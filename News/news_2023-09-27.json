One heavy shower was enough to force the final ODI to be abandoned at 3.21pm, just over half an hour after it started raining, after Bristol ground-staff appeared far too slow to cover the square, leaving the pitch soaked and areas around it saturated. And it followed similar scenes at Headingley last Wednesday when a wet area on one of the bowler’s run ups forced what should have been the first match between England and Ireland to be abandoned. The embarrassment for Gloucestershire was compounded because England, who take the ‘series’ 1-0, were on course to make history, racing along to 280 for four after 31 overs and in with a great chance of overtaking their highest one-day score of 498 against the Netherlands last year. And the frustration was made more acute for the 5,000 or so spectators who had braved the late September conditions by the cut-off point for refunds coming just one over before the players were taken off. Heavy rain forced England's final game of the summer to be abandoned on Tuesday The groundstaff tried to get the covers onto the pitch quickly, but strong winds made it difficult England had looked set to post a huge score after Ben Duckett hit his maiden ODI hundred At least those supporters were treated to a brief but brutal display of hitting by England’s second-string one-day side, Ben Duckett making his first 50-over century after Phil Salt and Will Jacks had got England off to a spectacular start. Both teams were then caught out by the speed of the abandonment, with England captain Zak Crawley saying: ‘It’s a shame it ended like that. The ground was wet this morning and it didn’t need a lot more rain for it to be abandoned. Then a lot more came in a short space of time. ‘It looked like the ground-staff were trying their best but it was difficult for them out there to get the covers on. I don’t think anything more could have been done. Ireland captain Paul Stirling was surprised at the speed of the handshakes between the sides, adding: ‘We’re maybe used to this more in Ireland because there’s a bit more rain there but we’ve never come across anything like that in England before where it was so sudden. We’re pretty disappointed.’ It was left to Gloucestershire chief executive Will Brown to defend a decision that was made with more than six hours of scheduled playing time remaining. ‘It’s just gutting,’ he said. ‘But you have to bear in mind the conditions if you’re trying to move covers. ‘If they’re wet and heavy already and it’s like monsoon weather it makes it a hell of a lot harder. The ground-staff did an admirable job in very difficult circumstances.’ The bottom line is that Bristol is a county ground staging an international and Gloucestershire’s facilities struggled to cope with the demands of the occasion. Sympathy comes with the late date for this game – and it will not get any easier. The next international at Bristol comes against Australia next year – on September 29.

Came and Reece put on 80 for the first wicket in sunny conditions but on a green pitch, occupying the majority of the morning session. They each got up and running with early boundaries off Timm van der Gugten before Reece dispatched Andy Gorvin’s first two deliveries to the fence. The 50 partnership came up in 16 overs, Reece with 33 of those runs, and the scoring rate began to quicken in the ensuing overs.

Reece swept a Kiran Carlson full toss to the rope to bring up the century partnership and the team’s 200 soon followed.

Sunil Gavaskar was to retire soon, Sachin Tendulkar hadn’t yet made his appearance in the Indian consciousness. Goa had become the 25th State of the Indian union. The population hadn’t touched a billion yet. Scandals over defence deals had been exposed in the media. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s ‘Mr Clean’ image was taking a beating. Writing in the Asian Journal , a think tank analyst said, “Indian democracy is on trial.” And World champions India hosted the first World Cup outside England. The first-ever World Cup match in India was played in Chennai 36 years ago. A year earlier at the same venue, Maninder Singh had been dismissed leg before to signal only the second tied Test. Now here he was again, last man, with India needing two to win. You couldn’t blame him if his only thought was Oh No Not Again! Steve Waugh knocked back his stumps to give Australia victory by one run. It was a dramatic start to the tournament and gave an early hint to the spirit of the Australian team which went on to win it and dominate world cricket for a few years. They had lost the home Ashes earlier, and five previous ODIs. Waugh, then 22, a bit of a bowler and a bit of a batsman, but one of the heroes of the Cup and later a world-beating batsman was to say the Australians were “rank outsiders.” In the Australian innings, Dean Jones had hit Maninder for a six which the neutral umpire signalled a four. At the break, the correction was made after the Australians spoke to the umpire. Sitting in the press box for my first World Cup match I thought it would be ironical if India lost by one run. Every run matters is an enduring cliché in the game. India had won the title four years earlier and were captained once again by Kapil Dev, one of the heroes of that tournament. He had sportingly conceded that Jones’ shot might have been a six although Ravi Shastri, the fielder near the boundary had said it was a four. It was too early for controversies. Australia were not taken seriously as opposition then (Zaheer Abbas said they were no better than a club side), and at any rate India had the firepower to get past their 270. They were 202 for two with some 15 overs to go, but managed to mess it up. Medium pacer Craig McDermott, after initial punishment, carved through the middle order finishing with four for 56. It ended with the late Dean Jones throwing the ball into the crowd — not in a gentle looping arc, but with the force of a cover point looking for a run out. Luckily it missed a lady spectator. Before the tournament began the hope was that India would beat Pakistan in the final at Eden Gardens in Kolkata and everybody would live happily ever after (in India, that is). Pakistan lost the semifinal to Australia in Lahore while England beat India in Mumbai, and fans discovered again what happens sometimes to the best-laid plans. The cricket board toyed with the idea of having a third-place match between India and Pakistan, but the players, understandably, weren’t interested and did what anyone would do under the circumstances. They demanded an exorbitant fee, and the idea was dropped. Bob Simpson, Australia’s coach had emphasised the importance of singles in one-day cricket, the importance of denying the bowler a dot ball. It is not something coaches today harp on because boundaries and sixes come more easily thanks to superior bats, fitter players, shorter boundaries, improved striking techniques and the influence of T20 cricket. Simpson also had a list of do’s and don’ts pasted onto kit bags, the most important being, To lose patience is to lose the battle. Modern coaches probably believe that too much patience can sometimes lose the battle. At the next World Cup, India lost to Australia in Brisbane, venue of the first tied Test, by one run. Again a left arm spinner — Venkatapathy Raju — was last out, run out. Again it was Waugh who caused the dismissal, picking up and throwing to the ’keeper. Raju was out of the crease by a yard, so in effect India lost by 23 yards.","pubDate":"2023-09-26 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1b1d023f54b66d4f2c2e90c4a32b0da9","title":"Cricket World Cup 2023 countdown | Amid the din and the drama, mercurial Pakistan hunts for a safe space","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cricket-world-cup-2023-countdown-pakistan-preview/article67349368.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In an ideal world, Pakistan’s bowling would be its trump card. But the injury to Naseem Shah has severely dented that advantage","content":"Luck and circumstance touch different people at different times in many different ways. In the lead-up to the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in India, Pakistan has got the short end of this stick. First, its very participation in the event came under a cloud. Once that shifted, there was the lack of clarity over the ‘safe’ venues for the team. Then came the disastrous performance at the preparatory Asia Cup where it finished last in the Super Four group. A tournament-ending shoulder injury to premier fast bowler Naseem Shah was the next body blow. The latest is the delay in procuring visas, which means the Babar Azam-led squad will arrive in India only on Wednesday evening, with under 48 hours left for the first warm-up match against New Zealand in Hyderabad. For Pakistan however, the lush green cricket field has often been a safe space. The side was ranked No.1 in ODIs — now No.2 – until last week. It finished a worthy runner-up to England in the last year’s Men’s T20 World Cup and won the Champions Trophy the last time it was held in 2017. These are the memories the former World champion would like to carry forward. In the Netherlands — notwithstanding the competitive three-match ODI series the two outfits played in August 2022 — Pakistan will get the soft start that’s helpful to ease into the tournament. The batting will be led by the likes of Babar, Mohammad Rizwan and Imam-ul-Haq. The form of Fakhar Zaman will however be a worry, for the southpaw hasn’t scored a half-century in his last 10 innings. In an ideal world, Pakistan’s bowling would be its trump card. But the injury to Naseem has severely dented that advantage. Hasan Ali, who last played an ODI in June 2022, has been named as Naseem’s replacement, a choice influenced by his experience of having played in big-ticket competitions. In focus will be the wicket-taking abilities of tweakers Shadab Khan — also the vice-captain — and Mohammad Nawaz. Expected to shoulder the responsibility in the crucial middle-overs, leggie Shadab had a forgettable Asia Cup, with just two wickets from the four outings against India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Left-arm spinner Nawaz has four scalps from his last eight ODIs. This perhaps explains the inclusion of leg-spinner Usama Mir, who was not part of the Asia Cup. But in the past, Pakistan has shown that mitigating factors do not always suffocate the side. The World Cup is another opportunity to prove that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The squad: Babar Azam (capt.), Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Abdullah Shafique, Mohammad Rizwan, Saud Shakeel, Iftikhar Ahmed, Agha Salman, Shadab Khan, Usama Mir, Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Wasim Jr. and Hasan Ali.","pubDate":"2023-09-26 18:55:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e67f41633928b2373025a673a93e830d","title":"New Zealand Whitewash Bangladesh To Wrap Cricket World Cup Preparation","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/new-zealand-whitewash-bangladesh-to-wrap-cricket-world-cup-2023-preparation-4426908","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand gave themselves a perfect boost ahead of the World Cup by whitewashingBangladeshin the three-match series 2-0.","content":"New Zealand gave themselves a perfect boost ahead of the World Cup by whitewashing Bangladesh in the three-match series 2-0, with a seven wickets win in the final one-day international in Dhaka on Tuesday. Will Young and Adam Milne starred with bat and ball respectively, with Young hitting 70 off 80 balls to guide New Zealand to 175-3. Milne's 4-34 restricted the hosts to 171 in 34.3 overs at Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Stand-in skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto scored highest with 76 runs for Bangladesh, but was unable to give the hosts a competitive score with a lack of support from the other end after he opted to bat first. New Zealand made light of their target despite losing Finn Allen (28) and Dean Foxcroft (0) to Shoriful Islam in consecutive balls, as Young put on 81 runs with in-form Henry Nicholls for the third wicket. By the time left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed bowled Young, New Zealand were well in control. Nicholls, who made 44 and 49 runs in the previous two matches, went on to complete 50 this time, with a single off Mahmudullah Riyad. Tom Blundell (23 not out) hit a boundary to take New Zealand home, with 91 balls to spare. Cole McConchie and Trent Boult earlier complemented Milne, who was playing his first match of the series, claiming 2-18 and 2-33 respectively to deny Bangladesh any serious momentum in the contest. The Kiwis, who lost the previous two series in Bangladesh 4-0 in 2010 and 3-0 in 2013, won the second match by 86 runs on Saturday. The first match was washed out by rain. \"The World Cup is just around the corner -- to come up with the first win since 2008 is great,\" said Young, the man of the match, in a briefing afterwards. \"This group plays a lot together, we gel well and it's a lot of fun,\" he added. Advertisement Young said that while he could not predict what conditions the Kiwis would face in India when the World Cup opens on October 5, he hoped \"it's similar to these\". Bangladesh initially rested key players but, with the series at stake, they brought back stalwarts Najmul, Mushfiqur Rahim and Shoriful Islam. However, it did little to improve their performance. Najmul, leading Bangladesh for the first time, held down one end to score his fifth ODI fifty but wickets kept falling regularly from the other end. \"Our batsmen didn't score big runs,\" Najmul said. \"Hopefully, next time batters take responsibility and bat long.\" Milne and Boult struck early to reduce Bangladesh to 35-3, before Najmul and Mushfiqur offered a brief resistance with a 53-run fourth wicket stand. Mushfiqur's dismissal to Lockie Ferguson for 18 put New Zealand back on top and the visitors did not lose the momentum again.

The 33-year-old tore the cruciate ligament in his right knee playing for Indian Premier League side Gujarat Titans in April, which looked to have scuppered his chances of making the showpiece tournament. However, intense rehab work has meant a speedy recovery. Williamson hopes to be ready for the Black Caps opening game against defending champions England on October 5, a repeat of the 2019 final his side narrowly lost. “It would be great. Naturally, you want to be back playing when you are fit and ready, sooner rather than later,” he said. “You hope that ends up being around that World Cup time, but I’m still being very focused on the rehab day-to-day and not wanting those targets to stretch it to a point where you take a backward step.” Williamson is already batting in the nets again, which the injured knee can handle. “For running, it’s not quite 100 percent, but making good progress,” he added. Black Caps coach Gary Stead said there was no fixed date for when Williamson will play again. But his return will be a big boost. He was player of the 2019 tournament with centuries against South Africa and the West Indies in leading New Zealand to the cusp of lifting the trophy. Williamson, who has chalked up over 6,500 runs in ODI cricket, is desperate to appear in a fourth World Cup, admitting the prospect “keeps you in the gym every day and working hard” .“It’s been really pleasing to see the progress and keep taking those little steps forward,” he added. While New Zealand have warmed-up for the World Cup with tours of England and Bangladesh, Williamson’s injury has limited his preparations. But he is not overly concerned. “Naturally, it isn’t ideal, but I didn’t get too much of a say in it. It’s the only option I have in front of me and the prospect of playing another World Cup is really, really exciting,” he said. “It’s something you always want to be a part of but I didn’t want that to dictate my rehab. At the same time, having a carrot at the back of your mind is helpful.” Despite a burning desire to play, the New Zealand skipper said he would have no problem withdrawing from the squad if the injury flared up. “I only want to be there if I can add some value and I’m fit and ready to go,” he said. Williamson already knows about spending time on the sidelines after returning last year from a lengthy spell out with an elbow injury. “Working through injuries are part of the job, so being ready for whatever’s next is the goal,” he said.","pubDate":"2023-09-26 18:05:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"abc73f29a8710178a1e5fd18d5ac1a83","title":"IND vs AUS Dream11 Team Prediction, 3rd ODI 2023: Tips and Suggestions To Pick Best Winning Fantasy Playing XI for India vs Australia Cricket Match in Rajkot","link":"https://www.latestly.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-dream11-team-prediction-3rd-odi-2023-tips-and-suggestions-to-pick-best-winning-fantasy-playing-xi-for-india-vs-australia-cricket-match-in-rajkot-5443268.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India's captain Rohit Sharma and batting stalwart Virat Kohli are back.

One heavy shower was enough to force the final ODI to be abandoned at 3.21pm, just over half an hour after it started raining, after Bristol ground-staff appeared far too slow to cover the square, leaving the pitch soaked and areas around it saturated. And it followed similar scenes at Headingley last Wednesday when a wet area on one of the bowler’s run ups forced what should have been the first match between England and Ireland to be abandoned. The embarrassment for Gloucestershire was compounded because England, who take the ‘series’ 1-0, were on course to make history, racing along to 280 for four after 31 overs and in with a great chance of overtaking their highest one-day score of 498 against the Netherlands last year. And the frustration was made more acute for the 5,000 or so spectators who had braved the late September conditions by the cut-off point for refunds coming just one over before the players were taken off. Heavy rain forced England's final game of the summer to be abandoned on Tuesday The groundstaff tried to get the covers onto the pitch quickly, but strong winds made it difficult England had looked set to post a huge score after Ben Duckett hit his maiden ODI hundred At least those supporters were treated to a brief but brutal display of hitting by England’s second-string one-day side, Ben Duckett making his first 50-over century after Phil Salt and Will Jacks had got England off to a spectacular start. Both teams were then caught out by the speed of the abandonment, with England captain Zak Crawley saying: ‘It’s a shame it ended like that. The ground was wet this morning and it didn’t need a lot more rain for it to be abandoned. Then a lot more came in a short space of time. ‘It looked like the ground-staff were trying their best but it was difficult for them out there to get the covers on. I don’t think anything more could have been done. Ireland captain Paul Stirling was surprised at the speed of the handshakes between the sides, adding: ‘We’re maybe used to this more in Ireland because there’s a bit more rain there but we’ve never come across anything like that in England before where it was so sudden. We’re pretty disappointed.’ It was left to Gloucestershire chief executive Will Brown to defend a decision that was made with more than six hours of scheduled playing time remaining. ‘It’s just gutting,’ he said. ‘But you have to bear in mind the conditions if you’re trying to move covers. ‘If they’re wet and heavy already and it’s like monsoon weather it makes it a hell of a lot harder. The ground-staff did an admirable job in very difficult circumstances.’ The bottom line is that Bristol is a county ground staging an international and Gloucestershire’s facilities struggled to cope with the demands of the occasion. Sympathy comes with the late date for this game – and it will not get any easier. The next international at Bristol comes against Australia next year – on September 29.

Sunil Gavaskar was to retire soon, Sachin Tendulkar hadn’t yet made his appearance in the Indian consciousness. Goa had become the 25th State of the Indian union. The population hadn’t touched a billion yet. Scandals over defence deals had been exposed in the media. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s ‘Mr Clean’ image was taking a beating. Writing in the Asian Journal , a think tank analyst said, “Indian democracy is on trial.” And World champions India hosted the first World Cup outside England. The first-ever World Cup match in India was played in Chennai 36 years ago. A year earlier at the same venue, Maninder Singh had been dismissed leg before to signal only the second tied Test. Now here he was again, last man, with India needing two to win. You couldn’t blame him if his only thought was Oh No Not Again! Steve Waugh knocked back his stumps to give Australia victory by one run. It was a dramatic start to the tournament and gave an early hint to the spirit of the Australian team which went on to win it and dominate world cricket for a few years. They had lost the home Ashes earlier, and five previous ODIs. Waugh, then 22, a bit of a bowler and a bit of a batsman, but one of the heroes of the Cup and later a world-beating batsman was to say the Australians were “rank outsiders.” In the Australian innings, Dean Jones had hit Maninder for a six which the neutral umpire signalled a four. At the break, the correction was made after the Australians spoke to the umpire. Sitting in the press box for my first World Cup match I thought it would be ironical if India lost by one run. Every run matters is an enduring cliché in the game. India had won the title four years earlier and were captained once again by Kapil Dev, one of the heroes of that tournament. He had sportingly conceded that Jones’ shot might have been a six although Ravi Shastri, the fielder near the boundary had said it was a four. It was too early for controversies. Australia were not taken seriously as opposition then (Zaheer Abbas said they were no better than a club side), and at any rate India had the firepower to get past their 270. They were 202 for two with some 15 overs to go, but managed to mess it up. Medium pacer Craig McDermott, after initial punishment, carved through the middle order finishing with four for 56. It ended with the late Dean Jones throwing the ball into the crowd — not in a gentle looping arc, but with the force of a cover point looking for a run out. Luckily it missed a lady spectator. Before the tournament began the hope was that India would beat Pakistan in the final at Eden Gardens in Kolkata and everybody would live happily ever after (in India, that is). Pakistan lost the semifinal to Australia in Lahore while England beat India in Mumbai, and fans discovered again what happens sometimes to the best-laid plans. The cricket board toyed with the idea of having a third-place match between India and Pakistan, but the players, understandably, weren’t interested and did what anyone would do under the circumstances. They demanded an exorbitant fee, and the idea was dropped. Bob Simpson, Australia’s coach had emphasised the importance of singles in one-day cricket, the importance of denying the bowler a dot ball. It is not something coaches today harp on because boundaries and sixes come more easily thanks to superior bats, fitter players, shorter boundaries, improved striking techniques and the influence of T20 cricket. Simpson also had a list of do’s and don’ts pasted onto kit bags, the most important being, To lose patience is to lose the battle. Modern coaches probably believe that too much patience can sometimes lose the battle. At the next World Cup, India lost to Australia in Brisbane, venue of the first tied Test, by one run. Again a left arm spinner — Venkatapathy Raju — was last out, run out. Again it was Waugh who caused the dismissal, picking up and throwing to the ’keeper. Raju was out of the crease by a yard, so in effect India lost by 23 yards.","pubDate":"2023-09-26 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1b1d023f54b66d4f2c2e90c4a32b0da9","title":"Cricket World Cup 2023 countdown | Amid the din and the drama, mercurial Pakistan hunts for a safe space","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cricket-world-cup-2023-countdown-pakistan-preview/article67349368.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In an ideal world, Pakistan’s bowling would be its trump card. But the injury to Naseem Shah has severely dented that advantage","content":"Luck and circumstance touch different people at different times in many different ways. In the lead-up to the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in India, Pakistan has got the short end of this stick. First, its very participation in the event came under a cloud. Once that shifted, there was the lack of clarity over the ‘safe’ venues for the team. Then came the disastrous performance at the preparatory Asia Cup where it finished last in the Super Four group. A tournament-ending shoulder injury to premier fast bowler Naseem Shah was the next body blow. The latest is the delay in procuring visas, which means the Babar Azam-led squad will arrive in India only on Wednesday evening, with under 48 hours left for the first warm-up match against New Zealand in Hyderabad. For Pakistan however, the lush green cricket field has often been a safe space. The side was ranked No.1 in ODIs — now No.2 – until last week. It finished a worthy runner-up to England in the last year’s Men’s T20 World Cup and won the Champions Trophy the last time it was held in 2017. These are the memories the former World champion would like to carry forward. In the Netherlands — notwithstanding the competitive three-match ODI series the two outfits played in August 2022 — Pakistan will get the soft start that’s helpful to ease into the tournament. The batting will be led by the likes of Babar, Mohammad Rizwan and Imam-ul-Haq. The form of Fakhar Zaman will however be a worry, for the southpaw hasn’t scored a half-century in his last 10 innings. In an ideal world, Pakistan’s bowling would be its trump card. But the injury to Naseem has severely dented that advantage. Hasan Ali, who last played an ODI in June 2022, has been named as Naseem’s replacement, a choice influenced by his experience of having played in big-ticket competitions. In focus will be the wicket-taking abilities of tweakers Shadab Khan — also the vice-captain — and Mohammad Nawaz. Expected to shoulder the responsibility in the crucial middle-overs, leggie Shadab had a forgettable Asia Cup, with just two wickets from the four outings against India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Left-arm spinner Nawaz has four scalps from his last eight ODIs. This perhaps explains the inclusion of leg-spinner Usama Mir, who was not part of the Asia Cup. But in the past, Pakistan has shown that mitigating factors do not always suffocate the side. The World Cup is another opportunity to prove that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The squad: Babar Azam (capt.), Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Abdullah Shafique, Mohammad Rizwan, Saud Shakeel, Iftikhar Ahmed, Agha Salman, Shadab Khan, Usama Mir, Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Wasim Jr. and Hasan Ali.","pubDate":"2023-09-26 18:55:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e67f41633928b2373025a673a93e830d","title":"New Zealand Whitewash Bangladesh To Wrap Cricket World Cup Preparation","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/new-zealand-whitewash-bangladesh-to-wrap-cricket-world-cup-2023-preparation-4426908","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand gave themselves a perfect boost ahead of the World Cup by whitewashingBangladeshin the three-match series 2-0.","content":"New Zealand gave themselves a perfect boost ahead of the World Cup by whitewashing Bangladesh in the three-match series 2-0, with a seven wickets win in the final one-day international in Dhaka on Tuesday. Will Young and Adam Milne starred with bat and ball respectively, with Young hitting 70 off 80 balls to guide New Zealand to 175-3. Milne's 4-34 restricted the hosts to 171 in 34.3 overs at Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Stand-in skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto scored highest with 76 runs for Bangladesh, but was unable to give the hosts a competitive score with a lack of support from the other end after he opted to bat first. New Zealand made light of their target despite losing Finn Allen (28) and Dean Foxcroft (0) to Shoriful Islam in consecutive balls, as Young put on 81 runs with in-form Henry Nicholls for the third wicket. By the time left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed bowled Young, New Zealand were well in control. Nicholls, who made 44 and 49 runs in the previous two matches, went on to complete 50 this time, with a single off Mahmudullah Riyad. Tom Blundell (23 not out) hit a boundary to take New Zealand home, with 91 balls to spare. Cole McConchie and Trent Boult earlier complemented Milne, who was playing his first match of the series, claiming 2-18 and 2-33 respectively to deny Bangladesh any serious momentum in the contest. The Kiwis, who lost the previous two series in Bangladesh 4-0 in 2010 and 3-0 in 2013, won the second match by 86 runs on Saturday. The first match was washed out by rain. \"The World Cup is just around the corner -- to come up with the first win since 2008 is great,\" said Young, the man of the match, in a briefing afterwards. \"This group plays a lot together, we gel well and it's a lot of fun,\" he added. Advertisement Young said that while he could not predict what conditions the Kiwis would face in India when the World Cup opens on October 5, he hoped \"it's similar to these\". Bangladesh initially rested key players but, with the series at stake, they brought back stalwarts Najmul, Mushfiqur Rahim and Shoriful Islam. However, it did little to improve their performance. Najmul, leading Bangladesh for the first time, held down one end to score his fifth ODI fifty but wickets kept falling regularly from the other end. \"Our batsmen didn't score big runs,\" Najmul said. \"Hopefully, next time batters take responsibility and bat long.\" Milne and Boult struck early to reduce Bangladesh to 35-3, before Najmul and Mushfiqur offered a brief resistance with a 53-run fourth wicket stand. Mushfiqur's dismissal to Lockie Ferguson for 18 put New Zealand back on top and the visitors did not lose the momentum again. McConchie ended any real chance of Bangladesh lodging a fighting score by dismissing Najmul with his second ball of the day, with the left-hander hitting 10 fours in his 84-ball innings.

The 33-year-old tore the cruciate ligament in his right knee playing for Indian Premier League side Gujarat Titans in April, which looked to have scuppered his chances of making the showpiece tournament. However, intense rehab work has meant a speedy recovery. Williamson hopes to be ready for the Black Caps opening game against defending champions England on October 5, a repeat of the 2019 final his side narrowly lost. “It would be great. Naturally, you want to be back playing when you are fit and ready, sooner rather than later,” he said. “You hope that ends up being around that World Cup time, but I’m still being very focused on the rehab day-to-day and not wanting those targets to stretch it to a point where you take a backward step.” Williamson is already batting in the nets again, which the injured knee can handle. “For running, it’s not quite 100 percent, but making good progress,” he added. Black Caps coach Gary Stead said there was no fixed date for when Williamson will play again. But his return will be a big boost. He was player of the 2019 tournament with centuries against South Africa and the West Indies in leading New Zealand to the cusp of lifting the trophy. Williamson, who has chalked up over 6,500 runs in ODI cricket, is desperate to appear in a fourth World Cup, admitting the prospect “keeps you in the gym every day and working hard” .“It’s been really pleasing to see the progress and keep taking those little steps forward,” he added. While New Zealand have warmed-up for the World Cup with tours of England and Bangladesh, Williamson’s injury has limited his preparations. But he is not overly concerned. “Naturally, it isn’t ideal, but I didn’t get too much of a say in it. It’s the only option I have in front of me and the prospect of playing another World Cup is really, really exciting,” he said. “It’s something you always want to be a part of but I didn’t want that to dictate my rehab. At the same time, having a carrot at the back of your mind is helpful.” Despite a burning desire to play, the New Zealand skipper said he would have no problem withdrawing from the squad if the injury flared up. “I only want to be there if I can add some value and I’m fit and ready to go,” he said. Williamson already knows about spending time on the sidelines after returning last year from a lengthy spell out with an elbow injury. “Working through injuries are part of the job, so being ready for whatever’s next is the goal,” he said.","pubDate":"2023-09-26 18:05:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"abc73f29a8710178a1e5fd18d5ac1a83","title":"IND vs AUS Dream11 Team Prediction, 3rd ODI 2023: Tips and Suggestions To Pick Best Winning Fantasy Playing XI for India vs Australia Cricket Match in Rajkot","link":"https://www.latestly.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-dream11-team-prediction-3rd-odi-2023-tips-and-suggestions-to-pick-best-winning-fantasy-playing-xi-for-india-vs-australia-cricket-match-in-rajkot-5443268.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India's captain Rohit Sharma and batting stalwart Virat Kohli are back.

One heavy shower was enough to force the final ODI to be abandoned at 3.21pm, just over half an hour after it started raining, after Bristol ground-staff appeared far too slow to cover the square, leaving the pitch soaked and areas around it saturated. And it followed similar scenes at Headingley last Wednesday when a wet area on one of the bowler’s run ups forced what should have been the first match between England and Ireland to be abandoned. The embarrassment for Gloucestershire was compounded because England, who take the ‘series’ 1-0, were on course to make history, racing along to 280 for four after 31 overs and in with a great chance of overtaking their highest one-day score of 498 against the Netherlands last year. And the frustration was made more acute for the 5,000 or so spectators who had braved the late September conditions by the cut-off point for refunds coming just one over before the players were taken off. Heavy rain forced England's final game of the summer to be abandoned on Tuesday The groundstaff tried to get the covers onto the pitch quickly, but strong winds made it difficult England had looked set to post a huge score after Ben Duckett hit his maiden ODI hundred At least those supporters were treated to a brief but brutal display of hitting by England’s second-string one-day side, Ben Duckett making his first 50-over century after Phil Salt and Will Jacks had got England off to a spectacular start. Both teams were then caught out by the speed of the abandonment, with England captain Zak Crawley saying: ‘It’s a shame it ended like that. The ground was wet this morning and it didn’t need a lot more rain for it to be abandoned. Then a lot more came in a short space of time. ‘It looked like the ground-staff were trying their best but it was difficult for them out there to get the covers on. I don’t think anything more could have been done. Ireland captain Paul Stirling was surprised at the speed of the handshakes between the sides, adding: ‘We’re maybe used to this more in Ireland because there’s a bit more rain there but we’ve never come across anything like that in England before where it was so sudden. We’re pretty disappointed.’ It was left to Gloucestershire chief executive Will Brown to defend a decision that was made with more than six hours of scheduled playing time remaining. ‘It’s just gutting,’ he said. ‘But you have to bear in mind the conditions if you’re trying to move covers. ‘If they’re wet and heavy already and it’s like monsoon weather it makes it a hell of a lot harder. The ground-staff did an admirable job in very difficult circumstances.’ The bottom line is that Bristol is a county ground staging an international and Gloucestershire’s facilities struggled to cope with the demands of the occasion. Sympathy comes with the late date for this game – and it will not get any easier. The next international at Bristol comes against Australia next year – on September 29.

Came and Reece put on 80 for the first wicket in sunny conditions but on a green pitch, occupying the majority of the morning session. They each got up and running with early boundaries off Timm van der Gugten before Reece dispatched Andy Gorvin’s first two deliveries to the fence. The 50 partnership came up in 16 overs, Reece with 33 of those runs, and the scoring rate began to quicken in the ensuing overs.

Reece swept a Kiran Carlson full toss to the rope to bring up the century partnership and the team’s 200 soon followed.

Sunil Gavaskar was to retire soon, Sachin Tendulkar hadn’t yet made his appearance in the Indian consciousness. Goa had become the 25th State of the Indian union. The population hadn’t touched a billion yet. Scandals over defence deals had been exposed in the media. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s ‘Mr Clean’ image was taking a beating. Writing in the Asian Journal , a think tank analyst said, “Indian democracy is on trial.” And World champions India hosted the first World Cup outside England. The first-ever World Cup match in India was played in Chennai 36 years ago. A year earlier at the same venue, Maninder Singh had been dismissed leg before to signal only the second tied Test. Now here he was again, last man, with India needing two to win. You couldn’t blame him if his only thought was Oh No Not Again! Steve Waugh knocked back his stumps to give Australia victory by one run. It was a dramatic start to the tournament and gave an early hint to the spirit of the Australian team which went on to win it and dominate world cricket for a few years. They had lost the home Ashes earlier, and five previous ODIs. Waugh, then 22, a bit of a bowler and a bit of a batsman, but one of the heroes of the Cup and later a world-beating batsman was to say the Australians were “rank outsiders.” In the Australian innings, Dean Jones had hit Maninder for a six which the neutral umpire signalled a four. At the break, the correction was made after the Australians spoke to the umpire. Sitting in the press box for my first World Cup match I thought it would be ironical if India lost by one run. Every run matters is an enduring cliché in the game. India had won the title four years earlier and were captained once again by Kapil Dev, one of the heroes of that tournament. He had sportingly conceded that Jones’ shot might have been a six although Ravi Shastri, the fielder near the boundary had said it was a four. It was too early for controversies. Australia were not taken seriously as opposition then (Zaheer Abbas said they were no better than a club side), and at any rate India had the firepower to get past their 270. They were 202 for two with some 15 overs to go, but managed to mess it up. Medium pacer Craig McDermott, after initial punishment, carved through the middle order finishing with four for 56. It ended with the late Dean Jones throwing the ball into the crowd — not in a gentle looping arc, but with the force of a cover point looking for a run out. Luckily it missed a lady spectator. Before the tournament began the hope was that India would beat Pakistan in the final at Eden Gardens in Kolkata and everybody would live happily ever after (in India, that is). Pakistan lost the semifinal to Australia in Lahore while England beat India in Mumbai, and fans discovered again what happens sometimes to the best-laid plans. The cricket board toyed with the idea of having a third-place match between India and Pakistan, but the players, understandably, weren’t interested and did what anyone would do under the circumstances. They demanded an exorbitant fee, and the idea was dropped. Bob Simpson, Australia’s coach had emphasised the importance of singles in one-day cricket, the importance of denying the bowler a dot ball. It is not something coaches today harp on because boundaries and sixes come more easily thanks to superior bats, fitter players, shorter boundaries, improved striking techniques and the influence of T20 cricket. Simpson also had a list of do’s and don’ts pasted onto kit bags, the most important being, To lose patience is to lose the battle. Modern coaches probably believe that too much patience can sometimes lose the battle. At the next World Cup, India lost to Australia in Brisbane, venue of the first tied Test, by one run. Again a left arm spinner — Venkatapathy Raju — was last out, run out. Again it was Waugh who caused the dismissal, picking up and throwing to the ’keeper. Raju was out of the crease by a yard, so in effect India lost by 23 yards.","pubDate":"2023-09-26 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1b1d023f54b66d4f2c2e90c4a32b0da9","title":"Cricket World Cup 2023 countdown | Amid the din and the drama, mercurial Pakistan hunts for a safe space","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cricket-world-cup-2023-countdown-pakistan-preview/article67349368.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In an ideal world, Pakistan’s bowling would be its trump card. But the injury to Naseem Shah has severely dented that advantage","content":"Luck and circumstance touch different people at different times in many different ways. In the lead-up to the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in India, Pakistan has got the short end of this stick. First, its very participation in the event came under a cloud. Once that shifted, there was the lack of clarity over the ‘safe’ venues for the team. Then came the disastrous performance at the preparatory Asia Cup where it finished last in the Super Four group. A tournament-ending shoulder injury to premier fast bowler Naseem Shah was the next body blow. The latest is the delay in procuring visas, which means the Babar Azam-led squad will arrive in India only on Wednesday evening, with under 48 hours left for the first warm-up match against New Zealand in Hyderabad. For Pakistan however, the lush green cricket field has often been a safe space. The side was ranked No.1 in ODIs — now No.2 – until last week. It finished a worthy runner-up to England in the last year’s Men’s T20 World Cup and won the Champions Trophy the last time it was held in 2017. These are the memories the former World champion would like to carry forward. In the Netherlands — notwithstanding the competitive three-match ODI series the two outfits played in August 2022 — Pakistan will get the soft start that’s helpful to ease into the tournament. The batting will be led by the likes of Babar, Mohammad Rizwan and Imam-ul-Haq. The form of Fakhar Zaman will however be a worry, for the southpaw hasn’t scored a half-century in his last 10 innings. In an ideal world, Pakistan’s bowling would be its trump card. But the injury to Naseem has severely dented that advantage. Hasan Ali, who last played an ODI in June 2022, has been named as Naseem’s replacement, a choice influenced by his experience of having played in big-ticket competitions. In focus will be the wicket-taking abilities of tweakers Shadab Khan — also the vice-captain — and Mohammad Nawaz. Expected to shoulder the responsibility in the crucial middle-overs, leggie Shadab had a forgettable Asia Cup, with just two wickets from the four outings against India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Left-arm spinner Nawaz has four scalps from his last eight ODIs. This perhaps explains the inclusion of leg-spinner Usama Mir, who was not part of the Asia Cup. But in the past, Pakistan has shown that mitigating factors do not always suffocate the side. The World Cup is another opportunity to prove that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The squad: Babar Azam (capt.), Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Abdullah Shafique, Mohammad Rizwan, Saud Shakeel, Iftikhar Ahmed, Agha Salman, Shadab Khan, Usama Mir, Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Wasim Jr. and Hasan Ali.","pubDate":"2023-09-26 18:55:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e67f41633928b2373025a673a93e830d","title":"New Zealand Whitewash Bangladesh To Wrap Cricket World Cup Preparation","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/new-zealand-whitewash-bangladesh-to-wrap-cricket-world-cup-2023-preparation-4426908","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand gave themselves a perfect boost ahead of the World Cup by whitewashingBangladeshin the three-match series 2-0.","content":"New Zealand gave themselves a perfect boost ahead of the World Cup by whitewashing Bangladesh in the three-match series 2-0, with a seven wickets win in the final one-day international in Dhaka on Tuesday. Will Young and Adam Milne starred with bat and ball respectively, with Young hitting 70 off 80 balls to guide New Zealand to 175-3. Milne's 4-34 restricted the hosts to 171 in 34.3 overs at Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Stand-in skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto scored highest with 76 runs for Bangladesh, but was unable to give the hosts a competitive score with a lack of support from the other end after he opted to bat first. New Zealand made light of their target despite losing Finn Allen (28) and Dean Foxcroft (0) to Shoriful Islam in consecutive balls, as Young put on 81 runs with in-form Henry Nicholls for the third wicket. By the time left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed bowled Young, New Zealand were well in control. Nicholls, who made 44 and 49 runs in the previous two matches, went on to complete 50 this time, with a single off Mahmudullah Riyad. Tom Blundell (23 not out) hit a boundary to take New Zealand home, with 91 balls to spare. Cole McConchie and Trent Boult earlier complemented Milne, who was playing his first match of the series, claiming 2-18 and 2-33 respectively to deny Bangladesh any serious momentum in the contest. The Kiwis, who lost the previous two series in Bangladesh 4-0 in 2010 and 3-0 in 2013, won the second match by 86 runs on Saturday. The first match was washed out by rain. \"The World Cup is just around the corner -- to come up with the first win since 2008 is great,\" said Young, the man of the match, in a briefing afterwards. \"This group plays a lot together, we gel well and it's a lot of fun,\" he added. Advertisement Young said that while he could not predict what conditions the Kiwis would face in India when the World Cup opens on October 5, he hoped \"it's similar to these\". Bangladesh initially rested key players but, with the series at stake, they brought back stalwarts Najmul, Mushfiqur Rahim and Shoriful Islam. However, it did little to improve their performance. Najmul, leading Bangladesh for the first time, held down one end to score his fifth ODI fifty but wickets kept falling regularly from the other end. \"Our batsmen didn't score big runs,\" Najmul said. \"Hopefully, next time batters take responsibility and bat long.\" Milne and Boult struck early to reduce Bangladesh to 35-3, before Najmul and Mushfiqur offered a brief resistance with a 53-run fourth wicket stand. Mushfiqur's dismissal to Lockie Ferguson for 18 put New Zealand back on top and the visitors did not lose the momentum again.

The 33-year-old tore the cruciate ligament in his right knee playing for Indian Premier League side Gujarat Titans in April, which looked to have scuppered his chances of making the showpiece tournament. However, intense rehab work has meant a speedy recovery. Williamson hopes to be ready for the Black Caps opening game against defending champions England on October 5, a repeat of the 2019 final his side narrowly lost. “It would be great. Naturally, you want to be back playing when you are fit and ready, sooner rather than later,” he said. “You hope that ends up being around that World Cup time, but I’m still being very focused on the rehab day-to-day and not wanting those targets to stretch it to a point where you take a backward step.” Williamson is already batting in the nets again, which the injured knee can handle. “For running, it’s not quite 100 percent, but making good progress,” he added. Black Caps coach Gary Stead said there was no fixed date for when Williamson will play again. But his return will be a big boost. He was player of the 2019 tournament with centuries against South Africa and the West Indies in leading New Zealand to the cusp of lifting the trophy. Williamson, who has chalked up over 6,500 runs in ODI cricket, is desperate to appear in a fourth World Cup, admitting the prospect “keeps you in the gym every day and working hard” .“It’s been really pleasing to see the progress and keep taking those little steps forward,” he added. While New Zealand have warmed-up for the World Cup with tours of England and Bangladesh, Williamson’s injury has limited his preparations. But he is not overly concerned. “Naturally, it isn’t ideal, but I didn’t get too much of a say in it. It’s the only option I have in front of me and the prospect of playing another World Cup is really, really exciting,” he said. “It’s something you always want to be a part of but I didn’t want that to dictate my rehab. At the same time, having a carrot at the back of your mind is helpful.” Despite a burning desire to play, the New Zealand skipper said he would have no problem withdrawing from the squad if the injury flared up. “I only want to be there if I can add some value and I’m fit and ready to go,” he said. Williamson already knows about spending time on the sidelines after returning last year from a lengthy spell out with an elbow injury. “Working through injuries are part of the job, so being ready for whatever’s next is the goal,” he said.","pubDate":"2023-09-26 18:05:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
