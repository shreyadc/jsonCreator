It could prompt Adam O‚ÄôBrien to rest the centre, although the Knights coach sounds confident both he and fellow Origin teammate Jacob Saifiti will back up. ‚ÄúBradman is in a bit of a purple patch at the moment with five tries in two weeks of footy,‚Äù O‚ÄôBrien said on Thursday, suggesting the pair will be cleared to play. ‚ÄúThey tell me that it‚Äôs easier to back up from Origin after two days as opposed to four days.

Nick Hockley and Mike Baird, the Cricket Australia chief executive and chair, have been discussing the concept with their opposite numbers at the BCCI and the ECB in recent weeks, including meetings around the Lord‚Äôs Ashes Test and the World Test Championship final at the Oval . Jess Jonassen (centre) celebrates with her Australian teammates after catching Sophia Dunkley in the T20 match at Lord‚Äôs. Credit: Getty Images A CA spokesperson confirmed discussions were ongoing but declined to comment further when contacted by this masthead. More talks took place this week around the ICC‚Äôs annual conference in South Africa, where member nations have approved a proposal to hand the BCCI as much as 38 per cent of revenue from the recent $US3 billion ($4.35 billion) sale of the rights to global events. This is nearly double the 22 per cent India were allotted under the previous distribution deal, signed off in 2017. Among other determinations, T20 franchise leagues were given greater regulation including a minimum threshold of seven local players per team. Baird, who became the new chair of CA earlier this year , is set to join the ICC‚Äôs powerful finance and commercial affairs committee, placing him head to head with the BCCI‚Äôs influential secretary Jay Shah on the big questions of cricket economics. The WPL‚Äôs spectacle, featuring big crowds and large TV audiences after the BCCI sold rights to the event to Viacom18 for $US116.5 million ($169 million) over five years, has been a significant driver for the Champions League idea. It would be a far more significant development for the game than the announcement of equal prize money for men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs World Cups at the end of the Durban meeting. Unlike tennis or golf, the lifeblood of a cricketer‚Äôs career is contracts and match payments, which would rise considerably should the Champions League become a success. Introduction of the league, with broadcast rights revenue to be shared among the countries involved, would mimic the attempt to start a men‚Äôs T20 Champions League when the IPL was launched in 2008. That tournament, sold for nearly $US1 billion ($1.45 billion) to Star Sports, was abandoned after six editions as it failed to generate enough spectator interest to justify the high price tag. Its revenue was shared between India, Australia and South Africa, after England‚Äôs board dropped out of discussions. This time around, the concept of a women‚Äôs Champions League is seen as the logical next step to capitalise on the strength of the WPL, the WBBL and the Hundred competition in England. There is no suggestion that CA, the BCCI and the ECB are considering the relaunch of a men‚Äôs Champions League. Big crowds and high-quality cricket have been a hallmark of each of the last two women‚Äôs T20 World Cups also, in 2020 in Australia shortly before the outbreak of COVID-19, and then in South Africa earlier this year, where Australia again prevailed in a tight tussle against the hosts. It is possible that the tournament will also include teams from other leagues such as the Caribbean Premier League, but there is a desire to start the event in a focused manner and grow from there. Locations would be rotated, with match revenue from tickets and corporate hospitality to be retained by the host nation. Australia‚Äôs captain Alyssa Healy has spoken about the need for the women‚Äôs game to be supported by wider investment down development pathways in more nations. Meg Lanning‚Äôs dismissal for 35 was a big moment in the WPL final this year. Credit: Getty Images ‚ÄúI think it takes support and investment from the global bodies to invest in their women‚Äôs teams and their women‚Äôs pathways in particular,‚Äù Healy said earlier on the current Ashes tour. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no secret to why this team has been successful for a long period of time, it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve got great domestic pathways. ‚ÄúThey were invested in a long time ago and it‚Äôs developed some amazing players. The likes of Annabel Sutherland and Phoebe Litchfield can almost come straight into international cricket and perform right away. That really helps, and I think a lot of nations are catching up, they‚Äôre doing some great things.‚Äù The Marylebone Cricket Club‚Äôs world cricket committee reached a similar conclusion at their recent meeting ahead of the Lord‚Äôs Ashes Test. ‚ÄúThe growth of the women‚Äôs game must also be consistent with the growth of the game as a whole,‚Äù chair Mike Gatting said. ‚ÄúWe need to ensure that nations are rewarded for their commitment to investing in both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs game alike, and a ring-fenced fund could be an important step here. ‚ÄúWe have seen similar reports previously, which haven‚Äôt led to actions or tangible improvements. The WCC firmly believes that if we are to protect the game of cricket as a whole, immediate action must be taken to bring about significant transformation in the sport.‚Äù Watch every ball of the 2023 Ashes series live and exclusive on Channel 9 and 9Now.

Jaiswal carried his bat through the day to be 143 not out on debut. He and Rohit moved their opening partnership from 80 overnight to 229. But after a middle-session pick up, India crawled to stumps on 2-312. Virat Kohli (36 not out) was with Jaiswal. West Indies middle-order bat Alick Athanaze earned his maiden Test wicket when he got Rohit and broke the massive opening stand. Athanaze's 13 overs of off-spin compensated for the absence of Rahkeem Cornwall, who bowled his third maiden over before walking off in the morning session due to a chest infection. Jaiswal and Rohit were restricted to 66 runs in 32 overs in the first session, but that was enough to post India's first 100-run opening partnership in 11 Tests. After lunch, Jaiswal and Rohit showed more intent without really getting their timing right. They passed West Indies' total of 150 about six overs quicker, marking the first time India took a first-innings lead in a Test without losing a wicket. After the stand reached 200, Jaiswal became the 17th Indian man to score a Test century on debut, matching Rohit, who was the 14th in 2013. From the 215th ball he faced, Jaiswal paddle-swept a single to fine leg off Athanaze and celebrated exuberantly, raising his arms and leaping to punch the air. Soon after, the batters owned the highest opening partnership outside Asia when they eclipsed the 213 by Sunil Gavaskar and Chetan Chauhan in 1979 against England at the Oval. This was only India's third ever double-century opening stand outside Asia. Rohit finally posted his 10th Test hundred with a cover drive to the boundary, then was out next ball when he gloved Athanaze off his thigh to wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva. Rohit made 103 off 221 balls with 10 boundaries and two sixes. Shubman Gill requested to drop in the order from opener to No.3 and made only six when he was caught by Athanaze at short second slip off spinner Jomel Warrican. India added 99 runs in the middle session and only 67 runs in 32 overs after tea. West Indies used up their third and last review trying to get Kohli out on nine but he didn't touch the ball. Without a review, West Indies rued what might have been when pacer Kemar Roach hit Jaiswal on his back pad on 133. West Indies appealed for leg before without success and ball tracking showed the ball would have hit leg stump. Kohli, content to help Jaiswal grind things out, took 81 balls to hit his first boundary and punched the air. By stumps, he'd used up 96 balls to make 36. He played second fiddle to Jaiswal, who had the highest score by an Indian man on debut outside Asia, and counting.","pubDate":"2023-07-13 22:05:50","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11274047/300c022dedf0b76f8771ed4ad4482c5c98b391c3-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zimbabwe cricket growth charms Andy Flower","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimbabwe-cricket-growth-charms-andy-flower/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["peter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brandon Moyo, Brandonmalvin9@gmail.com CRICKET in Zimbabwe has been on a positive trajectory over the past couple of years and has seen a rise in followership with fans filling stadia whenever the national team plays.

The steady growth of the sport in the country has charmed many from even outside the borders.

One man who liked what he saw during the recently ended 2023 Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup Qualifiers which were held in Zimbabwe is one of the country‚Äôs finest cricketers ever and an International Cricket Council (ICC) Hall of Famer, Andy Flower. Returning to Zimbabwe as part of the commentary team for the Qualifiers for the first time in over two decades, Flower was pleased with the growth of the sport in the country as a lot of work and effort has been put in to make sure that the game stays on top where it belongs. In an interview with ICC, Flower said he was pleased with what he saw at the country‚Äôs two biggest cricket stadiums, Queens Sports Club and Harare Sports Club having watched matches in Bulawayo and Harare where fans and the atmosphere was out of this world. He also noted a change in followership of the sport in the country as it has now become more popular to the black majority who have been showing appreciation for the sport unlike during their days as players. ‚ÄúBefore I arrived in Zimbabwe, I would have had a lukewarm response to a question about the future of Zimbabwean cricket. Now that I‚Äôm just about to leave, I feel much more positive. They (fans) threw love out towards everyone in the ground, even the little bit of barracking with the opposition was done in good spirit, and that I think I‚Äôll remember for years. ‚ÄúThe energy in the crowd. The love for the game, the feeling of support and love for the players while they were playing and while the crowd was singing and dancing and loving their day, but also taking note of every single ball. It was really interesting for me to see the change in the demographic in the crowd. When we were playing, it was mostly a White crowd, and the change that I have seen after being away for so long is such a great change for Zimbabwe,‚Äù he said. Over the past year, Zimbabwe has been playing positive cricket under the stewardship of Dave Houghton. Some of the Chevrons‚Äô notable victories include a final ball one run win over Pakistan in the T20 World Cup and also their first ODI victory over Australia Down Under, winning by three wickets after a Ryan Burl masterclass with the ball. The Chevrons also managed to reach the Super 12 stage of the T20 World Cup for the first time. Most recently, Zimbabwe beat the West Indies in their group match of the World Cup Qualifiers at Harare Sports Club. The positivity, courage and the mentality that the team now has is something that also caught Flower‚Äôs attention. Zimbabwe has enjoyed a good run in international cricket. ‚ÄúOne thing that stands out for me is the confidence with which Zimbabwe are playing their cricket, and I think partly that comes from exposure to international matches, to international tournaments and series. I see a certainly strong spirit in them. They have some experienced players, they‚Äôve got a few youngsters and it‚Äôll be an interesting transition when they move on from some of their experienced players in the next few years. But I do see a fighting spirit. You see that in the way that they field,‚Äù said Flower He remains the only Zimbabwean to have made it to the ICC Hall of Fame and is considered one of the finest wicket-keeper batters of all time across the globe. In 63 Test matches, Flower scored 4 794 runs with a high score of 232 runs not out at a staggering average of 51,54 while in one day cricket, the 55-year-old scored 6 786 runs from 213 games with a high score of 145 runs and an average of 35,34. He has 16 international tons. ‚Äì @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-07-13 22:01:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Why fast bowling is cricket's most primeval act: It does not just spill blood, it gets it pumping","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12297173/Why-fast-bowling-crickets-primeval-act-does-not-just-spill-blood-gets-pumping.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Fast bowling has always been cricket's most primeval act, a skill that comes from the heart not the brain and takes practitioners to places beyond logic.","content":"Why fast bowling is cricket's most primeval act: It does not just spill blood, it gets it pumping... that's why there will be a guttural roar when England's Mark Wood charges in to bowl at 97mph at Old Trafford next week Crowd gasped after Mark Wood‚Äôs fastest ball at Leeds ‚Äî 96.5mph ‚Äî was relayed Shoaib Akhtar holds record for a delivery clocked at 100.2mph against England Dennis Lillee rejoiced in terrorising batsmen with a bouncer at the rib-cage By Lawrence Booth for the Daily Mail Updated: 22:57, 13 July 2023 e-mail View comments On the day he sparked Australia ‚Äôs dramatic first innings collapse in the third Test, Mark Wood was asked what it was like to see his speed flashed up on Headingley‚Äôs big screen. He answered in two syllables: ‚ÄòWoo hoo!‚Äô Frankly, what more was there to be said? Fast bowling has always been cricket‚Äôs most primeval act, a skill that comes from the heart not the brain and takes practitioners to places beyond logic. Frank Tyson, the England quick who terrorised Australia in 1954-55, spoke of the ‚Äòglad animal action‚Äô of bowling fast. On the other side of the Ashes divide, Dennis Lillee rejoiced in the ‚Äòsheer ‚ÄúI can fly‚Äù exhilaration‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs seeing that look of apprehension on your quarry‚Äôs face‚Äô. The language is bestial, of hunter and hunted. When Wood‚Äôs fastest ball at Leeds ‚Äî 96.5mph ‚Äî was relayed to the crowd, they gasped at the brutishness it conveyed. And, for Wood, it was confirmation that everything was in working order. Woo hoo indeed. Not that he came close to the world record. That is held by Pakistan‚Äôs Shoaib Akhtar, who in a World Cup game against England at Cape Town in 2003 was clocked at 100.2mph and was known as the Rawalpindi Express. Strange, then, that the delivery ‚Äî in the words of Wisden ‚Äî was ‚Äòcomfortably repulsed‚Äô by Nick Knight. Fast bowler Mark Wood sparked Australia‚Äôs dramatic first innings collapse in the third Test Australia's Dennis Lillee rejoiced in terrorising batsmen with a bouncer at the rib-cage Since Shoaib, only two others have passed the mythical 100mph, both in one-day internationals for Australia ‚Äî Brett Lee, in 2005 against New Zealand at Napier, and Shaun Tait, in 2010 against England at Lord‚Äôs. Wood says he can bowl faster than at Headingley and with good reason ‚Äî last winter against Pakistan at Multan, he flew in at 97.3mph. One thing is certain. In a series already overflowing with subplots, all eyes will be on the speed gun when the Ashes resumes in Manchester next week. Central to the drama surrounding fast bowling is the threat of physical danger, as if cricket becomes something the Romans might have bayed for in the Colosseum. Jeff Thomson, the slingy Australian who was once said to have clocked 99.8mph at Perth‚Äôs WACA, was unapologetic about the edge this threat gave him. After putting an opponent in hospital for a week with a blow to the eye in a grade match, he admitted it was ‚Äòfrightening to see this bloke just screaming and shaking and the pitch splattered with blood as it poured through his fingers‚Äô. Ominously, though, he added: ‚ÄòI never let this sort of thing put me off.‚Äô He was especially undeterred against England, whom he destroyed during the 1974-75 Ashes with the help of Lillee. ‚ÄòI thought, ‚ÄúStuff that stiff-upper-lip crap‚Äù,‚Äô said Thomson. ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs see how stiff it is when it‚Äôs split.‚Äô Lillee was just as unflinching. ‚ÄòI try to hit a batsman in the rib-cage when I bowl a purposeful bouncer,‚Äô he once said. ‚ÄòI want it to hurt, so the batsman doesn‚Äôt want to face me any more.‚Äô The English players from that series, which Australia won 4-1, speak of shellshock, as if the balls were bullets and the crease a trench. David ‚ÄòBumble‚Äô Lloyd‚Äôs after-dinner story about having his inadequate box snapped open and, painfully, shut by Thomson has given that tour more humour than it deserves. Above all, there is little time for manoeuvre against fast bowling. While a 90mph delivery might slow to about 80mph before pitching, then to 72mph after it hits the turf, that still leaves the batsman just 0.4 seconds to react. Yet a study in Western Australia once suggested you need 0.3 of a second to make any sense of where the ball may land and another 0.3 of a second to execute your stroke. In other words, pre-meditation is the only option. As John Snow, the England fast bowler who helped Ray Illingworth‚Äôs side win the Ashes in Australia in 1970-71, put it: ‚ÄòSpeed defeats reactions.‚Äô You could see it in the way Australia‚Äôs lower order flinched at Wood, hoping to connect or simply survive. Only when Travis Head had his eye in on the third evening was Wood treated with anything other than apprehension. Fast bowling does not just spill blood, it gets it pumping like nothing else in cricket and like few activities in any sport. Perhaps the most famous over ever bowled was by Michael Holding to Geoffrey Boycott at Bridgetown, Barbados, in 1981, which ended with Boycott bowled for a duck. After he fell to Holding again in the second innings for a single, he was asked by a curious, and brave, waiter at the team hotel: ‚ÄòDid you see any of them?‚Äô Australian paceman Jeff Thomson was unapologetic about the edge this threat gave him Boycott, owner of arguably the tightest defence in the game‚Äôs history, replied: ‚ÄòI saw them all. I just couldn‚Äôt play any of them.‚Äô Others chose not to play any of them. On a brute of a pitch in Jamaica in 1976, Bishan Bedi declared India‚Äôs first innings on 306 for six to spare his lower order the ordeal of facing Holding, Wayne Daniel and Co. In the second innings, India got to 97 for two, but no further. Three wickets fell for none, while the remaining five batsmen were ‚Äòabsent hurt‚Äô. It was sobering to think West Indies had not yet embarked on their reign of terror, in which the psychological and physical grip exerted by their four-man attacks ensured they did not lose a Test series between 1980 and 1995. See off Holding and Andy Roberts and you had to contend with Joel Garner and Colin Croft. After them came Malcolm Marshall, Patrick Patterson, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh. There have been few more thrilling spells in England than the one sent down by Jofra Archer to Steve Smith in the 2019 Ashes Test at Lord‚Äôs. Hit on the head, Smith was ruled out of the next game due to concussion. The legend of Archer‚Äôs spell meant Smith recently pointed out on Twitter that Archer had not, in fact, taken his wicket. Only the toughest mentally survive the assault. Graham Gooch, one of the greatest players of pace, once said: ‚ÄòIf I went out to start an innings thinking about being hit, I could not play the game. My entire technique would collapse.‚Äô His England team-mate Robin Smith, another superb player of fast bowling, went for hypnosis after he had his jaw broken by West Indies‚Äô Ian Bishop at Old Trafford in 1995. The hypnotist was Derren Brown and his techniques did the trick. Smith never feared fast bowling again and later explained his tactics to the Guardian: ‚ÄòYou draw an imaginary line down the pitch, somewhere near the middle, and whenever the ball hits that line, you hit the f****** deck.‚Äô Not all fast bowlers have been comfortable inflicting pain. England‚Äôs Peter Lever could never forget hitting New Zealand No 11 Ewen Chatfield on the left temple at Auckland in 1975, years before protective headwear. Chatfield collapsed to the ground and swallowed his tongue. For a few seconds his heart stopped beating and it needed quick work by England physio Bernie Thomas to save his life. ‚ÄòI honestly thought I had killed him,‚Äô said Lever. ‚ÄòI felt sick and ashamed. All I could think when I got back to the pavilion was I wanted to retire.‚Äô Len Pascoe, a rugged Australian quick, had similar thoughts after hitting India‚Äôs Sandeep Patil in the face in 1981. Until then, he had traded off fear, but the incident led to introspection. ‚ÄòThe game‚Äôs not worth dying over,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòI was worried about what I was becoming. It wasn‚Äôt me.‚Äô After the death of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes following a blow to his vertebral artery on the side of his neck in a Sheffield Shield game in 2014, research was done into the number of deaths caused by cricket. According to Peter Brukner, then Australia team doctor, and historian Tom Gara, there were 544 cricket-related deaths in Australia, Britain and New Zealand dating back to 1850, with most caused by a blow to the heart or head. Since their research covered only three countries, the true number is likely to be much higher. Batsmen these days, of course, have more protection thanks to the introduction of helmets in the late 1970s, though this also means they are less likely to sway out of the way of bouncers, paradoxically increasing the chances of being hit. Are fast bowlers getting faster? Fred Trueman of Yorkshire and England, who once described himself as ‚Äòthe greatest bloody fast bowler that ever drew breath‚Äô, would be appalled at the thought that he was not in the same category as Wood, even if footage suggests he was not. Yet fast bowling may be one area of human endeavour where progress is not plotted on a smooth curve. Harold Larwood, England‚Äôs Bodyline hero of 1932-33, was said to have touched 96mph, though the evidence for this is sketchy. Shoaib‚Äôs record, meanwhile, has remained intact for 20 years. Since fast bowling is about more than the speed of the approach, it is easy to see why bowlers are not simply getting quicker. Also important are a long final stride, a braced front leg and the speed of the arm. As Shoaib found, a hyperextending elbow can help, too. There is no one-size-fits-all, no identikit method of making a fast bowler. It can be a mysterious process, dependent on temperament and defying reason. It connects with fans at an elemental level and makes batsmen question their life choices. It is why, when the Ashes resume, there will be a guttural roar as Wood charges in to deliver his first ball.

And now Rohit Sharma brings up his century ‚Äî his 10th in Tests ‚Äî shortly after Yashasvi Jaiswal brings up the milestone, driving a full toss from Athanaze through the covers. Reaches the milestone in 220 deliveries, collecting 10 fours and two maximums along the way. This is only his second ton away from home after his 127 against England at The Oval. IND 229/1 after 75.3 23:23 (IST) IND vs WI LIVE Cricket Score CENTURY ON TEST DEBUT FOR YASHASVI JAISWAL! What a start to the southpaw's international career! Brings up the milestone with a single off Alick Athanaze, taking 215 deliveries to bring up the milestone. Jaiswal thus becomes the 17th Indian batter to score a century on Test debut. IND 205/0 23:19 (IST) IND vs WI LIVE Cricket Score Yashasvi Jaiswal brings up 200 of the opening partnership with skipper Rohit Sharma with a single off Kemar Roach right after the drinks interval. The single also takes him to 99! IND 200/0; lead by 50 22:37 (IST) West Indies vs India LIVE Score After 61 overs,India 167/0 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 78 , Rohit Sharma (C) 73) FOUR! Full and wide from Holder, and Jaiswal comfortably drives this behind point, joining Rohit in the 70s and bringing up India's highest opening partnership in the West Indies ! Jaiswal collects another boundary later in the 61st over, this time slashing a shorter delivery outside off but targetting the same region to move to 78. 22:34 (IST) West Indies vs India LIVE Score After 58 overs,India 151/0 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 67 , Rohit Sharma (C) 68) Jaiswal looks to attack Warrican in the 58th over, dancing down the track in the first delivery only to push it for a dot and getting an inside edge while attempting a drive in the next delivery, coming back for a second to bring up the 150 for the visitors. He then collects a single to put India in the lead . 21:35 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 55 overs,India 146/0 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 62 , Rohit Sharma (C) 68) LUNCH ON DAY 2 : Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal continue to stand strong, both bringing up their half-centuries and stretching their partnership past the century mark as India head to the lunch interval on 146 for no loss , trailing by just four with all 10 wickets in hand. Rohit and Jaiswal have certainly been a lot more cautious in the morning session, scoring at less than three-an-over. Windies skipper Brathwaite decides to give debutant Alick Athanaze the final over of the session, and the part-time off-spinner concedes a couple of singles. 20:42 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score FIFTY! India skipper Rohit Sharma gets to his 15th half-century in Test cricket! It's been a calm and composed knock from the Mumbai cricketer, and more importantly, he has been leading his team from the front here. IND 118/0 20:18 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score FOUR! Pulled away in front of square by Jaiswal off Alzarri Joseph, and that brings up a half-century on international debut for the southpaw from Mumbai! Jaiswal took his time to get off the mark yesterday, but has looked a completely different batter once settled. Also brings up the century opening stand with Rohit Sharma. IND 103/0 Day 1 report: India will look to consolidate their position in the first Test against West Indies in Dominica, when they take field on Thursday for Day 2. The visitors were clinical in their approach on Wednesday after being asked to field first, with Ravichandran Ashwin, returning to the side, finishing with figures of 5/60 to see Windies off for 150. He was well-supported by fellow spin-bowling all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who collected three wickets for 26 runs. This was Ashwin‚Äôs 33rd five-fer in Test cricket, as well as his fifth against Windies since he made his Test debut against this very side in 2011. Barring debutant Alick Athanaze (47), none of the West Indian batters were able to convert starts into big knocks. Local boy Athanaze narrowly missed out on a half-century on Test debut, getting dismissed by Ashwin shortly before tea on the opening day. And in their first innings reply, India were 80/0 after 23 overs at stumps, with debutant Yashasvi Jaiswal (40*) and his skipper Rohit Sharma (30*) at the other end.

Nick Hockley and Mike Baird, the Cricket Australia chief executive and chair, have been discussing the concept with their opposite numbers at the BCCI and the ECB in recent weeks, including meetings around the Lord‚Äôs Ashes Test and the World Test Championship final at the Oval . Jess Jonassen (centre) celebrates with her Australian teammates after catching Sophia Dunkley in the T20 match at Lord‚Äôs. Credit: Getty Images A CA spokesperson confirmed discussions were ongoing but declined to comment further when contacted by this masthead. More talks took place this week around the ICC‚Äôs annual conference in South Africa, where member nations have approved a proposal to hand the BCCI as much as 38 per cent of revenue from the recent $US3 billion ($4.35 billion) sale of the rights to global events. This is nearly double the 22 per cent India were allotted under the previous distribution deal, signed off in 2017. Among other determinations, T20 franchise leagues were given greater regulation including a minimum threshold of seven local players per team. Baird, who became the new chair of CA earlier this year , is set to join the ICC‚Äôs powerful finance and commercial affairs committee, placing him head to head with the BCCI‚Äôs influential secretary Jay Shah on the big questions of cricket economics. The WPL‚Äôs spectacle, featuring big crowds and large TV audiences after the BCCI sold rights to the event to Viacom18 for $US116.5 million ($169 million) over five years, has been a significant driver for the Champions League idea. It would be a far more significant development for the game than the announcement of equal prize money for men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs World Cups at the end of the Durban meeting. Unlike tennis or golf, the lifeblood of a cricketer‚Äôs career is contracts and match payments, which would rise considerably should the Champions League become a success. Introduction of the league, with broadcast rights revenue to be shared among the countries involved, would mimic the attempt to start a men‚Äôs T20 Champions League when the IPL was launched in 2008. That tournament, sold for nearly $US1 billion ($1.45 billion) to Star Sports, was abandoned after six editions as it failed to generate enough spectator interest to justify the high price tag. Its revenue was shared between India, Australia and South Africa, after England‚Äôs board dropped out of discussions. This time around, the concept of a women‚Äôs Champions League is seen as the logical next step to capitalise on the strength of the WPL, the WBBL and the Hundred competition in England. There is no suggestion that CA, the BCCI and the ECB are considering the relaunch of a men‚Äôs Champions League. Big crowds and high-quality cricket have been a hallmark of each of the last two women‚Äôs T20 World Cups also, in 2020 in Australia shortly before the outbreak of COVID-19, and then in South Africa earlier this year, where Australia again prevailed in a tight tussle against the hosts. It is possible that the tournament will also include teams from other leagues such as the Caribbean Premier League, but there is a desire to start the event in a focused manner and grow from there. Locations would be rotated, with match revenue from tickets and corporate hospitality to be retained by the host nation. Australia‚Äôs captain Alyssa Healy has spoken about the need for the women‚Äôs game to be supported by wider investment down development pathways in more nations. Meg Lanning‚Äôs dismissal for 35 was a big moment in the WPL final this year. Credit: Getty Images ‚ÄúI think it takes support and investment from the global bodies to invest in their women‚Äôs teams and their women‚Äôs pathways in particular,‚Äù Healy said earlier on the current Ashes tour. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no secret to why this team has been successful for a long period of time, it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve got great domestic pathways. ‚ÄúThey were invested in a long time ago and it‚Äôs developed some amazing players. The likes of Annabel Sutherland and Phoebe Litchfield can almost come straight into international cricket and perform right away. That really helps, and I think a lot of nations are catching up, they‚Äôre doing some great things.‚Äù The Marylebone Cricket Club‚Äôs world cricket committee reached a similar conclusion at their recent meeting ahead of the Lord‚Äôs Ashes Test. ‚ÄúThe growth of the women‚Äôs game must also be consistent with the growth of the game as a whole,‚Äù chair Mike Gatting said. ‚ÄúWe need to ensure that nations are rewarded for their commitment to investing in both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs game alike, and a ring-fenced fund could be an important step here. ‚ÄúWe have seen similar reports previously, which haven‚Äôt led to actions or tangible improvements. The WCC firmly believes that if we are to protect the game of cricket as a whole, immediate action must be taken to bring about significant transformation in the sport.‚Äù Watch every ball of the 2023 Ashes series live and exclusive on Channel 9 and 9Now.

Jaiswal carried his bat through the day to be 143 not out on debut. He and Rohit moved their opening partnership from 80 overnight to 229. But after a middle-session pick up, India crawled to stumps on 2-312. Virat Kohli (36 not out) was with Jaiswal. West Indies middle-order bat Alick Athanaze earned his maiden Test wicket when he got Rohit and broke the massive opening stand. Athanaze's 13 overs of off-spin compensated for the absence of Rahkeem Cornwall, who bowled his third maiden over before walking off in the morning session due to a chest infection. Jaiswal and Rohit were restricted to 66 runs in 32 overs in the first session, but that was enough to post India's first 100-run opening partnership in 11 Tests. After lunch, Jaiswal and Rohit showed more intent without really getting their timing right. They passed West Indies' total of 150 about six overs quicker, marking the first time India took a first-innings lead in a Test without losing a wicket. After the stand reached 200, Jaiswal became the 17th Indian man to score a Test century on debut, matching Rohit, who was the 14th in 2013. From the 215th ball he faced, Jaiswal paddle-swept a single to fine leg off Athanaze and celebrated exuberantly, raising his arms and leaping to punch the air. Soon after, the batters owned the highest opening partnership outside Asia when they eclipsed the 213 by Sunil Gavaskar and Chetan Chauhan in 1979 against England at the Oval. This was only India's third ever double-century opening stand outside Asia. Rohit finally posted his 10th Test hundred with a cover drive to the boundary, then was out next ball when he gloved Athanaze off his thigh to wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva. Rohit made 103 off 221 balls with 10 boundaries and two sixes. Shubman Gill requested to drop in the order from opener to No.3 and made only six when he was caught by Athanaze at short second slip off spinner Jomel Warrican. India added 99 runs in the middle session and only 67 runs in 32 overs after tea. West Indies used up their third and last review trying to get Kohli out on nine but he didn't touch the ball. Without a review, West Indies rued what might have been when pacer Kemar Roach hit Jaiswal on his back pad on 133. West Indies appealed for leg before without success and ball tracking showed the ball would have hit leg stump. Kohli, content to help Jaiswal grind things out, took 81 balls to hit his first boundary and punched the air. By stumps, he'd used up 96 balls to make 36. He played second fiddle to Jaiswal, who had the highest score by an Indian man on debut outside Asia, and counting.","pubDate":"2023-07-13 22:05:50","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11274047/300c022dedf0b76f8771ed4ad4482c5c98b391c3-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zimbabwe cricket growth charms Andy Flower","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimbabwe-cricket-growth-charms-andy-flower/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["peter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brandon Moyo, Brandonmalvin9@gmail.com CRICKET in Zimbabwe has been on a positive trajectory over the past couple of years and has seen a rise in followership with fans filling stadia whenever the national team plays.

The passion and love [‚Ä¶]","content":"The Chronicle CRICKET in Zimbabwe has been on a positive trajectory over the past couple of years and has seen a rise in followership with fans filling stadia whenever the national team plays. The steady growth of the sport in the country has charmed many from even outside the borders. The passion and love that has been seen over the past years is testimony that the game is gaining popularity. One man who liked what he saw during the recently ended 2023 Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup Qualifiers which were held in Zimbabwe is one of the country‚Äôs finest cricketers ever and an International Cricket Council (ICC) Hall of Famer, Andy Flower. Returning to Zimbabwe as part of the commentary team for the Qualifiers for the first time in over two decades, Flower was pleased with the growth of the sport in the country as a lot of work and effort has been put in to make sure that the game stays on top where it belongs. In an interview with ICC, Flower said he was pleased with what he saw at the country‚Äôs two biggest cricket stadiums, Queens Sports Club and Harare Sports Club having watched matches in Bulawayo and Harare where fans and the atmosphere was out of this world. He also noted a change in followership of the sport in the country as it has now become more popular to the black majority who have been showing appreciation for the sport unlike during their days as players. ‚ÄúBefore I arrived in Zimbabwe, I would have had a lukewarm response to a question about the future of Zimbabwean cricket. Now that I‚Äôm just about to leave, I feel much more positive. They (fans) threw love out towards everyone in the ground, even the little bit of barracking with the opposition was done in good spirit, and that I think I‚Äôll remember for years. ‚ÄúThe energy in the crowd. The love for the game, the feeling of support and love for the players while they were playing and while the crowd was singing and dancing and loving their day, but also taking note of every single ball. It was really interesting for me to see the change in the demographic in the crowd. When we were playing, it was mostly a White crowd, and the change that I have seen after being away for so long is such a great change for Zimbabwe,‚Äù he said. Over the past year, Zimbabwe has been playing positive cricket under the stewardship of Dave Houghton. Some of the Chevrons‚Äô notable victories include a final ball one run win over Pakistan in the T20 World Cup and also their first ODI victory over Australia Down Under, winning by three wickets after a Ryan Burl masterclass with the ball. The Chevrons also managed to reach the Super 12 stage of the T20 World Cup for the first time. Most recently, Zimbabwe beat the West Indies in their group match of the World Cup Qualifiers at Harare Sports Club. The positivity, courage and the mentality that the team now has is something that also caught Flower‚Äôs attention. Zimbabwe has enjoyed a good run in international cricket. ‚ÄúOne thing that stands out for me is the confidence with which Zimbabwe are playing their cricket, and I think partly that comes from exposure to international matches, to international tournaments and series. I see a certainly strong spirit in them. They have some experienced players, they‚Äôve got a few youngsters and it‚Äôll be an interesting transition when they move on from some of their experienced players in the next few years. But I do see a fighting spirit. You see that in the way that they field,‚Äù said Flower He remains the only Zimbabwean to have made it to the ICC Hall of Fame and is considered one of the finest wicket-keeper batters of all time across the globe. In 63 Test matches, Flower scored 4 794 runs with a high score of 232 runs not out at a staggering average of 51,54 while in one day cricket, the 55-year-old scored 6 786 runs from 213 games with a high score of 145 runs and an average of 35,34. He has 16 international tons. ‚Äì @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-07-13 22:01:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Why fast bowling is cricket's most primeval act: It does not just spill blood, it gets it pumping","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12297173/Why-fast-bowling-crickets-primeval-act-does-not-just-spill-blood-gets-pumping.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Fast bowling has always been cricket's most primeval act, a skill that comes from the heart not the brain and takes practitioners to places beyond logic.","content":"Why fast bowling is cricket's most primeval act: It does not just spill blood, it gets it pumping... that's why there will be a guttural roar when England's Mark Wood charges in to bowl at 97mph at Old Trafford next week Crowd gasped after Mark Wood‚Äôs fastest ball at Leeds ‚Äî 96.5mph ‚Äî was relayed Shoaib Akhtar holds record for a delivery clocked at 100.2mph against England Dennis Lillee rejoiced in terrorising batsmen with a bouncer at the rib-cage By Lawrence Booth for the Daily Mail Updated: 22:57, 13 July 2023 e-mail View comments On the day he sparked Australia ‚Äôs dramatic first innings collapse in the third Test, Mark Wood was asked what it was like to see his speed flashed up on Headingley‚Äôs big screen. He answered in two syllables: ‚ÄòWoo hoo!‚Äô Frankly, what more was there to be said? Fast bowling has always been cricket‚Äôs most primeval act, a skill that comes from the heart not the brain and takes practitioners to places beyond logic. Frank Tyson, the England quick who terrorised Australia in 1954-55, spoke of the ‚Äòglad animal action‚Äô of bowling fast. On the other side of the Ashes divide, Dennis Lillee rejoiced in the ‚Äòsheer ‚ÄúI can fly‚Äù exhilaration‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs seeing that look of apprehension on your quarry‚Äôs face‚Äô. The language is bestial, of hunter and hunted. When Wood‚Äôs fastest ball at Leeds ‚Äî 96.5mph ‚Äî was relayed to the crowd, they gasped at the brutishness it conveyed. And, for Wood, it was confirmation that everything was in working order. Woo hoo indeed. Not that he came close to the world record. That is held by Pakistan‚Äôs Shoaib Akhtar, who in a World Cup game against England at Cape Town in 2003 was clocked at 100.2mph and was known as the Rawalpindi Express. Strange, then, that the delivery ‚Äî in the words of Wisden ‚Äî was ‚Äòcomfortably repulsed‚Äô by Nick Knight. Fast bowler Mark Wood sparked Australia‚Äôs dramatic first innings collapse in the third Test Australia's Dennis Lillee rejoiced in terrorising batsmen with a bouncer at the rib-cage Since Shoaib, only two others have passed the mythical 100mph, both in one-day internationals for Australia ‚Äî Brett Lee, in 2005 against New Zealand at Napier, and Shaun Tait, in 2010 against England at Lord‚Äôs. Wood says he can bowl faster than at Headingley and with good reason ‚Äî last winter against Pakistan at Multan, he flew in at 97.3mph. One thing is certain. In a series already overflowing with subplots, all eyes will be on the speed gun when the Ashes resumes in Manchester next week. Central to the drama surrounding fast bowling is the threat of physical danger, as if cricket becomes something the Romans might have bayed for in the Colosseum. Jeff Thomson, the slingy Australian who was once said to have clocked 99.8mph at Perth‚Äôs WACA, was unapologetic about the edge this threat gave him. After putting an opponent in hospital for a week with a blow to the eye in a grade match, he admitted it was ‚Äòfrightening to see this bloke just screaming and shaking and the pitch splattered with blood as it poured through his fingers‚Äô. Ominously, though, he added: ‚ÄòI never let this sort of thing put me off.‚Äô He was especially undeterred against England, whom he destroyed during the 1974-75 Ashes with the help of Lillee. ‚ÄòI thought, ‚ÄúStuff that stiff-upper-lip crap‚Äù,‚Äô said Thomson. ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs see how stiff it is when it‚Äôs split.‚Äô Lillee was just as unflinching. ‚ÄòI try to hit a batsman in the rib-cage when I bowl a purposeful bouncer,‚Äô he once said. ‚ÄòI want it to hurt, so the batsman doesn‚Äôt want to face me any more.‚Äô The English players from that series, which Australia won 4-1, speak of shellshock, as if the balls were bullets and the crease a trench. David ‚ÄòBumble‚Äô Lloyd‚Äôs after-dinner story about having his inadequate box snapped open and, painfully, shut by Thomson has given that tour more humour than it deserves. Above all, there is little time for manoeuvre against fast bowling. While a 90mph delivery might slow to about 80mph before pitching, then to 72mph after it hits the turf, that still leaves the batsman just 0.4 seconds to react. Yet a study in Western Australia once suggested you need 0.3 of a second to make any sense of where the ball may land and another 0.3 of a second to execute your stroke. In other words, pre-meditation is the only option. As John Snow, the England fast bowler who helped Ray Illingworth‚Äôs side win the Ashes in Australia in 1970-71, put it: ‚ÄòSpeed defeats reactions.‚Äô You could see it in the way Australia‚Äôs lower order flinched at Wood, hoping to connect or simply survive. Only when Travis Head had his eye in on the third evening was Wood treated with anything other than apprehension. Fast bowling does not just spill blood, it gets it pumping like nothing else in cricket and like few activities in any sport. Perhaps the most famous over ever bowled was by Michael Holding to Geoffrey Boycott at Bridgetown, Barbados, in 1981, which ended with Boycott bowled for a duck. After he fell to Holding again in the second innings for a single, he was asked by a curious, and brave, waiter at the team hotel: ‚ÄòDid you see any of them?‚Äô Australian paceman Jeff Thomson was unapologetic about the edge this threat gave him Boycott, owner of arguably the tightest defence in the game‚Äôs history, replied: ‚ÄòI saw them all. I just couldn‚Äôt play any of them.‚Äô Others chose not to play any of them. On a brute of a pitch in Jamaica in 1976, Bishan Bedi declared India‚Äôs first innings on 306 for six to spare his lower order the ordeal of facing Holding, Wayne Daniel and Co. In the second innings, India got to 97 for two, but no further. Three wickets fell for none, while the remaining five batsmen were ‚Äòabsent hurt‚Äô. It was sobering to think West Indies had not yet embarked on their reign of terror, in which the psychological and physical grip exerted by their four-man attacks ensured they did not lose a Test series between 1980 and 1995. See off Holding and Andy Roberts and you had to contend with Joel Garner and Colin Croft. After them came Malcolm Marshall, Patrick Patterson, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh. There have been few more thrilling spells in England than the one sent down by Jofra Archer to Steve Smith in the 2019 Ashes Test at Lord‚Äôs. Hit on the head, Smith was ruled out of the next game due to concussion. The legend of Archer‚Äôs spell meant Smith recently pointed out on Twitter that Archer had not, in fact, taken his wicket. Only the toughest mentally survive the assault. Graham Gooch, one of the greatest players of pace, once said: ‚ÄòIf I went out to start an innings thinking about being hit, I could not play the game. My entire technique would collapse.‚Äô His England team-mate Robin Smith, another superb player of fast bowling, went for hypnosis after he had his jaw broken by West Indies‚Äô Ian Bishop at Old Trafford in 1995. The hypnotist was Derren Brown and his techniques did the trick. Smith never feared fast bowling again and later explained his tactics to the Guardian: ‚ÄòYou draw an imaginary line down the pitch, somewhere near the middle, and whenever the ball hits that line, you hit the f****** deck.‚Äô Not all fast bowlers have been comfortable inflicting pain. England‚Äôs Peter Lever could never forget hitting New Zealand No 11 Ewen Chatfield on the left temple at Auckland in 1975, years before protective headwear. Chatfield collapsed to the ground and swallowed his tongue. For a few seconds his heart stopped beating and it needed quick work by England physio Bernie Thomas to save his life. ‚ÄòI honestly thought I had killed him,‚Äô said Lever. ‚ÄòI felt sick and ashamed. All I could think when I got back to the pavilion was I wanted to retire.‚Äô Len Pascoe, a rugged Australian quick, had similar thoughts after hitting India‚Äôs Sandeep Patil in the face in 1981. Until then, he had traded off fear, but the incident led to introspection. ‚ÄòThe game‚Äôs not worth dying over,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòI was worried about what I was becoming. It wasn‚Äôt me.‚Äô After the death of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes following a blow to his vertebral artery on the side of his neck in a Sheffield Shield game in 2014, research was done into the number of deaths caused by cricket. According to Peter Brukner, then Australia team doctor, and historian Tom Gara, there were 544 cricket-related deaths in Australia, Britain and New Zealand dating back to 1850, with most caused by a blow to the heart or head. Since their research covered only three countries, the true number is likely to be much higher. Batsmen these days, of course, have more protection thanks to the introduction of helmets in the late 1970s, though this also means they are less likely to sway out of the way of bouncers, paradoxically increasing the chances of being hit. Are fast bowlers getting faster? Fred Trueman of Yorkshire and England, who once described himself as ‚Äòthe greatest bloody fast bowler that ever drew breath‚Äô, would be appalled at the thought that he was not in the same category as Wood, even if footage suggests he was not. Yet fast bowling may be one area of human endeavour where progress is not plotted on a smooth curve. Harold Larwood, England‚Äôs Bodyline hero of 1932-33, was said to have touched 96mph, though the evidence for this is sketchy. Shoaib‚Äôs record, meanwhile, has remained intact for 20 years. Since fast bowling is about more than the speed of the approach, it is easy to see why bowlers are not simply getting quicker. Also important are a long final stride, a braced front leg and the speed of the arm. As Shoaib found, a hyperextending elbow can help, too. There is no one-size-fits-all, no identikit method of making a fast bowler. It can be a mysterious process, dependent on temperament and defying reason. It connects with fans at an elemental level and makes batsmen question their life choices. It is why, when the Ashes resume, there will be a guttural roar as Wood charges in to deliver his first ball.

Barring a couple of hiccups shortly before the tea interval in which Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill fell to spin in quick succession, the day well and truly belonged to the Indians, who did not lose a single wicket in two out of three seasons and are well placed to stretch their lead beyond the Windies' reach on the third day and go 1-0 up in the two-match series. Jaiswal, meanwhile, will be heading back to the team hotel dreaming about the possibility of becoming the first Indian batter to score a double-hundred on Test debut.

Drives the flighted delivery from Jomel Warrican outside off through the extra cover region for an easy boundary. The boundary also brings up the 300 for India . Full Scorecard 02:26 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 108 overs,India 298/2 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 140 , Virat Kohli 25) West Indies keeper Joshua Da Silva cops a painful blow while collecting the ball in Roach's 16th over. Apparently the ball had hit him on a taped-up finger and leads to the home team physio walking out to have a look. Meanwhile, Alzarri Joseph has left the field and he is replaced by left-arm seamer Raymond Reifer, who has bowled a solitary over so far today. Two singles off Reifer's over, the second of which takes Virat Kohli past Virender Sehwag's Test run-tally of 8,503 runs for India . Full Scorecard 02:14 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 106 overs,India 296/2 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 139 , Virat Kohli 24) Kohli collects a brace after steering the ball wide of the slip cordon off Roach's bowling at the start of the 105th over.

Umpire Richard Kettleborough shakes his head, and Windies unfortunately are out of reviews! HawkEye shows three reds in favour of the bowling side , with Impact bang at the centre of the middle stump and the ball going on to hit middle and leg. Roach buries his head in disappointment, knowing he fully deserved the wicket. It's just been his day so far. Jaiswal sets off for a risky single in the next ball and manages to reach the non-striker's end despite a direct hit from mid off. Jaiswal, meanwhile, adds another feather to his cap, going past Mohammad Azharuddin's record for most deliveries faced by an Indian on Test debut. Azharuddin had faced 322 deliveries on debut against England at Kolkata's Eden Gardens in 1984. Full Scorecard 01:54 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 102 overs,India 286/2 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 133 , Virat Kohli 20) West Indies finally have decided to take the second new ball after the 100th over, with skipper Brathwaite opting to hand the brand new Dukes cherry to Kemar Roach and Alzarri Joseph. Roach appeals for an LBW against Kohli in the first delivery with the second new ball, with the umpire shaking his head and the ball appearing to slide down leg. Full Scorecard 01:47 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 100 overs,India 282/2 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 132 , Virat Kohli 18) Jermaine Blackwood, who bowls off-spin part time, comes in as the ninth bowling option for the West Indies in this innings. Concedes a single off his first delivery with Kohli working the ball through the midwicket region. Turns out to be a case of change from both ends with Kemar Roach steaming in from the other end. Kohli welcomes him into his new spell with a drive through the extra cover region that fetches him a brace. Jaiswal collects a brace off Blackwood in the following over with a brace off a cut in front of square. 100 overs up in the Indian innings. The visitors continue to collect runs at a steady pace, their scoring rate remaining below three throughout today. Full Scorecard Load More Highlights 02:45 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 113 overs,India 312/2 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 143 , Virat Kohli 36) STUMPS ON DAY 2: Yashasvi Jaiswal remains unbeaten on 143 in 350 deliveries, stitching a patient third-wicket partnership with Virat Kohli worth 72 as India end the day 162 runs ahead of the West Indies with eight wickets in hand! Barring a couple of hiccups shortly before the tea interval in which Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill fell to spin in quick succession, the day well and truly belonged to the Indians, who did not lose a single wicket in two out of three seasons and are well placed to stretch their lead beyond the Windies' reach on the third day and go 1-0 up in the two-match series. Jaiswal, meanwhile, will be heading back to the team hotel dreaming about the possibility of becoming the first Indian batter to score a double-hundred on Test debut. 02:28 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 109 overs,India 302/2 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 140 , Virat Kohli 29) FOUR! Virat Kohli punches the air in delight after collecting his first boundary after facing 81 deliveries! Drives the flighted delivery from Jomel Warrican outside off through the extra cover region for an easy boundary. The boundary also brings up the 300 for India . 02:26 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 108 overs,India 298/2 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 140 , Virat Kohli 25) West Indies keeper Joshua Da Silva cops a painful blow while collecting the ball in Roach's 16th over. Apparently the ball had hit him on a taped-up finger and leads to the home team physio walking out to have a look. Meanwhile, Alzarri Joseph has left the field and he is replaced by left-arm seamer Raymond Reifer, who has bowled a solitary over so far today. Two singles off Reifer's over, the second of which takes Virat Kohli past Virender Sehwag's Test run-tally of 8,503 runs for India . 02:08 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 104 overs,India 290/2 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 135 , Virat Kohli 22) Jaiswal and Kohli collect a single each in Joseph's 13th over, and that brings up the fifty partnership for the third wicket . The pair have consumed 150 balls in the stand so far. 02:07 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 103 overs,India 288/2 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 134 , Virat Kohli 21) Lucky escape for Yashasvi Jaiswal after a confident shout for LBW by Kemar Roach and the West Indians! Umpire Richard Kettleborough shakes his head, and Windies unfortunately are out of reviews! HawkEye shows three reds in favour of the bowling side , with Impact bang at the centre of the middle stump and the ball going on to hit middle and leg. Roach buries his head in disappointment, knowing he fully deserved the wicket. It's just been his day so far. Jaiswal sets off for a risky single in the next ball and manages to reach the non-striker's end despite a direct hit from mid off. Jaiswal, meanwhile, adds another feather to his cap, going past Mohammad Azharuddin's record for most deliveries faced by an Indian on Test debut. Azharuddin had faced 322 deliveries on debut against England at Kolkata's Eden Gardens in 1984. 00:19 (IST) IND vs WI LIVE Cricket Score After 81 overs,India 245/2 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 116 , Virat Kohli 4) TEA ON DAY 2: West Indies claw back with the wickets of Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill, both of whom fall to spin towards the end of the second session, though India still are well ahead of the hosts with a lead worth 95 and a well set Yashasvi Jaiswal at the crease. The second new ball is now available, but Windies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite is yet to take it. They might at the start of the evening session. Meanwhile, the Windsor Park surface is starting to really assist the spinners, and while the Indian batters might face a challenge from the likes of Jomel Warrican and Alick Athanaze, the development might just get Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja a lot more excited. 00:06 (IST) IND vs WI LIVE Cricket Score OUT! Athanaze is part of another dismissal, this time taking a regulation catch at gully after Gill gets a nick off Warrican's bowling while attemping a defensive push. Not the best of starts for him at the No 3 position as he departs for 6. IND 240/2 Gill c Athanaze b Warrican 6(11) 00:02 (IST) IND vs WI LIVE Cricket Score OUT! Rohit departs right after bringing up his century as Alick Athanaze gets his maiden Test wicket on debut! Brathwaite goes for the review after the appeal for a catch by the keeper is turned down, and UltraEdge shows the ball brushing Rohit's glove before taking a deflection off his pad and landing between Da Silva's gloves. West Indies finally break the mammoth opening stand shortly before tea on the second day. Shubman Gill, batting at No 3 for the first time, makes his way to the centre. IND 229/1 in 76 Rohit c Da Silva b Athanaze 103(221) 23:53 (IST) IND vs WI LIVE Cricket Score FOUR! And now Rohit Sharma brings up his century ‚Äî his 10th in Tests ‚Äî shortly after Yashasvi Jaiswal brings up the milestone, driving a full toss from Athanaze through the covers. Reaches the milestone in 220 deliveries, collecting 10 fours and two maximums along the way. This is only his second ton away from home after his 127 against England at The Oval. IND 229/1 after 75.3 23:23 (IST) IND vs WI LIVE Cricket Score CENTURY ON TEST DEBUT FOR YASHASVI JAISWAL! What a start to the southpaw's international career! Brings up the milestone with a single off Alick Athanaze, taking 215 deliveries to bring up the milestone. Jaiswal thus becomes the 17th Indian batter to score a century on Test debut. IND 205/0 23:19 (IST) IND vs WI LIVE Cricket Score Yashasvi Jaiswal brings up 200 of the opening partnership with skipper Rohit Sharma with a single off Kemar Roach right after the drinks interval. The single also takes him to 99! IND 200/0; lead by 50 22:37 (IST) West Indies vs India LIVE Score After 61 overs,India 167/0 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 78 , Rohit Sharma (C) 73) FOUR! Full and wide from Holder, and Jaiswal comfortably drives this behind point, joining Rohit in the 70s and bringing up India's highest opening partnership in the West Indies ! Jaiswal collects another boundary later in the 61st over, this time slashing a shorter delivery outside off but targetting the same region to move to 78. 22:34 (IST) West Indies vs India LIVE Score After 58 overs,India 151/0 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 67 , Rohit Sharma (C) 68) Jaiswal looks to attack Warrican in the 58th over, dancing down the track in the first delivery only to push it for a dot and getting an inside edge while attempting a drive in the next delivery, coming back for a second to bring up the 150 for the visitors. He then collects a single to put India in the lead . 21:35 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 55 overs,India 146/0 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 62 , Rohit Sharma (C) 68) LUNCH ON DAY 2 : Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal continue to stand strong, both bringing up their half-centuries and stretching their partnership past the century mark as India head to the lunch interval on 146 for no loss , trailing by just four with all 10 wickets in hand. Rohit and Jaiswal have certainly been a lot more cautious in the morning session, scoring at less than three-an-over. Windies skipper Brathwaite decides to give debutant Alick Athanaze the final over of the session, and the part-time off-spinner concedes a couple of singles. 20:42 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score FIFTY! India skipper Rohit Sharma gets to his 15th half-century in Test cricket! It's been a calm and composed knock from the Mumbai cricketer, and more importantly, he has been leading his team from the front here. IND 118/0 20:18 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score FOUR! Pulled away in front of square by Jaiswal off Alzarri Joseph, and that brings up a half-century on international debut for the southpaw from Mumbai! Jaiswal took his time to get off the mark yesterday, but has looked a completely different batter once settled. Also brings up the century opening stand with Rohit Sharma. IND 103/0 Day 1 report: India will look to consolidate their position in the first Test against West Indies in Dominica, when they take field on Thursday for Day 2. The visitors were clinical in their approach on Wednesday after being asked to field first, with Ravichandran Ashwin, returning to the side, finishing with figures of 5/60 to see Windies off for 150. He was well-supported by fellow spin-bowling all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who collected three wickets for 26 runs. This was Ashwin‚Äôs 33rd five-fer in Test cricket, as well as his fifth against Windies since he made his Test debut against this very side in 2011. Barring debutant Alick Athanaze (47), none of the West Indian batters were able to convert starts into big knocks. Local boy Athanaze narrowly missed out on a half-century on Test debut, getting dismissed by Ashwin shortly before tea on the opening day. And in their first innings reply, India were 80/0 after 23 overs at stumps, with debutant Yashasvi Jaiswal (40*) and his skipper Rohit Sharma (30*) at the other end.

Nick Hockley and Mike Baird, the Cricket Australia chief executive and chair, have been discussing the concept with their opposite numbers at the BCCI and the ECB in recent weeks, including meetings around the Lord‚Äôs Ashes Test and the World Test Championship final at the Oval . Jess Jonassen (centre) celebrates with her Australian teammates after catching Sophia Dunkley in the T20 match at Lord‚Äôs. Credit: Getty Images A CA spokesperson confirmed discussions were ongoing but declined to comment further when contacted by this masthead. More talks took place this week around the ICC‚Äôs annual conference in South Africa, where member nations have approved a proposal to hand the BCCI as much as 38 per cent of revenue from the recent $US3 billion ($4.35 billion) sale of the rights to global events. This is nearly double the 22 per cent India were allotted under the previous distribution deal, signed off in 2017. Among other determinations, T20 franchise leagues were given greater regulation including a minimum threshold of seven local players per team. Baird, who became the new chair of CA earlier this year , is set to join the ICC‚Äôs powerful finance and commercial affairs committee, placing him head to head with the BCCI‚Äôs influential secretary Jay Shah on the big questions of cricket economics. The WPL‚Äôs spectacle, featuring big crowds and large TV audiences after the BCCI sold rights to the event to Viacom18 for $US116.5 million ($169 million) over five years, has been a significant driver for the Champions League idea. It would be a far more significant development for the game than the announcement of equal prize money for men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs World Cups at the end of the Durban meeting. Unlike tennis or golf, the lifeblood of a cricketer‚Äôs career is contracts and match payments, which would rise considerably should the Champions League become a success. Introduction of the league, with broadcast rights revenue to be shared among the countries involved, would mimic the attempt to start a men‚Äôs T20 Champions League when the IPL was launched in 2008. That tournament, sold for nearly $US1 billion ($1.45 billion) to Star Sports, was abandoned after six editions as it failed to generate enough spectator interest to justify the high price tag. Its revenue was shared between India, Australia and South Africa, after England‚Äôs board dropped out of discussions. This time around, the concept of a women‚Äôs Champions League is seen as the logical next step to capitalise on the strength of the WPL, the WBBL and the Hundred competition in England. There is no suggestion that CA, the BCCI and the ECB are considering the relaunch of a men‚Äôs Champions League. Big crowds and high-quality cricket have been a hallmark of each of the last two women‚Äôs T20 World Cups also, in 2020 in Australia shortly before the outbreak of COVID-19, and then in South Africa earlier this year, where Australia again prevailed in a tight tussle against the hosts. It is possible that the tournament will also include teams from other leagues such as the Caribbean Premier League, but there is a desire to start the event in a focused manner and grow from there. Locations would be rotated, with match revenue from tickets and corporate hospitality to be retained by the host nation. Australia‚Äôs captain Alyssa Healy has spoken about the need for the women‚Äôs game to be supported by wider investment down development pathways in more nations. Meg Lanning‚Äôs dismissal for 35 was a big moment in the WPL final this year. Credit: Getty Images ‚ÄúI think it takes support and investment from the global bodies to invest in their women‚Äôs teams and their women‚Äôs pathways in particular,‚Äù Healy said earlier on the current Ashes tour. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no secret to why this team has been successful for a long period of time, it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve got great domestic pathways. ‚ÄúThey were invested in a long time ago and it‚Äôs developed some amazing players. The likes of Annabel Sutherland and Phoebe Litchfield can almost come straight into international cricket and perform right away. That really helps, and I think a lot of nations are catching up, they‚Äôre doing some great things.‚Äù The Marylebone Cricket Club‚Äôs world cricket committee reached a similar conclusion at their recent meeting ahead of the Lord‚Äôs Ashes Test. ‚ÄúThe growth of the women‚Äôs game must also be consistent with the growth of the game as a whole,‚Äù chair Mike Gatting said. ‚ÄúWe need to ensure that nations are rewarded for their commitment to investing in both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs game alike, and a ring-fenced fund could be an important step here. ‚ÄúWe have seen similar reports previously, which haven‚Äôt led to actions or tangible improvements. The WCC firmly believes that if we are to protect the game of cricket as a whole, immediate action must be taken to bring about significant transformation in the sport.‚Äù Watch every ball of the 2023 Ashes series live and exclusive on Channel 9 and 9Now.

Jaiswal carried his bat through the day to be 143 not out on debut. He and Rohit moved their opening partnership from 80 overnight to 229. But after a middle-session pick up, India crawled to stumps on 2-312. Virat Kohli (36 not out) was with Jaiswal. West Indies middle-order bat Alick Athanaze earned his maiden Test wicket when he got Rohit and broke the massive opening stand. Athanaze's 13 overs of off-spin compensated for the absence of Rahkeem Cornwall, who bowled his third maiden over before walking off in the morning session due to a chest infection. Jaiswal and Rohit were restricted to 66 runs in 32 overs in the first session, but that was enough to post India's first 100-run opening partnership in 11 Tests. After lunch, Jaiswal and Rohit showed more intent without really getting their timing right. They passed West Indies' total of 150 about six overs quicker, marking the first time India took a first-innings lead in a Test without losing a wicket. After the stand reached 200, Jaiswal became the 17th Indian man to score a Test century on debut, matching Rohit, who was the 14th in 2013. From the 215th ball he faced, Jaiswal paddle-swept a single to fine leg off Athanaze and celebrated exuberantly, raising his arms and leaping to punch the air. Soon after, the batters owned the highest opening partnership outside Asia when they eclipsed the 213 by Sunil Gavaskar and Chetan Chauhan in 1979 against England at the Oval. This was only India's third ever double-century opening stand outside Asia. Rohit finally posted his 10th Test hundred with a cover drive to the boundary, then was out next ball when he gloved Athanaze off his thigh to wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva. Rohit made 103 off 221 balls with 10 boundaries and two sixes. Shubman Gill requested to drop in the order from opener to No.3 and made only six when he was caught by Athanaze at short second slip off spinner Jomel Warrican. India added 99 runs in the middle session and only 67 runs in 32 overs after tea. West Indies used up their third and last review trying to get Kohli out on nine but he didn't touch the ball. Without a review, West Indies rued what might have been when pacer Kemar Roach hit Jaiswal on his back pad on 133. West Indies appealed for leg before without success and ball tracking showed the ball would have hit leg stump. Kohli, content to help Jaiswal grind things out, took 81 balls to hit his first boundary and punched the air. By stumps, he'd used up 96 balls to make 36. He played second fiddle to Jaiswal, who had the highest score by an Indian man on debut outside Asia, and counting.","pubDate":"2023-07-13 22:05:50","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11274047/300c022dedf0b76f8771ed4ad4482c5c98b391c3-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zimbabwe cricket growth charms Andy Flower","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimbabwe-cricket-growth-charms-andy-flower/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["peter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brandon Moyo, Brandonmalvin9@gmail.com CRICKET in Zimbabwe has been on a positive trajectory over the past couple of years and has seen a rise in followership with fans filling stadia whenever the national team plays.

The passion and love [‚Ä¶]","content":"The Chronicle CRICKET in Zimbabwe has been on a positive trajectory over the past couple of years and has seen a rise in followership with fans filling stadia whenever the national team plays. The steady growth of the sport in the country has charmed many from even outside the borders. The passion and love that has been seen over the past years is testimony that the game is gaining popularity. One man who liked what he saw during the recently ended 2023 Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup Qualifiers which were held in Zimbabwe is one of the country‚Äôs finest cricketers ever and an International Cricket Council (ICC) Hall of Famer, Andy Flower. Returning to Zimbabwe as part of the commentary team for the Qualifiers for the first time in over two decades, Flower was pleased with the growth of the sport in the country as a lot of work and effort has been put in to make sure that the game stays on top where it belongs. In an interview with ICC, Flower said he was pleased with what he saw at the country‚Äôs two biggest cricket stadiums, Queens Sports Club and Harare Sports Club having watched matches in Bulawayo and Harare where fans and the atmosphere was out of this world. He also noted a change in followership of the sport in the country as it has now become more popular to the black majority who have been showing appreciation for the sport unlike during their days as players. ‚ÄúBefore I arrived in Zimbabwe, I would have had a lukewarm response to a question about the future of Zimbabwean cricket. Now that I‚Äôm just about to leave, I feel much more positive. They (fans) threw love out towards everyone in the ground, even the little bit of barracking with the opposition was done in good spirit, and that I think I‚Äôll remember for years. ‚ÄúThe energy in the crowd. The love for the game, the feeling of support and love for the players while they were playing and while the crowd was singing and dancing and loving their day, but also taking note of every single ball. It was really interesting for me to see the change in the demographic in the crowd. When we were playing, it was mostly a White crowd, and the change that I have seen after being away for so long is such a great change for Zimbabwe,‚Äù he said. Over the past year, Zimbabwe has been playing positive cricket under the stewardship of Dave Houghton. Some of the Chevrons‚Äô notable victories include a final ball one run win over Pakistan in the T20 World Cup and also their first ODI victory over Australia Down Under, winning by three wickets after a Ryan Burl masterclass with the ball. The Chevrons also managed to reach the Super 12 stage of the T20 World Cup for the first time. Most recently, Zimbabwe beat the West Indies in their group match of the World Cup Qualifiers at Harare Sports Club. The positivity, courage and the mentality that the team now has is something that also caught Flower‚Äôs attention. Zimbabwe has enjoyed a good run in international cricket. ‚ÄúOne thing that stands out for me is the confidence with which Zimbabwe are playing their cricket, and I think partly that comes from exposure to international matches, to international tournaments and series. I see a certainly strong spirit in them. They have some experienced players, they‚Äôve got a few youngsters and it‚Äôll be an interesting transition when they move on from some of their experienced players in the next few years. But I do see a fighting spirit. You see that in the way that they field,‚Äù said Flower He remains the only Zimbabwean to have made it to the ICC Hall of Fame and is considered one of the finest wicket-keeper batters of all time across the globe. In 63 Test matches, Flower scored 4 794 runs with a high score of 232 runs not out at a staggering average of 51,54 while in one day cricket, the 55-year-old scored 6 786 runs from 213 games with a high score of 145 runs and an average of 35,34. He has 16 international tons. ‚Äì @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-07-13 22:01:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Why fast bowling is cricket's most primeval act: It does not just spill blood, it gets it pumping","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12297173/Why-fast-bowling-crickets-primeval-act-does-not-just-spill-blood-gets-pumping.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Fast bowling has always been cricket's most primeval act, a skill that comes from the heart not the brain and takes practitioners to places beyond logic.","content":"Why fast bowling is cricket's most primeval act: It does not just spill blood, it gets it pumping... that's why there will be a guttural roar when England's Mark Wood charges in to bowl at 97mph at Old Trafford next week Crowd gasped after Mark Wood‚Äôs fastest ball at Leeds ‚Äî 96.5mph ‚Äî was relayed Shoaib Akhtar holds record for a delivery clocked at 100.2mph against England Dennis Lillee rejoiced in terrorising batsmen with a bouncer at the rib-cage By Lawrence Booth for the Daily Mail Updated: 22:57, 13 July 2023 e-mail View comments On the day he sparked Australia ‚Äôs dramatic first innings collapse in the third Test, Mark Wood was asked what it was like to see his speed flashed up on Headingley‚Äôs big screen. He answered in two syllables: ‚ÄòWoo hoo!‚Äô Frankly, what more was there to be said? Fast bowling has always been cricket‚Äôs most primeval act, a skill that comes from the heart not the brain and takes practitioners to places beyond logic. Frank Tyson, the England quick who terrorised Australia in 1954-55, spoke of the ‚Äòglad animal action‚Äô of bowling fast. On the other side of the Ashes divide, Dennis Lillee rejoiced in the ‚Äòsheer ‚ÄúI can fly‚Äù exhilaration‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs seeing that look of apprehension on your quarry‚Äôs face‚Äô. The language is bestial, of hunter and hunted. When Wood‚Äôs fastest ball at Leeds ‚Äî 96.5mph ‚Äî was relayed to the crowd, they gasped at the brutishness it conveyed. And, for Wood, it was confirmation that everything was in working order. Woo hoo indeed. Not that he came close to the world record. That is held by Pakistan‚Äôs Shoaib Akhtar, who in a World Cup game against England at Cape Town in 2003 was clocked at 100.2mph and was known as the Rawalpindi Express. Strange, then, that the delivery ‚Äî in the words of Wisden ‚Äî was ‚Äòcomfortably repulsed‚Äô by Nick Knight. Fast bowler Mark Wood sparked Australia‚Äôs dramatic first innings collapse in the third Test Australia's Dennis Lillee rejoiced in terrorising batsmen with a bouncer at the rib-cage Since Shoaib, only two others have passed the mythical 100mph, both in one-day internationals for Australia ‚Äî Brett Lee, in 2005 against New Zealand at Napier, and Shaun Tait, in 2010 against England at Lord‚Äôs. Wood says he can bowl faster than at Headingley and with good reason ‚Äî last winter against Pakistan at Multan, he flew in at 97.3mph. One thing is certain. In a series already overflowing with subplots, all eyes will be on the speed gun when the Ashes resumes in Manchester next week. Central to the drama surrounding fast bowling is the threat of physical danger, as if cricket becomes something the Romans might have bayed for in the Colosseum. Jeff Thomson, the slingy Australian who was once said to have clocked 99.8mph at Perth‚Äôs WACA, was unapologetic about the edge this threat gave him. After putting an opponent in hospital for a week with a blow to the eye in a grade match, he admitted it was ‚Äòfrightening to see this bloke just screaming and shaking and the pitch splattered with blood as it poured through his fingers‚Äô. Ominously, though, he added: ‚ÄòI never let this sort of thing put me off.‚Äô He was especially undeterred against England, whom he destroyed during the 1974-75 Ashes with the help of Lillee. ‚ÄòI thought, ‚ÄúStuff that stiff-upper-lip crap‚Äù,‚Äô said Thomson. ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs see how stiff it is when it‚Äôs split.‚Äô Lillee was just as unflinching. ‚ÄòI try to hit a batsman in the rib-cage when I bowl a purposeful bouncer,‚Äô he once said. ‚ÄòI want it to hurt, so the batsman doesn‚Äôt want to face me any more.‚Äô The English players from that series, which Australia won 4-1, speak of shellshock, as if the balls were bullets and the crease a trench. David ‚ÄòBumble‚Äô Lloyd‚Äôs after-dinner story about having his inadequate box snapped open and, painfully, shut by Thomson has given that tour more humour than it deserves. Above all, there is little time for manoeuvre against fast bowling. While a 90mph delivery might slow to about 80mph before pitching, then to 72mph after it hits the turf, that still leaves the batsman just 0.4 seconds to react. Yet a study in Western Australia once suggested you need 0.3 of a second to make any sense of where the ball may land and another 0.3 of a second to execute your stroke. In other words, pre-meditation is the only option. As John Snow, the England fast bowler who helped Ray Illingworth‚Äôs side win the Ashes in Australia in 1970-71, put it: ‚ÄòSpeed defeats reactions.‚Äô You could see it in the way Australia‚Äôs lower order flinched at Wood, hoping to connect or simply survive. Only when Travis Head had his eye in on the third evening was Wood treated with anything other than apprehension. Fast bowling does not just spill blood, it gets it pumping like nothing else in cricket and like few activities in any sport. Perhaps the most famous over ever bowled was by Michael Holding to Geoffrey Boycott at Bridgetown, Barbados, in 1981, which ended with Boycott bowled for a duck. After he fell to Holding again in the second innings for a single, he was asked by a curious, and brave, waiter at the team hotel: ‚ÄòDid you see any of them?‚Äô Australian paceman Jeff Thomson was unapologetic about the edge this threat gave him Boycott, owner of arguably the tightest defence in the game‚Äôs history, replied: ‚ÄòI saw them all. I just couldn‚Äôt play any of them.‚Äô Others chose not to play any of them. On a brute of a pitch in Jamaica in 1976, Bishan Bedi declared India‚Äôs first innings on 306 for six to spare his lower order the ordeal of facing Holding, Wayne Daniel and Co. In the second innings, India got to 97 for two, but no further. Three wickets fell for none, while the remaining five batsmen were ‚Äòabsent hurt‚Äô. It was sobering to think West Indies had not yet embarked on their reign of terror, in which the psychological and physical grip exerted by their four-man attacks ensured they did not lose a Test series between 1980 and 1995. See off Holding and Andy Roberts and you had to contend with Joel Garner and Colin Croft. After them came Malcolm Marshall, Patrick Patterson, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh. There have been few more thrilling spells in England than the one sent down by Jofra Archer to Steve Smith in the 2019 Ashes Test at Lord‚Äôs. Hit on the head, Smith was ruled out of the next game due to concussion. The legend of Archer‚Äôs spell meant Smith recently pointed out on Twitter that Archer had not, in fact, taken his wicket. Only the toughest mentally survive the assault. Graham Gooch, one of the greatest players of pace, once said: ‚ÄòIf I went out to start an innings thinking about being hit, I could not play the game. My entire technique would collapse.‚Äô His England team-mate Robin Smith, another superb player of fast bowling, went for hypnosis after he had his jaw broken by West Indies‚Äô Ian Bishop at Old Trafford in 1995. The hypnotist was Derren Brown and his techniques did the trick. Smith never feared fast bowling again and later explained his tactics to the Guardian: ‚ÄòYou draw an imaginary line down the pitch, somewhere near the middle, and whenever the ball hits that line, you hit the f****** deck.‚Äô Not all fast bowlers have been comfortable inflicting pain. England‚Äôs Peter Lever could never forget hitting New Zealand No 11 Ewen Chatfield on the left temple at Auckland in 1975, years before protective headwear. Chatfield collapsed to the ground and swallowed his tongue. For a few seconds his heart stopped beating and it needed quick work by England physio Bernie Thomas to save his life. ‚ÄòI honestly thought I had killed him,‚Äô said Lever. ‚ÄòI felt sick and ashamed. All I could think when I got back to the pavilion was I wanted to retire.‚Äô Len Pascoe, a rugged Australian quick, had similar thoughts after hitting India‚Äôs Sandeep Patil in the face in 1981. Until then, he had traded off fear, but the incident led to introspection. ‚ÄòThe game‚Äôs not worth dying over,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòI was worried about what I was becoming. It wasn‚Äôt me.‚Äô After the death of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes following a blow to his vertebral artery on the side of his neck in a Sheffield Shield game in 2014, research was done into the number of deaths caused by cricket. According to Peter Brukner, then Australia team doctor, and historian Tom Gara, there were 544 cricket-related deaths in Australia, Britain and New Zealand dating back to 1850, with most caused by a blow to the heart or head. Since their research covered only three countries, the true number is likely to be much higher. Batsmen these days, of course, have more protection thanks to the introduction of helmets in the late 1970s, though this also means they are less likely to sway out of the way of bouncers, paradoxically increasing the chances of being hit. Are fast bowlers getting faster? Fred Trueman of Yorkshire and England, who once described himself as ‚Äòthe greatest bloody fast bowler that ever drew breath‚Äô, would be appalled at the thought that he was not in the same category as Wood, even if footage suggests he was not. Yet fast bowling may be one area of human endeavour where progress is not plotted on a smooth curve. Harold Larwood, England‚Äôs Bodyline hero of 1932-33, was said to have touched 96mph, though the evidence for this is sketchy. Shoaib‚Äôs record, meanwhile, has remained intact for 20 years. Since fast bowling is about more than the speed of the approach, it is easy to see why bowlers are not simply getting quicker. Also important are a long final stride, a braced front leg and the speed of the arm. As Shoaib found, a hyperextending elbow can help, too. There is no one-size-fits-all, no identikit method of making a fast bowler. It can be a mysterious process, dependent on temperament and defying reason. It connects with fans at an elemental level and makes batsmen question their life choices. It is why, when the Ashes resume, there will be a guttural roar as Wood charges in to deliver his first ball.

The second new ball is now available, but Windies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite is yet to take it. They might at the start of the evening session. Meanwhile, the Windsor Park surface is starting to really assist the spinners, and while the Indian batters might face a challenge from the likes of Jomel Warrican and Alick Athanaze, the development might just get Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja a lot more excited. 00:06 (IST) IND vs WI LIVE Cricket Score OUT! Athanaze is part of another dismissal, this time taking a regulation catch at gully after Gill gets a nick off Warrican's bowling while attemping a defensive push.

West Indies finally break the mammoth opening stand shortly before tea on the second day. Shubman Gill, batting at No 3 for the first time, makes his way to the centre. IND 229/1 in 76 Rohit c Da Silva b Athanaze 103(221) 23:53 (IST) IND vs WI LIVE Cricket Score FOUR!

He then collects a single to put India in the lead . 21:35 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score After 55 overs,India 146/0 ( Yashasvi Jaiswal 62 , Rohit Sharma (C) 68) LUNCH ON DAY 2 : Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal continue to stand strong, both bringing up their half-centuries and stretching their partnership past the century mark as India head to the lunch interval on 146 for no loss , trailing by just four with all 10 wickets in hand. Rohit and Jaiswal have certainly been a lot more cautious in the morning session, scoring at less than three-an-over. Windies skipper Brathwaite decides to give debutant Alick Athanaze the final over of the session, and the part-time off-spinner concedes a couple of singles. 20:42 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score FIFTY! India skipper Rohit Sharma gets to his 15th half-century in Test cricket! It's been a calm and composed knock from the Mumbai cricketer, and more importantly, he has been leading his team from the front here. IND 118/0 20:18 (IST) India vs West Indies LIVE Score FOUR! Pulled away in front of square by Jaiswal off Alzarri Joseph, and that brings up a half-century on international debut for the southpaw from Mumbai!

IND 103/0 Day 1 report: India will look to consolidate their position in the first Test against West Indies in Dominica, when they take field on Thursday for Day 2. The visitors were clinical in their approach on Wednesday after being asked to field first, with Ravichandran Ashwin, returning to the side, finishing with figures of 5/60 to see Windies off for 150. He was well-supported by fellow spin-bowling all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who collected three wickets for 26 runs. This was Ashwin‚Äôs 33rd five-fer in Test cricket, as well as his fifth against Windies since he made his Test debut against this very side in 2011. Barring debutant Alick Athanaze (47), none of the West Indian batters were able to convert starts into big knocks. Local boy Athanaze narrowly missed out on a half-century on Test debut, getting dismissed by Ashwin shortly before tea on the opening day. And in their first innings reply, India were 80/0 after 23 overs at stumps, with debutant Yashasvi Jaiswal (40*) and his skipper Rohit Sharma (30*) at the other end.
