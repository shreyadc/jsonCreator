Holdstock joins fellow Western Caper Marais Erasmus on the panel and the duo was set to stand in the first ODI between South Africa and the West Indies. However, rain got in the permanent way of that game as it was washed out without a ball being bowled. Holdstock has officiated in five Tests, 42 ODIs and 48 T20s. Holdstock's ascension to the elite group means South Africa now have three umpires in the international panel in Shaun George, Bongani Jele and Allahudien Paleker.

The post 29 and out: Former Proteas Women skipper Dané van Niekerk announces her international retirement appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"Proteas Women’s all-rounder and former captain, Dané van Niekerk, has confirmed her retirement from all forms of international cricket after a career spanning more than 14 years in the national team. Van Niekerk joins Proteas Women stalwarts Lizelle Lee and Mignon du Preez, who retired from the national team within the last year. The 29-year-old enjoyed an illustrious international career for South Africa, representing her country on 194 occasions, including 107 One-Day Internationals (ODI), 86 T20 Internationals (T20Is) and a single Test match against India in 2014. Van Niekerk has struggled to stay on the playing field due to injuries and fitness over the past year. The last time she represented the national team was on 19 September 2021 against West Indies. She suffered a freak injury in January 2022 when she fractured an ankle after slipping on a wet floor at home, which ruled her out of the 50-over World Cup in New Zealand that year. Suné Luus took over the captaincy of the Proteas Women on an interim basis after the injury. Van Niekerk battled to regain fitness and subsequently missed out on selection for last month’s T20 World Cup hosted in South Africa. Luus was officially made skipper – having led the team for a year on a provisional basis – prior to the start of the home tournament. The Proteas reached the final of the 20-over World Cup but finished as runners-up after losing by 19 runs to Australia at Newlands on 26 February. Van Niekerk will continue to play in franchise leagues around the world. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations The former skipper is currently in India where she is representing the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Women’s Premier League. “It is with great sadness that I announce my retirement from international cricket,” Van Niekerk said in a statement released by Cricket South Africa (CSA). “It has been the greatest honour to lead and represent my country. I am incredibly blessed to have led the team through its transformative years. “There is no doubt that the women’s game is in an exciting space and I’m looking forward to seeing this beautiful game that I love, grow. “I look back on my career fondly and have made incredible memories and want to thank Cricket South Africa and all other stakeholders for your support. “Often the journey can be lonely, painful and emotional, but I would not change it for anything. I’m grateful for what this game has given me. “To all the players that I had the privilege to have shared the dressing room and competed with, I will hold on to the memories dearly.” Dané van Niekerk of the Strikers walks off after being caught behind during the Women’s Big Bash League match between the Perth Scorchers and the Adelaide Strikers at Optus Stadium, on 27 November 2021, in Perth, Australia. (Photo: Stefan Gosatti / Getty Images) Van Niekerk started her international career in March 2009. The former captain recorded 2,175 runs in ODI cricket, with nine half-centuries and a career-best score of 102 against Sri Lanka. She logged a further 1,877 runs in T20 cricket, while notching up 10 fifties. With the ball, the leg-spinner bagged 204 international scalps overall (138 in ODIs, 65 in T20Is and one in Tests), including record-breaking figures of four for zero during the Women’s Cricket World Cup 2017 against the West Indies in Leicester, England. Amongst Van Niekerk’s other notable records, the Tshwane-born star is one of only six female cricketers to claim more than 1,000 runs, 50 wickets and 50 catches in the one-day format Van Niekerk also led South Africa as one of the most successful and most-capped captains in the country’s history. She walked out as leader in 50 ODI encounters, winning 29 matches (61.22%) between 2016 and her last international appearance in September 2021. In the shorter format, Van Niekerk skippered the nation to 15 victories in 30 matches (50%). “We are merely custodians of this sport; I hand it over knowing I have given it my everything and that women’s cricket is in a better place than when I arrived,” her statement read. “That must be the responsibility of the new group, to always make sure you are improving and making a difference. It is time for me to support the new leadership and wish them all the very best. “To my amazing family. Thank you for your incredible love and support. From the age of four, you have seen the potential and did everything and anything to help me succeed. I will forever be grateful. “My wife, Marizanne [Kapp], you stood by my side since day one. Thank you for putting up with me and all that came with it, but yet, here you are. “You are at the pinnacle of your career and it is my time to support you, the way you have supported me. I love you.” CSA Director of Cricket Enoch Nkwe said: “I would like to take this opportunity to graciously thank Dané for all her years of service and contribution to not only the ground-breaking success of the Proteas over the last decade, but to the overall growth and popularity of women’s cricket in South Africa and around the world. “Her world-class cricketing ability and exceptional leadership skills are irrefutable and will surely be missed by her teammates, coaches and all South African fans who have followed her journey over the last 14 years. “We wish Dané all the very best ahead of the next chapter in her career.” DM","pubDate":"2023-03-16 20:10:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailymaverick","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chris Rattue’s watchlist: The best sport to watch this weekend and beyond (ranked)","link":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/chris-rattues-watchlist-the-best-sport-to-watch-this-weekend-and-beyond-ranked/IFEICMGFD5HMJB6E45D7JCGSFM/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Chris Rattue ranks the best sport to watch this weekend and beyond.","content":"Chris Rattue ranks the best sport to watch this weekend and beyond. 6. SailGP – Saturday & Sunday, 3pm – Sky (Day one live on channel Three) The Crusaders might be sinking but not to worry - Christchurch has a new game in town. The Russell Coutts extravaganza arrives in Lyttleton, where Peter Burling’s New Zealand team will aim to consolidate a place in the all-important top three and thus get to race for mega bucks in San Francisco. The foiling catamaran series isn’t on the same ocean as the America’s Cup in terms of profile despite the big names – Ben Ainslie, Jimmy Spithill et al. – being involved. It’s the nearest thing sailing will come to a demolition derby which gets a few headlines, but the America’s Cup association is what really keeps it afloat. Day one in Lyttleton will also be covered live on channel Three, but this free-to-air coverage is delayed on Sunday. 5. NCAA basketball, Washington State v Florida Gulf Coast, Sunday, 7.30am – ESPN Waikato basketball prodigy Charlisse Leger-Walker is so good she earned an honourable mention in Associated Press’s All-American team of the year. And if you negotiate the Sky/ESPN app bizzo, Leger-Walker can be seen in action for Washington State in the famous NCAA tournament, also known as March Madness. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. The 21-year-old guard has led the Cougars to new heights this season and they enter the 64-team finals seeded fifth for their region. Leger-Walker is already being touted as a second round WNBA draft pick for 2024 in a major breakthrough for Kiwi basketball. Some of the men’s and women’s tournament is covered on Sky’s standard ESPN2 channel. 4. Black Caps v Sri Lanka, from Friday, 11am – Spark Given current trends, something remarkable will happen in this Wellington cricket test on Tuesday evening. Pity the free-to-air deal didn’t begin this season. Neil Wagner and Kane Williamson celebrate winning the first test over Sri Lanka. Photosport 3. All Whites v China, Thursday, 7pm – Sky Ideally, this should be the game of the week. But the All Whites are so disappointing, with the goalless performances mounting. Star striker Chris Wood is in doubt for the opening match at Mt Smart Stadium, the new home of football (said tongue in cheek) with a new A-League team mooted to be based there. Wood is battling a thigh injury, and it would be both disappointing and interesting if the All Whites are without him. Or to put it another way, maybe the shock of running on the field without him will magically break the goal-scoring lethargy. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. On that note, Wood has come in for criticism from former striker Stan Collymore since his EPL transfer from Newcastle to Nottingham Forest. Collymore says modern rules should help a genuine centre forward like Wood, and claimed he was not throwing his body into the battle. China, meanwhile, will present mysterious opposition. They are ranked 80th in the world, to the All Whites’ 105, and appear to be a fairly young side of unknown, domestic players. The second game is three days later in Wellington. Chris Wood poses in his new Nottingham Forest uniform. Photo / Nottingham Forest FC 2. Six Nations: Ireland v England, Sunday, 6am – Sky Another chance to stare in disbelief at English rugby. All that money… England will need a minor miracle to get within 20 points of the title-chasing Irish, who have reached a new level under Andy Farrell. Ireland overcame adversity against Scotland, while England created it against France. They will try to bounce back from the humiliating defeat at Twickenham, but their lack of breakdown energy suggests it is a squad devoid of belief. Apart from that, there are also a few impressive Kiwis in the Irish backline to drool over, including bench halfback Jamison Gibson-Park whose form makes you wonder about the competency of the All Blacks development machine. He would walk into the All Blacks squad. Ireland's James Lowe in action. Photo / AP 1. NRL: Roosters v Rabbitohs, Friday, 10pm – Sky NRL grudge matches won’t come any better than this in 2023. The clubs are hardly best of mates anyway, and a spiteful 2022 encounter has put the antipathy into overdrive. The Rabbitohs are the best side in the NRL to watch when they are in the mood, but playmaker Cody Walker can be niggled off his stride. Victor Radley and Kiwi enforcer Jared Waerea-Hargreaves are back from injury for the Roosters – look out for some tasty action involving the latter. This game pips the England-Ireland rugby test as the most tantalising sports watch of the weekend.

को गुजरात ने 11 रनों से हरा दिया। गुजरात जायंट्स ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए चार विकेट पर 147 रन बनाए। इसके जवाब में दिल्ली की टीम 18. 4 ओवर में एक 136 रन पर आउट हो गई। इस मैच में जीत का क्रेडिट एशली गार्डनर को जाता है। लॉरा वुलफार्ट और एशली गार्डनर के अर्धशतकों की मदद से गुजरात जायंट्स ने गुरुवार को यहां दिल्ली कैपिटल्स 11 रन से हराकर महिला प्रीमियर लीग (डब्ल्यूपीएल) में अपनी दूसरी जीत दर्ज की। दिल्ली की यह पांच मैचों में दूसरी हार है। गुजरात की तरफ से वुलफार्ट ने 45 गेंदों पर 57 रन बनाए जिसमें 6 चौके और एक छक्का शामिल है। गार्डनर ने 33 गेंदों पर 9 चौकों की मदद से नाबाद 51 रन की पारी खेली। इन दोनों ने तीसरे विकेट के लिए 81 रन की महत्वपूर्ण साझेदारी की। इनके अलावा हरलीन देओल ने 33 गेंदों पर 31 रन बनाए। दिल्ली की तरफ से जेस जॉनासन ने 38 रन देकर दो विकेट लिए। दिल्ली के चार बल्लेबाज ही दोहरे अंक में पहुंचे जिनमें मारिजान कैप ने सर्वाधिक 36 रन बनाए। अरुंधति रेड्डी ने आखरी ओवरों में 19 गेंद पर 25 रन बनाकर एक समय गुजरात के पेशानी पर बल ला दिए थे। गार्डनर ने गेंदबाजी में भी कमाल दिखाया और 19 रन देकर दो विकेट लिए। उनके अलावा किम गार्थ और तनुजा कंवर ने भी दो-दो विकेट हासिल किए। दिल्ली के सामने मुश्किल लक्ष्य नहीं था लेकिन उसने रन गति बनाए रखने के बावजूद नियमित अंतराल में विकेट गवांकर अपने लिए स्थिति जटिल कर दी थी। दिल्ली ने पहले 10 ओवर में 78 रन बनाए लेकिन इस बीच चार विकेट भी गंवाए। शेफाली वर्मा केवल 8 रन बना पाई और तनुजा कंवर (29 रन देकर दो विकेट) की गेंद पर बोल्ड हो गई। कप्तान मेग लैनिंग ने स्नेह राणा की गेंद पर आउट आउट होने से पहले 18 रन बनाए। गुजरात की हार के साथ आरसीबी की प्लेऑफ में पहुंच पाने की उम्मीद भी लगभग खत्म हो चुकी हैं। आरसीबी को प्लेऑफ में पहुंचने के लिए दिल्ली को गुजरात के खिलाफ ये मैच जीतना बहुत जरूरी था। लीग चरण में आरसीबी को जो सबसे अच्छा फिनिश मिल सकता है वह तीसरा स्थान है। वे एलिमिनेटर में तभी जगह बना सकते हैं जब: 1. आरसीबी अपने बाकी दोनों मैच जीते। 2. मुंबई और दिल्ली अपने मैच यूपी वारियर्स और गुजरात जायंट्स के खिलाफ जीत जाए। 3. गुजरात जायंट्स 20 मार्च को यूपी वारियर्स को हरा दे।","pubDate":"2023-03-16

एमएस धोनी के नेतृत्व में चार बार खिताब जीतने वाली आईपीएल की दिग्गज टीम चेन्नई सुपर किंग्स की तो टीम चेन्नई के एमए चिदंबरम स्टेडियम में कमर कस चुकी है. टीम के अभ्यास सत्र के कई वीडियो सोशल मीडिया पर वायरल हो रहे हैं, जहां धोनी नेट्स पर पसीना बहा रहे हैं. हालाँकि एक नया वीडियो ट्विटर पर अब वायरल हो गया है, जिसमें पूर्व भारतीय कप्तान का बिल्कुल अलग अंदाज़ दिखाया दिया है. सीएसके के ट्विटर पर पोस्ट

होगा।","content":"बाबर आजम की कप्तानी वाली पेशावर जाल्मी अब पाकिस्तान सुपर लीग के फाइनल में पहुंचने से सिर्फ एक जीत दूर है। गद्दाफी स्टेडियम में गुरुवार रात खेले गए एलिमिनेटर-1 पेशावर ने इस्लामाबाद यूनाइटेड को 12 रन से हराकर टूर्नामेंट से बाहर कर दिया। अब बाबर सेना का अगला मैच एलिमिमेटर-2 में लाहौर कलंदर्स से होगा, जो भी यह मैच जीतेगा वह मुल्तान सुल्तांस से फाइनल खेलेगा। इस बड़े मुकाबले में कप्तान बाबर आजम ने शानदार अर्धशतक जड़ा तो गेंदबाजों ने कसी बोलिंग डाली। इस्लामाबाद यूनाइटेड ने टॉस जीतकर पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए स्कोरबोर्ड पर 8 विकेट के नुकसान पर 183 रन ठोके। बाबर आजम ने 39 गेंद में 64 रन बनाए। मोहम्मद हारिस के बल्ले से भी तेज 34 रन निकले। जवाब में इस्लामाद यूनाइटेड 171 रन ही बना पाई और 12 रन से मुकाबला हार बैठी। एक वक्त मैच बराबरी का लग रहा था, लेकिन 17वें ओवर में खेल पलट गया। 16 ओवर में इस्लामबाद का स्कोर 137/3 था। चार ओवर में 47 रन की दरकार थी। टी-20 में 47 गेंद में शतक ठोक चुके न्यूजीलैंड के विस्फोटक बल्लेबाज कॉलिन मुनरो और एलेक्स हेल्स क्रीज पर थे, जो 36 गेंद पर 57 रन बनाकर नाबाद थे। मैच बराबरी का था। मगर 17वें ओवर में खेल हो गया। इस ओवर की जिम्मेदारी आमेर जमाल के पास थी। तेज गेंदबाज ने बेहद चतुराई से बोलिंग डालते हुए दो विकेट निकाले। पहली ही गेंद पर हेल्स को चलता किया और फिर नए बल्लेबाज फहीम अशरफ को भी रन आउट कर दिया। बाबर आजम (कप्तान), सईम अयूब, मोहम्मद हारिस, हसीबुल्लाह खान (विकेटकीपर), टॉम कोहलर-कैडमोर, जेम्स नीशम, आमेर जमाल, अजमतुल्लाह उमरजई, मुजीब उर

क्वार्टर फाइनल में पहुंच चुकी है। त्रीसा जॉली और गायत्री गोपीचंद की भारतीय महिला युगल जोड़ी ने शानदार जीत दर्ज करके गुरुवार को यहां आल इंग्लैंड बैडमिंटन चैंपियनशिप के क्वार्टरफाइनल में प्रवेश किया लेकिन लक्ष्य सेन पुरुष एकल में हारकर बाहर हो गए। राष्ट्रमंडल खेलों की कांस्य पदक विजेता त्रीसा और गायत्री ने अपना बेहतरीन प्रदर्शन जारी रखते हुए युकी फुकुशिमा और सायाका हिरोटा की जोड़ी को रोमांचक मुकाबले में 21-14, 24-22 से हराया। पिछली बार सेमीफाइनल में पहुंचने वाली यह भारतीय जोड़ी अगले दौर में ली वेन मेई और लियू जुआन जुआन की चीनी जोड़ी से भिड़ेगी। पिछली बार फाइनल में जगह बनाने वाले सेन डेनमार्क के एंडर्स एंटोनसेन के खिलाफ किसी भी समय लय में नहीं दिखे और 52 मिनट में 13-21, 15-21 से हार गए। सात्विकसाईराज रैंकीरेड्डी और चिराग शेट्टी की भारतीय पुरुष युगल जोड़ी भी चीन के विश्व नंबर 10

The post 29 and out: Former Proteas Women skipper Dané van Niekerk announces her international retirement appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"Proteas Women’s all-rounder and former captain, Dané van Niekerk, has confirmed her retirement from all forms of international cricket after a career spanning more than 14 years in the national team. Van Niekerk joins Proteas Women stalwarts Lizelle Lee and Mignon du Preez, who retired from the national team within the last year. The 29-year-old enjoyed an illustrious international career for South Africa, representing her country on 194 occasions, including 107 One-Day Internationals (ODI), 86 T20 Internationals (T20Is) and a single Test match against India in 2014. Van Niekerk has struggled to stay on the playing field due to injuries and fitness over the past year. The last time she represented the national team was on 19 September 2021 against West Indies. She suffered a freak injury in January 2022 when she fractured an ankle after slipping on a wet floor at home, which ruled her out of the 50-over World Cup in New Zealand that year. Suné Luus took over the captaincy of the Proteas Women on an interim basis after the injury. Van Niekerk battled to regain fitness and subsequently missed out on selection for last month’s T20 World Cup hosted in South Africa. Luus was officially made skipper – having led the team for a year on a provisional basis – prior to the start of the home tournament. The Proteas reached the final of the 20-over World Cup but finished as runners-up after losing by 19 runs to Australia at Newlands on 26 February. Van Niekerk will continue to play in franchise leagues around the world. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations The former skipper is currently in India where she is representing the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Women’s Premier League. “It is with great sadness that I announce my retirement from international cricket,” Van Niekerk said in a statement released by Cricket South Africa (CSA). “It has been the greatest honour to lead and represent my country. I am incredibly blessed to have led the team through its transformative years. “There is no doubt that the women’s game is in an exciting space and I’m looking forward to seeing this beautiful game that I love, grow. “I look back on my career fondly and have made incredible memories and want to thank Cricket South Africa and all other stakeholders for your support. “Often the journey can be lonely, painful and emotional, but I would not change it for anything. I’m grateful for what this game has given me. “To all the players that I had the privilege to have shared the dressing room and competed with, I will hold on to the memories dearly.” Dané van Niekerk of the Strikers walks off after being caught behind during the Women’s Big Bash League match between the Perth Scorchers and the Adelaide Strikers at Optus Stadium, on 27 November 2021, in Perth, Australia. (Photo: Stefan Gosatti / Getty Images) Van Niekerk started her international career in March 2009. The former captain recorded 2,175 runs in ODI cricket, with nine half-centuries and a career-best score of 102 against Sri Lanka. She logged a further 1,877 runs in T20 cricket, while notching up 10 fifties. With the ball, the leg-spinner bagged 204 international scalps overall (138 in ODIs, 65 in T20Is and one in Tests), including record-breaking figures of four for zero during the Women’s Cricket World Cup 2017 against the West Indies in Leicester, England. Amongst Van Niekerk’s other notable records, the Tshwane-born star is one of only six female cricketers to claim more than 1,000 runs, 50 wickets and 50 catches in the one-day format Van Niekerk also led South Africa as one of the most successful and most-capped captains in the country’s history. She walked out as leader in 50 ODI encounters, winning 29 matches (61.22%) between 2016 and her last international appearance in September 2021. In the shorter format, Van Niekerk skippered the nation to 15 victories in 30 matches (50%). “We are merely custodians of this sport; I hand it over knowing I have given it my everything and that women’s cricket is in a better place than when I arrived,” her statement read. “That must be the responsibility of the new group, to always make sure you are improving and making a difference. It is time for me to support the new leadership and wish them all the very best. “To my amazing family. Thank you for your incredible love and support. From the age of four, you have seen the potential and did everything and anything to help me succeed. I will forever be grateful. “My wife, Marizanne [Kapp], you stood by my side since day one. Thank you for putting up with me and all that came with it, but yet, here you are. “You are at the pinnacle of your career and it is my time to support you, the way you have supported me. I love you.” CSA Director of Cricket Enoch Nkwe said: “I would like to take this opportunity to graciously thank Dané for all her years of service and contribution to not only the ground-breaking success of the Proteas over the last decade, but to the overall growth and popularity of women’s cricket in South Africa and around the world. “Her world-class cricketing ability and exceptional leadership skills are irrefutable and will surely be missed by her teammates, coaches and all South African fans who have followed her journey over the last 14 years. “We wish Dané all the very best ahead of the next chapter in her career.” DM","pubDate":"2023-03-16 20:10:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailymaverick","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chris Rattue’s watchlist: The best sport to watch this weekend and beyond (ranked)","link":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/chris-rattues-watchlist-the-best-sport-to-watch-this-weekend-and-beyond-ranked/IFEICMGFD5HMJB6E45D7JCGSFM/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Chris Rattue ranks the best sport to watch this weekend and beyond.","content":"Chris Rattue ranks the best sport to watch this weekend and beyond. 6. SailGP – Saturday & Sunday, 3pm – Sky (Day one live on channel Three) The Crusaders might be sinking but not to worry - Christchurch has a new game in town. The Russell Coutts extravaganza arrives in Lyttleton, where Peter Burling’s New Zealand team will aim to consolidate a place in the all-important top three and thus get to race for mega bucks in San Francisco. The foiling catamaran series isn’t on the same ocean as the America’s Cup in terms of profile despite the big names – Ben Ainslie, Jimmy Spithill et al. – being involved. It’s the nearest thing sailing will come to a demolition derby which gets a few headlines, but the America’s Cup association is what really keeps it afloat. Day one in Lyttleton will also be covered live on channel Three, but this free-to-air coverage is delayed on Sunday. 5. NCAA basketball, Washington State v Florida Gulf Coast, Sunday, 7.30am – ESPN Waikato basketball prodigy Charlisse Leger-Walker is so good she earned an honourable mention in Associated Press’s All-American team of the year. And if you negotiate the Sky/ESPN app bizzo, Leger-Walker can be seen in action for Washington State in the famous NCAA tournament, also known as March Madness. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. The 21-year-old guard has led the Cougars to new heights this season and they enter the 64-team finals seeded fifth for their region. Leger-Walker is already being touted as a second round WNBA draft pick for 2024 in a major breakthrough for Kiwi basketball. Some of the men’s and women’s tournament is covered on Sky’s standard ESPN2 channel. 4. Black Caps v Sri Lanka, from Friday, 11am – Spark Given current trends, something remarkable will happen in this Wellington cricket test on Tuesday evening. Pity the free-to-air deal didn’t begin this season. Neil Wagner and Kane Williamson celebrate winning the first test over Sri Lanka. Photosport 3. All Whites v China, Thursday, 7pm – Sky Ideally, this should be the game of the week. But the All Whites are so disappointing, with the goalless performances mounting. Star striker Chris Wood is in doubt for the opening match at Mt Smart Stadium, the new home of football (said tongue in cheek) with a new A-League team mooted to be based there. Wood is battling a thigh injury, and it would be both disappointing and interesting if the All Whites are without him. Or to put it another way, maybe the shock of running on the field without him will magically break the goal-scoring lethargy. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. On that note, Wood has come in for criticism from former striker Stan Collymore since his EPL transfer from Newcastle to Nottingham Forest. Collymore says modern rules should help a genuine centre forward like Wood, and claimed he was not throwing his body into the battle. China, meanwhile, will present mysterious opposition. They are ranked 80th in the world, to the All Whites’ 105, and appear to be a fairly young side of unknown, domestic players. The second game is three days later in Wellington. Chris Wood poses in his new Nottingham Forest uniform. Photo / Nottingham Forest FC 2. Six Nations: Ireland v England, Sunday, 6am – Sky Another chance to stare in disbelief at English rugby. All that money… England will need a minor miracle to get within 20 points of the title-chasing Irish, who have reached a new level under Andy Farrell. Ireland overcame adversity against Scotland, while England created it against France. They will try to bounce back from the humiliating defeat at Twickenham, but their lack of breakdown energy suggests it is a squad devoid of belief. Apart from that, there are also a few impressive Kiwis in the Irish backline to drool over, including bench halfback Jamison Gibson-Park whose form makes you wonder about the competency of the All Blacks development machine. He would walk into the All Blacks squad. Ireland's James Lowe in action. Photo / AP 1. NRL: Roosters v Rabbitohs, Friday, 10pm – Sky NRL grudge matches won’t come any better than this in 2023. The clubs are hardly best of mates anyway, and a spiteful 2022 encounter has put the antipathy into overdrive. The Rabbitohs are the best side in the NRL to watch when they are in the mood, but playmaker Cody Walker can be niggled off his stride. Victor Radley and Kiwi enforcer Jared Waerea-Hargreaves are back from injury for the Roosters – look out for some tasty action involving the latter. This game pips the England-Ireland rugby test as the most tantalising sports watch of the weekend.

दोहरे अंक में पहुंचे जिनमें मारिजान कैप ने सर्वाधिक 36 रन बनाए। अरुंधति रेड्डी ने आखरी ओवरों में 19 गेंद पर 25 रन बनाकर एक समय गुजरात के पेशानी पर बल ला दिए थे। गार्डनर ने गेंदबाजी में भी कमाल दिखाया और 19 रन देकर दो विकेट लिए। उनके अलावा किम गार्थ और तनुजा कंवर ने भी दो-दो विकेट हासिल किए। दिल्ली के सामने मुश्किल लक्ष्य नहीं था लेकिन उसने रन गति बनाए रखने के बावजूद नियमित अंतराल में विकेट गवांकर अपने लिए स्थिति जटिल कर दी थी। दिल्ली ने पहले 10 ओवर में 78 रन बनाए लेकिन इस बीच चार विकेट भी गंवाए। शेफाली वर्मा केवल 8 रन बना पाई और तनुजा कंवर (29 रन देकर दो विकेट) की गेंद पर बोल्ड हो गई। कप्तान मेग लैनिंग ने स्नेह राणा की गेंद पर आउट आउट होने से पहले 18 रन बनाए। गुजरात की हार के साथ आरसीबी की प्लेऑफ में पहुंच पाने की उम्मीद भी लगभग खत्म हो चुकी हैं। आरसीबी को प्लेऑफ में पहुंचने के लिए दिल्ली को गुजरात के खिलाफ ये मैच जीतना बहुत जरूरी था। लीग चरण में आरसीबी को जो सबसे अच्छा फिनिश मिल सकता है वह तीसरा स्थान है। वे एलिमिनेटर में तभी जगह बना सकते हैं जब: 1. आरसीबी अपने बाकी दोनों मैच जीते। 2. मुंबई और दिल्ली अपने मैच यूपी वारियर्स और गुजरात जायंट्स के खिलाफ जीत जाए। 3. गुजरात जायंट्स 20 मार्च को यूपी वारियर्स को हरा दे।","pubDate":"2023-03-16

कप्तान बाबर आजम ने शानदार अर्धशतक जड़ा तो गेंदबाजों ने कसी बोलिंग डाली। इस्लामाबाद यूनाइटेड ने टॉस जीतकर पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए स्कोरबोर्ड पर 8 विकेट के नुकसान पर 183 रन ठोके। बाबर आजम ने 39 गेंद में 64 रन बनाए। मोहम्मद हारिस के बल्ले से भी तेज 34 रन निकले। जवाब में इस्लामाद यूनाइटेड 171 रन ही बना पाई और 12 रन से मुकाबला हार बैठी। एक वक्त मैच बराबरी का लग रहा था, लेकिन 17वें ओवर में खेल पलट गया।

The post 29 and out: Former Proteas Women skipper Dané van Niekerk announces her international retirement appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"Proteas Women’s all-rounder and former captain, Dané van Niekerk, has confirmed her retirement from all forms of international cricket after a career spanning more than 14 years in the national team. Van Niekerk joins Proteas Women stalwarts Lizelle Lee and Mignon du Preez, who retired from the national team within the last year. The 29-year-old enjoyed an illustrious international career for South Africa, representing her country on 194 occasions, including 107 One-Day Internationals (ODI), 86 T20 Internationals (T20Is) and a single Test match against India in 2014. Van Niekerk has struggled to stay on the playing field due to injuries and fitness over the past year. The last time she represented the national team was on 19 September 2021 against West Indies. She suffered a freak injury in January 2022 when she fractured an ankle after slipping on a wet floor at home, which ruled her out of the 50-over World Cup in New Zealand that year. Suné Luus took over the captaincy of the Proteas Women on an interim basis after the injury. Van Niekerk battled to regain fitness and subsequently missed out on selection for last month’s T20 World Cup hosted in South Africa. Luus was officially made skipper – having led the team for a year on a provisional basis – prior to the start of the home tournament. The Proteas reached the final of the 20-over World Cup but finished as runners-up after losing by 19 runs to Australia at Newlands on 26 February. Van Niekerk will continue to play in franchise leagues around the world. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations The former skipper is currently in India where she is representing the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Women’s Premier League. “It is with great sadness that I announce my retirement from international cricket,” Van Niekerk said in a statement released by Cricket South Africa (CSA). “It has been the greatest honour to lead and represent my country. I am incredibly blessed to have led the team through its transformative years. “There is no doubt that the women’s game is in an exciting space and I’m looking forward to seeing this beautiful game that I love, grow. “I look back on my career fondly and have made incredible memories and want to thank Cricket South Africa and all other stakeholders for your support. “Often the journey can be lonely, painful and emotional, but I would not change it for anything. I’m grateful for what this game has given me. “To all the players that I had the privilege to have shared the dressing room and competed with, I will hold on to the memories dearly.” Dané van Niekerk of the Strikers walks off after being caught behind during the Women’s Big Bash League match between the Perth Scorchers and the Adelaide Strikers at Optus Stadium, on 27 November 2021, in Perth, Australia. (Photo: Stefan Gosatti / Getty Images) Van Niekerk started her international career in March 2009. The former captain recorded 2,175 runs in ODI cricket, with nine half-centuries and a career-best score of 102 against Sri Lanka. She logged a further 1,877 runs in T20 cricket, while notching up 10 fifties. With the ball, the leg-spinner bagged 204 international scalps overall (138 in ODIs, 65 in T20Is and one in Tests), including record-breaking figures of four for zero during the Women’s Cricket World Cup 2017 against the West Indies in Leicester, England. Amongst Van Niekerk’s other notable records, the Tshwane-born star is one of only six female cricketers to claim more than 1,000 runs, 50 wickets and 50 catches in the one-day format Van Niekerk also led South Africa as one of the most successful and most-capped captains in the country’s history. She walked out as leader in 50 ODI encounters, winning 29 matches (61.22%) between 2016 and her last international appearance in September 2021. In the shorter format, Van Niekerk skippered the nation to 15 victories in 30 matches (50%). “We are merely custodians of this sport; I hand it over knowing I have given it my everything and that women’s cricket is in a better place than when I arrived,” her statement read. “That must be the responsibility of the new group, to always make sure you are improving and making a difference. It is time for me to support the new leadership and wish them all the very best. “To my amazing family. Thank you for your incredible love and support. From the age of four, you have seen the potential and did everything and anything to help me succeed. I will forever be grateful. “My wife, Marizanne [Kapp], you stood by my side since day one. Thank you for putting up with me and all that came with it, but yet, here you are. “You are at the pinnacle of your career and it is my time to support you, the way you have supported me. I love you.” CSA Director of Cricket Enoch Nkwe said: “I would like to take this opportunity to graciously thank Dané for all her years of service and contribution to not only the ground-breaking success of the Proteas over the last decade, but to the overall growth and popularity of women’s cricket in South Africa and around the world. “Her world-class cricketing ability and exceptional leadership skills are irrefutable and will surely be missed by her teammates, coaches and all South African fans who have followed her journey over the last 14 years. “We wish Dané all the very best ahead of the next chapter in her career.” DM","pubDate":"2023-03-16 20:10:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailymaverick","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chris Rattue’s watchlist: The best sport to watch this weekend and beyond (ranked)","link":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/chris-rattues-watchlist-the-best-sport-to-watch-this-weekend-and-beyond-ranked/IFEICMGFD5HMJB6E45D7JCGSFM/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Chris Rattue ranks the best sport to watch this weekend and beyond.","content":"Chris Rattue ranks the best sport to watch this weekend and beyond. 6.

The foiling catamaran series isn’t on the same ocean as the America’s Cup in terms of profile despite the big names – Ben Ainslie, Jimmy Spithill et al. – being involved. It’s the nearest thing sailing will come to a demolition derby which gets a few headlines, but the America’s Cup association is what really keeps it afloat. Day one in Lyttleton will also be covered live on channel Three, but this free-to-air coverage is delayed on Sunday. 5. NCAA basketball, Washington State v Florida Gulf Coast, Sunday, 7.30am – ESPN Waikato basketball prodigy Charlisse Leger-Walker is so good she earned an honourable mention in Associated Press’s All-American team of the year. And if you negotiate the Sky/ESPN app bizzo, Leger-Walker can be seen in action for Washington State in the famous NCAA tournament, also known as March Madness. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. The 21-year-old guard has led the Cougars to new heights this season and they enter the 64-team finals seeded fifth for their region. Leger-Walker is already being touted as a second round WNBA draft pick for 2024 in a major breakthrough for Kiwi basketball.

All Whites v China, Thursday, 7pm – Sky Ideally, this should be the game of the week. But the All Whites are so disappointing, with the goalless performances mounting. Star striker Chris Wood is in doubt for the opening match at Mt Smart Stadium, the new home of football (said tongue in cheek) with a new A-League team mooted to be based there. Wood is battling a thigh injury, and it would be both disappointing and interesting if the All Whites are without him. Or to put it another way, maybe the shock of running on the field without him will magically break the goal-scoring lethargy. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. On that note, Wood has come in for criticism from former striker Stan Collymore since his EPL transfer from Newcastle to Nottingham Forest. Collymore says modern rules should help a genuine centre forward like Wood, and claimed he was not throwing his body into the battle. China, meanwhile, will present mysterious opposition. They are ranked 80th in the world, to the All Whites’ 105, and appear to be a fairly young side of unknown, domestic players. The second game is three days later in Wellington.

All that money… England will need a minor miracle to get within 20 points of the title-chasing Irish, who have reached a new level under Andy Farrell. Ireland overcame adversity against Scotland, while England created it against France. They will try to bounce back from the humiliating defeat at Twickenham, but their lack of breakdown energy suggests it is a squad devoid of belief. Apart from that, there are also a few impressive Kiwis in the Irish backline to drool over, including bench halfback Jamison Gibson-Park whose form makes you wonder about the competency of the All Blacks development machine. He would walk into the All Blacks squad. Ireland's James Lowe in action. Photo / AP 1. NRL: Roosters v Rabbitohs, Friday, 10pm – Sky NRL grudge matches won’t come any better than this in 2023.

The Rabbitohs are the best side in the NRL to watch when they are in the mood, but playmaker Cody Walker can be niggled off his stride. Victor Radley and Kiwi enforcer Jared Waerea-Hargreaves are back from injury for the Roosters – look out for some tasty action involving the latter. This game pips the England-Ireland rugby test as the most tantalising sports watch of the weekend.

2023: गुजरात ने एक कांटे के मुकाबले में दिल्ली की टीम को हरा दिया है।","content":"वुमेन प्रीमियर लीग के 14वें मुकाबले में आज गुजरात जायंट्स के सामने दिल्ली कैपिटल्स की टीम थी। इस मैच में दिल्ली की टीम को गुजरात ने 11 रनों से हरा दिया। गुजरात जायंट्स ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए चार विकेट पर 147 रन बनाए। इसके जवाब में दिल्ली की टीम 18. 4 ओवर में एक 136 रन पर आउट हो गई। इस मैच में जीत का क्रेडिट एशली गार्डनर को जाता है। लॉरा वुलफार्ट और एशली गार्डनर के अर्धशतकों की मदद से गुजरात जायंट्स ने गुरुवार को यहां दिल्ली कैपिटल्स 11 रन से हराकर महिला प्रीमियर लीग (डब्ल्यूपीएल) में अपनी दूसरी जीत दर्ज की। दिल्ली की यह पांच मैचों में दूसरी हार है। गुजरात की तरफ से वुलफार्ट ने 45 गेंदों पर 57 रन बनाए जिसमें 6 चौके और एक छक्का शामिल है। गार्डनर ने 33 गेंदों पर 9 चौकों की मदद से नाबाद 51 रन की पारी खेली। इन दोनों ने तीसरे विकेट के लिए 81 रन की महत्वपूर्ण साझेदारी की। इनके अलावा हरलीन देओल ने 33 गेंदों पर 31 रन बनाए। दिल्ली की तरफ से जेस जॉनासन ने 38 रन देकर दो विकेट लिए। दिल्ली के चार बल्लेबाज ही दोहरे अंक में पहुंचे जिनमें मारिजान कैप ने सर्वाधिक 36 रन बनाए। अरुंधति रेड्डी ने आखरी ओवरों में 19 गेंद पर 25 रन बनाकर एक समय गुजरात के पेशानी पर बल ला दिए थे। गार्डनर ने गेंदबाजी में भी कमाल दिखाया और 19 रन देकर दो विकेट लिए। उनके अलावा किम गार्थ और तनुजा कंवर ने भी दो-दो विकेट हासिल किए। दिल्ली के सामने मुश्किल लक्ष्य नहीं था लेकिन उसने रन गति बनाए रखने के बावजूद नियमित अंतराल में विकेट गवांकर अपने लिए स्थिति जटिल कर दी थी। दिल्ली ने पहले 10 ओवर में 78 रन बनाए लेकिन इस बीच चार विकेट भी गंवाए। शेफाली वर्मा केवल 8 रन बना पाई और तनुजा कंवर (29 रन देकर दो विकेट) की गेंद पर बोल्ड हो गई। कप्तान मेग लैनिंग ने स्नेह राणा की गेंद पर आउट आउट होने से पहले 18 रन बनाए। गुजरात की हार के साथ आरसीबी की प्लेऑफ में पहुंच पाने की उम्मीद भी लगभग खत्म हो चुकी हैं। आरसीबी को प्लेऑफ में पहुंचने के लिए दिल्ली को गुजरात के खिलाफ ये मैच जीतना बहुत जरूरी था। लीग चरण में आरसीबी को जो सबसे अच्छा फिनिश मिल सकता है वह तीसरा स्थान है। वे एलिमिनेटर में तभी जगह बना सकते हैं जब: 1. आरसीबी अपने बाकी दोनों मैच जीते। 2. मुंबई और दिल्ली अपने मैच यूपी वारियर्स और गुजरात जायंट्स के खिलाफ जीत जाए। 3. गुजरात जायंट्स 20 मार्च को यूपी वारियर्स को हरा दे।","pubDate":"2023-03-16
