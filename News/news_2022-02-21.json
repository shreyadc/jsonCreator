This is the first match of Group C of the European Cricket League which has brought us plenty of drama, action and excitement so far. Ahmet Dursak, Rashid Mullahzada, Ali Cetin and Dawood Surkhi will be key for Zeytinburnu Zafer. Meanwhile, Prague CC Kings are likely to depend heavily upon Arun Ashokan, Sharan Sundareswaran Ramakrishnan, Sudesh Wickramasekera and Keyur Mehta. ZTB XI Ahmet Dursak, Rashid Mullahzada, Ali Cetin, Dawood Surkhi, Mehmet Onur Sert, Ulutuna Tunahan, Ahmad Elech, Qalander Abbas, Abdullhay Harry, Gokhan Alta, Mecit Zargar PCK XI Arun Ashokan, Sharan Sundareswaran Ramakrishnan, Sudesh Wickramasekera, Keyur Mehta, Hilal Ahmad, Suditha Udugala, Rohit Deshmoyni, Smit Patel-I, Sameera Maduranga, Laxminarayanan Selvan ZTB vs PCK, European Cricket League 2022, Match 1 Date and Time: 21st February, 2022, 1:30 PM IST Venue: Cartama Oval, Cartama Judging by previous games, the track seems to be a batting paradise. High scores are pretty common on this ground as the ball skids and comes on to the bat quite well. 120 could prove to be the par score at this venue and the side winning the toss should ideally opt to bat first. Wicketkeeper H Ahmad is a valuable choice for the wicket-keeper position in the Dream11 Fantasy Team. He will be looking for an important contribution to his side’s cause. Batters A Ashokan is a valuable batting all-rounder who can change the course of a game almost single-handedly. He has scored 212 runs from 10 games and also picked up one wicket in the last Prague T10. S Sundareswaran Ramakrishnan is another wonderful player who has scored 249 runs in 11 matches at a strike rate of over 150. He has also picked up seven wickets. All-rounders S Wickramasekera is an excellent player who’s like to fetch plenty of fantasy points. He has scored 299 runs and has also scalped five wickets in the Prague T10. He could prove to be a great multiplier choice for your ZTB vs PCK Dream11 Fantasy Team. K Mehta has picked up 11 wickets in 11 matches and his economy rate of 5.78 makes him a stellar choice. Bowlers S Maduranga is a great bowler who will be hoping to get into stride pretty quickly. S Wickramasekera (PCK) A Ashokan (PCK) S Sundareswaran Ramakrishnan (PCK) K Mehta (PCK) A Cetin (ZTB) S Wickramasekera: 51 runs and 1 wicket in last five matches A Ashokan: 83 runs and 1 wicket in last five matches S Sundareswaran Ramakrishnan: 56 runs in last five matches K Mehta: 2 wickets in last five matches Fantasy Suggestion #1: A Ashokan, S Sundareswaran Ramakrishnan, A Cetin, K Mehta, R Mullahzada, S Wickramasekera, D Surkhi, G Alta, S Maduranga Captain: S Wickramasekera , Vice-Captain: A Ashokan Fantasy Suggestion #2: A Ashokan, S Sundareswaran Ramakrishnan, K Mehta, R Mullahzada, S Wickramasekera, D Surkhi, G Alta, S Maduranga, A Hassan Sittar Captain: K Mehta , Vice-Captain: S Sundareswaran Ramakrishnan","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/02/3be09-16454233713802-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"MSC-W vs RAC-W Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11s and Pitch Report for Bengal Women’s T20 Blast, Match 30","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/msc-w-vs-rac-w-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11s-pitch-report-bengal-women-s-t20-blast-match-30?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Anjishnu Roy"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-21 07:33:00","full_description":"Mohammedan Sporting Club Women (MSC-W) will take on Rajasthan Club Women (RAC-W) in the 30th match of the Bengal Women’s T20 Blast at the Bengal Cricket Academy Ground in Kalyani on Monday. Both teams have already qualified for the semi-finals, making this clash a dead rubber. However, the two teams could experiment and try out different formations. Mohammedan Sporting Club have been exceptional in the competition, and are atop the points table with 28 points. Rajasthan Club, meanwhile, lost their previous match against Mohammedan Sporting Club, and could seek retribution. Mita Paul, Shrabani Swapan Paul, Bidisha Dey, Priyanka Bala, Sushmitha Ganguly, Tithas Sadhu, Tapati Paul, Swati Sah, Namita Mondal, Punam Soni, Payel Vakharia.

Match: MSC-W vs RAC-W, Bengal Women’s T20 Blast, Match 30. Date and Time: February 21, 2022; 1:00 PM IST. Venue: Bengal Cricket Academy Ground, Kalyani. It is difficult to score runs easily on this track. Batters will need to be patient and drop their anchor before taking on the bowlers. A score of 120 runs is expected to be par here. S Sumit Bishwas has been absolutely wonderful for Rajasthan. She has done a great job with the bat, scoring 226 runs in eight games at an average of 32.29. She’s currently the second-highest run-scorer in the tournament. D Gujjar is a decent player who can take on the opposition bowlers at any stage of games. She will be expected to play well again. M Paul is a fabulous all-rounder who has been at the top of her game in recent matches. She is the top scorer in the league with 298 runs from eight games at an average of 59.60. Paul is also the highest wicket-taker for her team, having picked up seven wickets. She could be an excellent multiplier choice for your MSC-W vs RAC-W Dream11 Fantasy team. Meanwhile, T Sadhu is another player you must have in your Dream11 Fantasy team. She has amassed 157 runs in eight innings, and has also scalped three wickets. A Halder is the best wicket-taker in the Bengal Women’s T20. She has scalped 15 wickets in eight games at an economy rate of 6.25. M Paul (MSC-W) – 654 points A Halder (RAC-W) – 536 points M Manik Mandal (RAC-W) – 458 points D Gujjar (RAC-W) – 455 points S Sumit Bishwas (RAC-W) – 428 points.

They will now fly to India to participate in a three-match T20I series starting from February 24 in Lucknow. Chasing 155, Sri Lanka lost two wickets in the powerplay but managed to get 54 runs off the first six overs. Mendis played a lot of shots in the start of the chase but dropped anchor after power-play ended. Charith Asalanka played some aggressive shots in a quickfire 9-ball 20. Mendis was involved in run-outs of debutants Kamil Mishara and Janith Liyanage. At 71/4 in nine overs, Sri Lanka were under a bit of pressure despite being ahead of the asking rate. Mendis then joined hands with skipper Dasun Shanaka (35) to resurrect the chase. The duo mixed caution with aggression nicely for an 83-run partnership. Shanaka pulled a monstrous six off Kane Richardson in the final over but was bowled the very next ball. There was no scope for a late twist in the match as Chamika Karunaratne hit the winning runs to vacant square leg to seal the match in Sri Lanka's favour with a ball to spare. Mendis remained unbeaten till the end and was adjudged 'Player of the Match'. Earlier, Matthew Wade's unbeaten effort of 43 off just 27 balls, combining big-hitting with some innovative strokes, meant Australia were able to go above 150 in their 20 overs.

In Delhi's Elite Group H contest against Tamil Nadu at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium, Dhull scored 113 off 202 balls, including 14 fours and a six, to continue his cricketing fairy tale.

This is where the journalism has gone.” Saha’s tweet came after he was excluded from the Test squad for the two-match Test series against Sri Lanka in March alongside Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ishant Sharma. During a virtual press conference, chief selector Chetan Sharma was asked about why Saha was not in the Test squad. Sharing his thoughts on the comments, former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan took to Twitter to write, “An honest coach Or someone just gives hope even after knowing that a player doesn’t fit in the scheme of things?

Trent Boult is set to miss the 2nd test against South Africa. New Zealand won the first test by an innings and 276 runs against South Africa in just two and a half days of play. The Kiwi pacers just dominated the South African team in the first test. South Africa bundled out for just 95 runs on the first day, whereas they managed to score just 111 runs in the second innings. The game will be played at Christchurch’s Hagley Oval only. This game is important for the Kiwi side as they would want to get those important World Test Championship points. Trent Boult to miss New Zealand vs South Africa second test Trent Boult missed the first test as his wife awaited the birth of their third child. It was likely that he will return to the second test, but it looks unlikely now. He will join the teammates for the nets, but he is not likely to take a load for the game. “[He] is not in a position to be available with his loads and where he’s at,” New Zealand coach Gary Stead said. “Since his wife has been having the baby he’s missed out on a lot of opportunities to play cricket and bowl. We just felt the risk of him playing was far too great at the moment.” Matt Henry replaced Trent Boult in New Zealand’s XI, and now has a higher score than him at No. 11 #NZvSA — ESPNcricinfo (@ESPNcricinfo) February 18, 2022 Matt Henry replaced Trent Boult in the first game, and he scalped seven wickets in the first innings. Stead had a lot of praise for Henry and believes he needed that opportunity. “He’s always been a good bowler and sometimes you need that opportunity to strike and make the most it,” Stead said. “He bowled beautifully throughout the Test but I thought the whole bowling unit bowled really well together. I thought that was one of the reasons we were so convincing.” Matt Henry has scalped 46 test wickets in 15 wickets, whereas he also has 98 ODI wickets under his name.

Australia finished their home-cricketing summer with a 4-1 T20I series win over Sri Lanka. After winning the Ashes by 4-0, the T20I series win made it a perfect summer for the Australians. Glenn Maxwell won the Man of the Series against Sri Lanka, whereas the bowlers also played their part. However, the form of Aaron Finch was a bit of concern. He managed to score just 78 runs in the five innings he played. According to the current schedule, Australia is scheduled to play just one T20I ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup. Aaron Finch went unsold in the IPL Auction, so there are not many T20 opportunities available for him at the moment. Matthew Wade calls Aaron Finch a “class player” Matthew Wade has said that he has no doubt over Finch’s form. Wade insists that there were a lot of questions regarding Warner ahead of the World Cup, but he won the Man of the Tournament award. “It feels like these questions have come before the last World Cup and after the first couple of games about David,” Wade said. “Everyone had their say about Davey and he got player of the tournament in the World Cup.” “Finchy’s a class player and I’ve heard people questioning where he’s at. He averages (close to) 40 and strikes at 140 for a reason. He’s a class player and he’s the captain of our team.” 11 of Aaron Finch’s last 16 innings in T20 internationals have come at a strike rate of less than 100.#AUSvSL — Nic Savage (@nic_savage1) February 18, 2022 Matthew Wade also said that he does not expect any changes at the top-order in the world cup. He believes David Warner and Aaron Finch will open for the side in the tournament. “The questions are always going to come when you get a little bit older and you don’t do well in one series. But they (Finch and Warner) are class players for a reason and the best we’ve had in T20 cricket ever,” Wade added. “I don’t expect any change at the top of the order to be honest. Those two will be there in the World Cup, I’m confident in that and when the big game comes, they will nail it.” The post “Those two will be there in the World Cup, I’m confident in that”: Matthew Wade believes Aaron Finch and David Warner will open at the T20 World Cup 2022 for Australia despite form issues appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-02-21 02:39:41","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Warner’s dream team win in comeback alongside legend","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/news/nsw/candice-warner-and-guy-leech-dream-team-in-big-win-in-double-ski/news-story/89e2405eb92dce4af359e1ed941c1a66","keywords":["NSW News and Photos","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Candice Warner’s return to competition after marriage to cricket star David Warner and three children continues to grow legs with the former ironwoman winning a double ski race as past of a surf life saving dream team.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-21 02:04:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Would've been different had they scored a ton in SA': Gavaskar on why Pujara, Rahane Test return will be 'difficult' - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMizQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC93b3VsZHZlLWJlZW4tZGlmZmVyZW50LWhhZC10aGV5LXNjb3JlZC1hLXRvbi1pbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2Etc3VuaWwtZ2F2YXNrYXItb24td2h5LWNoZXRlc2h3YXItcHVqYXJhLWFqaW5reWEtcmFoYW5lLXRlc3QtcmV0dXJuLXdpbGwtYmUtZGlmZmljdWx0LTEwMTY0NTM0OTUwNDc3OC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"'Would've been different had they scored a ton in SA': Gavaskar on why Pujara, Rahane Test return will be 'difficult'  Hindustan TimesRohit Sharma Named India Test Captain, Ajinkya Rahane & Pujara Dropped From Sri Lanka Series  India TodaySunil Gavaskar Assesses Rohit Sharma's Time As Team India Captain So Far | Cricket News  NDTVSports.comMichael Vaughan gives a two-word verdict on Rohit Sharma becoming India's new Test captain  Hindustan TimesFrom senior players being dropped to Sanju Samson's return: 3 talking points from India's squads for SL series  Times NowView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-21 01:35:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Double delight: Yash Dhull scores second 100, coach says he’s ready for India","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/double-delight-yash-dhull-scores-second-100-coach-says-hes-ready-for-india-371706","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Guwahati, February 20 Yash Dhull, captain of India's U-19 World Cup-winning team, capped a dream First-Class debut by scoring his second century of the match even as the Ranji Trophy Group H match between Delhi and Tamil Nadu ended in a draw here today.

India surpassed former T20 World Champions England who had 269 rating points to take the top spot. India was previously No. 1 in the format under Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s leadership from February 12, 2016 to May 3, 2016. Their last defeat came in the 2021 T20 World Cup group stage against New Zealand before winning their remaining three matches in the tournament against Afghanistan, Namibia and Scotland. After Virat Kohli’s stepped down from captaincy post the T20 World Cup 2021, skipper Rohit Sharma led India to series clean-sweeps over New Zealand and West Indies – guiding the side to nine consecutive wins in T20 international cricket. Meanwhile, Team India pacer Harshal Patel said that the dampness in the wicket made it difficult for his side to hold on to the landing area in the third and final T20I against West Indies, at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Suryakumar Yadav’s 65-run knock was backed up by a spirited bowling performance as India defeated West Indies by 17 runs in the third and final T20I. “We spoke about it after the powerplay (the line and length). The ball was holding on to the wicket and therefore we wanted to keep it a little fuller. Whenever we bowled shorter they had the time to sit back and pull it. We had the conversation that we want to bowl fuller,” said Harshal Patel after the game. “You have to have clarity on what you are going to bowl. Just focusing on the next delivery is important. There was a bit of dampness in the wicket because of the weather and it was making it difficult for us to hold on to the landing area. I don`t think there was a lot of dew,” he added. . .

Chasing 185, West Indies got off to the worst start possible as the visitors lost opening batter Kyle Mayers (6) on the fifth ball of the innings bowled by Deepak Chahar. In his next over, Chahar removed Shai Hope (8) and West Indies was reduced to 26/2 in the third over. Nicholas Pooran and Rovman Powell then got together at the crease and after powerplay overs, visitors’ score read 68/2. The 47-run stand for the third wicket was broken by Harshal Patel in the seventh over as he got the better of Powell (25). Venkatesh Iyer then got among the wickets as he got the prized scalp of skipper Kieron Pollard (5), and as a result, Windies were reduced to 82/4, still needing 103 runs to win. Pooran (61) and Romario Shephard (29) tried their best, but in the end, the task proved too much, and India registered a 17-run win.
