Defending champions Chennai Super Kings have suffered their fifth Indian Premier League 2022 loss; becoming only the second team to do so this season. While a fifth loss in sixth match is bound to hurt the second-best team in the history of the biggest T20 league across the world, CSK would be all the more hurt after losing a match which they should‚Äôve won. Not that Chennai posted a match-winning total after being put in to bat first by Gujarat Titans at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium tonight but had bowled exceedingly well to reduce the opposition to 48/4 in eight overs while defending a 170-run target. Super Kings, who have had issues with their death overs bowling this season, were found wanting in this department yet again as GT batter David Miller and stand-in captain Rashid Khan managed to score 48 runs in the last three overs to make Super Kings look absolutely clueless. Will CSK qualify for playoffs 2022? Currently at the ninth position on the points table, CSK are only above Mumbai Indians (six losses in as many matches). While their chances of qualifying for the playoffs are next to impossible, only a miraculous second half of IPL 2022 league phase can see them end up among the Top Four teams. In the general run of things, a team requires a minimum of eight victories to qualify for the playoffs of an IPL season. Historically, teams have qualified with seven wins as well but it only happens with a superior NRR (Net Run Rate).

Gujarat consolidated their lead at top with five wins out of 6 games played.Earlier, opener Ruturaj Gaikwad returned to run-scoring with an excellent half-century (73 off 48) and helped Chennai post 169-5 against Gujarat.

Lower down the order, Ravindra Jadeja (22 off 12) and Shivam Dube (19 off 17) also made valuable contributions with the bat for CSK. Invited to bat first, CSK didn't have a great start as Mohammed Shami struck in the third over of the innings to dismiss Uthappa, who tried to play across the line but was struck on the back leg. The onfield umpire ruled in favour of the batter but a successful review from Gujarat ended Uthappa's stay for 3 off 10.

During the 29th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings in Pune, Gujarat Titans beat Chennai Super Kings by 3 wickets with a ball to spare. Chasing a 170-run target, Titans had lost three wickets in the powerplay before eventually being reduced to 48/4 in eight overs. A lacklustre start to a chase in the absence of captain Hardik Pandya was far from an ideal scenario but batter David Miller delivered with his team in deep trouble. Coming in to bat at No. 5 in the fifth over, Miller scored a match-winning 39th T20 half-century, 11th in the IPL and first-ever for GT. A 37-ball 70-run partnership for the sixth wicket between Miller and stand-in captain Rashid Khan (40) turned the tables and how at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium tonight. From needing 112 runs in 10 overs to needing 48 in the last three, Miller and Rashid hit boundaries to all parts of the ground to seal an emphatic chase tonight. While Rashid hit two fours and three sixes at a strike rate of 190.47, Miller ended up with a magnificent 94* (51) comprising of eight fours and six sixes. Rashid, in particular, was ferocious against Chris Jordan to hit three sixes and a four in a game-changing 18th over. First team to collect 10 points this season, Gujarat has further strengthened their position at the top of the points table. Defending champions Super Kings, on the other hand, have become the second team to lose five IPL 2022 matches.

Miller finds the gap. This is full, right in the slot again. Jordan misses his length. This is whipped through square leg and it races away to the fence. 19.4 overs (1 Run) NO BALL IT IS! It is a bonus run and a Free Hit too! Just the 6 needed now! A high full toss around off, Miller swings, it goes off the outside edge and it is taken at short third man. Chennai are celebrating but it is taken upstairs to check. Replays show that it's above the waist and has not dipped enough. Is that out? Miller has edged a high full toss and is caught at short third man. The umpires get together and send the decision upstairs. It's a no ball for height. Free Hit loading now! 6 needed off 3 balls. Another meeting. This time Moeen and Bravo are discussing the plans with the bowler. Jordan is sweating. He is feeling the heat. 19.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! That is the reason why he did not take the run, that is right in the slot, poor bowling from Jordan. This is full and on the pads, Miller loves it there, he flicks it well over the backward square leg fence. 7 needed in 3. Another hit like that will do it. Jordan is the one under pressure. He has already gone for 50 in the 21 balls bowled by him. 19.2 overs (0 Run) Two dots in a row! Really good stuff from Jordan! The length is perfect, really full and on middle, this is jammed down to long on and Miller does not run. 19.1 overs (0 Run) A dot to begin! This is full and on the pads, Miller misses out. He looks to flick but misses to get hit on the pads. Dhoni does brilliantly to dive to his right and stop it. Who will bowl the final over? There is a confab going on with MS Dhoni calling the shots. 13 needed off 6 balls. Lockie Ferguson has walked in and is at the non-striker's end. Chris Jordan to bowl. Here we go... 18.6 overs (0 Run) OUT! Alzarri Joseph holes out! Doesn't matter much as David Miller will be on strike for the final over. This was a free hit for Joseph in a way, he tries his best but fails to clear the fence. Fuller and on off, Alzarri Joseph goes hard and lofts it towards long off. Chris Jordan speeds forward and takes a fine catch. Alzarri Joseph to bat. 18.5 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Rashid is gone and it's a sigh of relief for Chennai. Change in pace, slower one and on a length around off, Rashid runs down the track for a big shot but skies it in the air off the bottom part of his bat. Moeen moves across to his left from mid on and takes the catch at mid off. End of a scintillating cameo from the Gujarat skipper. 13 needed off 7 balls. 18.4 overs (2 Runs) Slower one, full and dipping in around leg, Rashid whips it to deep mid-wicket and picks up a couple. 13 needed off 8 balls. 18.3 overs (1 Run) Fuller in length and wide outside off, Miller drives it to deep cover for one. 18.2 overs (3 Runs) Heavy bottom hand this time! Too full, around off, Rashid flies the mini helicopter and sends it blazing down the ground. This time the long off fielder makes the stop and saves one run. 18.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! The Afghan is on fire! Picks the slower length ball around off early and smashes it over the bowler's head for a boundary, no chance for long off. 17.6 overs (2 Runs) Two more and that is 25 from the over! The game has turned on its head! Gujarat surely favouties now. The last ball is full and on the pads, this is worked through square leg for two. 17.5 overs (1 Run) Not sure what Rashid was trying to do there! A full toss outside off, Rashid looks to whip it over the leg side yet again, it goes off the top edge and it lands safely on the leg side. They take one. MS Dhoni is having a word with Chris Jordan now. 17.4 overs (6 Runs) SIX! KABOOM! This one is over the fence too! What a shot, what wrist work! Absolutely brilliant! This is outside off, on a length, Rashid brings his wrists into play and clobbers it over wide long on. 26 needed now in 14. Game is now in Gujarat's favour. 17.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Over mid off now! 16 from the first three balls and just 32 needed now in 15 balls. This is a full toss and it is hit over the mid off fielder for a boundary. 17.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX MORE! Rashid is now turning it on! 12 from the first two balls! This is an outrageous stroke! It is full and outside off, Rashid rockets it over point and it sails over the fence. 17.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! BANG! This is what Rashid can do and this is what was needed from him! What a hit! This was right in the arc. Full and on middle, Rashid whips it over the mid-wicket fence. Jordan is under pressure now. Change! Chris Jordan is back on. 16.6 overs (0 Run) In the end, it is a dot! A full toss, Miller was probably looking to carve it over short third man but misses. That is an outstanding over. 48 needed from 18 now. Rashid will face the first ball of the next over. 16.5 overs (1 Run) Just the one! A slower one on middle, this is swept through square leg for one. What will Miller look for now, will he go for a boundary or will he take a run? 16.4 overs (0 Run) A loud appeal but turned down! CHENNAI REVIEW! NOT OUT! It is off the bat! A yorker on middle, Rashid gets his bat down in time and jams it out. Bravo appeals as he feels it is off the pad. It is taken upstairs but Chennai end up losing a review. It is a dot though. 16.3 overs (1 Run) Just short! There should have been a better effort! Dube lost it in the lights! A slower one, on middle, this one holds in the surface. Miller looks to pull, it goes off the top edge, Dube at deep mid-wicket runs in but then stops. Takes it on the bounce, only one. Bravo is not pleased. 16.2 overs (1 Run) Almost drags it on! A slower one outside off, Khan looks to swing across the line, he gets an inside edge, it goes past the off pole and towards fine leg for one. 16.1 overs (1 Run) Miller gets off strike with a run! Just what Chennai wanted! Full and outside off, this is carved to deep point for one. 15.6 overs (1 Run) Wanted two but got only a run! A good comeback by Maheesh Theekshana! Shorter and on middle, this is pulled towards deep mid-wicket. Ravindra Jadeja fumbles, Miller thinks for the second run but is sent back. Never take any chance with Jadeja's bullet arm. 15.5 overs (1 Run) Just the one! Outside off, Khan slaps it through covers for one. 15.4 overs (0 Run) Right in the blockhole. Quick and straight at 103.7 kph, credit to Rashid for keeping it out safely. A dot now! Dots are gold! 15.3 overs (1 Run) Flatter and on off, Miller pushes it to covers for one. 8 from the first three. 15.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! BANG! That is a nothing delivery! It is short and on middle, asking to be hit. David Miller rocks back and hammers it over the mid-wicket fence for a biggie. 15.1 overs (1 Run) Flatter and shorter but outside off, this is dragged down to long on for one.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637858329304543466.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RR vs KKR Head to Head in IPL history: Rajasthan Royals vs Kolkata Knight Riders stats and records 2022 IPL","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-rr-vs-kkr-head-to-head-in-ipl-history-rajasthan-royals-vs-kolkata-knight-riders-stats-and-records-2022-ipl/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","KKR","Rajasthan Royals","Indian Premier League","Kolkata Knight riders","rajasthan royals","RR"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"RR vs KKR Head to Head in IPL history: The SportsRush presents for you the Head to Head statistics for IPL 2022 Match 30.

Another superb over from Jadeja. 9.5 overs (0 Run) Really good from Jadeja, despite bowling to two left-handers he is making it difficult for them to hit! Outside off, flatter, Miller looks to cut but it goes off the under-edge to short third man. 9.4 overs (1 Run) Just the one! Fuller and on middle, this is pushed down to long on for one. 9.3 overs (0 Run) Fired on the pads again, Rahul flicks it to mid-wicket. 9.2 overs (0 Run) On the pads, Rahul Tewatia looks to flick but misses to get hit on the pads. 9.1 overs (1 Run) On the pads, this is worked through square leg for one. Strategic break. Chennai are all over Gujarat like a rash. They have removed the cream of the Gujarat batting and are ruling the roost. The last recognized batters are in the middle and they will have to form a partnership and also take care of the asking rate which is hovering close to 11 now. Will we get to see the Killer Miller? Will Tewatia do a Tewatia again? Exciting times ahead. 8.6 overs (1 Run) Takes one now! On middle, this is pushed down to long on for one. 8.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Whacked! Miller makes room and Moeen goes fuller, this ends up being right in the slot, Miller smashes it to the long on fence. Really good shot and not an easy one on this surface. Miller needs to continue to attack. 8.4 overs (1 Run) Flatter and on off, Rahul pushes it down to long off for one. 8.3 overs (0 Run) Another one, nice and slow, and on off, defended. 8.2 overs (0 Run) Nicely bowled! Slows it up and tosses it up on off, this is blocked. 8.1 overs (1 Run) Slower through the air and on off, Miller goes back and pushes it through covers for one. Rahul Tewatia arrives very early in the middle. Also, Moeen Ali comes into the attack with two left-handers in the middle. 7.6 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! Saha departs. He needed to try something, he needed to get a few boundaries but falls in the attempt. This wicket though could well be a blessing in disguise for Gujarat. Not the best of deliveries from Jadeja, it is short and on the body, Saha pulls but does so straight to deep square leg. Ruturaj Gaikwad takes the catch safely. Gujarat slip further. 122 needed in 72 balls. 7.5 overs (1 Run) Just the one! Fires it on off, this one holds a bit on the surface. Miller pushes it to covers. 7.4 overs (0 Run) Probably tried to hit that way too hard! Shorter and on leg, Miller rocks back and looks to pull, he gets an inside edge onto the pads. 7.3 overs (0 Run) Well bowled! Sees Miller coming down the track and shortens the length. Miller looks to flick but misses to get hit on the pads. 7.2 overs (1 Run) A slight misfield! Flatter and on off, Saha comes down the track and pushes it towards covers. Shivam Dube dives over the ball and a run is taken. 7.1 overs (1 Run) Fires it on the pads, Miller works it through square leg for one. 6.6 overs (1 Run) The extra ball does not cost a lot! This is full and outside off, Miller looks to hit it hard through covers but he gets an under edge. The ball drops near the popping crease and they steal a quick single. Maheesh Theekshana is replaced in the attack by Ravindra Jadeja. 6.6 overs (1 Run) WIDE! The bowler did not like the call! This is full and wide outside off. Left alone. Wided. Probably the right call. 6.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Finds the gap! This is full and on the pads, poor delivery, easy pickings for Miller who flicks it through backward square leg and this one races away to the fence. 6.4 overs (0 Run) A yorker, on middle, Miller works it to mid-wicket. A dot. 6.3 overs (1 Run) Good length and around off, Saha waits and then guides it down to third man for one. 6.2 overs (0 Run) On middle, defended. Saha also needs to get a move on here. 6.1 overs (1 Run) A short one and on the body, this is pulled through square leg for one. Change in bowling. Mukesh Choudhary is back into the attack. 1/10 in his 2 overs so far. 5.6 overs (1 Run) A single to end the Powerplay and Chennai are on top after it. Gujarat are 37 for 3. On off, Miller looks to push it on the off side, this goes off the inner half towards short fine leg for one. 5.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! That's uppish but was hit like a rocket! On middle, fuller, Miller smashes it back towards the bowler. Maheesh Theekshana stretches his hands up but it sneaks through and races behind to find the fence. 5.4 overs (1 Run) On off, this is pushed towards cover for one. 5.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR BYES!

The 42-year-old, who retired from playing six years ago, takes over the role with immediate effect. It means Key will give up his work with Sky Sports, having carved out a successful media career in recent years. Key will be responsible for the strategy behind the England Men‚Äôs cricket teams and the performance pathways leading into them. He will also take a key role as part of the High Performance Review which will begin shortly. His first task will be to help appoint a new head coach and captain, after the depature of Joe Root earlier this week. Key said: ‚ÄúIt is an absolute honour to take up this role. \"The chance to have an impact and make a difference is an opportunity given to very few and I will give it everything I have to try shape the next great era of English Men‚Äôs cricket. ‚ÄúI have absolutely loved my time at Sky and I could never have imagined leaving were it not for this incredible opportunity. \"I‚Äôd like to personally thank Bryan Henderson and everyone in the team for their help and support. ‚ÄúAlthough at this current moment it has been a challenging time in English cricket, I also think it‚Äôs as exciting a time as I can remember. \"With two of our teams near or at the top of the world rankings and an undoubted amount of talent in our game, I hope to try and bring everyone along for the ride so we can all help take English Men‚Äôs cricket to new heights across all formats.‚Äù Prior to the appointment, Sir Andrew Strauss had undertaken the role on an interim basis following Ashley Giles‚Äô departure in February after three years. Key played 15 Tests for England and averaged 31.00, his finest honour coming when he scored a double hundred against the West Indies at Lord's in 2004. He captained Kent in two spells, helping the side win the County Championship Division 2 title in 2010 and reach three domestic finals. He was also part of the England side who won the Under-19 World Cup for the first and only time in 1998. Key has remained involved in the administration side of the game and has previously sat on the ECB‚Äôs Performance Cricket Committee. ECB chief executive officer Tom Harrison said: ‚ÄúFollowing a thorough recruitment process, Rob stood out in a very competitive field. \"His passion and knowledge of the game at domestic and international level is outstanding. \"He is a proven leader and combines an approachable nature with fresh, original thinking and resilience which will stand him in good stead. \"He will bring a lot to the role and I am sure players and staff alike will enjoy working with Rob. I have no doubt he will relish the challenge before us.‚Äù","image_url":"https://www.kentonline.co.uk/_media/img/330x0/743LJV8F7U3KRX5GDP31.jpg","source_id":"kentonline","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gujarat Titans vs Chennai Super Kings: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/gujarat-titans-vs-chennai-super-kings-live-score-over-match-29-t20-16-20-updates-2895860","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Gujarat Titans vs Chennai Super Kings from Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune.

It seems like there is bat involved. NOT OUT! INDEED THERE IS! Jadeja was pretty sure and hence, reviewed straightaway. Another successful review by Chennai! Rashid bowls this on off and this one turns back in. Jadeja looks to defend, but it goes closely past the inside edge and hits him on the flap of the front pad. The ball lobs over the keeper's head. They go for a run as there is an appeal from the bowler. The finger is raised. Jadeja reviews and the UltraEdge shows a spike.

Full and on off, this is hit down to long off for one. 17.5 overs (1 Run) Goes full and wide outside off, Dube carves it towards deep point for one. This is really good bowling, bowling to his field, as they say, making Dube hit towards the longer side. 17.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Finally, a boundary for Dube and Chennai! A welcome one. This one is short and angling away from middle, Dube manages to drag it, it is not off the middle of the bat but in the gap for a boundary in the wide long on region. 17.3 overs (1 Run) Just the single again!

Very unfortunate for Ruturaj Gaikwad, he had hit that really well! A low full toss on middle, Ruturaj Gaikwad goes down on one knee and plays the sweep shot towards deep square leg. Abhinav Manohar is stationed there and he takes an easy catch. A really good inning and a much-needed one for Ruturaj Gaikwad and Chennai. He though has fallen at the wrong time.

This looked dead. It is a full ball on middle, Dube looks to go downtown but misses and is struck on the back leg. A huge appeal and the finger is raised. A successful review from Dube. He survives to fight another day. 15.3 overs (1 Run) Just the one again! Fuller and on off, Ruturaj Gaikwad makes room and chips it towards long off for one. 15.2 overs (1 Run) Just the single!

Key, who has made 21 appearances for England and scored over 19,000 first-class runs, was chosen after a rigorous recruitment process. He will take up the role immediately, relinquishing his current role with broadcaster Sky Sports. \"Key will be responsible for the strategy behind the England Men's cricket teams and the performance pathways leading into them. He will also take a key role as part of the High-Performance Review which will shortly begin,\" the England Cricket Board (ECB) said in a press release. Prior to Key's appointment, Andrew Strauss had undertaken the role on an interim basis following Ashley Giles' departure in February after three years. Key played 21 times for England across all three formats including making a Test double hundred against the West Indies at Lord's in 2004 which led to him being named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2005. During a playing career that spanned three decades (1998-2015), Key amassed over 28,000 runs with 60 centuries. He captained Kent twice from 2006-2012 and then again from 2014-15. During his time as captain, the side won the County Championship Second Division title in 2010 and reached three white ball domestic finals. He was also part of the England side that won the Under-19 World Cup for the first and only time in 1998. After announcing his retirement in 2016, Key became a successful commentator for Sky Sports alongside writing a regular column for the Evening Standard. He has remained involved in the administration side of the game and has previously sat on the ECB's Performance Cricket Committee. Key said: \"It is an absolute honour to take up this role. The chance to have an impact and make a difference is an opportunity given to very few and I will give it everything I have to try and shape the next great era of English men's cricket. \"I have absolutely loved my time at Sky and I could never have imagined leaving were it not for this incredible opportunity. I'd like to personally thank Bryan Henderson and everyone in the team for their help and support. \"Although at this current moment it has been a challenging time in English cricket, I also think it's as exciting a time as I can remember. \"With two of our teams near or at the top of the world rankings and an undoubted amount of talent in our game, I hope to try and bring everyone along for the ride so we can all help take English men's cricket to new heights across all formats.\" Tom Harrison, ECB Chief Executive Officer said: \"Following a thorough recruitment process, Rob stood out in a very competitive field. His passion and knowledge of the game at the domestic and international level is outstanding. He is a proven leader and combines an approachable nature with fresh original thinking and resilience which will stand him in good stead. \"He will bring a lot to the role and I am sure players and staff alike will enjoy working with Rob. I have no doubt he will relish the challenge before us.\"","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pujara and Rizwan Sussex: C Pujara scores century on Sussex debut in County Championship 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-pujara-and-rizwan-sussex-c-pujara-scores-century-on-sussex-debut-in-county-championship-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","Cheteshwar Pujara","County Cricket","Mohammad Rizwan","Sussex"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pujara and Rizwan Sussex: Chesteshwar Pujara scored a brilliant century on his Sussex debut against Derbyshire in County Championship.

They cross for a run as the leggie attacks the ball. 7.5 overs (0 Run) A loud appeal for a caught behind but turned down! No review taken! The leg spinner, this lands on off and then spins away. Rayudu looks to defend but is beaten. The noise was of the bat hitting the pad. Rashid decides not to review after consulting his keeper. 7.4 overs (1 Run) This one stays a touch low!

The 2016 Twenty20 World Cup-winning all-rounder, 33, made his Birmingham & District Premier League debut for Knowle & Dorridge CC at the weekend. West Indies hero Carlos Brathwaite was out for a golden duck and had his car stolen on his English club cricket debut Credit: Getty ‚Äì Contributor Carlos Brathwaite was out for a golden duck on his English club cricket debut Brathwaite skied a long hop from the opposition spinner as he was caught on his first ball of the first match of the season But Brathwaite endured a disastrous Saturday afternoon on and off the pitch in the first game of the league season. The former Windies star ‚Äì who last represented his country in 2019 ‚Äì returned figures of 0/31 from just four overs in his first bowl for six months against Leamington CC. Brathwaite then scooped a long hop into the hands of a fielder from his FIRST BALL in English club cricket, as he was out for a golden duck. The all-rounder later revealed he also had his CAR STOLEN . Reflecting on his bizarre afternoon, Brathwaite tweeted: ‚ÄúWhat a day yesterday‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFirst time bowling in a game after injury for six months‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFirst ball duck from a long hop‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCar stolen‚Ä¶‚Äù However, Brathwaite was in remarkably good spirits despite his shocking Saturday. On Easter Sunday morning, he continued: ‚ÄúBut you know what, woke up this morning, Sun is shining and giving thanks. ‚ÄúHappy Easter to all.‚Äù Brathwaite took to the field for Knowle & Dorridge having signed for the county T20 side Birmingham Bears last year. The club had huge hopes for their overseas pro ‚Äì even calling themselves ‚ÄòThe Home of Carlos Brathwaite‚Äô on their social media. But after coming into the attack as fourth-change bowler, Brathwaite failed to show why he was such a huge part of the Windies squad during the 2010s. The all-rounder was knocked around the park as he went at 7.75 runs per over from four wicketless sets of six. Having famously smashed Ben Stokes for four sixes in a row to win the 2016 T20 World Cup final, K&D fans were itching to see Brathwaite with the bat. Chasing just 228 to win from their 50 overs, Brathwaite came in at No5, with the score 76-3. However, the explosive hitter went after Leamington spinner Dinuk da Silva with his first ball. Da Silva threw down a rank long hop, which Brathwaite horribly mis-timed, spooning it up into the air. K&D eventually ended up losing by 12 runs after slipping to 212 all out with just one ball to spare.

The return of Hardik Pandya will certainly impact the run of Gujarat Titans in IPL 2022.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PBKS vs SRH Highlights, IPL 2022: Pooran-Markaram guide Hyderabad home - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9pcGwtMjAyMi1wYmtzLXZzLXNyaC1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXB1bmphYi1raW5ncy12cy1zdW5yaXNlcnMtaHlkZXJhYmFkLXQyMC1tYXRjaC0yOC1saXZlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMTAxNjUwMTc4MzEwNzc0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PBKS vs SRH Highlights, IPL 2022: Pooran-Markaram guide Hyderabad home¬†¬†Hindustan TimesRevealed: Why Mayank Agarwal Isn't Playing Today For Punjab Kings Against Sunrisers Hyderabad¬†¬†Cricket AddictorLive Cricket Score - PBKS vs SRH, Match 28, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzMayank doing better, ready to be back: Shikhar Dhawan¬†¬†The Indian ExpressHighlights IPL 2022, PBKS vs SRH Match 28: Umran Malik Shines; Sunrisers Hyderabad Beat Punjab Kings By 7 Wic¬†¬†India.comView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-17 14:07:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, Punjab Kings vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Highlights: Umran Malik's final-over heroics seal fourth wi - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMi1wFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9pcGwvdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvaXBsLTIwMjItcHVuamFiLWtpbmdzLXZzLXN1bnJpc2Vycy1oeWRlcmFiYWQtaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy11bXJhbi1tYWxpa3MtZmluYWwtb3Zlci1oZXJvaWNzLXNlYWwtZm91cnRoLXdpbi1vbi10aGUtdHJvdC1mb3Itc3JoL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkwODk2NTk0LmNtc9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, Punjab Kings vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Highlights: Umran Malik's final-over heroics seal fourth wi¬†¬†Times of IndiaWatch: 4 Wickets And No Run In Dramatic Final Over Bowled By Umran Malik In IPL 2022¬†¬†NDTV Sports'Facing Umran in nets is a nightmare.

Ruturaj Gaikwad and Robin Uthappa are the Chennai openers and it is going to be Mohammad Shami to begin proceedings with the ball. Here we go... Stephen Fleming, the head coach of Chennai, comes up for a quick word. The Kiwi says that they are trying to stay calm as the start has not been ideal. Tells that they have worked hard and have a few new faces in the team. Feels that the last win was important which can drive them forward but they still have a lot of work to do. Adds that they certainly have the determination. Admits they have a lot of work still to do as there are teams that are looking better than them but he hopes they can do well from here on. On working with Jadeja, Fleming replies that MS Dhoni is still a big part of the leadership and his job is to provide the information and give freedom to the new captain. Update - Hyderabad have registered an easy win against Punjab by 7 wickets with more than one over to spare. With four wins in a row, Hyderabad now enter the top four. Ravindra Jadeja, the captain of Chennai, says that they would have bowled as well but the pitch looks good and they would now look to put a good total on the board and later defend it. Tells that the atmosphere in the team is positive and everyone is happy. Shares that they spent their off time practising and training. Informs that they are unchanged. Rashid Khan, the stand-in skipper of Gujarat, starts by sharing that Hardik Pandya has a little bit of stiffness and they don't want to take risks with him. Hopes he will be back for their next game. Mentions it is like a dream captaining the side and he will give his 100 per cent. Informs about a couple of changes - Wriddhiman Saha comes in for Matthew Wade and Alzarri Joseph replaces Hardik. Chennai (Unchanged Playing XI) - Ruturaj Gaikwad, Robin Uthappa, Moeen Ali, Ambati Rayudu, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja (C), MS Dhoni (WK), Dwayne Bravo, Chris Jordan, Maheesh Theekshana, Mukesh Choudhary. Gujarat (Playing XI) - Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha (WK) (In for Matthew Wade), Vijay Shankar, Abhinav Manohar, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan (C), Mohammad Shami, Lockie Ferguson, Alzarri Joseph (In for Hardik Pandya), Yash Dayal. Toss - Big breaking! Hardik Pandya is unwell and RASHID KHAN IS LEADING GUJARAT! The Afghan is in the middle along with Ravindra Jadeja. Up goes the coin and it falls in favour of Rashid. GUJARAT ELECT TO FIELD! Latest - Wriddhiman Saha and Alzarri Joseph are all set to make their debut for Gujarat. Update from Match 28 - Hyderabad are comfortably placed in their chase against Punjab. They need another 55 runs in 7 overs to secure their 4th win in a row. Can they do it with ease or is there some drama in store? While we wait for the toss here, you can keep shuffling the tabs and follow that match as well. At the moment, with the result of the ongoing game not out, Gujarat are the table-toppers and would be keen to keep their spot up top with a thumping show against Chennai. Their batting is one area that has shown some vulnerability and the Yellow team will look to exploit the loopholes. The 4-time champions, on the other hand, recently tasted their first success of the season after four flop shows and would like to build on that victory. Unlike their opponents, Chennai's bowling has been an area of worry and could be targeted by the big hitters of Gujarat. This is setting up to be a mouth-watering clash. Welcome, folks! The first game of Super Sunday is still going on but it's time for us to shift our attention to the second match, coming up this evening in Pune. Hardik's Gujarat versus Jadeja's Chennai - that's the contest. Two of the best all-rounders in the country will be crossing swords, both new in their role as the captain of the ship, but one has taken it like a duck to water while the other is learning it the hard way. Individually, both Jadeja and Pandya can do wonders with both bat and ball, but let's see how they lead their troops this evening. Stay tuned for more... ...
