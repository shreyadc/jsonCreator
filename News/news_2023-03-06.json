This was Sri Lanka’s only warm-up game ahead of the two match Test series against New Zealand that gets underway on Thursday in Christchurch. Sri Lanka had declared on 274 for four after the top and middle order batters had spent some useful time in the middle and New Zealand Board XI were 141 for one at stumps on day one. Not a single ball was bowled yesterday due to heavy rain and play was called off early. Kusal Mendis smashed a quick-fire 95 that came off 87 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. Mendis shared a 162 runs stand with Oshada Fernando, who opened batting and made 78. All Sri Lanka’s batters spent useful time in the middle before the innings was declared. Angelo Mathews batted at number four and made 38 off 67 balls while Dinesh Chandimal scored 35 off 45 balls. Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella didn’t get a chance to bat. Sri Lanka’s top seven is pretty much settled and they are unlikely to make any changes to the batting unit and it’s the bowling attack they need to figure out. Quicks Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando and Lahiru Kumara bowled some decent spells and Kumara was the only wicket taker. Sri Lanka are likely to play only three quicks in the Test series but some feel that they are better off with all four quicks in with Dhananjaya de Silva being the lone spinner. The selectors are unlikely to follow that bold step. The Test series is viral for Sri Lanka as a 2-0 series win will give them a slot in the World Test Championship final later this year at The Oval during the English summer. But it’s quite a tough task as in the history Sri Lanka have been to New Zealand on ten Test tours and have just won two Tests. Unlike in white ball cricket, the Test team has been far more consistent and the ability of fast bowlers to run through sides has been a notable feature. The teams will move to north island for the second Test with Basin Reserve in Wellington hosting the game. It was at this venue Sri Lanka won the 2006 Test with Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva scoring hundreds. Muttiah Muralitharan claimed a match bag of ten wickets. It was also at the Basin Reserve Aravinda de Silva produced his career best 267 during the 1991 tour. In the same game Martin Crowe was dismissed for 299. Published on By Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year. Curran took 4 for 29 in the second ODI against Bangladesh on Friday, including a devastating burst of 3 for 19 in five overs with the new ball, as England sealed the series with one game to play. He also struck 33 off 19 with the bat to provide a timely reminder of his all-round abilities in the format where he has most struggled to pin down a regular spot. With Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer rested after the first match of the series, England were able to call on Curran and Saqib Mahmood, who was making his first international appearance since his Test debut in the Caribbean a year ago, having recovered from a back stress fracture. England could also select another World Cup-winner in Mark Wood, while Reece Topley and Olly Stone – who missed the tour of Bangladesh due to being part of the Test squad out in New Zealand – have recently returned to contention after injury problems. Throw in the likes of David Willey, Brydon Carse, Matthew Potts and Luke Wood, and England can hope to have a strong pool of seamers to pick from for the World Cup. “It is a quality squad at the moment,” Curran said. “There are a lot of guys who have been on the Test tour who will come back in. Any time you play in a team for England you want to put in a performance but it shows we’ve got a great squad with Jof, Woakes, Woody being back now as well. “Everyone has had a tough year with injuries and everyone is pleased to see the quality of the bowlers we have around. You saw how great the Test team were bowling as well. “It is an exciting time and hopefully we can give the captain and coach some good decisions to make but right now I’m sure the bowlers just want to keep performing and be in that 15 for the World Cup. Conditions will dictate if there is extra pace or extra spin, so it is about enjoying it and not putting on too much pressure.” Curran was Player of the Tournament when England lifted the T20 World Cup in Australia last year, carving out a well-defined role as one of the side’s go-to death bowlers during the lead-up to the competition. His left-arm angle, ability to swing the new ball and then fall back on his variations later in the innings – not to mention his hyper-aggressive approach with the bat – should make him a strong candidate to be part of the group in India, where he has a wealth of IPL experience. His overall record in ODIs remains underwhelming, with 24 wickets in 22 appearances at an average of 37.29. In 2022, that blew out to four wickets at 72.65, having been largely used at first or second change; but in Mirpur he took the new ball for only the second time in 12 appearances and promptly produced his second-best figures (his maiden five-for, against Sri Lanka in 2021, also came when opening the bowling). “It is a nice time to bowl as a seam bowler because you get swing and movement but it is tricky as well because you have to be on the money and start really well because the white ball doesn’t swing for that long,” Curran said. “In these conditions, your cutters, your slower balls and cross-seam deliveries may become useful as well. It is about adjusting and seeing what is in front of you. (cricinfo) Published on By Coming to the annual Big Match as underdogs, Ananda needed their inexperienced batting lineup to produce something special to be on par with their arch-rivals. Kithma Sithmal and Kanchana de Livera stood out for them producing just that as their vital knocks in the first innings helped them salvage pride against Nalanda at the annual encounter that ended in a draw at the SSC ground yesterday. In reply to Nalanda’s 280 for five wickets declared, Ananda posted 235 runs thanks largely to the batting efforts of Kithma Sithmal and Kanchana de Livera. Sithmal anchored the fragile batting lineup with a valiant knock of 90 runs. Livera departed after an aggressive knock of 43 runs which included seven fours. From then on Sithmal took it upen his shoulders to anchor the innings. His 184-ball innings helped Ananda survive for 87 overs and avoid the danger of being enforced the follow on as others failed to top 20 runs. He was also the beneficiary of two costly fielding mishaps. However, his marathon innings left only a session for the two teams to battle it out in the second innings. For the second time in the match, Nalanda declared their innings for the loss of five wickets. They had a lead of 166 runs. Chasing a rather unlikely target Ananda were 22 for two wickets at stumps. For Nalanda Eranga Jayakodige did well in the batting department top scoring with 83 runs. After they were put to bat Nalanda lost three wickets but the middle order lived up to their reputation to post their eventual total. Published on By Alex Carey admitted he feared the worst after Rohit Sharma was given two lives in the first over of the Indore Test when Australia opted not to review for a nick and an lbw, but was delighted to play his part in ensuring the India captain did not inflict major damage. Carey’s stumping of Rohit in the sixth over, Matt Kuhnemann’s first wicket of the match, was picked out as a key moment by head coach Andrew McDonald who lauded Carey’s glovework on a tough pitch for wicketkeeping. Having beaten Rohit with one which spun sharply to beat the edge, Kuhnemann then drew him down the pitch and another ragging delivery presented Carey with a stumping opportunity but he had to navigate some significant bounce to ensure the dismissal was completed. “Instinct takes over when you see a ball bounce like that,” Carey said. “I don’t think many of us were expecting an eight-degree turning ball that early in the game. But it was nice to hold onto that and for us to get a bit of momentum. “Once the big screen showed the nick [in the first over], I thought he [Rohit] might have settled in for a nice 150 or something like that. It was challenging conditions throughout the match, but it was nice to get that one away and for us to get on a bit of a roll after that.” Carey was exceptional with the gloves throughout the match, conceding just three byes on a surface with uneven bounce, and has been impressive all series. Conditions in Indore were comparable to those he faced in the first Test in Galle last year when he was struck on the helmet by a Nathan Lyon delivery that exploded off the surface. It continued the development of his keeping after some initial struggles on the low surfaces in Pakistan last year and a handful of missed chances early in his Test career. This time, he had some bruises on his shoulders to show for his efforts. “It’s fun being out there, it’s challenging for everyone, and it’s great to be on the right end of this one,” he said. “Balls are going to explode off lengths and even Starcy bowled a half volley that exploded up, so you’re out there reacting to what you see. “In terms of our sundries, it was nice to reduce those and it can turn out to be an extra batter at times. You don’t really think about it at the time, you probably think back and go ‘that was pretty good’, but a few nice little bruises as well just to get the body behind it.” Australia lower-order struggles Though Australia got over the line outstandingly in Indore, they did suffer another collapse, losing 6 for 11 on the second day when there was a more substantial lead in the offing. It continued a trend where the lower order has struggled to contribute, an area in which India have excelled, with Pat Cummins’ 33 in Delhi the only significant score among the bowlers. From No. 8 onwards, India’s have scored 307 runs at 25.58 in the series compared to Australia’s 84 and 4.94. In Australia’s defence, conditions have been extremely tough, especially in Delhi and Indore, even for top-order batters. Axar Patel could easily command a place higher up the order, and his position at No. 8 or 9 highlights India’s batting depth. Even in the third Test when it ultimately did not make a difference, while Cheteshwar Pujara and Axar were together, there was a chance Australia could have had a much tougher chase. “I think it’s one of those things where it’s so hard to start for any player, so we’re asking guys to play in different environments,” Carey said. “I think if we go out and try to slog and get a few runs that way [and] if it goes pear-shaped, we’re happy to live with that. If they go out and try to survive for the [top-order] batter, we know that there’s a ball with their name on it. “We know that we haven’t given enough with the tail. We also understand that India’s batting line-up is very, very strong. So they bat all the way down to No. 10 really. We’ll have those conversations about how we can navigate and try to get 10-15 runs each more.” Carey himself also knows he needs to contribute more after four low scores following his 36 in Nagpur. “I had some confidence out of the first game and then getting out defending [in Indore]. Am I happy with that? Not really,” he said. “So back my strength and try to score with the sweeps and manipulate a little bit more that way. Looking forward to another opportunity in Ahmedabad and get down and maybe get the broom out again.”","pubDate":"2023-03-06 00:01:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sam Curran eager to state World Cup case as competition ramps up","link":"http://island.lk/sam-curran-eager-to-state-world-cup-case-as-competition-ramps-up/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Thilina Walpola"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year.

Looking forward to another opportunity in Ahmedabad and get down and maybe get the broom out again.” Published on By Historic tweets from Michael Vaughan took centre stage on the third day of the ECB’s racism hearings, as the former England captain denied having made the statement that forms the core of the ECB’s charge of bringing the game into disrepute. As he has done publicly before, Vaughan emphatically denied ever having said, “There’s too many of you lot, we need to have a word about that” to Azeem Rafiq, Adil Rashid, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Ajmal Shahzad at a T20 game in June 2009. The ECB’s charge stems from Rafiq’s recollection of the remark which was, on Thursday, supported by the testimony of Rashid. Vaughan, appearing at the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) hearing in London, said of the day in question that he had “a very clear mind about back in 2009” and that he knew he did not say what had been alleged. He added that he would never have gone on to the field and said something to team-mates that could “put them in a bad state of mind” before the game. “Knowing me in 2009, that’s not the sort of thing I would’ve said.” Vaughan was questioned by the ECB’s lead counsel Jane Mulcahy KC for nearly 90 minutes, during which she argued that some historical tweets of his were “remarkably similar in tone” to the alleged remarks. Vaughan said the tweets were unacceptable and that he had apologised for them before and would continue to do so. But he disagreed with the suggestion that they were similar in tone. Mulcahy pointed out that both Rafiq and Rashid claimed Vaughan likely made the alleged comment as a “bad joke” and said the tweet was similar in tone because it was “lighthearted but offensive”. Asked if he agreed, Vaughan said: “No.” Vaughan said he was “disgusted” with the tweets. “I apologised for them. I put myself on an online course, Inclusion. I wanted to lead the game in knowing how to lead in modern times. The tweets are disgusting, awful, and other words you could use. But the most important thing is I have said sorry and I am learning from them. As I say, if I get things wrong in my life, I stick my hands up.” He went back to his recollection of the day of the game – which he has written about in his memoir – that he “could not have been more proud [of] four Asian players, three of whom had come through the system.” Vaughan was also questioned about his meeting with Rafiq in November 2021 saying he felt the need for it because “the whole situation was escalating out of control”. Vaughan said he was apologetic in the meeting with Rafiq because he was “disgusted” by what Rafiq had to go through at Yorkshire but did not accept he made the alleged comment. Vaughan said that the CDC hearing was a “terrible look” for cricket. “It’s not been easy for anybody. This is not the right process to deal with word-against-word comments from 14 years ago. Ex-team-mates fighting it out over hearsay is a terrible look for the game and a really bad look on how cricket has dealt with this situation.” Earlier in the morning, scrutiny fell on the ECB’s scope in the investigation of the incident as well as the rigour deployed, with Meena Botros, its director of legal and integrity, facing a three-hour grilling from Christopher Stoner, Vaughan’s lawyer. The line of questioning took in a recent interview with Lord Kamlesh Patel, the outgoing Yorkshire chair, in Eastern Eye. In it the claim was made that the ECB had “urged” Lord Patel to “get rid of people” at the county when he took over. Talking about his role, Patel said: “I was asked by the ECB to meet a set of criteria that most people would have winced at, would have thought there’s no way we can deliver this, and I delivered it. “I was asked by the ECB to work with them to create a framework and an environment where we would prove to the world that we want a non-racist institution, and I did all that. I was asked by the ECB to ensure some people who were there from the previous regime did not take part in that governance process, very clear about that.” Stoner suggested those comments showed that the ECB was “actively involved” in the Yorkshire investigation, in breach of the process as described in Botros’ witness statement, that the ECB remained independent of action being taken by one of its counties in such matters. Botros said he couldn’t talk about what Lord Patel had said but insisted that Stoner was “mistaking” the ECB’s regulatory function in getting involved, from its other roles in such cases. Stoner pointed to Botros’s witness statement which read: “In its capacity as a regulator, the ECB must remain independent of action being taken by one of its member first-class county clubs.” “That’s just not what happened, is it?” Stoner asked. Botros replied: “It is what happened.” Stoner then zeroed in on the day Vaughan is alleged to have made the remark, questioning whether the ECB could and should have gone further in its investigations of events. He confirmed with Botros that the only players the ECB had spoken to about the incident were Adil Rashid and Ajmal Shahzad. Stoner asked why all Yorkshire players that day weren’t spoken to. Botros said the ECB “did speak to the individuals where we were able to” but that “certain individuals either didn’t want to take part or engage”, or that the ECB “weren’t able” to get contact details for others. Stoner also asked Botros why the on-field umpires that day had not been contacted by the ECB for their version of events. “There is no suggestion that the umpires were close enough to hear it,” Botros replied. Botros added that if it was such an important point, Vaughan’s team could have taken it on themselves. The hearing is scheduled to end next Tuesday.

Published on By There was much disappointment for Sri Lanka’s players as the entire day two’s play of their warm-up game against New Zealand Board XI at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln was called off due to rain yesterday. This was Sri Lanka’s only warm-up game ahead of the two match Test series against New Zealand that gets underway on Thursday in Christchurch. Sri Lanka had declared on 274 for four after the top and middle order batters had spent some useful time in the middle and New Zealand Board XI were 141 for one at stumps on day one. Not a single ball was bowled yesterday due to heavy rain and play was called off early. Kusal Mendis smashed a quick-fire 95 that came off 87 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. Mendis shared a 162 runs stand with Oshada Fernando, who opened batting and made 78. All Sri Lanka’s batters spent useful time in the middle before the innings was declared. Angelo Mathews batted at number four and made 38 off 67 balls while Dinesh Chandimal scored 35 off 45 balls. Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella didn’t get a chance to bat. Sri Lanka’s top seven is pretty much settled and they are unlikely to make any changes to the batting unit and it’s the bowling attack they need to figure out. Quicks Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando and Lahiru Kumara bowled some decent spells and Kumara was the only wicket taker. Sri Lanka are likely to play only three quicks in the Test series but some feel that they are better off with all four quicks in with Dhananjaya de Silva being the lone spinner. The selectors are unlikely to follow that bold step. The Test series is viral for Sri Lanka as a 2-0 series win will give them a slot in the World Test Championship final later this year at The Oval during the English summer. But it’s quite a tough task as in the history Sri Lanka have been to New Zealand on ten Test tours and have just won two Tests. Unlike in white ball cricket, the Test team has been far more consistent and the ability of fast bowlers to run through sides has been a notable feature. The teams will move to north island for the second Test with Basin Reserve in Wellington hosting the game. It was at this venue Sri Lanka won the 2006 Test with Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva scoring hundreds. Muttiah Muralitharan claimed a match bag of ten wickets. It was also at the Basin Reserve Aravinda de Silva produced his career best 267 during the 1991 tour. In the same game Martin Crowe was dismissed for 299. Published on By Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year. Curran took 4 for 29 in the second ODI against Bangladesh on Friday, including a devastating burst of 3 for 19 in five overs with the new ball, as England sealed the series with one game to play. He also struck 33 off 19 with the bat to provide a timely reminder of his all-round abilities in the format where he has most struggled to pin down a regular spot. With Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer rested after the first match of the series, England were able to call on Curran and Saqib Mahmood, who was making his first international appearance since his Test debut in the Caribbean a year ago, having recovered from a back stress fracture. England could also select another World Cup-winner in Mark Wood, while Reece Topley and Olly Stone – who missed the tour of Bangladesh due to being part of the Test squad out in New Zealand – have recently returned to contention after injury problems. Throw in the likes of David Willey, Brydon Carse, Matthew Potts and Luke Wood, and England can hope to have a strong pool of seamers to pick from for the World Cup. “It is a quality squad at the moment,” Curran said. “There are a lot of guys who have been on the Test tour who will come back in. Any time you play in a team for England you want to put in a performance but it shows we’ve got a great squad with Jof, Woakes, Woody being back now as well. “Everyone has had a tough year with injuries and everyone is pleased to see the quality of the bowlers we have around. You saw how great the Test team were bowling as well. “It is an exciting time and hopefully we can give the captain and coach some good decisions to make but right now I’m sure the bowlers just want to keep performing and be in that 15 for the World Cup. Conditions will dictate if there is extra pace or extra spin, so it is about enjoying it and not putting on too much pressure.” Curran was Player of the Tournament when England lifted the T20 World Cup in Australia last year, carving out a well-defined role as one of the side’s go-to death bowlers during the lead-up to the competition. His left-arm angle, ability to swing the new ball and then fall back on his variations later in the innings – not to mention his hyper-aggressive approach with the bat – should make him a strong candidate to be part of the group in India, where he has a wealth of IPL experience. His overall record in ODIs remains underwhelming, with 24 wickets in 22 appearances at an average of 37.29. In 2022, that blew out to four wickets at 72.65, having been largely used at first or second change; but in Mirpur he took the new ball for only the second time in 12 appearances and promptly produced his second-best figures (his maiden five-for, against Sri Lanka in 2021, also came when opening the bowling). “It is a nice time to bowl as a seam bowler because you get swing and movement but it is tricky as well because you have to be on the money and start really well because the white ball doesn’t swing for that long,” Curran said. “In these conditions, your cutters, your slower balls and cross-seam deliveries may become useful as well. It is about adjusting and seeing what is in front of you. (cricinfo) Published on By Alex Carey admitted he feared the worst after Rohit Sharma was given two lives in the first over of the Indore Test when Australia opted not to review for a nick and an lbw, but was delighted to play his part in ensuring the India captain did not inflict major damage. Carey’s stumping of Rohit in the sixth over, Matt Kuhnemann’s first wicket of the match, was picked out as a key moment by head coach Andrew McDonald who lauded Carey’s glovework on a tough pitch for wicketkeeping. Having beaten Rohit with one which spun sharply to beat the edge, Kuhnemann then drew him down the pitch and another ragging delivery presented Carey with a stumping opportunity but he had to navigate some significant bounce to ensure the dismissal was completed. “Instinct takes over when you see a ball bounce like that,” Carey said. “I don’t think many of us were expecting an eight-degree turning ball that early in the game. But it was nice to hold onto that and for us to get a bit of momentum. “Once the big screen showed the nick [in the first over], I thought he [Rohit] might have settled in for a nice 150 or something like that. It was challenging conditions throughout the match, but it was nice to get that one away and for us to get on a bit of a roll after that.” Carey was exceptional with the gloves throughout the match, conceding just three byes on a surface with uneven bounce, and has been impressive all series. Conditions in Indore were comparable to those he faced in the first Test in Galle last year when he was struck on the helmet by a Nathan Lyon delivery that exploded off the surface. It continued the development of his keeping after some initial struggles on the low surfaces in Pakistan last year and a handful of missed chances early in his Test career. This time, he had some bruises on his shoulders to show for his efforts. “It’s fun being out there, it’s challenging for everyone, and it’s great to be on the right end of this one,” he said. “Balls are going to explode off lengths and even Starcy bowled a half volley that exploded up, so you’re out there reacting to what you see. “In terms of our sundries, it was nice to reduce those and it can turn out to be an extra batter at times. You don’t really think about it at the time, you probably think back and go ‘that was pretty good’, but a few nice little bruises as well just to get the body behind it.” Australia lower-order struggles Though Australia got over the line outstandingly in Indore, they did suffer another collapse, losing 6 for 11 on the second day when there was a more substantial lead in the offing. It continued a trend where the lower order has struggled to contribute, an area in which India have excelled, with Pat Cummins’ 33 in Delhi the only significant score among the bowlers. From No. 8 onwards, India’s have scored 307 runs at 25.58 in the series compared to Australia’s 84 and 4.94. In Australia’s defence, conditions have been extremely tough, especially in Delhi and Indore, even for top-order batters. Axar Patel could easily command a place higher up the order, and his position at No. 8 or 9 highlights India’s batting depth. Even in the third Test when it ultimately did not make a difference, while Cheteshwar Pujara and Axar were together, there was a chance Australia could have had a much tougher chase. “I think it’s one of those things where it’s so hard to start for any player, so we’re asking guys to play in different environments,” Carey said. “I think if we go out and try to slog and get a few runs that way [and] if it goes pear-shaped, we’re happy to live with that. If they go out and try to survive for the [top-order] batter, we know that there’s a ball with their name on it. “We know that we haven’t given enough with the tail. We also understand that India’s batting line-up is very, very strong. So they bat all the way down to No. 10 really. We’ll have those conversations about how we can navigate and try to get 10-15 runs each more.” Carey himself also knows he needs to contribute more after four low scores following his 36 in Nagpur. “I had some confidence out of the first game and then getting out defending [in Indore]. Am I happy with that? Not really,” he said. “So back my strength and try to score with the sweeps and manipulate a little bit more that way. Looking forward to another opportunity in Ahmedabad and get down and maybe get the broom out again.”","pubDate":"2023-03-05 23:40:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Carey: ‘Was nice to reduce sundries; they can turn out to be extra batter at times’","link":"http://island.lk/carey-was-nice-to-reduce-sundries-they-can-turn-out-to-be-extra-batter-at-times/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Thilina Walpola"],"video_url":null,"description":"Alex Carey admitted he feared the worst after Rohit Sharma was given two lives in the first over of the Indore Test when Australia opted not to review for a nick and an lbw, but was delighted to play his part in ensuring the India captain did not inflict major damage.

This was Sri Lanka’s only warm-up game ahead of the two match Test series against New Zealand that gets underway on Thursday in Christchurch. Sri Lanka had declared on 274 for four after the top and middle order batters had spent some useful time in the middle and New Zealand Board XI were 141 for one at stumps on day one. Not a single ball was bowled yesterday due to heavy rain and play was called off early. Kusal Mendis smashed a quick-fire 95 that came off 87 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. Mendis shared a 162 runs stand with Oshada Fernando, who opened batting and made 78. All Sri Lanka’s batters spent useful time in the middle before the innings was declared. Angelo Mathews batted at number four and made 38 off 67 balls while Dinesh Chandimal scored 35 off 45 balls. Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella didn’t get a chance to bat. Sri Lanka’s top seven is pretty much settled and they are unlikely to make any changes to the batting unit and it’s the bowling attack they need to figure out. Quicks Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando and Lahiru Kumara bowled some decent spells and Kumara was the only wicket taker. Sri Lanka are likely to play only three quicks in the Test series but some feel that they are better off with all four quicks in with Dhananjaya de Silva being the lone spinner. The selectors are unlikely to follow that bold step. The Test series is viral for Sri Lanka as a 2-0 series win will give them a slot in the World Test Championship final later this year at The Oval during the English summer. But it’s quite a tough task as in the history Sri Lanka have been to New Zealand on ten Test tours and have just won two Tests. Unlike in white ball cricket, the Test team has been far more consistent and the ability of fast bowlers to run through sides has been a notable feature. The teams will move to north island for the second Test with Basin Reserve in Wellington hosting the game. It was at this venue Sri Lanka won the 2006 Test with Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva scoring hundreds. Muttiah Muralitharan claimed a match bag of ten wickets. It was also at the Basin Reserve Aravinda de Silva produced his career best 267 during the 1991 tour. In the same game Martin Crowe was dismissed for 299. Published on By Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year. Curran took 4 for 29 in the second ODI against Bangladesh on Friday, including a devastating burst of 3 for 19 in five overs with the new ball, as England sealed the series with one game to play. He also struck 33 off 19 with the bat to provide a timely reminder of his all-round abilities in the format where he has most struggled to pin down a regular spot. With Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer rested after the first match of the series, England were able to call on Curran and Saqib Mahmood, who was making his first international appearance since his Test debut in the Caribbean a year ago, having recovered from a back stress fracture. England could also select another World Cup-winner in Mark Wood, while Reece Topley and Olly Stone – who missed the tour of Bangladesh due to being part of the Test squad out in New Zealand – have recently returned to contention after injury problems.

As he has done publicly before, Vaughan emphatically denied ever having said, “There’s too many of you lot, we need to have a word about that” to Azeem Rafiq, Adil Rashid, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Ajmal Shahzad at a T20 game in June 2009. The ECB’s charge stems from Rafiq’s recollection of the remark which was, on Thursday, supported by the testimony of Rashid. Vaughan, appearing at the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) hearing in London, said of the day in question that he had “a very clear mind about back in 2009” and that he knew he did not say what had been alleged. He added that he would never have gone on to the field and said something to team-mates that could “put them in a bad state of mind” before the game. “Knowing me in 2009, that’s not the sort of thing I would’ve said.” Vaughan was questioned by the ECB’s lead counsel Jane Mulcahy KC for nearly 90 minutes, during which she argued that some historical tweets of his were “remarkably similar in tone” to the alleged remarks. Vaughan said the tweets were unacceptable and that he had apologised for them before and would continue to do so. But he disagreed with the suggestion that they were similar in tone. Mulcahy pointed out that both Rafiq and Rashid claimed Vaughan likely made the alleged comment as a “bad joke” and said the tweet was similar in tone because it was “lighthearted but offensive”. Asked if he agreed, Vaughan said: “No.” Vaughan said he was “disgusted” with the tweets. “I apologised for them. I put myself on an online course, Inclusion. I wanted to lead the game in knowing how to lead in modern times. The tweets are disgusting, awful, and other words you could use. But the most important thing is I have said sorry and I am learning from them. As I say, if I get things wrong in my life, I stick my hands up.” He went back to his recollection of the day of the game – which he has written about in his memoir – that he “could not have been more proud [of] four Asian players, three of whom had come through the system.” Vaughan was also questioned about his meeting with Rafiq in November 2021 saying he felt the need for it because “the whole situation was escalating out of control”. Vaughan said he was apologetic in the meeting with Rafiq because he was “disgusted” by what Rafiq had to go through at Yorkshire but did not accept he made the alleged comment. Vaughan said that the CDC hearing was a “terrible look” for cricket. “It’s not been easy for anybody. This is not the right process to deal with word-against-word comments from 14 years ago. Ex-team-mates fighting it out over hearsay is a terrible look for the game and a really bad look on how cricket has dealt with this situation.” Earlier in the morning, scrutiny fell on the ECB’s scope in the investigation of the incident as well as the rigour deployed, with Meena Botros, its director of legal and integrity, facing a three-hour grilling from Christopher Stoner, Vaughan’s lawyer. The line of questioning took in a recent interview with Lord Kamlesh Patel, the outgoing Yorkshire chair, in Eastern Eye. In it the claim was made that the ECB had “urged” Lord Patel to “get rid of people” at the county when he took over. Talking about his role, Patel said: “I was asked by the ECB to meet a set of criteria that most people would have winced at, would have thought there’s no way we can deliver this, and I delivered it. “I was asked by the ECB to work with them to create a framework and an environment where we would prove to the world that we want a non-racist institution, and I did all that. I was asked by the ECB to ensure some people who were there from the previous regime did not take part in that governance process, very clear about that.” Stoner suggested those comments showed that the ECB was “actively involved” in the Yorkshire investigation, in breach of the process as described in Botros’ witness statement, that the ECB remained independent of action being taken by one of its counties in such matters. Botros said he couldn’t talk about what Lord Patel had said but insisted that Stoner was “mistaking” the ECB’s regulatory function in getting involved, from its other roles in such cases. Stoner pointed to Botros’s witness statement which read: “In its capacity as a regulator, the ECB must remain independent of action being taken by one of its member first-class county clubs.” “That’s just not what happened, is it?” Stoner asked. Botros replied: “It is what happened.” Stoner then zeroed in on the day Vaughan is alleged to have made the remark, questioning whether the ECB could and should have gone further in its investigations of events. He confirmed with Botros that the only players the ECB had spoken to about the incident were Adil Rashid and Ajmal Shahzad. Stoner asked why all Yorkshire players that day weren’t spoken to. Botros said the ECB “did speak to the individuals where we were able to” but that “certain individuals either didn’t want to take part or engage”, or that the ECB “weren’t able” to get contact details for others. Stoner also asked Botros why the on-field umpires that day had not been contacted by the ECB for their version of events. “There is no suggestion that the umpires were close enough to hear it,” Botros replied. Botros added that if it was such an important point, Vaughan’s team could have taken it on themselves. The hearing is scheduled to end next Tuesday.

My contract is long, so hopefully I can win something more.” These words sound a lot like something Erik ten Hag could have said in the aftermath of Manchester United’s Carabao Cup final victory against Newcastle on Sunday, but they belong to Jose Mourinho, who had been sat in the same seat in the Wembley news conference exactly six years earlier. Like Ten Hag, Mourinho lifted the League Cup in his first season as manager at Old Trafford and then spoke about wanting more. There was more to come from Mourinho in the elongated vase of the UEFA Europa League three months later, but a little over a year after that, Mourinho was gone, sacked in December 2018 following a series of disagreements with the board over transfers and a run of miserable results. The 2017 League Cup, secured with a 3-2 win over Southampton, wasn’t the platform it was supposed to be, and it has since been consigned to history as a rare good day during the post-Sir Alex Ferguson slump. Ferguson used the cup competitions — particularly success in the FA Cup in 1990 and the League Cup in 2006 — to trigger periods of sustained success. The question for Ten Hag is simple: how will his 2023 League Cup triumph be remembered? It’s easy with the benefit of hindsight but there were signs, even during the celebrations at Wembley in 2017, that all was not well with Mourinho at United. In fact, the second question in his winners’ news conference suggested as much. “Jose,” it started, “for someone who has just won a trophy, you don’t seem hugely exuberant or happy.” “I am very happy,” came Mourinho’s reply, delivered while wearing the face of a man who was anything but. “I am very happy. It’s important for the fans and for the players. I always try to put myself in a secondary position, but the reality is that it’s also important for me. It’s a relief.” The difference in Ten Hag’s demeanour on Sunday could not have been more different. After dancing on the pitch with Antony and Lisandro Martinez, he sat down for his news conference wearing a wide grin. He said broadly similar things to what Mourinho had said six years before — “If we keep going and working then we can win even more” — but he was in a buoyant-enough mood to make a joke, as he left having nearly forgotten to take the trophy with him. Ten Hag has cracked down on squad discipline since taking over last summer, but he has also ensured he has built a bond with his players and the fans, something it seemed Mourinho always struggled to do. In line with Carabao Cup rules, clubs do not have to hold prematch news conferences for any round prior to the semifinals and for the first time this season, United used the time to invite supporters to come to the training base at Carrington and put their own questions to Ten Hag. Fans from all over the world took up the opportunity and each time, it went down well. Mourinho might have understood his task at Old Trafford, but Ten Hag, it seems, understands the club.After winning the League Cup and the Europa League in his first season, Mourinho finished second in the Premier League in his second year and lost in the FA Cup final to Chelsea. It was at that point, however, that his reign began to unravel. He had already lost patience with star player Paul Pogba and during the summer of 2018, he became increasingly frustrated by the club’s transfer business. Having decided he wanted to move on Anthony Martial, Mourinho was convinced the idea was blocked because the French forward was club co-chairman Joel Glazer’s favourite player. Mourinho also asked to sign a new centre-back, but was told that targets Harry Maguire and Jerome Boateng were too expensive and too old and injury-prone, respectively. Transfers can be contentious for any manager and Ten Hag will have to be careful in the way he navigates the summer window so as not to fall into the same trap as Mourinho. After making such a huge step forward in his first season, there will be an expectation for United to make a genuine title challenge and the Dutchman will quite rightly want a squad capable of delivering. Ten Hag has not been shy in pushing for more players — winger Antony last summer, forward Wout Weghorst and midfielder Marcel Sabitzer in January — and will do so again, but as Mourinho learned to his cost, there can be danger when you overstep the mark. Because of financial fair play concerns, United are planning a summer spend of between £100m and £200m, and it will be football director John Murtough’s job to balance Ten Hag’s demands with the club’s financial constraints. A new striker, in particular, is vital if United are going to reach the next level. Mourinho thought the League Cup would provide a first taste of success for a team destined for bigger and better things and the fans at Wembley that day probably thought the same. That it didn’t provides an apt reminder for Ten Hag — not that he needs one — that there’s work to do to complete his Old Trafford revolution and get United back to the top table in both England and Europe. Mourinho’s League Cup turned out to be nothing more than a brief highlight. Ten Hag wants his to be the start of a series of them. (ESPN) Published on By There was much disappointment for Sri Lanka’s players as the entire day two’s play of their warm-up game against New Zealand Board XI at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln was called off due to rain yesterday. This was Sri Lanka’s only warm-up game ahead of the two match Test series against New Zealand that gets underway on Thursday in Christchurch. Sri Lanka had declared on 274 for four after the top and middle order batters had spent some useful time in the middle and New Zealand Board XI were 141 for one at stumps on day one. Not a single ball was bowled yesterday due to heavy rain and play was called off early. Kusal Mendis smashed a quick-fire 95 that came off 87 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. Mendis shared a 162 runs stand with Oshada Fernando, who opened batting and made 78. All Sri Lanka’s batters spent useful time in the middle before the innings was declared. Angelo Mathews batted at number four and made 38 off 67 balls while Dinesh Chandimal scored 35 off 45 balls. Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella didn’t get a chance to bat. Sri Lanka’s top seven is pretty much settled and they are unlikely to make any changes to the batting unit and it’s the bowling attack they need to figure out. Quicks Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando and Lahiru Kumara bowled some decent spells and Kumara was the only wicket taker. Sri Lanka are likely to play only three quicks in the Test series but some feel that they are better off with all four quicks in with Dhananjaya de Silva being the lone spinner. The selectors are unlikely to follow that bold step. The Test series is viral for Sri Lanka as a 2-0 series win will give them a slot in the World Test Championship final later this year at The Oval during the English summer. But it’s quite a tough task as in the history Sri Lanka have been to New Zealand on ten Test tours and have just won two Tests. Unlike in white ball cricket, the Test team has been far more consistent and the ability of fast bowlers to run through sides has been a notable feature. The teams will move to north island for the second Test with Basin Reserve in Wellington hosting the game. It was at this venue Sri Lanka won the 2006 Test with Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva scoring hundreds. Muttiah Muralitharan claimed a match bag of ten wickets. It was also at the Basin Reserve Aravinda de Silva produced his career best 267 during the 1991 tour. In the same game Martin Crowe was dismissed for 299. Published on By Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year. Curran took 4 for 29 in the second ODI against Bangladesh on Friday, including a devastating burst of 3 for 19 in five overs with the new ball, as England sealed the series with one game to play. He also struck 33 off 19 with the bat to provide a timely reminder of his all-round abilities in the format where he has most struggled to pin down a regular spot. With Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer rested after the first match of the series, England were able to call on Curran and Saqib Mahmood, who was making his first international appearance since his Test debut in the Caribbean a year ago, having recovered from a back stress fracture. England could also select another World Cup-winner in Mark Wood, while Reece Topley and Olly Stone – who missed the tour of Bangladesh due to being part of the Test squad out in New Zealand – have recently returned to contention after injury problems. Throw in the likes of David Willey, Brydon Carse, Matthew Potts and Luke Wood, and England can hope to have a strong pool of seamers to pick from for the World Cup. “It is a quality squad at the moment,” Curran said. “There are a lot of guys who have been on the Test tour who will come back in. Any time you play in a team for England you want to put in a performance but it shows we’ve got a great squad with Jof, Woakes, Woody being back now as well. “Everyone has had a tough year with injuries and everyone is pleased to see the quality of the bowlers we have around. You saw how great the Test team were bowling as well. “It is an exciting time and hopefully we can give the captain and coach some good decisions to make but right now I’m sure the bowlers just want to keep performing and be in that 15 for the World Cup. Conditions will dictate if there is extra pace or extra spin, so it is about enjoying it and not putting on too much pressure.” Curran was Player of the Tournament when England lifted the T20 World Cup in Australia last year, carving out a well-defined role as one of the side’s go-to death bowlers during the lead-up to the competition. His left-arm angle, ability to swing the new ball and then fall back on his variations later in the innings – not to mention his hyper-aggressive approach with the bat – should make him a strong candidate to be part of the group in India, where he has a wealth of IPL experience. His overall record in ODIs remains underwhelming, with 24 wickets in 22 appearances at an average of 37.29. In 2022, that blew out to four wickets at 72.65, having been largely used at first or second change; but in Mirpur he took the new ball for only the second time in 12 appearances and promptly produced his second-best figures (his maiden five-for, against Sri Lanka in 2021, also came when opening the bowling). “It is a nice time to bowl as a seam bowler because you get swing and movement but it is tricky as well because you have to be on the money and start really well because the white ball doesn’t swing for that long,” Curran said. “In these conditions, your cutters, your slower balls and cross-seam deliveries may become useful as well. It is about adjusting and seeing what is in front of you. (cricinfo) Published on By Coming to the annual Big Match as underdogs, Ananda needed their inexperienced batting lineup to produce something special to be on par with their arch-rivals. Kithma Sithmal and Kanchana de Livera stood out for them producing just that as their vital knocks in the first innings helped them salvage pride against Nalanda at the annual encounter that ended in a draw at the SSC ground yesterday. In reply to Nalanda’s 280 for five wickets declared, Ananda posted 235 runs thanks largely to the batting efforts of Kithma Sithmal and Kanchana de Livera. Sithmal anchored the fragile batting lineup with a valiant knock of 90 runs. Livera departed after an aggressive knock of 43 runs which included seven fours. From then on Sithmal took it upen his shoulders to anchor the innings. His 184-ball innings helped Ananda survive for 87 overs and avoid the danger of being enforced the follow on as others failed to top 20 runs. He was also the beneficiary of two costly fielding mishaps. However, his marathon innings left only a session for the two teams to battle it out in the second innings. For the second time in the match, Nalanda declared their innings for the loss of five wickets. They had a lead of 166 runs. Chasing a rather unlikely target Ananda were 22 for two wickets at stumps. For Nalanda Eranga Jayakodige did well in the batting department top scoring with 83 runs. After they were put to bat Nalanda lost three wickets but the middle order lived up to their reputation to post their eventual total.","pubDate":"2023-03-05 23:40:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Skipper Rushab heaps praise on teammates as Swamis celebrate NPCA T20 title victory","link":"https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/2023/03/06/skipper-rushab-heaps-praise-on-teammates-as-swamis-celebrate-npca-t20-title-victory/","keywords":["Cricket","featured"],"creator":["Capital Sport"],"video_url":null,"description":"NAIROBI, Kenya, Mar 6 – Swamibapa “A” skipper Rushab Patel has sung the praises of his team mates, following their 2023 Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) T20 League title victory.

Put into bat, the Swamis amassed a decent total of 200 runs for the loss 7 wickets, with openers Rushab and Alex Obanda anchoring their innings with 52 and 60 runs apiece, which set the mood for their cup victory. Yash Bhatt (23), Mitesh Sanghani (17) and Harendra Kerai (10 not out) chipped in with useful cameos to help Swamis post an imposing total. Sikh Union “A” (155-7) won the toss and elected to bowl, a decision they didn’t regret either. The Simba’s, led by their indefatigable Skipper and opener Sukhdeep Singh (34) got off to a flying start with middle order batsman Osama Aslam smashing a cool 53; though their spirited chase suffered rapid collapse of wickets at some point. Rushab was all smiles and here is what he had to say: “Winning a tournament is always a great feeling. We came very close, we shared the trophy last year with Kanbis and we deserved to win as we have played some very competitive cricket in the T20 League.” “As I had said before, the essence was to execute our plans and I must admit that my teammates did a fantastic job throughout the season. We have just been looking to take each team game by game and make sure we have our processes and plans in order and per each opposition.” “I am a very strong believer of plans and execution, and the moment we started doing that as a unit we started to gel well and found the chemistry in our batting unit as well” Rushab’s counterpart Sukhdeep expounded on their fairy tale season of the T20 League: “I think it has been quite a few years we have not reached the final. Our positive was being here. We knew we had played good cricket throughout the tournament, but today was a day in which we did give about 15 extra runs., which is quite a lot in T-20 Cricket” Asked about their losing experience in the final, Sukhdeep continued: “I would say it’s not hurting as much, because we have played some good cricket through and through. We saw our Senior club officials, fans and family cheer us on and it was a privilege ruffling feathers in their presence” “We won the toss and had planned to bowl. One thing about our team is that we have been chasing really well, hence the decision to bowl first. Sikh Union is now back, but we are also developing the youngsters as well.” An elated Sikh Union Club Vice Chairman Hardial Singh Kalsi, better known as “Dali”Kalsi in the Motorsport arena in Kenya, congratulated his boys saying: “We are on the path of development of our game and I am glad that our Sikh Union Cricket Academy under the watchful eye of Avtar Singh Kundi is now bearing fruits with the engagement of our youngsters.” The T20 season, traditionally a precursor to the 50-Overs Knockout Tournament also saw several players feted for their exemplary performances. Kenya’s leg-spinning all-rounder in the 2003 World Cup Collins Obuya of Obuya Academy was named the player of the tournament whilst 10-year-old Kavit Joshi of Sikh Union took the accolade for the best youngster.

में दिल्ली के गेंदबाजों ने भी अपना दम दिखाया। दिल्ली की गेंदबाज टारा नॉरिज ने पांच विकेट लिया। उनकी शानदार गेंदबाजी के लिए उन्हें प्लेयर ऑफ द मैच भी चुना गया। कुछ ऐसा ही दिन के दूसरे मैच में भी देखने

His overall record in ODIs remains underwhelming, with 24 wickets in 22 appearances at an average of 37.29. In 2022, that blew out to four wickets at 72.65, having been largely used at first or second change; but in Mirpur he took the new ball for only the second time in 12 appearances and promptly produced his second-best figures (his maiden five-for, against Sri Lanka in 2021, also came when opening the bowling). “It is a nice time to bowl as a seam bowler because you get swing and movement but it is tricky as well because you have to be on the money and start really well because the white ball doesn’t swing for that long,” Curran said. “In these conditions, your cutters, your slower balls and cross-seam deliveries may become useful as well. It is about adjusting and seeing what is in front of you. (cricinfo) Published on By Coming to the annual Big Match as underdogs, Ananda needed their inexperienced batting lineup to produce something special to be on par with their arch-rivals. Kithma Sithmal and Kanchana de Livera stood out for them producing just that as their vital knocks in the first innings helped them salvage pride against Nalanda at the annual encounter that ended in a draw at the SSC ground yesterday. In reply to Nalanda’s 280 for five wickets declared, Ananda posted 235 runs thanks largely to the batting efforts of Kithma Sithmal and Kanchana de Livera. Sithmal anchored the fragile batting lineup with a valiant knock of 90 runs. Livera departed after an aggressive knock of 43 runs which included seven fours. From then on Sithmal took it upen his shoulders to anchor the innings. His 184-ball innings helped Ananda survive for 87 overs and avoid the danger of being enforced the follow on as others failed to top 20 runs. He was also the beneficiary of two costly fielding mishaps. However, his marathon innings left only a session for the two teams to battle it out in the second innings. For the second time in the match, Nalanda declared their innings for the loss of five wickets. They had a lead of 166 runs. Chasing a rather unlikely target Ananda were 22 for two wickets at stumps. For Nalanda Eranga Jayakodige did well in the batting department top scoring with 83 runs. After they were put to bat Nalanda lost three wickets but the middle order lived up to their reputation to post their eventual total. Published on By Alex Carey admitted he feared the worst after Rohit Sharma was given two lives in the first over of the Indore Test when Australia opted not to review for a nick and an lbw, but was delighted to play his part in ensuring the India captain did not inflict major damage. Carey’s stumping of Rohit in the sixth over, Matt Kuhnemann’s first wicket of the match, was picked out as a key moment by head coach Andrew McDonald who lauded Carey’s glovework on a tough pitch for wicketkeeping. Having beaten Rohit with one which spun sharply to beat the edge, Kuhnemann then drew him down the pitch and another ragging delivery presented Carey with a stumping opportunity but he had to navigate some significant bounce to ensure the dismissal was completed. “Instinct takes over when you see a ball bounce like that,” Carey said. “I don’t think many of us were expecting an eight-degree turning ball that early in the game. But it was nice to hold onto that and for us to get a bit of momentum. “Once the big screen showed the nick [in the first over], I thought he [Rohit] might have settled in for a nice 150 or something like that. It was challenging conditions throughout the match, but it was nice to get that one away and for us to get on a bit of a roll after that.” Carey was exceptional with the gloves throughout the match, conceding just three byes on a surface with uneven bounce, and has been impressive all series. Conditions in Indore were comparable to those he faced in the first Test in Galle last year when he was struck on the helmet by a Nathan Lyon delivery that exploded off the surface. It continued the development of his keeping after some initial struggles on the low surfaces in Pakistan last year and a handful of missed chances early in his Test career. This time, he had some bruises on his shoulders to show for his efforts. “It’s fun being out there, it’s challenging for everyone, and it’s great to be on the right end of this one,” he said. “Balls are going to explode off lengths and even Starcy bowled a half volley that exploded up, so you’re out there reacting to what you see. “In terms of our sundries, it was nice to reduce those and it can turn out to be an extra batter at times. You don’t really think about it at the time, you probably think back and go ‘that was pretty good’, but a few nice little bruises as well just to get the body behind it.” Australia lower-order struggles Though Australia got over the line outstandingly in Indore, they did suffer another collapse, losing 6 for 11 on the second day when there was a more substantial lead in the offing. It continued a trend where the lower order has struggled to contribute, an area in which India have excelled, with Pat Cummins’ 33 in Delhi the only significant score among the bowlers. From No. 8 onwards, India’s have scored 307 runs at 25.58 in the series compared to Australia’s 84 and 4.94. In Australia’s defence, conditions have been extremely tough, especially in Delhi and Indore, even for top-order batters. Axar Patel could easily command a place higher up the order, and his position at No. 8 or 9 highlights India’s batting depth. Even in the third Test when it ultimately did not make a difference, while Cheteshwar Pujara and Axar were together, there was a chance Australia could have had a much tougher chase. “I think it’s one of those things where it’s so hard to start for any player, so we’re asking guys to play in different environments,” Carey said. “I think if we go out and try to slog and get a few runs that way [and] if it goes pear-shaped, we’re happy to live with that. If they go out and try to survive for the [top-order] batter, we know that there’s a ball with their name on it. “We know that we haven’t given enough with the tail. We also understand that India’s batting line-up is very, very strong. So they bat all the way down to No. 10 really. We’ll have those conversations about how we can navigate and try to get 10-15 runs each more.” Carey himself also knows he needs to contribute more after four low scores following his 36 in Nagpur. “I had some confidence out of the first game and then getting out defending [in Indore]. Am I happy with that? Not really,” he said. “So back my strength and try to score with the sweeps and manipulate a little bit more that way. Looking forward to another opportunity in Ahmedabad and get down and maybe get the broom out again.”","pubDate":"2023-03-06 00:01:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sam Curran eager to state World Cup case as competition ramps up","link":"http://island.lk/sam-curran-eager-to-state-world-cup-case-as-competition-ramps-up/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Thilina Walpola"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year.

He also struck 33 off 19 with the bat to provide a timely reminder of his all-round abilities in the format where he has most struggled to pin down a regular spot. With Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer rested after the first match of the series, England were able to call on Curran and Saqib Mahmood, who was making his first international appearance since his Test debut in the Caribbean a year ago, having recovered from a back stress fracture. England could also select another World Cup-winner in Mark Wood, while Reece Topley and Olly Stone – who missed the tour of Bangladesh due to being part of the Test squad out in New Zealand – have recently returned to contention after injury problems. Throw in the likes of David Willey, Brydon Carse, Matthew Potts and Luke Wood, and England can hope to have a strong pool of seamers to pick from for the World Cup. “It is a quality squad at the moment,” Curran said. “There are a lot of guys who have been on the Test tour who will come back in. Any time you play in a team for England you want to put in a performance but it shows we’ve got a great squad with Jof, Woakes, Woody being back now as well. “Everyone has had a tough year with injuries and everyone is pleased to see the quality of the bowlers we have around. You saw how great the Test team were bowling as well. “It is an exciting time and hopefully we can give the captain and coach some good decisions to make but right now I’m sure the bowlers just want to keep performing and be in that 15 for the World Cup.

Looking forward to another opportunity in Ahmedabad and get down and maybe get the broom out again.” Published on By Historic tweets from Michael Vaughan took centre stage on the third day of the ECB’s racism hearings, as the former England captain denied having made the statement that forms the core of the ECB’s charge of bringing the game into disrepute. As he has done publicly before, Vaughan emphatically denied ever having said, “There’s too many of you lot, we need to have a word about that” to Azeem Rafiq, Adil Rashid, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Ajmal Shahzad at a T20 game in June 2009. The ECB’s charge stems from Rafiq’s recollection of the remark which was, on Thursday, supported by the testimony of Rashid. Vaughan, appearing at the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) hearing in London, said of the day in question that he had “a very clear mind about back in 2009” and that he knew he did not say what had been alleged. He added that he would never have gone on to the field and said something to team-mates that could “put them in a bad state of mind” before the game. “Knowing me in 2009, that’s not the sort of thing I would’ve said.” Vaughan was questioned by the ECB’s lead counsel Jane Mulcahy KC for nearly 90 minutes, during which she argued that some historical tweets of his were “remarkably similar in tone” to the alleged remarks. Vaughan said the tweets were unacceptable and that he had apologised for them before and would continue to do so. But he disagreed with the suggestion that they were similar in tone. Mulcahy pointed out that both Rafiq and Rashid claimed Vaughan likely made the alleged comment as a “bad joke” and said the tweet was similar in tone because it was “lighthearted but offensive”. Asked if he agreed, Vaughan said: “No.” Vaughan said he was “disgusted” with the tweets. “I apologised for them. I put myself on an online course, Inclusion. I wanted to lead the game in knowing how to lead in modern times. The tweets are disgusting, awful, and other words you could use. But the most important thing is I have said sorry and I am learning from them. As I say, if I get things wrong in my life, I stick my hands up.” He went back to his recollection of the day of the game – which he has written about in his memoir – that he “could not have been more proud [of] four Asian players, three of whom had come through the system.” Vaughan was also questioned about his meeting with Rafiq in November 2021 saying he felt the need for it because “the whole situation was escalating out of control”. Vaughan said he was apologetic in the meeting with Rafiq because he was “disgusted” by what Rafiq had to go through at Yorkshire but did not accept he made the alleged comment. Vaughan said that the CDC hearing was a “terrible look” for cricket. “It’s not been easy for anybody. This is not the right process to deal with word-against-word comments from 14 years ago. Ex-team-mates fighting it out over hearsay is a terrible look for the game and a really bad look on how cricket has dealt with this situation.” Earlier in the morning, scrutiny fell on the ECB’s scope in the investigation of the incident as well as the rigour deployed, with Meena Botros, its director of legal and integrity, facing a three-hour grilling from Christopher Stoner, Vaughan’s lawyer. The line of questioning took in a recent interview with Lord Kamlesh Patel, the outgoing Yorkshire chair, in Eastern Eye. In it the claim was made that the ECB had “urged” Lord Patel to “get rid of people” at the county when he took over. Talking about his role, Patel said: “I was asked by the ECB to meet a set of criteria that most people would have winced at, would have thought there’s no way we can deliver this, and I delivered it. “I was asked by the ECB to work with them to create a framework and an environment where we would prove to the world that we want a non-racist institution, and I did all that. I was asked by the ECB to ensure some people who were there from the previous regime did not take part in that governance process, very clear about that.” Stoner suggested those comments showed that the ECB was “actively involved” in the Yorkshire investigation, in breach of the process as described in Botros’ witness statement, that the ECB remained independent of action being taken by one of its counties in such matters. Botros said he couldn’t talk about what Lord Patel had said but insisted that Stoner was “mistaking” the ECB’s regulatory function in getting involved, from its other roles in such cases. Stoner pointed to Botros’s witness statement which read: “In its capacity as a regulator, the ECB must remain independent of action being taken by one of its member first-class county clubs.” “That’s just not what happened, is it?” Stoner asked. Botros replied: “It is what happened.” Stoner then zeroed in on the day Vaughan is alleged to have made the remark, questioning whether the ECB could and should have gone further in its investigations of events. He confirmed with Botros that the only players the ECB had spoken to about the incident were Adil Rashid and Ajmal Shahzad. Stoner asked why all Yorkshire players that day weren’t spoken to. Botros said the ECB “did speak to the individuals where we were able to” but that “certain individuals either didn’t want to take part or engage”, or that the ECB “weren’t able” to get contact details for others. Stoner also asked Botros why the on-field umpires that day had not been contacted by the ECB for their version of events. “There is no suggestion that the umpires were close enough to hear it,” Botros replied. Botros added that if it was such an important point, Vaughan’s team could have taken it on themselves. The hearing is scheduled to end next Tuesday.

Published on By There was much disappointment for Sri Lanka’s players as the entire day two’s play of their warm-up game against New Zealand Board XI at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln was called off due to rain yesterday. This was Sri Lanka’s only warm-up game ahead of the two match Test series against New Zealand that gets underway on Thursday in Christchurch. Sri Lanka had declared on 274 for four after the top and middle order batters had spent some useful time in the middle and New Zealand Board XI were 141 for one at stumps on day one. Not a single ball was bowled yesterday due to heavy rain and play was called off early. Kusal Mendis smashed a quick-fire 95 that came off 87 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. Mendis shared a 162 runs stand with Oshada Fernando, who opened batting and made 78. All Sri Lanka’s batters spent useful time in the middle before the innings was declared. Angelo Mathews batted at number four and made 38 off 67 balls while Dinesh Chandimal scored 35 off 45 balls. Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella didn’t get a chance to bat. Sri Lanka’s top seven is pretty much settled and they are unlikely to make any changes to the batting unit and it’s the bowling attack they need to figure out. Quicks Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando and Lahiru Kumara bowled some decent spells and Kumara was the only wicket taker. Sri Lanka are likely to play only three quicks in the Test series but some feel that they are better off with all four quicks in with Dhananjaya de Silva being the lone spinner. The selectors are unlikely to follow that bold step. The Test series is viral for Sri Lanka as a 2-0 series win will give them a slot in the World Test Championship final later this year at The Oval during the English summer. But it’s quite a tough task as in the history Sri Lanka have been to New Zealand on ten Test tours and have just won two Tests. Unlike in white ball cricket, the Test team has been far more consistent and the ability of fast bowlers to run through sides has been a notable feature. The teams will move to north island for the second Test with Basin Reserve in Wellington hosting the game. It was at this venue Sri Lanka won the 2006 Test with Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva scoring hundreds. Muttiah Muralitharan claimed a match bag of ten wickets. It was also at the Basin Reserve Aravinda de Silva produced his career best 267 during the 1991 tour. In the same game Martin Crowe was dismissed for 299. Published on By Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year.

Even in the third Test when it ultimately did not make a difference, while Cheteshwar Pujara and Axar were together, there was a chance Australia could have had a much tougher chase. “I think it’s one of those things where it’s so hard to start for any player, so we’re asking guys to play in different environments,” Carey said. “I think if we go out and try to slog and get a few runs that way [and] if it goes pear-shaped, we’re happy to live with that. If they go out and try to survive for the [top-order] batter, we know that there’s a ball with their name on it. “We know that we haven’t given enough with the tail. We also understand that India’s batting line-up is very, very strong. So they bat all the way down to No. 10 really. We’ll have those conversations about how we can navigate and try to get 10-15 runs each more.” Carey himself also knows he needs to contribute more after four low scores following his 36 in Nagpur. “I had some confidence out of the first game and then getting out defending [in Indore]. Am I happy with that? Not really,” he said. “So back my strength and try to score with the sweeps and manipulate a little bit more that way. Looking forward to another opportunity in Ahmedabad and get down and maybe get the broom out again.”","pubDate":"2023-03-05 23:40:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Carey: ‘Was nice to reduce sundries; they can turn out to be extra batter at times’","link":"http://island.lk/carey-was-nice-to-reduce-sundries-they-can-turn-out-to-be-extra-batter-at-times/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Thilina Walpola"],"video_url":null,"description":"Alex Carey admitted he feared the worst after Rohit Sharma was given two lives in the first over of the Indore Test when Australia opted not to review for a nick and an lbw, but was delighted to play his part in ensuring the India captain did not inflict major damage.

Carey’s stumping of Rohit in the sixth over, Matt Kuhnemann’s first wicket of the match, was picked out as a key moment by head coach Andrew McDonald who lauded Carey’s glovework on a tough pitch for wicketkeeping. Having beaten Rohit with one which spun sharply to beat the edge, Kuhnemann then drew him down the pitch and another ragging delivery presented Carey with a stumping opportunity but he had to navigate some significant bounce to ensure the dismissal was completed. “Instinct takes over when you see a ball bounce like that,” Carey said. “I don’t think many of us were expecting an eight-degree turning ball that early in the game. But it was nice to hold onto that and for us to get a bit of momentum. “Once the big screen showed the nick [in the first over], I thought he [Rohit] might have settled in for a nice 150 or something like that. It was challenging conditions throughout the match, but it was nice to get that one away and for us to get on a bit of a roll after that.” Carey was exceptional with the gloves throughout the match, conceding just three byes on a surface with uneven bounce, and has been impressive all series. Conditions in Indore were comparable to those he faced in the first Test in Galle last year when he was struck on the helmet by a Nathan Lyon delivery that exploded off the surface. It continued the development of his keeping after some initial struggles on the low surfaces in Pakistan last year and a handful of missed chances early in his Test career. This time, he had some bruises on his shoulders to show for his efforts. “It’s fun being out there, it’s challenging for everyone, and it’s great to be on the right end of this one,” he said. “Balls are going to explode off lengths and even Starcy bowled a half volley that exploded up, so you’re out there reacting to what you see. “In terms of our sundries, it was nice to reduce those and it can turn out to be an extra batter at times. You don’t really think about it at the time, you probably think back and go ‘that was pretty good’, but a few nice little bruises as well just to get the body behind it.” Australia lower-order struggles Though Australia got over the line outstandingly in Indore, they did suffer another collapse, losing 6 for 11 on the second day when there was a more substantial lead in the offing. It continued a trend where the lower order has struggled to contribute, an area in which India have excelled, with Pat Cummins’ 33 in Delhi the only significant score among the bowlers. From No. 8 onwards, India’s have scored 307 runs at 25.58 in the series compared to Australia’s 84 and 4.94.

This was Sri Lanka’s only warm-up game ahead of the two match Test series against New Zealand that gets underway on Thursday in Christchurch. Sri Lanka had declared on 274 for four after the top and middle order batters had spent some useful time in the middle and New Zealand Board XI were 141 for one at stumps on day one. Not a single ball was bowled yesterday due to heavy rain and play was called off early. Kusal Mendis smashed a quick-fire 95 that came off 87 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. Mendis shared a 162 runs stand with Oshada Fernando, who opened batting and made 78. All Sri Lanka’s batters spent useful time in the middle before the innings was declared. Angelo Mathews batted at number four and made 38 off 67 balls while Dinesh Chandimal scored 35 off 45 balls. Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella didn’t get a chance to bat. Sri Lanka’s top seven is pretty much settled and they are unlikely to make any changes to the batting unit and it’s the bowling attack they need to figure out. Quicks Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando and Lahiru Kumara bowled some decent spells and Kumara was the only wicket taker. Sri Lanka are likely to play only three quicks in the Test series but some feel that they are better off with all four quicks in with Dhananjaya de Silva being the lone spinner. The selectors are unlikely to follow that bold step. The Test series is viral for Sri Lanka as a 2-0 series win will give them a slot in the World Test Championship final later this year at The Oval during the English summer. But it’s quite a tough task as in the history Sri Lanka have been to New Zealand on ten Test tours and have just won two Tests. Unlike in white ball cricket, the Test team has been far more consistent and the ability of fast bowlers to run through sides has been a notable feature. The teams will move to north island for the second Test with Basin Reserve in Wellington hosting the game. It was at this venue Sri Lanka won the 2006 Test with Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva scoring hundreds. Muttiah Muralitharan claimed a match bag of ten wickets. It was also at the Basin Reserve Aravinda de Silva produced his career best 267 during the 1991 tour. In the same game Martin Crowe was dismissed for 299. Published on By Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year. Curran took 4 for 29 in the second ODI against Bangladesh on Friday, including a devastating burst of 3 for 19 in five overs with the new ball, as England sealed the series with one game to play. He also struck 33 off 19 with the bat to provide a timely reminder of his all-round abilities in the format where he has most struggled to pin down a regular spot. With Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer rested after the first match of the series, England were able to call on Curran and Saqib Mahmood, who was making his first international appearance since his Test debut in the Caribbean a year ago, having recovered from a back stress fracture. England could also select another World Cup-winner in Mark Wood, while Reece Topley and Olly Stone – who missed the tour of Bangladesh due to being part of the Test squad out in New Zealand – have recently returned to contention after injury problems. Throw in the likes of David Willey, Brydon Carse, Matthew Potts and Luke Wood, and England can hope to have a strong pool of seamers to pick from for the World Cup. “It is a quality squad at the moment,” Curran said. “There are a lot of guys who have been on the Test tour who will come back in. Any time you play in a team for England you want to put in a performance but it shows we’ve got a great squad with Jof, Woakes, Woody being back now as well. “Everyone has had a tough year with injuries and everyone is pleased to see the quality of the bowlers we have around. You saw how great the Test team were bowling as well. “It is an exciting time and hopefully we can give the captain and coach some good decisions to make but right now I’m sure the bowlers just want to keep performing and be in that 15 for the World Cup. Conditions will dictate if there is extra pace or extra spin, so it is about enjoying it and not putting on too much pressure.” Curran was Player of the Tournament when England lifted the T20 World Cup in Australia last year, carving out a well-defined role as one of the side’s go-to death bowlers during the lead-up to the competition. His left-arm angle, ability to swing the new ball and then fall back on his variations later in the innings – not to mention his hyper-aggressive approach with the bat – should make him a strong candidate to be part of the group in India, where he has a wealth of IPL experience. His overall record in ODIs remains underwhelming, with 24 wickets in 22 appearances at an average of 37.29. In 2022, that blew out to four wickets at 72.65, having been largely used at first or second change; but in Mirpur he took the new ball for only the second time in 12 appearances and promptly produced his second-best figures (his maiden five-for, against Sri Lanka in 2021, also came when opening the bowling). “It is a nice time to bowl as a seam bowler because you get swing and movement but it is tricky as well because you have to be on the money and start really well because the white ball doesn’t swing for that long,” Curran said. “In these conditions, your cutters, your slower balls and cross-seam deliveries may become useful as well. It is about adjusting and seeing what is in front of you.

As he has done publicly before, Vaughan emphatically denied ever having said, “There’s too many of you lot, we need to have a word about that” to Azeem Rafiq, Adil Rashid, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Ajmal Shahzad at a T20 game in June 2009. The ECB’s charge stems from Rafiq’s recollection of the remark which was, on Thursday, supported by the testimony of Rashid. Vaughan, appearing at the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) hearing in London, said of the day in question that he had “a very clear mind about back in 2009” and that he knew he did not say what had been alleged. He added that he would never have gone on to the field and said something to team-mates that could “put them in a bad state of mind” before the game. “Knowing me in 2009, that’s not the sort of thing I would’ve said.” Vaughan was questioned by the ECB’s lead counsel Jane Mulcahy KC for nearly 90 minutes, during which she argued that some historical tweets of his were “remarkably similar in tone” to the alleged remarks. Vaughan said the tweets were unacceptable and that he had apologised for them before and would continue to do so. But he disagreed with the suggestion that they were similar in tone. Mulcahy pointed out that both Rafiq and Rashid claimed Vaughan likely made the alleged comment as a “bad joke” and said the tweet was similar in tone because it was “lighthearted but offensive”. Asked if he agreed, Vaughan said: “No.” Vaughan said he was “disgusted” with the tweets. “I apologised for them. I put myself on an online course, Inclusion. I wanted to lead the game in knowing how to lead in modern times. The tweets are disgusting, awful, and other words you could use. But the most important thing is I have said sorry and I am learning from them. As I say, if I get things wrong in my life, I stick my hands up.” He went back to his recollection of the day of the game – which he has written about in his memoir – that he “could not have been more proud [of] four Asian players, three of whom had come through the system.” Vaughan was also questioned about his meeting with Rafiq in November 2021 saying he felt the need for it because “the whole situation was escalating out of control”. Vaughan said he was apologetic in the meeting with Rafiq because he was “disgusted” by what Rafiq had to go through at Yorkshire but did not accept he made the alleged comment. Vaughan said that the CDC hearing was a “terrible look” for cricket. “It’s not been easy for anybody. This is not the right process to deal with word-against-word comments from 14 years ago. Ex-team-mates fighting it out over hearsay is a terrible look for the game and a really bad look on how cricket has dealt with this situation.” Earlier in the morning, scrutiny fell on the ECB’s scope in the investigation of the incident as well as the rigour deployed, with Meena Botros, its director of legal and integrity, facing a three-hour grilling from Christopher Stoner, Vaughan’s lawyer. The line of questioning took in a recent interview with Lord Kamlesh Patel, the outgoing Yorkshire chair, in Eastern Eye. In it the claim was made that the ECB had “urged” Lord Patel to “get rid of people” at the county when he took over. Talking about his role, Patel said: “I was asked by the ECB to meet a set of criteria that most people would have winced at, would have thought there’s no way we can deliver this, and I delivered it. “I was asked by the ECB to work with them to create a framework and an environment where we would prove to the world that we want a non-racist institution, and I did all that. I was asked by the ECB to ensure some people who were there from the previous regime did not take part in that governance process, very clear about that.” Stoner suggested those comments showed that the ECB was “actively involved” in the Yorkshire investigation, in breach of the process as described in Botros’ witness statement, that the ECB remained independent of action being taken by one of its counties in such matters. Botros said he couldn’t talk about what Lord Patel had said but insisted that Stoner was “mistaking” the ECB’s regulatory function in getting involved, from its other roles in such cases. Stoner pointed to Botros’s witness statement which read: “In its capacity as a regulator, the ECB must remain independent of action being taken by one of its member first-class county clubs.” “That’s just not what happened, is it?” Stoner asked. Botros replied: “It is what happened.” Stoner then zeroed in on the day Vaughan is alleged to have made the remark, questioning whether the ECB could and should have gone further in its investigations of events. He confirmed with Botros that the only players the ECB had spoken to about the incident were Adil Rashid and Ajmal Shahzad. Stoner asked why all Yorkshire players that day weren’t spoken to. Botros said the ECB “did speak to the individuals where we were able to” but that “certain individuals either didn’t want to take part or engage”, or that the ECB “weren’t able” to get contact details for others. Stoner also asked Botros why the on-field umpires that day had not been contacted by the ECB for their version of events. “There is no suggestion that the umpires were close enough to hear it,” Botros replied. Botros added that if it was such an important point, Vaughan’s team could have taken it on themselves. The hearing is scheduled to end next Tuesday.

My contract is long, so hopefully I can win something more.” These words sound a lot like something Erik ten Hag could have said in the aftermath of Manchester United’s Carabao Cup final victory against Newcastle on Sunday, but they belong to Jose Mourinho, who had been sat in the same seat in the Wembley news conference exactly six years earlier. Like Ten Hag, Mourinho lifted the League Cup in his first season as manager at Old Trafford and then spoke about wanting more. There was more to come from Mourinho in the elongated vase of the UEFA Europa League three months later, but a little over a year after that, Mourinho was gone, sacked in December 2018 following a series of disagreements with the board over transfers and a run of miserable results. The 2017 League Cup, secured with a 3-2 win over Southampton, wasn’t the platform it was supposed to be, and it has since been consigned to history as a rare good day during the post-Sir Alex Ferguson slump. Ferguson used the cup competitions — particularly success in the FA Cup in 1990 and the League Cup in 2006 — to trigger periods of sustained success. The question for Ten Hag is simple: how will his 2023 League Cup triumph be remembered? It’s easy with the benefit of hindsight but there were signs, even during the celebrations at Wembley in 2017, that all was not well with Mourinho at United. In fact, the second question in his winners’ news conference suggested as much. “Jose,” it started, “for someone who has just won a trophy, you don’t seem hugely exuberant or happy.” “I am very happy,” came Mourinho’s reply, delivered while wearing the face of a man who was anything but. “I am very happy. It’s important for the fans and for the players. I always try to put myself in a secondary position, but the reality is that it’s also important for me. It’s a relief.” The difference in Ten Hag’s demeanour on Sunday could not have been more different. After dancing on the pitch with Antony and Lisandro Martinez, he sat down for his news conference wearing a wide grin. He said broadly similar things to what Mourinho had said six years before — “If we keep going and working then we can win even more” — but he was in a buoyant-enough mood to make a joke, as he left having nearly forgotten to take the trophy with him. Ten Hag has cracked down on squad discipline since taking over last summer, but he has also ensured he has built a bond with his players and the fans, something it seemed Mourinho always struggled to do. In line with Carabao Cup rules, clubs do not have to hold prematch news conferences for any round prior to the semifinals and for the first time this season, United used the time to invite supporters to come to the training base at Carrington and put their own questions to Ten Hag. Fans from all over the world took up the opportunity and each time, it went down well. Mourinho might have understood his task at Old Trafford, but Ten Hag, it seems, understands the club.After winning the League Cup and the Europa League in his first season, Mourinho finished second in the Premier League in his second year and lost in the FA Cup final to Chelsea. It was at that point, however, that his reign began to unravel. He had already lost patience with star player Paul Pogba and during the summer of 2018, he became increasingly frustrated by the club’s transfer business. Having decided he wanted to move on Anthony Martial, Mourinho was convinced the idea was blocked because the French forward was club co-chairman Joel Glazer’s favourite player. Mourinho also asked to sign a new centre-back, but was told that targets Harry Maguire and Jerome Boateng were too expensive and too old and injury-prone, respectively. Transfers can be contentious for any manager and Ten Hag will have to be careful in the way he navigates the summer window so as not to fall into the same trap as Mourinho. After making such a huge step forward in his first season, there will be an expectation for United to make a genuine title challenge and the Dutchman will quite rightly want a squad capable of delivering. Ten Hag has not been shy in pushing for more players — winger Antony last summer, forward Wout Weghorst and midfielder Marcel Sabitzer in January — and will do so again, but as Mourinho learned to his cost, there can be danger when you overstep the mark. Because of financial fair play concerns, United are planning a summer spend of between £100m and £200m, and it will be football director John Murtough’s job to balance Ten Hag’s demands with the club’s financial constraints. A new striker, in particular, is vital if United are going to reach the next level. Mourinho thought the League Cup would provide a first taste of success for a team destined for bigger and better things and the fans at Wembley that day probably thought the same. That it didn’t provides an apt reminder for Ten Hag — not that he needs one — that there’s work to do to complete his Old Trafford revolution and get United back to the top table in both England and Europe. Mourinho’s League Cup turned out to be nothing more than a brief highlight. Ten Hag wants his to be the start of a series of them.

Sri Lanka had declared on 274 for four after the top and middle order batters had spent some useful time in the middle and New Zealand Board XI were 141 for one at stumps on day one. Not a single ball was bowled yesterday due to heavy rain and play was called off early. Kusal Mendis smashed a quick-fire 95 that came off 87 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. Mendis shared a 162 runs stand with Oshada Fernando, who opened batting and made 78. All Sri Lanka’s batters spent useful time in the middle before the innings was declared. Angelo Mathews batted at number four and made 38 off 67 balls while Dinesh Chandimal scored 35 off 45 balls. Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella didn’t get a chance to bat. Sri Lanka’s top seven is pretty much settled and they are unlikely to make any changes to the batting unit and it’s the bowling attack they need to figure out. Quicks Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando and Lahiru Kumara bowled some decent spells and Kumara was the only wicket taker. Sri Lanka are likely to play only three quicks in the Test series but some feel that they are better off with all four quicks in with Dhananjaya de Silva being the lone spinner. The selectors are unlikely to follow that bold step. The Test series is viral for Sri Lanka as a 2-0 series win will give them a slot in the World Test Championship final later this year at The Oval during the English summer. But it’s quite a tough task as in the history Sri Lanka have been to New Zealand on ten Test tours and have just won two Tests. Unlike in white ball cricket, the Test team has been far more consistent and the ability of fast bowlers to run through sides has been a notable feature. The teams will move to north island for the second Test with Basin Reserve in Wellington hosting the game. It was at this venue Sri Lanka won the 2006 Test with Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva scoring hundreds. Muttiah Muralitharan claimed a match bag of ten wickets. It was also at the Basin Reserve Aravinda de Silva produced his career best 267 during the 1991 tour. In the same game Martin Crowe was dismissed for 299. Published on By Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year. Curran took 4 for 29 in the second ODI against Bangladesh on Friday, including a devastating burst of 3 for 19 in five overs with the new ball, as England sealed the series with one game to play. He also struck 33 off 19 with the bat to provide a timely reminder of his all-round abilities in the format where he has most struggled to pin down a regular spot. With Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer rested after the first match of the series, England were able to call on Curran and Saqib Mahmood, who was making his first international appearance since his Test debut in the Caribbean a year ago, having recovered from a back stress fracture. England could also select another World Cup-winner in Mark Wood, while Reece Topley and Olly Stone – who missed the tour of Bangladesh due to being part of the Test squad out in New Zealand – have recently returned to contention after injury problems. Throw in the likes of David Willey, Brydon Carse, Matthew Potts and Luke Wood, and England can hope to have a strong pool of seamers to pick from for the World Cup. “It is a quality squad at the moment,” Curran said. “There are a lot of guys who have been on the Test tour who will come back in. Any time you play in a team for England you want to put in a performance but it shows we’ve got a great squad with Jof, Woakes, Woody being back now as well. “Everyone has had a tough year with injuries and everyone is pleased to see the quality of the bowlers we have around. You saw how great the Test team were bowling as well. “It is an exciting time and hopefully we can give the captain and coach some good decisions to make but right now I’m sure the bowlers just want to keep performing and be in that 15 for the World Cup. Conditions will dictate if there is extra pace or extra spin, so it is about enjoying it and not putting on too much pressure.” Curran was Player of the Tournament when England lifted the T20 World Cup in Australia last year, carving out a well-defined role as one of the side’s go-to death bowlers during the lead-up to the competition. His left-arm angle, ability to swing the new ball and then fall back on his variations later in the innings – not to mention his hyper-aggressive approach with the bat – should make him a strong candidate to be part of the group in India, where he has a wealth of IPL experience. His overall record in ODIs remains underwhelming, with 24 wickets in 22 appearances at an average of 37.29. In 2022, that blew out to four wickets at 72.65, having been largely used at first or second change; but in Mirpur he took the new ball for only the second time in 12 appearances and promptly produced his second-best figures (his maiden five-for, against Sri Lanka in 2021, also came when opening the bowling). “It is a nice time to bowl as a seam bowler because you get swing and movement but it is tricky as well because you have to be on the money and start really well because the white ball doesn’t swing for that long,” Curran said. “In these conditions, your cutters, your slower balls and cross-seam deliveries may become useful as well. It is about adjusting and seeing what is in front of you.

Put into bat, the Swamis amassed a decent total of 200 runs for the loss 7 wickets, with openers Rushab and Alex Obanda anchoring their innings with 52 and 60 runs apiece, which set the mood for their cup victory. Yash Bhatt (23), Mitesh Sanghani (17) and Harendra Kerai (10 not out) chipped in with useful cameos to help Swamis post an imposing total. Sikh Union “A” (155-7) won the toss and elected to bowl, a decision they didn’t regret either. The Simba’s, led by their indefatigable Skipper and opener Sukhdeep Singh (34) got off to a flying start with middle order batsman Osama Aslam smashing a cool 53; though their spirited chase suffered rapid collapse of wickets at some point. Rushab was all smiles and here is what he had to say: “Winning a tournament is always a great feeling. We came very close, we shared the trophy last year with Kanbis and we deserved to win as we have played some very competitive cricket in the T20 League.” “As I had said before, the essence was to execute our plans and I must admit that my teammates did a fantastic job throughout the season. We have just been looking to take each team game by game and make sure we have our processes and plans in order and per each opposition.” “I am a very strong believer of plans and execution, and the moment we started doing that as a unit we started to gel well and found the chemistry in our batting unit as well” Rushab’s counterpart Sukhdeep expounded on their fairy tale season of the T20 League: “I think it has been quite a few years we have not reached the final. Our positive was being here. We knew we had played good cricket throughout the tournament, but today was a day in which we did give about 15 extra runs., which is quite a lot in T-20 Cricket” Asked about their losing experience in the final, Sukhdeep continued: “I would say it’s not hurting as much, because we have played some good cricket through and through. We saw our Senior club officials, fans and family cheer us on and it was a privilege ruffling feathers in their presence” “We won the toss and had planned to bowl. One thing about our team is that we have been chasing really well, hence the decision to bowl first. Sikh Union is now back, but we are also developing the youngsters as well.” An elated Sikh Union Club Vice Chairman Hardial Singh Kalsi, better known as “Dali”Kalsi in the Motorsport arena in Kenya, congratulated his boys saying: “We are on the path of development of our game and I am glad that our Sikh Union Cricket Academy under the watchful eye of Avtar Singh Kundi is now bearing fruits with the engagement of our youngsters.” The T20 season, traditionally a precursor to the 50-Overs Knockout Tournament also saw several players feted for their exemplary performances. Kenya’s leg-spinning all-rounder in the 2003 World Cup Collins Obuya of Obuya Academy was named the player of the tournament whilst 10-year-old Kavit Joshi of Sikh Union took the accolade for the best youngster.

गुजरात ने। लेकिन इन दोनों मैचों में कुछ ऐसा हुआ जो शायद ही कभी किसी टी20 लीग के इतिहास में हुआ हो। यूं तो टी20 लीग को बल्लबाजों और उनके तेजी से रन बनाने के लिए जाना जाता है। लेकिन महिला प्रीमियर लीग ने इसके उलट एक लोगो को मैच देखने का नया नजरिया दे डाला है। दरअसल आज खेले गए दोनों मैचों में कुछ ऐसा हुआ जिसे देख फैंस हैरान रह गए। पहले मैच में दिल्ली के बल्लेबाजों ने 223 रन तो बनाए। लेकिन दूसरी पारी में दिल्ली के गेंदबाजों ने भी अपना दम दिखाया। दिल्ली की गेंदबाज टारा नॉरिज ने पांच विकेट लिया। उनकी शानदार गेंदबाजी के लिए उन्हें प्लेयर ऑफ द मैच भी चुना गया। कुछ ऐसा ही दिन के दूसरे मैच में भी देखने को मिला। गुजरात के बल्लेबाजों ने पहली पारी में 169 रन बनाए, तो उनके गेंदबाजों ने भी दिखा दिया कि वह किसी से कम नहीं और टीम की तेज गेंदबाज किम गार्थ ने पांच विकेट ले लिया। टी20 लीग के इतिहास में शायद ही ऐसा कभी हुआ होगा कि एक दिन खेले गए दो अन्य मुकाबलों में दो गेंदबाजों ने पांच-पांच विकेट लिए हो। बल्लेबाज मैच में अपना दम दिखा रहे हैं तो गेंदबाज भी अपना जलवा दिखाने से पीछ नहीं हट रहे हैं। दोनों मैचों में गेंदबाजों ने यह दिखा दिया कि वह किसी से कम नहीं है और टी20 जैसे फॉर्मेट में भी वह दर्शकों को अपने प्रदर्शन से इंटरटेन कर सकते हैं। WPL के पहले मैच भी गेंदबाजों ने कमाल किया था। जब मुंबई इंडियंस ने गुजरात जायंट्स को 64 रन पर ऑलआउट कर दिया था।","pubDate":"2023-03-05

After they were put to bat Nalanda lost three wickets but the middle order lived up to their reputation to post their eventual total. Published on By Alex Carey admitted he feared the worst after Rohit Sharma was given two lives in the first over of the Indore Test when Australia opted not to review for a nick and an lbw, but was delighted to play his part in ensuring the India captain did not inflict major damage. Carey’s stumping of Rohit in the sixth over, Matt Kuhnemann’s first wicket of the match, was picked out as a key moment by head coach Andrew McDonald who lauded Carey’s glovework on a tough pitch for wicketkeeping. Having beaten Rohit with one which spun sharply to beat the edge, Kuhnemann then drew him down the pitch and another ragging delivery presented Carey with a stumping opportunity but he had to navigate some significant bounce to ensure the dismissal was completed. “Instinct takes over when you see a ball bounce like that,” Carey said. “I don’t think many of us were expecting an eight-degree turning ball that early in the game. But it was nice to hold onto that and for us to get a bit of momentum. “Once the big screen showed the nick [in the first over], I thought he [Rohit] might have settled in for a nice 150 or something like that. It was challenging conditions throughout the match, but it was nice to get that one away and for us to get on a bit of a roll after that.” Carey was exceptional with the gloves throughout the match, conceding just three byes on a surface with uneven bounce, and has been impressive all series. Conditions in Indore were comparable to those he faced in the first Test in Galle last year when he was struck on the helmet by a Nathan Lyon delivery that exploded off the surface. It continued the development of his keeping after some initial struggles on the low surfaces in Pakistan last year and a handful of missed chances early in his Test career. This time, he had some bruises on his shoulders to show for his efforts. “It’s fun being out there, it’s challenging for everyone, and it’s great to be on the right end of this one,” he said. “Balls are going to explode off lengths and even Starcy bowled a half volley that exploded up, so you’re out there reacting to what you see. “In terms of our sundries, it was nice to reduce those and it can turn out to be an extra batter at times. You don’t really think about it at the time, you probably think back and go ‘that was pretty good’, but a few nice little bruises as well just to get the body behind it.” Australia lower-order struggles Though Australia got over the line outstandingly in Indore, they did suffer another collapse, losing 6 for 11 on the second day when there was a more substantial lead in the offing. It continued a trend where the lower order has struggled to contribute, an area in which India have excelled, with Pat Cummins’ 33 in Delhi the only significant score among the bowlers. From No. 8 onwards, India’s have scored 307 runs at 25.58 in the series compared to Australia’s 84 and 4.94. In Australia’s defence, conditions have been extremely tough, especially in Delhi and Indore, even for top-order batters. Axar Patel could easily command a place higher up the order, and his position at No. 8 or 9 highlights India’s batting depth. Even in the third Test when it ultimately did not make a difference, while Cheteshwar Pujara and Axar were together, there was a chance Australia could have had a much tougher chase. “I think it’s one of those things where it’s so hard to start for any player, so we’re asking guys to play in different environments,” Carey said. “I think if we go out and try to slog and get a few runs that way [and] if it goes pear-shaped, we’re happy to live with that. If they go out and try to survive for the [top-order] batter, we know that there’s a ball with their name on it. “We know that we haven’t given enough with the tail. We also understand that India’s batting line-up is very, very strong. So they bat all the way down to No. 10 really. We’ll have those conversations about how we can navigate and try to get 10-15 runs each more.” Carey himself also knows he needs to contribute more after four low scores following his 36 in Nagpur. “I had some confidence out of the first game and then getting out defending [in Indore]. Am I happy with that? Not really,” he said. “So back my strength and try to score with the sweeps and manipulate a little bit more that way. Looking forward to another opportunity in Ahmedabad and get down and maybe get the broom out again.”","pubDate":"2023-03-06 00:01:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sam Curran eager to state World Cup case as competition ramps up","link":"http://island.lk/sam-curran-eager-to-state-world-cup-case-as-competition-ramps-up/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Thilina Walpola"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year.

Curran took 4 for 29 in the second ODI against Bangladesh on Friday, including a devastating burst of 3 for 19 in five overs with the new ball, as England sealed the series with one game to play. He also struck 33 off 19 with the bat to provide a timely reminder of his all-round abilities in the format where he has most struggled to pin down a regular spot. With Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer rested after the first match of the series, England were able to call on Curran and Saqib Mahmood, who was making his first international appearance since his Test debut in the Caribbean a year ago, having recovered from a back stress fracture. England could also select another World Cup-winner in Mark Wood, while Reece Topley and Olly Stone – who missed the tour of Bangladesh due to being part of the Test squad out in New Zealand – have recently returned to contention after injury problems. Throw in the likes of David Willey, Brydon Carse, Matthew Potts and Luke Wood, and England can hope to have a strong pool of seamers to pick from for the World Cup. “It is a quality squad at the moment,” Curran said. “There are a lot of guys who have been on the Test tour who will come back in. Any time you play in a team for England you want to put in a performance but it shows we’ve got a great squad with Jof, Woakes, Woody being back now as well. “Everyone has had a tough year with injuries and everyone is pleased to see the quality of the bowlers we have around. You saw how great the Test team were bowling as well. “It is an exciting time and hopefully we can give the captain and coach some good decisions to make but right now I’m sure the bowlers just want to keep performing and be in that 15 for the World Cup. Conditions will dictate if there is extra pace or extra spin, so it is about enjoying it and not putting on too much pressure.” Curran was Player of the Tournament when England lifted the T20 World Cup in Australia last year, carving out a well-defined role as one of the side’s go-to death bowlers during the lead-up to the competition. His left-arm angle, ability to swing the new ball and then fall back on his variations later in the innings – not to mention his hyper-aggressive approach with the bat – should make him a strong candidate to be part of the group in India, where he has a wealth of IPL experience. His overall record in ODIs remains underwhelming, with 24 wickets in 22 appearances at an average of 37.29. In 2022, that blew out to four wickets at 72.65, having been largely used at first or second change; but in Mirpur he took the new ball for only the second time in 12 appearances and promptly produced his second-best figures (his maiden five-for, against Sri Lanka in 2021, also came when opening the bowling). “It is a nice time to bowl as a seam bowler because you get swing and movement but it is tricky as well because you have to be on the money and start really well because the white ball doesn’t swing for that long,” Curran said. “In these conditions, your cutters, your slower balls and cross-seam deliveries may become useful as well. It is about adjusting and seeing what is in front of you. (cricinfo) Published on By Coming to the annual Big Match as underdogs, Ananda needed their inexperienced batting lineup to produce something special to be on par with their arch-rivals. Kithma Sithmal and Kanchana de Livera stood out for them producing just that as their vital knocks in the first innings helped them salvage pride against Nalanda at the annual encounter that ended in a draw at the SSC ground yesterday. In reply to Nalanda’s 280 for five wickets declared, Ananda posted 235 runs thanks largely to the batting efforts of Kithma Sithmal and Kanchana de Livera. Sithmal anchored the fragile batting lineup with a valiant knock of 90 runs. Livera departed after an aggressive knock of 43 runs which included seven fours. From then on Sithmal took it upen his shoulders to anchor the innings. His 184-ball innings helped Ananda survive for 87 overs and avoid the danger of being enforced the follow on as others failed to top 20 runs. He was also the beneficiary of two costly fielding mishaps. However, his marathon innings left only a session for the two teams to battle it out in the second innings. For the second time in the match, Nalanda declared their innings for the loss of five wickets. They had a lead of 166 runs. Chasing a rather unlikely target Ananda were 22 for two wickets at stumps. For Nalanda Eranga Jayakodige did well in the batting department top scoring with 83 runs. After they were put to bat Nalanda lost three wickets but the middle order lived up to their reputation to post their eventual total. Published on By Alex Carey admitted he feared the worst after Rohit Sharma was given two lives in the first over of the Indore Test when Australia opted not to review for a nick and an lbw, but was delighted to play his part in ensuring the India captain did not inflict major damage. Carey’s stumping of Rohit in the sixth over, Matt Kuhnemann’s first wicket of the match, was picked out as a key moment by head coach Andrew McDonald who lauded Carey’s glovework on a tough pitch for wicketkeeping. Having beaten Rohit with one which spun sharply to beat the edge, Kuhnemann then drew him down the pitch and another ragging delivery presented Carey with a stumping opportunity but he had to navigate some significant bounce to ensure the dismissal was completed. “Instinct takes over when you see a ball bounce like that,” Carey said. “I don’t think many of us were expecting an eight-degree turning ball that early in the game. But it was nice to hold onto that and for us to get a bit of momentum. “Once the big screen showed the nick [in the first over], I thought he [Rohit] might have settled in for a nice 150 or something like that. It was challenging conditions throughout the match, but it was nice to get that one away and for us to get on a bit of a roll after that.” Carey was exceptional with the gloves throughout the match, conceding just three byes on a surface with uneven bounce, and has been impressive all series. Conditions in Indore were comparable to those he faced in the first Test in Galle last year when he was struck on the helmet by a Nathan Lyon delivery that exploded off the surface. It continued the development of his keeping after some initial struggles on the low surfaces in Pakistan last year and a handful of missed chances early in his Test career. This time, he had some bruises on his shoulders to show for his efforts. “It’s fun being out there, it’s challenging for everyone, and it’s great to be on the right end of this one,” he said. “Balls are going to explode off lengths and even Starcy bowled a half volley that exploded up, so you’re out there reacting to what you see. “In terms of our sundries, it was nice to reduce those and it can turn out to be an extra batter at times. You don’t really think about it at the time, you probably think back and go ‘that was pretty good’, but a few nice little bruises as well just to get the body behind it.” Australia lower-order struggles Though Australia got over the line outstandingly in Indore, they did suffer another collapse, losing 6 for 11 on the second day when there was a more substantial lead in the offing. It continued a trend where the lower order has struggled to contribute, an area in which India have excelled, with Pat Cummins’ 33 in Delhi the only significant score among the bowlers. From No. 8 onwards, India’s have scored 307 runs at 25.58 in the series compared to Australia’s 84 and 4.94. In Australia’s defence, conditions have been extremely tough, especially in Delhi and Indore, even for top-order batters. Axar Patel could easily command a place higher up the order, and his position at No. 8 or 9 highlights India’s batting depth. Even in the third Test when it ultimately did not make a difference, while Cheteshwar Pujara and Axar were together, there was a chance Australia could have had a much tougher chase. “I think it’s one of those things where it’s so hard to start for any player, so we’re asking guys to play in different environments,” Carey said. “I think if we go out and try to slog and get a few runs that way [and] if it goes pear-shaped, we’re happy to live with that.

Looking forward to another opportunity in Ahmedabad and get down and maybe get the broom out again.” Published on By Historic tweets from Michael Vaughan took centre stage on the third day of the ECB’s racism hearings, as the former England captain denied having made the statement that forms the core of the ECB’s charge of bringing the game into disrepute. As he has done publicly before, Vaughan emphatically denied ever having said, “There’s too many of you lot, we need to have a word about that” to Azeem Rafiq, Adil Rashid, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Ajmal Shahzad at a T20 game in June 2009. The ECB’s charge stems from Rafiq’s recollection of the remark which was, on Thursday, supported by the testimony of Rashid. Vaughan, appearing at the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) hearing in London, said of the day in question that he had “a very clear mind about back in 2009” and that he knew he did not say what had been alleged. He added that he would never have gone on to the field and said something to team-mates that could “put them in a bad state of mind” before the game. “Knowing me in 2009, that’s not the sort of thing I would’ve said.” Vaughan was questioned by the ECB’s lead counsel Jane Mulcahy KC for nearly 90 minutes, during which she argued that some historical tweets of his were “remarkably similar in tone” to the alleged remarks. Vaughan said the tweets were unacceptable and that he had apologised for them before and would continue to do so. But he disagreed with the suggestion that they were similar in tone. Mulcahy pointed out that both Rafiq and Rashid claimed Vaughan likely made the alleged comment as a “bad joke” and said the tweet was similar in tone because it was “lighthearted but offensive”. Asked if he agreed, Vaughan said: “No.” Vaughan said he was “disgusted” with the tweets. “I apologised for them. I put myself on an online course, Inclusion. I wanted to lead the game in knowing how to lead in modern times. The tweets are disgusting, awful, and other words you could use. But the most important thing is I have said sorry and I am learning from them. As I say, if I get things wrong in my life, I stick my hands up.” He went back to his recollection of the day of the game – which he has written about in his memoir – that he “could not have been more proud [of] four Asian players, three of whom had come through the system.” Vaughan was also questioned about his meeting with Rafiq in November 2021 saying he felt the need for it because “the whole situation was escalating out of control”. Vaughan said he was apologetic in the meeting with Rafiq because he was “disgusted” by what Rafiq had to go through at Yorkshire but did not accept he made the alleged comment. Vaughan said that the CDC hearing was a “terrible look” for cricket. “It’s not been easy for anybody. This is not the right process to deal with word-against-word comments from 14 years ago. Ex-team-mates fighting it out over hearsay is a terrible look for the game and a really bad look on how cricket has dealt with this situation.” Earlier in the morning, scrutiny fell on the ECB’s scope in the investigation of the incident as well as the rigour deployed, with Meena Botros, its director of legal and integrity, facing a three-hour grilling from Christopher Stoner, Vaughan’s lawyer. The line of questioning took in a recent interview with Lord Kamlesh Patel, the outgoing Yorkshire chair, in Eastern Eye. In it the claim was made that the ECB had “urged” Lord Patel to “get rid of people” at the county when he took over. Talking about his role, Patel said: “I was asked by the ECB to meet a set of criteria that most people would have winced at, would have thought there’s no way we can deliver this, and I delivered it. “I was asked by the ECB to work with them to create a framework and an environment where we would prove to the world that we want a non-racist institution, and I did all that. I was asked by the ECB to ensure some people who were there from the previous regime did not take part in that governance process, very clear about that.” Stoner suggested those comments showed that the ECB was “actively involved” in the Yorkshire investigation, in breach of the process as described in Botros’ witness statement, that the ECB remained independent of action being taken by one of its counties in such matters. Botros said he couldn’t talk about what Lord Patel had said but insisted that Stoner was “mistaking” the ECB’s regulatory function in getting involved, from its other roles in such cases. Stoner pointed to Botros’s witness statement which read: “In its capacity as a regulator, the ECB must remain independent of action being taken by one of its member first-class county clubs.” “That’s just not what happened, is it?” Stoner asked. Botros replied: “It is what happened.” Stoner then zeroed in on the day Vaughan is alleged to have made the remark, questioning whether the ECB could and should have gone further in its investigations of events. He confirmed with Botros that the only players the ECB had spoken to about the incident were Adil Rashid and Ajmal Shahzad. Stoner asked why all Yorkshire players that day weren’t spoken to. Botros said the ECB “did speak to the individuals where we were able to” but that “certain individuals either didn’t want to take part or engage”, or that the ECB “weren’t able” to get contact details for others. Stoner also asked Botros why the on-field umpires that day had not been contacted by the ECB for their version of events. “There is no suggestion that the umpires were close enough to hear it,” Botros replied. Botros added that if it was such an important point, Vaughan’s team could have taken it on themselves. The hearing is scheduled to end next Tuesday.

Published on By There was much disappointment for Sri Lanka’s players as the entire day two’s play of their warm-up game against New Zealand Board XI at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln was called off due to rain yesterday. This was Sri Lanka’s only warm-up game ahead of the two match Test series against New Zealand that gets underway on Thursday in Christchurch. Sri Lanka had declared on 274 for four after the top and middle order batters had spent some useful time in the middle and New Zealand Board XI were 141 for one at stumps on day one. Not a single ball was bowled yesterday due to heavy rain and play was called off early. Kusal Mendis smashed a quick-fire 95 that came off 87 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. Mendis shared a 162 runs stand with Oshada Fernando, who opened batting and made 78. All Sri Lanka’s batters spent useful time in the middle before the innings was declared. Angelo Mathews batted at number four and made 38 off 67 balls while Dinesh Chandimal scored 35 off 45 balls. Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella didn’t get a chance to bat. Sri Lanka’s top seven is pretty much settled and they are unlikely to make any changes to the batting unit and it’s the bowling attack they need to figure out. Quicks Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando and Lahiru Kumara bowled some decent spells and Kumara was the only wicket taker. Sri Lanka are likely to play only three quicks in the Test series but some feel that they are better off with all four quicks in with Dhananjaya de Silva being the lone spinner. The selectors are unlikely to follow that bold step. The Test series is viral for Sri Lanka as a 2-0 series win will give them a slot in the World Test Championship final later this year at The Oval during the English summer. But it’s quite a tough task as in the history Sri Lanka have been to New Zealand on ten Test tours and have just won two Tests. Unlike in white ball cricket, the Test team has been far more consistent and the ability of fast bowlers to run through sides has been a notable feature. The teams will move to north island for the second Test with Basin Reserve in Wellington hosting the game. It was at this venue Sri Lanka won the 2006 Test with Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva scoring hundreds. Muttiah Muralitharan claimed a match bag of ten wickets. It was also at the Basin Reserve Aravinda de Silva produced his career best 267 during the 1991 tour. In the same game Martin Crowe was dismissed for 299. Published on By Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year. Curran took 4 for 29 in the second ODI against Bangladesh on Friday, including a devastating burst of 3 for 19 in five overs with the new ball, as England sealed the series with one game to play.

If they go out and try to survive for the [top-order] batter, we know that there’s a ball with their name on it. “We know that we haven’t given enough with the tail. We also understand that India’s batting line-up is very, very strong. So they bat all the way down to No. 10 really. We’ll have those conversations about how we can navigate and try to get 10-15 runs each more.” Carey himself also knows he needs to contribute more after four low scores following his 36 in Nagpur. “I had some confidence out of the first game and then getting out defending [in Indore]. Am I happy with that? Not really,” he said. “So back my strength and try to score with the sweeps and manipulate a little bit more that way. Looking forward to another opportunity in Ahmedabad and get down and maybe get the broom out again.” Published on By There was much disappointment for Sri Lanka’s players as the entire day two’s play of their warm-up game against New Zealand Board XI at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln was called off due to rain yesterday. This was Sri Lanka’s only warm-up game ahead of the two match Test series against New Zealand that gets underway on Thursday in Christchurch. Sri Lanka had declared on 274 for four after the top and middle order batters had spent some useful time in the middle and New Zealand Board XI were 141 for one at stumps on day one. Not a single ball was bowled yesterday due to heavy rain and play was called off early. Kusal Mendis smashed a quick-fire 95 that came off 87 balls with 16 fours and two sixes. Mendis shared a 162 runs stand with Oshada Fernando, who opened batting and made 78. All Sri Lanka’s batters spent useful time in the middle before the innings was declared. Angelo Mathews batted at number four and made 38 off 67 balls while Dinesh Chandimal scored 35 off 45 balls. Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella didn’t get a chance to bat. Sri Lanka’s top seven is pretty much settled and they are unlikely to make any changes to the batting unit and it’s the bowling attack they need to figure out. Quicks Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando and Lahiru Kumara bowled some decent spells and Kumara was the only wicket taker. Sri Lanka are likely to play only three quicks in the Test series but some feel that they are better off with all four quicks in with Dhananjaya de Silva being the lone spinner. The selectors are unlikely to follow that bold step. The Test series is viral for Sri Lanka as a 2-0 series win will give them a slot in the World Test Championship final later this year at The Oval during the English summer. But it’s quite a tough task as in the history Sri Lanka have been to New Zealand on ten Test tours and have just won two Tests. Unlike in white ball cricket, the Test team has been far more consistent and the ability of fast bowlers to run through sides has been a notable feature. The teams will move to north island for the second Test with Basin Reserve in Wellington hosting the game. It was at this venue Sri Lanka won the 2006 Test with Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva scoring hundreds. Muttiah Muralitharan claimed a match bag of ten wickets. It was also at the Basin Reserve Aravinda de Silva produced his career best 267 during the 1991 tour. In the same game Martin Crowe was dismissed for 299. Published on By Sam Curran has hailed the competition for places among England’s white-ball seam attack as Jos Buttler’s squad builds towards the defence of their 50-over World Cup title in India later this year. Curran took 4 for 29 in the second ODI against Bangladesh on Friday, including a devastating burst of 3 for 19 in five overs with the new ball, as England sealed the series with one game to play. He also struck 33 off 19 with the bat to provide a timely reminder of his all-round abilities in the format where he has most struggled to pin down a regular spot. With Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer rested after the first match of the series, England were able to call on Curran and Saqib Mahmood, who was making his first international appearance since his Test debut in the Caribbean a year ago, having recovered from a back stress fracture. England could also select another World Cup-winner in Mark Wood, while Reece Topley and Olly Stone – who missed the tour of Bangladesh due to being part of the Test squad out in New Zealand – have recently returned to contention after injury problems. Throw in the likes of David Willey, Brydon Carse, Matthew Potts and Luke Wood, and England can hope to have a strong pool of seamers to pick from for the World Cup. “It is a quality squad at the moment,” Curran said. “There are a lot of guys who have been on the Test tour who will come back in. Any time you play in a team for England you want to put in a performance but it shows we’ve got a great squad with Jof, Woakes, Woody being back now as well. “Everyone has had a tough year with injuries and everyone is pleased to see the quality of the bowlers we have around. You saw how great the Test team were bowling as well. “It is an exciting time and hopefully we can give the captain and coach some good decisions to make but right now I’m sure the bowlers just want to keep performing and be in that 15 for the World Cup. Conditions will dictate if there is extra pace or extra spin, so it is about enjoying it and not putting on too much pressure.” Curran was Player of the Tournament when England lifted the T20 World Cup in Australia last year, carving out a well-defined role as one of the side’s go-to death bowlers during the lead-up to the competition. His left-arm angle, ability to swing the new ball and then fall back on his variations later in the innings – not to mention his hyper-aggressive approach with the bat – should make him a strong candidate to be part of the group in India, where he has a wealth of IPL experience. His overall record in ODIs remains underwhelming, with 24 wickets in 22 appearances at an average of 37.29. In 2022, that blew out to four wickets at 72.65, having been largely used at first or second change; but in Mirpur he took the new ball for only the second time in 12 appearances and promptly produced his second-best figures (his maiden five-for, against Sri Lanka in 2021, also came when opening the bowling). “It is a nice time to bowl as a seam bowler because you get swing and movement but it is tricky as well because you have to be on the money and start really well because the white ball doesn’t swing for that long,” Curran said. “In these conditions, your cutters, your slower balls and cross-seam deliveries may become useful as well. It is about adjusting and seeing what is in front of you.

As he has done publicly before, Vaughan emphatically denied ever having said, “There’s too many of you lot, we need to have a word about that” to Azeem Rafiq, Adil Rashid, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Ajmal Shahzad at a T20 game in June 2009. The ECB’s charge stems from Rafiq’s recollection of the remark which was, on Thursday, supported by the testimony of Rashid. Vaughan, appearing at the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) hearing in London, said of the day in question that he had “a very clear mind about back in 2009” and that he knew he did not say what had been alleged. He added that he would never have gone on to the field and said something to team-mates that could “put them in a bad state of mind” before the game. “Knowing me in 2009, that’s not the sort of thing I would’ve said.” Vaughan was questioned by the ECB’s lead counsel Jane Mulcahy KC for nearly 90 minutes, during which she argued that some historical tweets of his were “remarkably similar in tone” to the alleged remarks. Vaughan said the tweets were unacceptable and that he had apologised for them before and would continue to do so. But he disagreed with the suggestion that they were similar in tone. Mulcahy pointed out that both Rafiq and Rashid claimed Vaughan likely made the alleged comment as a “bad joke” and said the tweet was similar in tone because it was “lighthearted but offensive”. Asked if he agreed, Vaughan said: “No.” Vaughan said he was “disgusted” with the tweets. “I apologised for them. I put myself on an online course, Inclusion. I wanted to lead the game in knowing how to lead in modern times. The tweets are disgusting, awful, and other words you could use. But the most important thing is I have said sorry and I am learning from them. As I say, if I get things wrong in my life, I stick my hands up.” He went back to his recollection of the day of the game – which he has written about in his memoir – that he “could not have been more proud [of] four Asian players, three of whom had come through the system.” Vaughan was also questioned about his meeting with Rafiq in November 2021 saying he felt the need for it because “the whole situation was escalating out of control”. Vaughan said he was apologetic in the meeting with Rafiq because he was “disgusted” by what Rafiq had to go through at Yorkshire but did not accept he made the alleged comment. Vaughan said that the CDC hearing was a “terrible look” for cricket. “It’s not been easy for anybody. This is not the right process to deal with word-against-word comments from 14 years ago. Ex-team-mates fighting it out over hearsay is a terrible look for the game and a really bad look on how cricket has dealt with this situation.” Earlier in the morning, scrutiny fell on the ECB’s scope in the investigation of the incident as well as the rigour deployed, with Meena Botros, its director of legal and integrity, facing a three-hour grilling from Christopher Stoner, Vaughan’s lawyer. The line of questioning took in a recent interview with Lord Kamlesh Patel, the outgoing Yorkshire chair, in Eastern Eye. In it the claim was made that the ECB had “urged” Lord Patel to “get rid of people” at the county when he took over. Talking about his role, Patel said: “I was asked by the ECB to meet a set of criteria that most people would have winced at, would have thought there’s no way we can deliver this, and I delivered it. “I was asked by the ECB to work with them to create a framework and an environment where we would prove to the world that we want a non-racist institution, and I did all that. I was asked by the ECB to ensure some people who were there from the previous regime did not take part in that governance process, very clear about that.” Stoner suggested those comments showed that the ECB was “actively involved” in the Yorkshire investigation, in breach of the process as described in Botros’ witness statement, that the ECB remained independent of action being taken by one of its counties in such matters. Botros said he couldn’t talk about what Lord Patel had said but insisted that Stoner was “mistaking” the ECB’s regulatory function in getting involved, from its other roles in such cases. Stoner pointed to Botros’s witness statement which read: “In its capacity as a regulator, the ECB must remain independent of action being taken by one of its member first-class county clubs.” “That’s just not what happened, is it?” Stoner asked. Botros replied: “It is what happened.” Stoner then zeroed in on the day Vaughan is alleged to have made the remark, questioning whether the ECB could and should have gone further in its investigations of events. He confirmed with Botros that the only players the ECB had spoken to about the incident were Adil Rashid and Ajmal Shahzad. Stoner asked why all Yorkshire players that day weren’t spoken to. Botros said the ECB “did speak to the individuals where we were able to” but that “certain individuals either didn’t want to take part or engage”, or that the ECB “weren’t able” to get contact details for others. Stoner also asked Botros why the on-field umpires that day had not been contacted by the ECB for their version of events. “There is no suggestion that the umpires were close enough to hear it,” Botros replied. Botros added that if it was such an important point, Vaughan’s team could have taken it on themselves. The hearing is scheduled to end next Tuesday.

My contract is long, so hopefully I can win something more.” These words sound a lot like something Erik ten Hag could have said in the aftermath of Manchester United’s Carabao Cup final victory against Newcastle on Sunday, but they belong to Jose Mourinho, who had been sat in the same seat in the Wembley news conference exactly six years earlier. Like Ten Hag, Mourinho lifted the League Cup in his first season as manager at Old Trafford and then spoke about wanting more. There was more to come from Mourinho in the elongated vase of the UEFA Europa League three months later, but a little over a year after that, Mourinho was gone, sacked in December 2018 following a series of disagreements with the board over transfers and a run of miserable results. The 2017 League Cup, secured with a 3-2 win over Southampton, wasn’t the platform it was supposed to be, and it has since been consigned to history as a rare good day during the post-Sir Alex Ferguson slump. Ferguson used the cup competitions — particularly success in the FA Cup in 1990 and the League Cup in 2006 — to trigger periods of sustained success. The question for Ten Hag is simple: how will his 2023 League Cup triumph be remembered? It’s easy with the benefit of hindsight but there were signs, even during the celebrations at Wembley in 2017, that all was not well with Mourinho at United. In fact, the second question in his winners’ news conference suggested as much. “Jose,” it started, “for someone who has just won a trophy, you don’t seem hugely exuberant or happy.” “I am very happy,” came Mourinho’s reply, delivered while wearing the face of a man who was anything but. “I am very happy. It’s important for the fans and for the players. I always try to put myself in a secondary position, but the reality is that it’s also important for me. It’s a relief.” The difference in Ten Hag’s demeanour on Sunday could not have been more different. After dancing on the pitch with Antony and Lisandro Martinez, he sat down for his news conference wearing a wide grin. He said broadly similar things to what Mourinho had said six years before — “If we keep going and working then we can win even more” — but he was in a buoyant-enough mood to make a joke, as he left having nearly forgotten to take the trophy with him. Ten Hag has cracked down on squad discipline since taking over last summer, but he has also ensured he has built a bond with his players and the fans, something it seemed Mourinho always struggled to do. In line with Carabao Cup rules, clubs do not have to hold prematch news conferences for any round prior to the semifinals and for the first time this season, United used the time to invite supporters to come to the training base at Carrington and put their own questions to Ten Hag. Fans from all over the world took up the opportunity and each time, it went down well. Mourinho might have understood his task at Old Trafford, but Ten Hag, it seems, understands the club.After winning the League Cup and the Europa League in his first season, Mourinho finished second in the Premier League in his second year and lost in the FA Cup final to Chelsea. It was at that point, however, that his reign began to unravel. He had already lost patience with star player Paul Pogba and during the summer of 2018, he became increasingly frustrated by the club’s transfer business. Having decided he wanted to move on Anthony Martial, Mourinho was convinced the idea was blocked because the French forward was club co-chairman Joel Glazer’s favourite player. Mourinho also asked to sign a new centre-back, but was told that targets Harry Maguire and Jerome Boateng were too expensive and too old and injury-prone, respectively. Transfers can be contentious for any manager and Ten Hag will have to be careful in the way he navigates the summer window so as not to fall into the same trap as Mourinho. After making such a huge step forward in his first season, there will be an expectation for United to make a genuine title challenge and the Dutchman will quite rightly want a squad capable of delivering. Ten Hag has not been shy in pushing for more players — winger Antony last summer, forward Wout Weghorst and midfielder Marcel Sabitzer in January — and will do so again, but as Mourinho learned to his cost, there can be danger when you overstep the mark. Because of financial fair play concerns, United are planning a summer spend of between £100m and £200m, and it will be football director John Murtough’s job to balance Ten Hag’s demands with the club’s financial constraints. A new striker, in particular, is vital if United are going to reach the next level. Mourinho thought the League Cup would provide a first taste of success for a team destined for bigger and better things and the fans at Wembley that day probably thought the same. That it didn’t provides an apt reminder for Ten Hag — not that he needs one — that there’s work to do to complete his Old Trafford revolution and get United back to the top table in both England and Europe. Mourinho’s League Cup turned out to be nothing more than a brief highlight. Ten Hag wants his to be the start of a series of them.

In 2022, that blew out to four wickets at 72.65, having been largely used at first or second change; but in Mirpur he took the new ball for only the second time in 12 appearances and promptly produced his second-best figures (his maiden five-for, against Sri Lanka in 2021, also came when opening the bowling). “It is a nice time to bowl as a seam bowler because you get swing and movement but it is tricky as well because you have to be on the money and start really well because the white ball doesn’t swing for that long,” Curran said. “In these conditions, your cutters, your slower balls and cross-seam deliveries may become useful as well. It is about adjusting and seeing what is in front of you. (cricinfo) Published on By Coming to the annual Big Match as underdogs, Ananda needed their inexperienced batting lineup to produce something special to be on par with their arch-rivals. Kithma Sithmal and Kanchana de Livera stood out for them producing just that as their vital knocks in the first innings helped them salvage pride against Nalanda at the annual encounter that ended in a draw at the SSC ground yesterday. In reply to Nalanda’s 280 for five wickets declared, Ananda posted 235 runs thanks largely to the batting efforts of Kithma Sithmal and Kanchana de Livera. Sithmal anchored the fragile batting lineup with a valiant knock of 90 runs. Livera departed after an aggressive knock of 43 runs which included seven fours. From then on Sithmal took it upen his shoulders to anchor the innings. His 184-ball innings helped Ananda survive for 87 overs and avoid the danger of being enforced the follow on as others failed to top 20 runs. He was also the beneficiary of two costly fielding mishaps. However, his marathon innings left only a session for the two teams to battle it out in the second innings. For the second time in the match, Nalanda declared their innings for the loss of five wickets. They had a lead of 166 runs. Chasing a rather unlikely target Ananda were 22 for two wickets at stumps. For Nalanda Eranga Jayakodige did well in the batting department top scoring with 83 runs. After they were put to bat Nalanda lost three wickets but the middle order lived up to their reputation to post their eventual total.","pubDate":"2023-03-05 23:40:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Skipper Rushab heaps praise on teammates as Swamis celebrate NPCA T20 title victory","link":"https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/2023/03/06/skipper-rushab-heaps-praise-on-teammates-as-swamis-celebrate-npca-t20-title-victory/","keywords":["Cricket","featured"],"creator":["Capital Sport"],"video_url":null,"description":"NAIROBI, Kenya, Mar 6 – Swamibapa “A” skipper Rushab Patel has sung the praises of his team mates, following their 2023 Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) T20 League title victory.

Put into bat, the Swamis amassed a decent total of 200 runs for the loss 7 wickets, with openers Rushab and Alex Obanda anchoring their innings with 52 and 60 runs apiece, which set the mood for their cup victory. Yash Bhatt (23), Mitesh Sanghani (17) and Harendra Kerai (10 not out) chipped in with useful cameos to help Swamis post an imposing total. Sikh Union “A” (155-7) won the toss and elected to bowl, a decision they didn’t regret either. The Simba’s, led by their indefatigable Skipper and opener Sukhdeep Singh (34) got off to a flying start with middle order batsman Osama Aslam smashing a cool 53; though their spirited chase suffered rapid collapse of wickets at some point. Rushab was all smiles and here is what he had to say: “Winning a tournament is always a great feeling. We came very close, we shared the trophy last year with Kanbis and we deserved to win as we have played some very competitive cricket in the T20 League.” “As I had said before, the essence was to execute our plans and I must admit that my teammates did a fantastic job throughout the season. We have just been looking to take each team game by game and make sure we have our processes and plans in order and per each opposition.” “I am a very strong believer of plans and execution, and the moment we started doing that as a unit we started to gel well and found the chemistry in our batting unit as well” Rushab’s counterpart Sukhdeep expounded on their fairy tale season of the T20 League: “I think it has been quite a few years we have not reached the final. Our positive was being here. We knew we had played good cricket throughout the tournament, but today was a day in which we did give about 15 extra runs., which is quite a lot in T-20 Cricket” Asked about their losing experience in the final, Sukhdeep continued: “I would say it’s not hurting as much, because we have played some good cricket through and through. We saw our Senior club officials, fans and family cheer us on and it was a privilege ruffling feathers in their presence” “We won the toss and had planned to bowl. One thing about our team is that we have been chasing really well, hence the decision to bowl first. Sikh Union is now back, but we are also developing the youngsters as well.” An elated Sikh Union Club Vice Chairman Hardial Singh Kalsi, better known as “Dali”Kalsi in the Motorsport arena in Kenya, congratulated his boys saying: “We are on the path of development of our game and I am glad that our Sikh Union Cricket Academy under the watchful eye of Avtar Singh Kundi is now bearing fruits with the engagement of our youngsters.” The T20 season, traditionally a precursor to the 50-Overs Knockout Tournament also saw several players feted for their exemplary performances. Kenya’s leg-spinning all-rounder in the 2003 World Cup Collins Obuya of Obuya Academy was named the player of the tournament whilst 10-year-old Kavit Joshi of Sikh Union took the accolade for the best youngster. Ruaraka Sports Club’ run machine, Sachin Gill was declared the tournament’s best batsman while Swamibapa’ s Yash Bhatt and Dhwanil Patel were named the best bowler and wicket keeper

और रॉयल चैलेंजर्स बैंगलौर के बीच खेला गया। वहीं दूसरा मैच गुजरात जायंट्स और यूपी वॉरियर्स के बीच हुआ। इन दोनों मैचों में गेंदबाजों का जलवा रहा। पहला मैच दिल्ली की टीम ने जीता, वहीं दूसरा मुकाबला गुजरात ने। लेकिन इन दोनों मैचों में कुछ ऐसा हुआ जो शायद ही कभी किसी टी20 लीग के इतिहास में हुआ हो। यूं तो टी20 लीग को बल्लबाजों और उनके तेजी से रन बनाने के लिए जाना जाता है। लेकिन महिला प्रीमियर लीग ने इसके उलट एक लोगो को मैच देखने का नया नजरिया दे डाला है। दरअसल आज खेले गए दोनों मैचों में कुछ ऐसा हुआ जिसे देख फैंस हैरान रह गए। पहले मैच में दिल्ली के बल्लेबाजों ने 223 रन तो बनाए। लेकिन दूसरी पारी में दिल्ली के गेंदबाजों ने भी अपना दम दिखाया। दिल्ली की गेंदबाज टारा नॉरिज ने पांच विकेट लिया। उनकी शानदार गेंदबाजी के लिए उन्हें प्लेयर ऑफ द मैच भी चुना गया। कुछ ऐसा ही दिन के दूसरे मैच में भी देखने को मिला। गुजरात के बल्लेबाजों ने पहली पारी में 169 रन बनाए, तो उनके गेंदबाजों ने भी दिखा दिया कि वह किसी से कम नहीं और टीम की तेज गेंदबाज किम गार्थ ने पांच विकेट ले लिया। टी20 लीग के इतिहास में शायद ही ऐसा कभी हुआ होगा कि एक दिन खेले गए दो अन्य मुकाबलों में दो गेंदबाजों ने पांच-पांच विकेट लिए हो। बल्लेबाज मैच में अपना दम दिखा रहे हैं तो गेंदबाज भी अपना जलवा दिखाने से पीछ नहीं हट रहे हैं। दोनों मैचों में गेंदबाजों ने यह दिखा दिया कि वह किसी से कम नहीं है और टी20 जैसे फॉर्मेट में भी वह दर्शकों को अपने प्रदर्शन से इंटरटेन कर सकते हैं। WPL के पहले मैच भी गेंदबाजों ने कमाल किया था। जब मुंबई इंडियंस ने गुजरात जायंट्स को 64 रन पर ऑलआउट कर दिया था।","pubDate":"2023-03-05

उन्हें लगा कि यह गेंद वाइट जा रही है। फिर क्या था अंपायर ने रिव्यू में उस गेंद को वाइड करार दिया और मैच का मूमेंटम उनकी ओर मुड़ गया। गुजरात जायंट्स और यूपी वॉरियर्स के बीच खेले गए इस मुकाबले में
