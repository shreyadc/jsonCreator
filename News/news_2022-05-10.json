The 53rd match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will be played between the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) and the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the MCA Stadium in Pune. Having won all of their previous four matches, including a resounding 75-run victory against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in their last match, the LSG have stamped their authority in their maiden IPL season so far, and are currently placed right at the top of the points table. GT, on the other hand, have had a commendable maiden IPL season as well so far, as they are just behind LSG at the second spot in the table. However, having lost their previous two matches, the Hardik Pandya-led side will look to address their areas of concern as soon as possible, before their side enter the playoffs stage. Both GT and LSG are just one win away from entering the playoffs in only their debut season. Both the teams would play their third match at the MCA Stadium today. On the eve of #LSGvGT , the Titans look back at #GTvLSG , a perfect start to our #SeasonOfFirsts üòÅ That first ball from Shami bhai and more key moments, ‚ñ∂Ô∏è now on our website: https://t.co/RYhqUAgi3P #AavaDe pic.twitter.com/0dYWKphuLO ‚Äî Gujarat Titans (@gujarat_titans) May 9, 2022 The LSG pace quartet of Mohsin Khan, Dushmantha Chameera, Avesh Khan, and Jason Holder literally bounced the KKR batters Out during their 75-run victory against them during the previous match on this venue. Thus, expect the pacers to be right in the game especially during the Powerplay Overs. Having said that, the general nature of the pitch would be on the slower side, with the spinners (and the pacers as well) looking to bowl as slow as possible; thereby allowing the ball to grip and hold-up a bit. Last time around, the groundsman had removed the grass off the pitch, thereby exposing the black soil surface. In case that happens again today, expect the average score of 170 in at this venue so far, to be again on the cards.","pubDate":"2022-05-09 17:16:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄúMy husband is fire‚Äù: Jasprit Bumrah wife Sanjana Ganesan exults as Bumrah picks 5 wicket haul vs KKR","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-my-husband-is-fire-jasprit-bumrah-wife-sanjana-ganesan-exults-as-bumrah-picks-5-wicket-haul-vs-kkr/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","KKR","Mumbai Indians","Indian Premier League","Jasprit Bumrah","Kolkata Knight riders","MI"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jasprit Bumrah picks 5 wicket haul: The fast bowler from Mumbai Indians picked his maiden five-wicket haul in T20s tonight.

During the 56th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders in Navi Mumbai, Mumbai Indians fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah registered his maiden five-wicket haul in T20s. In what had been an unusual IPL season for Bumrah until tonight, there were multiple occasions where he failed to even pick a wicket. Introduced into the attack as a first-change bowler in the fourth over, Bumrah couldn‚Äôt pick a wicket in his only over in the powerplay. It was then in the 15th over that Mumbai captain Rohit Sharma brought back Bumrah into the attack. The right-arm bowler needed only a couple of deliveries to send back a danger man in Andre Russell (9). Wanting to play a slog Bumrah on as recent as the second delivery, all Russell did was mis-time the delivery to Kieron Pollard. Not looking in a mood to spare the opposition tonight, Bumrah dismissed Nitish Rana (43) in the same over to significantly dent the Knight Riders. The first four deliveries of Bumrah‚Äôs third over saw him picking as many as three wickets. In what was a maiden over, Bumrah sending back Sheldon Jackson (5), Pat Cummins (0) and Sunil Narine (0) to the pavilion prevented KKR from putting on board a formidable innings total. With pace and accuracy being at the helm, Bumrah didn‚Äôt provide any opportunity to the batters to stand a chance against him in the middle. Thus, cruising on his way to pick career-best bowling figures of 4-1-10-5 in the biggest T20 tournament in the world. Twitter reactions as Jasprit Bumrah picks 5 wicket haul vs KKR: Holy moly!

Adlington became Britain‚Äôs first Olympic swimming champion since 1988 when she won two gold medals in the 400-metre freestyle and 800-metre freestyle at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. [‚Ä¶]","content":"Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Rebecca Adlington has revealed she struggled after retirement as she opened up about her mental health battles to talkSPORT. Adlington became Britain‚Äôs first Olympic swimming champion since 1988 when she won two gold medals in the 400-metre freestyle and 800-metre freestyle at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. And she told talkSPORT that she first began to struggle with her mental health after winning those triumphs: Adlington said: ‚ÄúAfter Beijing that pressure just mounts, because you realise what the consequences are. ‚ÄúYou realise as an athlete this is what happens when you do win so when you don‚Äôt win it doesn‚Äôt come with this. ‚ÄúI think all of that sort of stuff started to happen after Beijing.‚Äù Adlington didn‚Äôt even know she needed help at the time. She revealed: ‚ÄúMy coach was actually the person that said to me after Beijing that I should get a sports psychologist. I was like ‚ÄòWhy, what‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äô ‚ÄúI sat down with one and I realised the absolute benefit with it. That became my security as well.‚Äù Following retirement at just 23 years old, having won two Olympic and Commonwealth golds as well as two bronzes in both competitions, Adlington a different struggle emerged. She added: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really know who I was. I was always Becky the swimmer. ‚ÄúThat was a big shift going from that, to ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm just Becky‚Äô, and I didn‚Äôt really know who Becky was.‚Äù Mental health issues among former professional sportsmen and women is a huge topic. In May 2021, an International Olympic Committee (IOC) report confirmed that 45 per cent of former athletes suffer from anxiety and depression after transitioning from sports. Former England and Durham cricketer Steve Harmison has his own view of the affects of leaving your trade. ‚ÄúRetirement was an eye opener,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou lose your identity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like coming out of a supermarket with a heavy bag of shopping and not knowing where your car is, and the shopping bags are getting heavier and heavier.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the person you used to be. For 18 years I got told what to do, where to be, what to wear, what time to be there, and, more often than not, what to eat to. Just off you go.‚Äù Out of the 92 professional football clubs in England‚Äôs top four tiers, there is only one professional psychotherapist whose sole job is to look after the mental well-being of players ‚Äì Oxford United‚Äôs Gary Bloom. ‚ÄúThe Professional Cricketers‚Äô Association have several schemes where their professional players are given opportunities to go into offices and organisations that give them experience of what it‚Äôs like to do another job,‚Äù Bloom said. ‚ÄúFootball lags behind by several years. ‚ÄúIf you think about the financial rewards of being a professional footballer, you don‚Äôt really need to do a great deal more once you get to the age of 33, 34, or 35, if you‚Äôve looked after your money. ‚ÄúSo the need to transition isn‚Äôt that great, but the psychological need is huge. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a massive problem for many ex-professional footballers.‚Äù Head of education and athlete engagement at Sporting Mind, Alex Mills, believes we‚Äôre starting to see more athletes willing to talk about their mental health. He said: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre comfortable talking about what‚Äôs going on in their brain if it relates to what‚Äôs going on the pitch. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre starting to see that shift where players are starting to feel more comfortable with talking about what‚Äôs going on between their ears in relation to their relationships at home and their relationships with other players, their self-esteem, their anger, their fears and their anxiety.‚Äù The case that alerted the world to the rising problem of mental illness in sport was that of 32-year-old Robert Enke , one of Germany‚Äôs leading football stars. In 2009 the goalkeeper, widely tipped to be Germany‚Äôs number one at the 2010 World Cup, passed away after walking in front of a train at a crossing near his home. Police later revealed that he‚Äôd left a suicide note. Enke‚Äôs wife Teresa said that he‚Äôd been tormented with depression for years, but had tried to hide his mental condition due to fears it would damage his professional career. Now sportstars feel able to be more open about their feelings. In 2021, tennis superstar Naomi Osaka pulled out of both the French Open and Wimbledon due to bouts of depression. Meanwhile, the most decorated and successful Olympian of all time, Michael Phelps, revealed that he suffered from depression after every Olympic Games. And Harmison speaks about his experiences of dealing with the illness with candour. He told talkSPORT: ‚ÄúOnce your careers done it‚Äôs done. ‚ÄúFrom an England point of view, you‚Äôre picked one minute and you‚Äôre not picked the next and out the door just as quickly as you came in it.‚Äù He said: ‚ÄúI was diagnosed with clinical depression in 2004.‚Äù And added: ‚ÄúYou can earn enough money as you want but you‚Äôve still got to occupy the mind.‚Äù Adlington advised any athlete looking for help to ‚Äò100 per cent do it‚Äô. She said: ‚ÄúGo and see somebody to talk to. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a sports psychologist or a therapist, it could be a teammate, it could be a member of your coaching staff or a senior member of staff, it could also be a friend. ‚ÄúJust reach out to somebody. I know so many past athletes will respond. ‚ÄúI guarantee there‚Äôll be someone there who can help you, it‚Äôs just that starting point.‚Äù","pubDate":"2022-05-09 16:12:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"FIFA wijst beroepen tegen overspelen Brazili√´ ‚Äì Argentini√´ af","link":"https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl/anp/fifa-wijst-beroepen-tegen-overspelen-brazilie-argentinie-af","keywords":["voetbal","voetbal-overig-nieuws-fifa"],"creator":["anp"],"video_url":null,"description":"ZURICH (ANP) - De FIFA heeft de beroepen van Brazili√´ en Argentini√´ tegen het overspelen van de onderlinge WK-kwalificatiewedstrijd afgewezen.

A full toss on middle, this is eased down to long on for one. 9.5 overs (1 Run) Good fielding! Shorter and outside off, Rana cuts it hard through point. The fielder runs to his right, slides and keeps it down to one. A good comeback so far by Pollard after going for a boundary on the first ball. Can he end it well now? 9.4 overs (1 Run) Shorter and on middle, Rahane plays the pull, it goes towards deep square leg for another single. 9.3 overs (1 Run) Rana steps out, the length is shortened, he guides it towards point for one. 9.2 overs (1 Run) Shorter and on middle, Rahane pulls it through square leg for one. 9.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! That is lovely placement! Shorter and outside off, Rahane waits and then guides it past point, this races away to the fence. Not the ideal line by Pollard with third man up. He is under pressure now. Drinks! Kolkata were scoring at a quick rate but after the Powerplay, runs dried up and both the batters are struggling now a bit. Credit to Mumbai for keeping it tight and they will hope to control the middle phase. Also, Kieron Pollard to have a bowl now. 8.6 overs (1 Run) On a length and on middle, this is pulled towards deep square leg for one. 8.5 overs (0 Run) NOT OUT! Rahane is in! Another dot though! Kumar Kartikeya slows it up and lands it outside off, Rahane looks to go over covers but this one turns away and he is beaten. Kishan whips the bails off and appeals. It is taken upstairs. They check if there is an edge first, Ultra Edge shows no spike and now they check whether Rahane is in the crease and he surely is. A stumping appeal! Rahane has a wild swing and misses. Kishan is quick to clip the bails off. UltraEdge shows no bat there. Rahane has his foot down and he survives. Not out. 8.4 overs (1 Run) Fuller one on leg, Nitish Rana tries to reverse sweep but gets a bottom edge. The ball rolls past Ishan Kishan but he has no idea where the ball is going. Single taken. 8.3 overs (0 Run) Fuller and on off, Nitish Rana eases it towards covers. 8.2 overs (1 Run) Fuller one on off, this is played towards mid wicket for one. 8.1 overs (0 Run) Flatter one outside off, Ajinkya Rahane tries to cut it but misses. 7.6 overs (1 Run) Flatter delivery, attacking the stumps and Rahane works it off the back foot down to wide long on for one more. 7.5 overs (1 Run) Around middle and leg, worked through mid-wicket for a run. 7.4 overs (0 Run) Huge appeal from the keeper but not given! This is pushed through quicker, closer to the off pole. Nitish Rana attempts the reverse sweep but misses and Ishan Kishan is up in an instant. Mumbai don't go for the review though. 7.3 overs (0 Run) On leg stump, Rana prods and nudges it gently on the leg side. 7.2 overs (1 Run) Smart batting, rotating the strike after a boundary. On off, pushed away towards covers for a quick single. 7.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Nicely done! Looped up down the leg side, Ajinkya Rahane gets down on one knee and paddles it really fine past the keeper and picks up a boundary down to fine leg. 6.6 overs (0 Run) Short of a length, angled into the body and Rana fails to get it away. 6.6 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Attempted slower ball, this is spilled way down the leg side, wide called. 6.5 overs (0 Run) This is angled into middle and leg, Rana looks to flick it away but gets hit on the body. 6.4 overs (0 Run) Good short ball from Sams, around off and Rana sways away from the line of the ball. 6.3 overs (2 Runs) Back of a length, on the pads. Rana tucks it behind square on the leg side for a couple of runs. 6.2 overs (0 Run) Shorter from Sams, on the body. Rana hops and keeps it down on the leg side. 6.1 overs (1 Run) This is floated up on the pads, Rahane lofts it up and over the mid-wicket region and picks up a single. Daniel Sams is back on. 5.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Full toss and punished! Around off, Rana smashes it through the cover region and gets off the mark with a boundary. 5.5 overs (0 Run) Flatter one, on off. Rana punches it off the back foot towards covers. Nitish Rana is the new man in. 5.4 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Venkatesh Iyer goes a bit too hard at this one and ends up giving his wicket away. This is floated up, on off stump and this one turns away from the left-hander. Iyer stays deep and looks to launch it down the ground but ends up slicing it high and towards cover-point. Daniel Sams over there settles under it and takes a simple catch. Kumar Kartikeya gets his man as Iyer departs but he has given his side a brlliant start. 5.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! WOW! Venkatesh Iyer is on fire at the moment! On off, Iyer gets low and smokes it well beyond the mid-wicket fence for a huge hit. 12 already off the over. 5.2 overs (2 Runs) Misfield but it doesn't cost them a boundary. Short and wide, cut away through cover-point for a couple of runs. 5.1 overs (4 Runs) EDGED AND FOUR! Kolkata have been going hard at the bowling and are riding their luck as well. It's the arm ball from Kartikeya, around off. Venkatesh Iyer has a big swing at it buts gets a thick outside edge that runs down to the third man fence. The first 50-run opening stand for Kolkata this season!","pubDate":"2022-05-09 14:33:41","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637877234116890943.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mumbai Indians vs Kolkata Knight Riders Live Score Ball by Ball, IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/mumbai-indians-vs-kolkata-knight-riders-live-score-over-match-56-t20-1-5-updates-2959926","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Mumbai Indians vs Kolkata Knight Riders from Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy, Navi Mumbai.

He had also accused ex-Pakistani captain Shahid Afridi of forcibly trying to convert him to Islam. However, his revelations have not gone down well with ordinary Pakistanis who refuse to acknowledge this problem. In a tweet, Danish Kaneria said, ‚ÄúWhen I raised my voice against forced conversion, I was threatened that my career would be destroyed.‚Äù Within minutes, Pakistanis descended on his Twitter timeline and accused him of lying and defaming Pakistan. They also asked him to leave the country and settle in India instead. ‚ÄúBro, I don‚Äôt (think) Shahid bhai has forced you to convert. He might have told you about Islam but didn‚Äôt force you as Islam doesn‚Äôt allow forceful conversion,‚Äù wrote one Ahmad Raza. He further claimed, ‚ÄúInstead of highlighting the privileges being given to Hindu and Other Non-Mulsim communities, you are making false comments.‚Äù Screengrab of the tweet Another user Muhammad Kashif accused Danish Kaneria of making up a concocted story. Screengrab of the tweet He also asked the former Pakistani spinner to go to India instead. ‚ÄúYour (Youtube) channel is mostly watched in India. You can go to India and can give updates on IPL.

Screengrab of the tweet Another Pakistani user wrote, ‚ÄúAfter fixing matches, you are taking refuge of religion. You have stooped so low for increasing engagement on your Youtube channel. Did not expect this from you. Pakistan has given you fame. Maybe the love of Indians has sunk your boat.‚Äù Screengrab of the tweet Allegations made by Danish Kaneria against Shahid Afridi On April 29 this year, Danish Kaneria¬†accused¬†his former team-mate Shahid Afridi of¬†ill-treatment¬†for being a Hindu. He had called Afridi a characterless forger and a liar.¬† While speaking to IANS, Kaneria remarked, ‚ÄúShahid Afridi always let me down. He used to keep me on the bench and not let me play One Day International matches. He didn‚Äôt want me to be on the team.‚Äù He further said that Shahid Afridi is a characterless and false person. He also told the news agency that Shahid Afridi was jealous of his good performances and provoked other players against him.

Under Pant, DC have won just five of the 11 matches they have played so far, including the 91-run thrashing at the hands of Chennai Super Kings on Sunday. Pant‚Äôs bowling changes and selection of bowlers to bowl at crucial periods of matches have been criticised by former players like Virender Sehwag. But Ponting, a former Australia and Mumbai Indians captain, said he fully backs every decision Pant takes on the field. ‚ÄúI fully back every decision he (Pant) takes on the field. I being a T20 captain before, I know you don‚Äôt have a lot of time to think about especially under extreme pressure,‚Äù Ponting said at the post-match press conference after DC‚Äôs 91-run loss to CSK. ‚ÄúIt is easy to make judgments from outside but trust me when you are in the middle it is not an easy thing to do.‚Äù Elaborating on the decision-making process of a captain, the legendary batter said, ‚ÄúA captain makes decisions in a very short time and the decision he takes he thinks is the best for the team at that given time of the match. ‚ÄúHe takes things like boundary size and batsmen at the crease into account when he takes those decisions.‚Äù He, however, admitted that his side fared poorly in all departments of the game in the loss against CSK. ‚ÄúOur bowling was not up to the mark, similarly our batting was very very poor. There were not many positives to take from the match. The only positive was Khaleel Ahmed, he was outstanding with the ball again,‚Äù Ponting said. ‚ÄúTo lose by 91 runs, it will put a huge dent in our net run-rate. It means we need to bounce back really strongly in our next game.‚Äù Ponting said DC can still make the play-offs with wins in all the remaining three matches. ‚ÄúWe would think we can make the play-offs with three wins. Eight wins might be enough to get in and one big win might help our net run rate. Who knows we can be in the final. ‚ÄúThat is what we can think of, what happened has happened and we would want to look to the future and look for a rebound from a bad performance.‚Äù DC have been facing issues related to COVID-19 with a net bowler testing positive for the virus just before the CSK match on Sunday. Some of their players and support staff, as well as Ponting‚Äôs family member, had also contracted the virus last month. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an excuse for us. It‚Äôs not the first time that we‚Äôve had to deal with it on game day. In one of the earlier games against Punjab Kings we had to deal with the same thing and ended up winning that game really comfortably,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are going to make excuses and we are going to find solutions for the problems we are facing. Although it wasn‚Äôt ideal preparation, we should have played better cricket. At the end of the day, we let ourselves down.‚Äù","pubDate":"2022-05-09 06:49:50","image_url":"https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ricky-Ponting-300x169.jpg","source_id":"orissapost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: RCB Head Coach Sanjay Bangar Comforts Virat Kohli After He Registers Third Golden Duck - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9pcGwtMjAyMi1yY2ItaGVhZC1jb2FjaC1zYW5qYXktYmFuZ2FyLWNvbWZvcnRzLXZpcmF0LWtvaGxpLWFmdGVyLWhlLXJlZ2lzdGVycy10aGlyZC1nb2xkZW4tZHVjay13YXRjaC0yOTU4MTYw0gGUAWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2lwbC0yMDIyL2lwbC0yMDIyLXJjYi1oZWFkLWNvYWNoLXNhbmpheS1iYW5nYXItY29tZm9ydHMtdmlyYXQta29obGktYWZ0ZXItaGUtcmVnaXN0ZXJzLXRoaXJkLWdvbGRlbi1kdWNrLXdhdGNoLTI5NTgxNjAvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Watch: RCB Head Coach Sanjay Bangar Comforts Virat Kohli After He Registers Third Golden Duck¬†¬†NDTV SportsSunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore, Match Report, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†Cricbuzzdu Plessis, Hasaranga and Karthik star in Bangalore‚Äôs 67-run thrashing of Hyderabad¬†¬†Bangalore MirrorWatch: Bangar wins hearts with great gesture towards Kohli after 3rd golden duck¬†¬†Hindustan TimesLive Cricket Score - SRH vs RCB, Match 54, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-09 05:32:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cheteshwar Pujara scores fourth successive ton in County","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports-news/cheteshwar-pujara-scores-fourth-successive-ton-in-county-591248","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Cheteshwar Pujara continued his imperious form with a fourth successive hundred for Sussex against a quality Middlesex attack that had Pakistan international","content":"LONDON: Cheteshwar Pujara continued his imperious form with a fourth successive hundred for Sussex against a quality Middlesex attack that had Pakistan international Shaheen Shah Afridi in its ranks. Pujara, who has already scored two double hundreds and a hundred, batted with an attacking intent, completing his three-figure mark in 133 balls with 13 boundaries and two sixes. The first of his two sixes is the one he will remember as he slashed a short ball from Afridi over backward point for a six. He also hit a boundary off Afridi and negotiated one of world's premier pacer with ease, completing 500 runs for the season in only four games. At stumps on third day, Cheteshwar Pujara was batting on 125 off 149 balls with 16 boundaries and two sixes and Sussex in their second innings have reached 236 for three in their second innings. Middlesex had scored 358 in their first essay in reply to Sussex' 392. Pujara's hundred came off off-spinner Mark Stoneman, whom he drove for three runs. Pujara was very attacking throughout the innings and it only helped that the pitch at Sussex's county ground at Hove was a flat one and with bright sunshine, there wasn't much happening in the air or off the track. Pujara added 138 for the third wicket with first innings centurion Tom Aslop (66 off 90 balls) and was severe on young medum pacer Blake Cullen. Pujara's sequence of scores in county cricket stands as 6, 201 no, 109, 12, 203, 16, 125 no with a total of 582* runs in four games.
