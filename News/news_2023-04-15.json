Guardiola gives City reality check Pep Guardiola warned against anybody expecting Manchester City to close down Arsenal despite their form. City picked up their fifth league win in a row at Southampton, then their ninth in all competitions in midweek as they smashed Bayern Munich 3-0 to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. Arsenal dropping points at Liverpool last week means that the title is now once again in the hands of Guardiola's defending champions. READ MORE: Every word from Guardiola press conference ahead of Leicester If they are able to beat Brighton in their game in hand, and beat Arsenal in a top-of-the-table clash later this month, they would lead the league on goal difference. With their experience and the form that they are in, the odds have shifted in City's favour . Read the full story, here Arteta's Arsenal admission Mikel Arteta admits the summer signings of Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City have brought something different to Arsenal's Premier League title challenge. The pair swapped the north west for north London during the summer transfer window , becoming pivotal parts of Arteta 's team overnight. Jesus and Zinchenko won four Premier League titles together as City players and have brought that experience to a dressing room which was otherwise lacking in that department. Mentally, Arteta explains the impact their additions to the group have had and the high standards they have brought with them from past successes in England.

With one eye on the summer transfer window, Erik ten Hag wants to make at least two major signings. Harry Kane is their prime target in the search for a new striker - while United will also look to recruit another central midfielder such as Jude Bellingham, Declan Rice or Frenkie de Jong. Mount has been mooted as a possible alternative, meanwhile, as speculation over his Stamford Bridge future continues to spiral before the market reopens. Mount, 24, only has 14 months left to run on his contract, while previous discussions between his representatives and the west Londoners have stalled. READ MORE: Every word from press conference Other top-flight clubs have been linked with a move - including Liverpool and Manchester City - while Bayern Munich have also emerged as potential suitors after appointing former Blues boss Thomas Tuchel as their manager. Mount was a key part of Tuchel's squad during his time in the Stamford Bridge dugout. Reports from ESPN indicate that talks between Mount and Chelsea are set to be revived. If an agreement cannot be reached, though, the midfielder is open to leave. Elsewhere, reports from The Sun argue United are poised and ready to step up their interest in Joao Palhinha after his impressive displays with Fulham this season. Palhinha, 27, is deployed as a defensive midfielder and is thought to be valued at around Â£60million at Craven Cottage. Palhinha has been earmarked as a possible replacement for Scott McTominay - as cover for Casemiro - should the Academy graduate move on. United might have a fight to secure his signature, though, with Liverpool and other Premier League sides also said to be interested.

The left-footed centre-back is currently on loan at Brighton and Hove Albion - who are also thought to be keen to keep the player permanently should his parent club choose to sell. The Evening Standard reports Colwill is also attracting interest from Liverpool , but City could look at the defender should a sale of Aymeric Laporte be sanctioned at the end of this season. Following Colwill's progress on the south coast this season, the report adds that Chelsea are keen to enter contract talks with the defender in hope of persuading him to remain at Stamford Bridge. However, it is also claimed that \"there is a feeling\" Chelsea will have to part ways with a number of homegrown stars in the summer in order to avoid breaching Financial Fair Play rules, which could open the door to a summer move for Colwill.

The City captain is set to become a free agent at the end of this season and is therefore allowed to enter talks with overseas clubs about a pre-contract agreement. An offer of â¬12 million per year for two seasons plus a potential third is said to be on the table at Camp Nou with Barca director Mateu Alemany and sporting advisor Jordi Cruyff rumoured to have been working on the deal \"for months\". It is claimed that the Barcelona duo met with Ilkay Gundogan's dad Ihan this week and a move is now said to be \"very close to being closed\".

Pant is currently undergoing rehabilitation and recovery at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). Pant has been ruled out of action for majority of the year after suffering multiple injuries following a car accident last year. He even underwent a surgery on his right knee. âI am recovering very well and Iâm getting better with each passing day. I came to visit the National Cricket Academy and the Delhi Capitals happened to be there. So I met the team,â Pant said in a media release. âI just saw how the teamâs practice is carrying on. I really love to be around the boys and I am missing it,â Pant further added. âMy heart and soul are always with the Delhi Capitals. I would like to wish them all the best for their next match.â The Delhi Capitals will take on Royal Challengers Bangalore at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru on Saturday. Delhi have lost all their four matches so far in IPL 2023 and need to win against RCB at any cost. However, this is not the first time Pant is meeting his teammates in IPL 2023. Earlier, during Delhi Capitalsâ home game against Gujarat Titans, Pant made his first public appearance at the Feroz Shah Kotla following the accident.

The inaugural edition of the tournament was held here from March 4-26 across two venues in Mumbai. Earlier this month, IPL chairman Arun Dhumal had told PTI that WPL will remain a five-team tournament for the next three seasons and it will be staged in the home and away format as that was âimportant for building a fan baseâ. The BCCI source however said it would be tough to take the league to tier-2 cities such as Indore, which doesnât have a WPL franchise named after it. The source added that the ongoing discussions also include postponing the WPL to later in the year, around Diwali, but nothing has been finalised. Indo-Pak World Cup venue and Asia Cup still being discussed The BCCI will wait for the directives from the Indian government on their participation in the Asia Cup 2023 as well as on Pakistanâs matches in India during the World Cup, the source added, saying that all members are currently discussing the matter and a final call will be made after that. It was reported by PTI earlier that Pakistan are most likely to play a bulk of their World Cup matches in Chennai and Kolkata as the team has âfelt safeâ at these two venues during their previous tours. BCCI chairman of selectors to be announced before Afghanistan series The BCCI is hopeful of appointing the chairman of selectors for the Indian cricket team before the three-match ODI series against Afghanistan, which is expected to be held after the ICC World Test Championship final between India and Australia in June at The Oval. The post has been lying vacant since the resignation of Chetan Sharma in February this year. The post is usually determined on seniority, as currently former India opening batter Shiv Sundar Das is the acting chairman post Sharmaâs resignation. For the WTC final, Indiaâs national coaching staff under Rahul Dravid and a few players who would have no role to play in the knockout stage of the IPL will travel to England early to bolster the preparations, the source added. BCCI confident that Bumrah will be fit for World Cup The BCCI is confident that the ace India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah, out of action due to a back injury, will be fit in time for the World Cup 2023. India will host the 50-over tournament later this year in October-November and the schedule is expected to be declared soon. The source made it clear that the board will continue with its policy of not allowing any active Indian players to take part in various other T20 leagues around the world, including the proposed T20 league in Saudi Arabia. However, the franchises can have their presence like they have made in other competitions such as SA20 and International League T20. The source added that the ICC revenue model will be decided in the next meeting in South Africa but the dates for the same are yet to be finalised.

With one eye on the summer transfer window, Erik ten Hag wants to make at least two major signings. Harry Kane is their prime target in the search for a new striker - while United will also look to recruit another central midfielder such as Jude Bellingham, Declan Rice or Frenkie de Jong. Mount has been mooted as a possible alternative, meanwhile, as speculation over his Stamford Bridge future continues to spiral before the market reopens. Mount, 24, only has 14 months left to run on his contract, while previous discussions between his representatives and the west Londoners have stalled. READ MORE: Every word from press conference Other top-flight clubs have been linked with a move - including Liverpool and Manchester City - while Bayern Munich have also emerged as potential suitors after appointing former Blues boss Thomas Tuchel as their manager. Mount was a key part of Tuchel's squad during his time in the Stamford Bridge dugout. Reports from ESPN indicate that talks between Mount and Chelsea are set to be revived. If an agreement cannot be reached, though, the midfielder is open to leave. Elsewhere, reports from The Sun argue United are poised and ready to step up their interest in Joao Palhinha after his impressive displays with Fulham this season. Palhinha, 27, is deployed as a defensive midfielder and is thought to be valued at around Â£60million at Craven Cottage. Palhinha has been earmarked as a possible replacement for Scott McTominay - as cover for Casemiro - should the Academy graduate move on. United might have a fight to secure his signature, though, with Liverpool and other Premier League sides also said to be interested.

The left-footed centre-back is currently on loan at Brighton and Hove Albion - who are also thought to be keen to keep the player permanently should his parent club choose to sell. The Evening Standard reports Colwill is also attracting interest from Liverpool , but City could look at the defender should a sale of Aymeric Laporte be sanctioned at the end of this season. Following Colwill's progress on the south coast this season, the report adds that Chelsea are keen to enter contract talks with the defender in hope of persuading him to remain at Stamford Bridge. However, it is also claimed that \"there is a feeling\" Chelsea will have to part ways with a number of homegrown stars in the summer in order to avoid breaching Financial Fair Play rules, which could open the door to a summer move for Colwill.

Pant is currently undergoing rehabilitation and recovery at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). Pant has been ruled out of action for majority of the year after suffering multiple injuries following a car accident last year. He even underwent a surgery on his right knee. âI am recovering very well and Iâm getting better with each passing day. I came to visit the National Cricket Academy and the Delhi Capitals happened to be there. So I met the team,â Pant said in a media release. âI just saw how the teamâs practice is carrying on. I really love to be around the boys and I am missing it,â Pant further added. âMy heart and soul are always with the Delhi Capitals. I would like to wish them all the best for their next match.â The Delhi Capitals will take on Royal Challengers Bangalore at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru on Saturday. Delhi have lost all their four matches so far in IPL 2023 and need to win against RCB at any cost. However, this is not the first time Pant is meeting his teammates in IPL 2023. Earlier, during Delhi Capitalsâ home game against Gujarat Titans, Pant made his first public appearance at the Feroz Shah Kotla following the accident.

The inaugural edition of the tournament was held here from March 4-26 across two venues in Mumbai. Earlier this month, IPL chairman Arun Dhumal had told PTI that WPL will remain a five-team tournament for the next three seasons and it will be staged in the home and away format as that was âimportant for building a fan baseâ. The BCCI source however said it would be tough to take the league to tier-2 cities such as Indore, which doesnât have a WPL franchise named after it. The source added that the ongoing discussions also include postponing the WPL to later in the year, around Diwali, but nothing has been finalised. Indo-Pak World Cup venue and Asia Cup still being discussed The BCCI will wait for the directives from the Indian government on their participation in the Asia Cup 2023 as well as on Pakistanâs matches in India during the World Cup, the source added, saying that all members are currently discussing the matter and a final call will be made after that. It was reported by PTI earlier that Pakistan are most likely to play a bulk of their World Cup matches in Chennai and Kolkata as the team has âfelt safeâ at these two venues during their previous tours. BCCI chairman of selectors to be announced before Afghanistan series The BCCI is hopeful of appointing the chairman of selectors for the Indian cricket team before the three-match ODI series against Afghanistan, which is expected to be held after the ICC World Test Championship final between India and Australia in June at The Oval. The post has been lying vacant since the resignation of Chetan Sharma in February this year. The post is usually determined on seniority, as currently former India opening batter Shiv Sundar Das is the acting chairman post Sharmaâs resignation. For the WTC final, Indiaâs national coaching staff under Rahul Dravid and a few players who would have no role to play in the knockout stage of the IPL will travel to England early to bolster the preparations, the source added. BCCI confident that Bumrah will be fit for World Cup The BCCI is confident that the ace India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah, out of action due to a back injury, will be fit in time for the World Cup 2023. India will host the 50-over tournament later this year in October-November and the schedule is expected to be declared soon. The source made it clear that the board will continue with its policy of not allowing any active Indian players to take part in various other T20 leagues around the world, including the proposed T20 league in Saudi Arabia. However, the franchises can have their presence like they have made in other competitions such as SA20 and International League T20. The source added that the ICC revenue model will be decided in the next meeting in South Africa but the dates for the same are yet to be finalised.

Guardiola gives City reality check Pep Guardiola warned against anybody expecting Manchester City to close down Arsenal despite their form. City picked up their fifth league win in a row at Southampton, then their ninth in all competitions in midweek as they smashed Bayern Munich 3-0 to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. Arsenal dropping points at Liverpool last week means that the title is now once again in the hands of Guardiola's defending champions. READ MORE: Every word from Guardiola press conference ahead of Leicester If they are able to beat Brighton in their game in hand, and beat Arsenal in a top-of-the-table clash later this month, they would lead the league on goal difference. With their experience and the form that they are in, the odds have shifted in City's favour . Read the full story, here Arteta's Arsenal admission Mikel Arteta admits the summer signings of Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City have brought something different to Arsenal's Premier League title challenge. The pair swapped the north west for north London during the summer transfer window , becoming pivotal parts of Arteta 's team overnight. Jesus and Zinchenko won four Premier League titles together as City players and have brought that experience to a dressing room which was otherwise lacking in that department. Mentally, Arteta explains the impact their additions to the group have had and the high standards they have brought with them from past successes in England.

With one eye on the summer transfer window, Erik ten Hag wants to make at least two major signings. Harry Kane is their prime target in the search for a new striker - while United will also look to recruit another central midfielder such as Jude Bellingham, Declan Rice or Frenkie de Jong. Mount has been mooted as a possible alternative, meanwhile, as speculation over his Stamford Bridge future continues to spiral before the market reopens. Mount, 24, only has 14 months left to run on his contract, while previous discussions between his representatives and the west Londoners have stalled. READ MORE: Every word from press conference Other top-flight clubs have been linked with a move - including Liverpool and Manchester City - while Bayern Munich have also emerged as potential suitors after appointing former Blues boss Thomas Tuchel as their manager. Mount was a key part of Tuchel's squad during his time in the Stamford Bridge dugout. Reports from ESPN indicate that talks between Mount and Chelsea are set to be revived. If an agreement cannot be reached, though, the midfielder is open to leave. Elsewhere, reports from The Sun argue United are poised and ready to step up their interest in Joao Palhinha after his impressive displays with Fulham this season. Palhinha, 27, is deployed as a defensive midfielder and is thought to be valued at around Â£60million at Craven Cottage. Palhinha has been earmarked as a possible replacement for Scott McTominay - as cover for Casemiro - should the Academy graduate move on. United might have a fight to secure his signature, though, with Liverpool and other Premier League sides also said to be interested.

The left-footed centre-back is currently on loan at Brighton and Hove Albion - who are also thought to be keen to keep the player permanently should his parent club choose to sell. The Evening Standard reports Colwill is also attracting interest from Liverpool , but City could look at the defender should a sale of Aymeric Laporte be sanctioned at the end of this season. Following Colwill's progress on the south coast this season, the report adds that Chelsea are keen to enter contract talks with the defender in hope of persuading him to remain at Stamford Bridge. However, it is also claimed that \"there is a feeling\" Chelsea will have to part ways with a number of homegrown stars in the summer in order to avoid breaching Financial Fair Play rules, which could open the door to a summer move for Colwill.

The City captain is set to become a free agent at the end of this season and is therefore allowed to enter talks with overseas clubs about a pre-contract agreement. An offer of â¬12 million per year for two seasons plus a potential third is said to be on the table at Camp Nou with Barca director Mateu Alemany and sporting advisor Jordi Cruyff rumoured to have been working on the deal \"for months\". It is claimed that the Barcelona duo met with Ilkay Gundogan's dad Ihan this week and a move is now said to be \"very close to being closed\".

Pant is currently undergoing rehabilitation and recovery at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). Pant has been ruled out of action for majority of the year after suffering multiple injuries following a car accident last year. He even underwent a surgery on his right knee. âI am recovering very well and Iâm getting better with each passing day. I came to visit the National Cricket Academy and the Delhi Capitals happened to be there. So I met the team,â Pant said in a media release. âI just saw how the teamâs practice is carrying on. I really love to be around the boys and I am missing it,â Pant further added. âMy heart and soul are always with the Delhi Capitals. I would like to wish them all the best for their next match.â The Delhi Capitals will take on Royal Challengers Bangalore at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru on Saturday. Delhi have lost all their four matches so far in IPL 2023 and need to win against RCB at any cost. However, this is not the first time Pant is meeting his teammates in IPL 2023. Earlier, during Delhi Capitalsâ home game against Gujarat Titans, Pant made his first public appearance at the Feroz Shah Kotla following the accident.

The inaugural edition of the tournament was held here from March 4-26 across two venues in Mumbai. Earlier this month, IPL chairman Arun Dhumal had told PTI that WPL will remain a five-team tournament for the next three seasons and it will be staged in the home and away format as that was âimportant for building a fan baseâ. The BCCI source however said it would be tough to take the league to tier-2 cities such as Indore, which doesnât have a WPL franchise named after it. The source added that the ongoing discussions also include postponing the WPL to later in the year, around Diwali, but nothing has been finalised. Indo-Pak World Cup venue and Asia Cup still being discussed The BCCI will wait for the directives from the Indian government on their participation in the Asia Cup 2023 as well as on Pakistanâs matches in India during the World Cup, the source added, saying that all members are currently discussing the matter and a final call will be made after that. It was reported by PTI earlier that Pakistan are most likely to play a bulk of their World Cup matches in Chennai and Kolkata as the team has âfelt safeâ at these two venues during their previous tours. BCCI chairman of selectors to be announced before Afghanistan series The BCCI is hopeful of appointing the chairman of selectors for the Indian cricket team before the three-match ODI series against Afghanistan, which is expected to be held after the ICC World Test Championship final between India and Australia in June at The Oval. The post has been lying vacant since the resignation of Chetan Sharma in February this year. The post is usually determined on seniority, as currently former India opening batter Shiv Sundar Das is the acting chairman post Sharmaâs resignation. For the WTC final, Indiaâs national coaching staff under Rahul Dravid and a few players who would have no role to play in the knockout stage of the IPL will travel to England early to bolster the preparations, the source added. BCCI confident that Bumrah will be fit for World Cup The BCCI is confident that the ace India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah, out of action due to a back injury, will be fit in time for the World Cup 2023. India will host the 50-over tournament later this year in October-November and the schedule is expected to be declared soon. The source made it clear that the board will continue with its policy of not allowing any active Indian players to take part in various other T20 leagues around the world, including the proposed T20 league in Saudi Arabia. However, the franchises can have their presence like they have made in other competitions such as SA20 and International League T20. The source added that the ICC revenue model will be decided in the next meeting in South Africa but the dates for the same are yet to be finalised.
