The 302-run win is India’s biggest margin of victory by runs ever at a Men’s Cricket World Cup. It is also the second-biggest such margin by any team in the history of the tournament, falling only behind the 309-run record set by Australia against Netherlands a week ago. Only three times in the history of the Men’s ODI game has there been a bigger margin of victory by runs: Zimbabwe against USA in Harare in June of this year, Australia's win over the Dutch in this tournament, and India’s hammering of Sri Lanka back in January. That means of course that the four biggest wins by runs in Men’s ODI cricket history have all come in 2023. Mohammed Shami makes history Mohammed Shami is now India’s leading wicket-taker at Men’s Cricket World Cups. His 45 wickets have come in just 14 matches at an eye-watering average of 12.91. India’s previous highest wicket-taker in the tournament’s history was Zaheer Khan, whose 44 wickets came in 23 matches. Only seven bowlers have ever taken more Cricket World Cup wickets than Shami, with none doing so in as few matches and none having as close to as good an average. Shami has taken more wicket hauls of four or more in World Cups than any other bowler. His record of seven such feats surpasses Mitchell Starc (6) and Imran Tahir (5). Virat Kohli continues his fine form Virat Kohli has risen up a spot in the list of the Men’s Cricket World Cup’s greatest-ever run-scorers. His latest effort saw move to 1472 career runs in the tournament, and helped him leapfrog Australian David Warner into fourth in the all-time list. Only Kumar Sangakkara (1532), Ricky Ponting (1743) and Sachin Tendulkar (2278) have scored more in their careers. Kohli’s tally for the current tournament moved on to 442 in seven innings, just one run shy of his effort from the 2019 tournament, where he averaged 55.37 across nine matches. Dilshan Madushanka makes his mark It wasn’t just the India team making waves at the Wankhede. Dilshan Madushanka’s five-wicket haul means he is now the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 18. Shaheen Shah Afridi, Marco Jansen and Adam Zampa are the closest to the Sri Lankan with 16 apiece, while Jasprit Bumrah (15) and Mohammed Shami (14) are not much further behind.

By Tum Balogun For Mailonline Published: 22:00 GMT, 2 November 2023 | Updated: 22:00 GMT, 2 November 2023 e-mail View comments England and Manchester United goalkeeper Mary Earps has been named The Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year. The 30-year-old played a crucial role in the Lionesses' run to the final of the Women's World Cup and was awarded with the Golden Glove. Earps played every minute for Sarina Wiegman 's side at the tournament, keeping three clean sheets and conceding only four goals in seven matches. She also produced what looked at the time to be a crucial penalty save in the closing stages of August's final in Perth but England ultimately finished as runners-up to Spain. Ben Taylor, editor of The Sunday Times said : 'Mary Earps’ performance at the 2023 Football World Cup cemented her spot as one of the game's greatest goalkeepers.

The 30-year-old also produced a wonderful penalty save in the closing stages of the final 'Her and the rest of the Lionesses showed determination, skill, and resilience to reach the finals and will continue to inspire many young girls for years to come.' Two-time heptathlon world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson, seven-time Paralympic gold medallist Hannah Cockroft and English cricketer Tammy Beaumont were also among the nominees. The prestigious awards, which are now in the 36th year, recognise and celebrate the outstanding contribution made to sport by women at all levels. Previous winners of the Sportswoman of the Year accolade include Emma Raducanu, Dina Asher-Smith, Elise Christie, Sally Gunnell, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Denise Lewis, Dame Kelly Holmes, Zara Phillips, Victoria Pendleton, Christine Ohuruogu and Hollie Doyle. 2022 Commonwealth Games 10,000 metres champion, Eilish McColgan, took home the prize last year. Earps also scooped the The Best FIFA Women's Goalkeeper award last season The Man United stopper has seen her level of celebrity skyrocket following success with the Lionesses Away from the main prize, snowboarder Mia Brookes clinched the Young Sportswoman of the Year gong. The 16-year-old won gold in the slopestyle at the 2023 World Championships in Georgia. Cockroft claimed the Citi Disability Sportswoman of the Year, while three-time Olympic medallist Katie Archibald received the Helen Rollason Award for Inspiration. Taylor added: 'These awards also recognise that sport and exercise is vital for the physical and mental health of millions of women and congratulate our Grassroots winner Aimee Rees, and Tess Howard for winning the Changemaker award for campaigning to make female sports kits more accessible.' Wiegman's Lionesses' were also honoured on the night with the prize for Team of the Year. Earps's stellar campaign was recognised at the Ballon d'Or awards in Paris on Monday , where she placed fifth and achieved the highest-ever finish for a female footballer. She was also the subject of a PR own-goal from England's shirt manufacturer Nike, who took the peculiar decision to omit her jersey from their collection that went on sale ahead of the World Cup. Nike put the 'Earps 1' replica jerseys on sale following a backlash during the World Cup Earps hit out at the ‘extremely hurtful’ decision with over 170,000 people signing a petition calling on the sportswear giants to change their mind. It is understood Nike originally decided against selling Earps’ shirt for commercial reasons but a U-turn was made in August when they announced they would retail limited quantities. Replica jerseys finally went on sale earlier this month, though many fans were left disappointed as they quickly sold out . Earps's increased celebrity has seen her gain over a million followers on TikTok. She had considered retirement after being dropped by England in 2019 but has seen a remarkable turnaround in recent years. IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!

How did it go so wrong?","content":"In the last week of the Wallabies’ Rugby World Cup campaign, players and coaches were living in a state of purgatory; neither in the World Cup finals nor out of them. Having lost to Fiji and Wales , the Wallabies had effectively also lost their chance to play in knockout stages for the first time in World Cup history. But with Fiji needing to secure just one bonus point against Portugal a weekend later to make it official, the zombie Wallabies continued training for a week at their base in Saint-Etienne, a small French city about an hour’s drive from Lyon, for the remote chance they could make it through. As the week wore on, players tried to keep the mood light and a group of Wallabies coaching staff – without coach Eddie Jones – were spotted out drinking beers in the town square. But camp life carried a strange vibe, and Jones made it even more unusual when he started pulling players aside at the team hotel, according to a Wallabies player who spoke to the Herald on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise his employment. “There were a couple of very bizarre meetings in the last week of the World Cup, after Portugal. They felt like goodbye meetings,” the player recalled. “They were one-on-one meetings. Guys would come out and go ‘was that a goodbye? Don’t we have a plan for next year?’. Mate, it was bizarre.” Jones was contracted to coach the Wallabies for another four years. But five weeks after the Herald reported Jones had done a Zoom interview with Japan and 12 days after Jones stood at Coogee Oval and said he was in for the long haul through to 2027, the goodbye was finally made official. He resigned as Wallabies coach on October 29, citing unmet guarantees from Rugby Australia about resources and high-performance reform. Before revealing his resignation to media outlets, Jones sent a message to the Wallabies squad WhatsApp group. “It said, ‘I am proud to have worked with you. Contrary to media I haven’t signed anything (with Japan) and am going to spend the next month deciding my next move’,” the Wallaby player said. It ended a short but chaos-filled second-coming for Jones, which began with optimism and high hopes, but ended with Rugby Australia in its deepest ever hole. To understand how – and why – the Jones journey went off the rails so badly, the Herald has spoken to a large group of people directly involved in the slow-moving train wreck. At the end of 2022 - well before his return to Australia - Jones appeared to be in more immediate strife than his then-Wallabies counterpart Dave Rennie. As England coach, Jones was under heavy fire for the team’s lacklustre form and results, which had seen the English win just five from 12 Tests. The Wallabies hadn’t fared much better, with five wins from 14 Tests. But after also enduring an injury toll that saw 40 players sidelined in the Test winter, Wallabies players felt enthused about the 2023 Rugby World Cup, after a spring tour where they’d fielded a weakened team and only lost to the world No.1 and No.2 sides, Ireland and France, by the closest of margins. “We were a couple of penalty goals away from going five [wins] from five [Tests] and people going ‘look out for Australia’,” a Wallaby player, who requested anonymity to talk freely, said. RA commissioned former Olympic rower Bo Hanson to review the year, and a separate examination of the worrying injury toll was also completed. The results were shared with the players at the Wallabies’ first camp on the Gold Coast on January 10. As the rest of the nation was focused on the summer of cricket and tennis, Rennie gathered a 44-man squad to lay out the plans for the Rugby World Cup campaign to come. “Looking back, I guess what they were hoping to get out of it [the review] was that Rens [Rennie] had lost the room. But it came back glowingly in favour of him,” the Wallaby player said. “Everyone loved him and he was an incredible coach. There was no doubt we had problems with injury rates and all that, but to be honest, that review did what it needed to do.” Rugby Australia chairman Hamish McLennan was fuming about the Wallabies’ results on the spring tour, and in particular a loss to Italy on November 13. As RA’s representative in Florence, defeat was difficult viewing for McLennan at Stadio Artemio Franchi. The Wallabies were made to play five Tests in a row on that tour, an increase on the usual four. Knowing his first-choice side would struggle playing on five consecutive weekends, Rennie made 11 changes to his starting side and it backfired with a one-point loss. Rennie’s future was now in question, and McLennan had eyes for another coach. The well-connected Sydney business figure, who also is chairman of the REA Group and deputy chair of Magellan Financial Group, had already begun a charm offensive to woo Eddie Jones home as Wallabies coach in 2024, and through to the Rugby World Cup in Australia in 2027. Jones was on contract with the Rugby Football Union until the end of 2023. The pair first discussed the plan in July 2022 when Jones was in Sydney with England for the last game of a three-Test series. McLennan hosted a dinner for Jones at his Lavender Bay home, where they ate Portuguese chicken and salad made by the chairman’s wife Lucinda. The dinner occurred just days after Jones reacted angrily to a fan labelling him a “traitor” at the Sydney Cricket Ground. When McLennan discovered the RFU had not inserted a no-compete clause in their termination agreement with Jones, he saw his chance. Selling the vision of RA being on the cusp of a resources boom via a private equity deal, and with long-overdue centralisation reform now a matter of when, not if, McLennan convinced Jones to come a year early and a five-year deal was fleshed out. Rennie would need to be sacked but some on RA’s board – comprised of Brett Godfrey, Daniel Herbert, Phil Waugh, Pip Marlow, Karen Penrose, Jane Wilson, Matthew Hanning and the then-chief executive Andy Marinos – weren’t immediately sold. Sources familiar with the boardroom discussions, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said there were dissenting views, but after debating the risks and rewards, the board agreed to make the change. Behind the scenes, McLennan led the negotiations. Marinos disagreed with the call to appoint Jones. “Nothing was going to stop Hamish,” said a source familiar with discussions. “He went after Eddie. Hamish went and got his man. He believed it was going to be the magic pill.” With Rennie’s win percentage at 38, the board decided the chance to sign Jones was worth the gamble. McLennan argued ex-Wallabies were supportive of the move, and that Jones had a “hard edge” that Rennie did not. The chair later upset some players and fans by appearing to criticise Rennie’s penchant for playing guitar in team bonding sessions. “I would rather we have somebody who’s really tough and we win World Cups than we have a Kumbaya session, everyone holds hands and we fail,” McLennan said. Marinos publicly defended the decision to sack Rennie but resigned as chief executive five months later, after his relationship with McLennan became strained. Marinos declined to comment when contacted this week. McLennan rejects the argument that hiring Jones was a captain’s pick. “We went in with good faith ... we at Rugby Australia felt that we needed to make a change and it [appointing Jones] wasn’t just me, it went through the rugby committee and the board,” McLennan said this week at Sydney Airport. “There was an appropriate level of governance around that decision, but we weren’t tracking well. We lost a lot of games last year to big teams. And so all I’d just say to the rugby public, is that you’ve got to continue to make decisions, not all of them work out. If this was a business, you would find that you don’t get 100 per cent success rate and I stand by the calls.” Waugh, who replaced Marinos as RA chief executive, said on Tuesday of the Jones hiring: “Hindsight is a wonderful thing. When you make decisions at any time during your career ... you get presented information at the time and you make decisions based on that information.” Players had mixed emotions. On one hand, they were upset about Rennie’s departure, but on the other, the return of Jones - a noted Rugby World Cup specialist - generated buzz. “The guys were disappointed,” the Wallabies player said. “But a lot were also excited. If they were gonna get rid of Rens and bring someone in, Eddie Jones … look at what he has done. Everyone fell in love with the idea of a bloke coming in who has done well at World Cups.” The next six months were a honeymoon period. RA basked in the hyper-luminous glow of Jones, whose profile and personality immediately saw rugby back on the TV news and back pages of newspapers after spending too long in the wilderness. For a while, there wasn’t a lunch or school fundraiser on a Friday that didn’t have Jones on hand as a special guest. He answered questions, cracked jokes and built Australian rugby’s stocks back up one room at a time. Jones could have a room of coaches, business figures, sporting identities, members of the media, eating out of the palm of his hand with wisecracks and a confidence-inducing spiel about the Wallabies being a genuine chance to win the World Cup. He was often seen volunteering his time to coach juniors, too. NRL supremo and Nine broadcaster Phil Gould agreed to do a one-on-one interview with Jones in the sheds at Coogee Oval, which aired in February . One onlooker recalls marveling at the sight of Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley queueing patiently to get a ball signed by Jones after one function in Melbourne. However, the sailing wasn’t entirely smooth. Jones privately began bemoaning the quality of performances of Australian Super Rugby teams, and pulling together a coaching staff became a major struggle. Apart from forwards coach Dan McKellar, Jones didn’t want to carry forward any of Rennie’s crew. Experienced forwards coach Laurie Fisher was let go. McKellar did not accept an offer to stay and instead took the Leicester Tigers head coach job after getting a picture of how inexperienced Jones’ coaching staff would be. In the end, former rugby league player Brett Hodgson became defence coach, and Brad Davis – a former defence coach at London Irish– became attack coach. Brumbies scrum guru Dan Palmer took on a role as lineout coach, and little-known French coach Pierre-Henry Broncan – a former halfback – was employed as a maul coach. Super Rugby sides were supportive of Jones but one official, who did not want to be named because of their continued employment, said alarm bells about communication with the Wallabies program first rang when Jones held his first mid-season camp in April. Having left their Super Rugby teams for several days, but with games still to play on the weekend, the Wallabies did their training in the camp - but didn’t wear GPS devices to track the training loads, as is standard. Super Rugby teams were left in the dark and unclear about how much training players needed to do when they returned from the Gold Coast. The opacity of Jones’ long-term plans also became an issue in May. In Australian rugby circles, speculation that Jones would not see out his full, five-year contract had been bubbling since he landed in Australia in late January. But most expected the coach would at least stay until after the British and Irish Lions tour in 2025. Jones sidestepped questions about his future until he told former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio on an Evening Standard podcast on May 31 that he only intended to stay for one year with the Wallabies. “I’m only coaching ’til this World Cup,” Jones said. “I’ve signed [until the end of 2027], but as I’ve made the mistake before, I’ve stayed too long. So we win the World Cup, it will be time to go. If we lose the World Cup, it will be time to go.” It left Australian rugby stunned: did Jones just say the quiet part out loud? The Herald immediately messaged Jones to offer a chance to clarify, but he declined on several occasions. Senior RA officials privately dismissed the remarks as “Eddie being Eddie”, but when pushed by the media for a comment, a spokesman said Jones was contracted through to 2027 and the comment was referencing his single-minded focus on the 2023 Rugby World Cup. Five days later, Jones contacted the Herald and asked if his position could be clarified in print . “I am here for five years,” Jones said. “But my only concentration is this Rugby World Cup, so I don’t think past that.” Jones had been emphasising the need for strong leadership from senior players in the Wallabies’ 2023 campaign. At least once a week during Super Rugby, Jones convened the leadership group on Zoom calls, along with sports psychology experts. The message was drilled into them that a belief in the team’s ability to win the World Cup would be crucial to helping young players think the same way. “He painted a picture that experienced guys were going to be important to the World Cup,” a Wallaby player said. In late June, Jones had named Michael Hooper and James Slipper as co-captains and incumbent players were used in the Wallabies’ first two games against South Africa and Argentina. After the Wallabies travelled to South Africa, documentary crews began filming the team’s every move, with Jones wearing a microphone at training and in team meetings. A heavy kicking strategy was employed against the Springboks but they thumped the Wallabies 43-12 in Pretoria. When the Wallabies lost their second consecutive game a week later to Argentina at CommBank Stadium in Sydney in July, Jones lost faith in the senior players. Hooper missed the Test with a calf injury. “That was when everything changed. Some switch was flicked,” the Wallabies player recalled. Jones went for a younger team, and new leadership, to take on the All Blacks in two Tests in Melbourne and Dunedin. Having changed tactics to hold the ball more, and attack directly, the Wallabies began to find their groove. They lost at the MCG but a week later in Dunedin, the Wallabies led 17-3 before being beaten at the death 23-20. Players and coaches were slowly adjusting to life inside Camp Jones, some with more comfort than others. A notoriously hard taskmaster inclined to have blunt conversations, Jones is famous for churning through assistant coaches. But unlike in his first stint with the Wallabies, most players now didn’t feel like they were walking on eggshells. “There was a barrier. The staff would really cop it, the leaders were the next barrier and the players were mostly sheltered from it,” a Wallabies player said. “Hoops was the guy who stood up for the group. It wasn’t confrontational but in those meetings if someone wasn’t right, Hoops would say it. Maybe that was deemed as being too challenging.” Elsewhere, optimism about the Wallabies’ World Cup chances wasn’t in great supply. On July 20 – the night the Matildas began their soon-to-be famous World Cup campaign against Ireland at Homebush – RA sponsor RM Williams hosted an intimate dinner in the exclusive Clock Tower at Shell House in Sydney for rugby supporters, media executives and corporate supporters. The occasion was to launch a new RM Williams line of rugby apparel, but it doubled as a chance for RA to rally enthusiasm for the upcoming World Cup. Australia’s two World Cup-winning skippers, John Eales and Nick Farr-Jones, were asked to give a few words. They largely stuck to their stock anecdotes from the past. When the dessert course had been cleared and guests stood to chat, some privately shared concerns about the team’s World Cup chances. The Dunedin performance had given Wallabies fans a glimmer of hope but things took a sharp and unexpected turn when Jones settled on his 33-man squad for the Rugby World Cup. Jones left out many senior players – none more shocking than Hooper, who’d been battling a calf injury but was expected to be fit by the start of the World Cup; his last before international retirement. Quade Cooper, Pete Samu, Bernard Foley, Jed Holloway, Reece Hodge and Tom Wright were also omitted. A day before the public found out, however, the players were told. But in contrast to recent World Cup campaigns, where Michael Cheika organised for former Wallabies to ring players with the good news, the process for the 2023 announcement was flawed. The 33 players picked to go were told via a phone call from Wallabies general manager Chris Webb in the afternoon. One bolter, who’d had no contact with the Wallabies for weeks, had to hurriedly pack a bag for a flight the next day and re-arrange his winter plans. But by 7pm, unsuccessful candidates had still not been told about their fate, and there was a flight to Darwin early the next day for a camp. Sources with knowledge of the plan said Jones was due to make the calls to players who missed out. But the calls were delayed because the coach was on a flight back to Australia. Jones had dashed back to the UK after the Dunedin match with his wife to pick up their Papillon dog, Annie, and take it to their home in Japan. With the Wallabies’ WhatsApp group lighting up with excited chat, players who hadn’t been told began to phone Webb, asking what was going on. Jones ended up speaking to Hooper that night but Cooper didn’t take his call, and the pair still haven’t spoken. Jones later explained he’d left out Hooper and star centre Len Ikitau because he didn’t want to carry injured players who may not make the first game. But he also named Max Jorgensen, Samu Kerevi and Josh Kemeny who were all recovering from respective injuries. Jones pushed the button on a young squad for the World Cup and conceded he felt that senior players from the Rennie era had maxed out their potential. It was the youngest, most inexperienced Wallabies squad ever sent to a Rugby World Cup. The public were shocked by Jones’ inexperienced squad, and so were the Wallabies. “It just went against a lot of what he had said all year,” a Wallaby told the Herald . “He started saying things like ’27 is important. All of a sudden, it felt like ‘ah, he’s put in a safety net for us not doing well in France’. The belief levels – well, no-one spoke about it – but you could feel it, that he is grooming guys for the 2027 World Cup and this one isn’t important.” On the eve of the Wallabies’ departure from Australia, one of Jones’ assistants was unable to continue. Attack coach Davis, who’d been driven particularly hard by Jones, along with Hodgson, left the team camp in Darwin. RA announced Davis’ exit a few days later – citing “family reasons” – as the team gathered at the airport to fly out to the World Cup. “There’s a potential candidate ready to step up now,” Jones told reporters. “I think we’ll improve the coaching staff.” Jones, who hadn’t held in-person press conference since naming his World Cup squad, stood in front of members of the fourth estate at a media conference at Sydney Airport. Like the rest of the touring group, Jones had a brand new Akubra hat on his head. The squad was flying out to France for the Rugby World Cup but the mood was anything but celebratory. Jones bristled when the questions started. Why had Cooper not taken his call? Did Hooper, a Wallabies great, really have to ring team management to find out his World Cup dream was over? Jones snapped, labelling it the “worst press conference” he’d ever been involved in and inviting journalists to “give yourselves uppercuts” before walking through to customs. “There was no need for it,” said a Wallabies squad member. “It was funny but it’s not professional. It was just creating a circus when we should be focusing on rugby. Guys were wondering ‘is this really good for us?’.” About an hour after the press conference, Jones texted a reporter who had asked questions in the scrum. “Don’t ever contact me again,” Jones wrote. Asked why, Jones blocked the journalist’s number. During the World Cup, a Japanese media report emerged suggesting Jones was a candidate for that country’s head coaching role in 2024. “Bullshit and gossip,” Jones responded via a Wallabies spokesperson. The story wasn’t over, though. After Jones’ denials, the Herald’s Tom Decent received a tantalising tip that Jones took part in a secret Zoom interview with the Japanese Rugby Football Union days before the World Cup began. The Herald spent days investigating and fact-checking the information. Players were oblivious to the Japanese talks, until the Herald’s story broke hours before Australia’s match against Wales. Jones deflected questions about the Japan interview, saying: “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Captain Will Skelton told the press that the Herald’s story had not disrupted the preparation and that most players didn’t know anything about it. But a Wallabies player this week recounted a different version of events. “We were talking about it on the day of the game,” he said. “It was a bizarre mood after that game. We got the same line [from Jones] as the media got. That was alarm bells. He didn’t even trust us.” Jones told players, coaches and his bosses at RA there was nothing to the story. Press conferences were tense. At one point, a Wallabies media manager asked how much longer the probing would go on for. Jones’ inexperienced squad was only one part of the Wallabies’ problems heading into the Rugby World Cup. Tactically, the coach had elected to abandon the way the team had been playing for the last three years and focus on a game based on ad-lib attack. All major Test nations, and a majority of successful club teams, operate with attacking structures, which dictate default patterns players will attack from on the field. Jones decided the Wallabies wouldn’t play with any pre-set structures, and instead attack with more freedom, as they saw the opportunity before them. But also believing possession rugby was dead, Jones didn’t want to hold the ball for more than four phases. Prior to the last warm-up game against France, Jones changed the game plan again, to keep their style hidden. Australia lost to Fiji for the first time in 69 years and the next week their World Cup fate was sealed with a 40-6 loss to Wales. It was the heaviest defeat in Wallabies World Cup history. Jones covered his face with his hands. Wallabies fans, many who had paid large sums of money to be in France, walked out of the stadium in Lyon before the full-time whistle had sounded. Along with Jones’ links to Japan – which was now being reported by other world media outlets – the Wallabies’ disastrous campaign saw the heat intensify on Jones. When Jones returned home from France, he fronted a press conference at Coogee Oval on October 17. But despite speculation he may quit, Jones repeated he was in for the long haul. But public support was thin on the ground and within a week Jones had begun working on an exit strategy. In the week of the Rugby World Cup final, McLennan and RA hosted a function at the Australian Embassy in Paris on October 25, celebrating the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia. In a room looking out to the adjacent Eiffel Tower, World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont and New Zealand rugby boss Mark Robinson were among the distinguished guests. Unbeknown to most people in the room, Jones and his representatives informed RA earlier that day they did not see a future in Australia for the under-fire coach. There was one last flurry of headlines, when Jones told Herald columnist Peter FitzSimons, a former Wallaby, that he didn’t regret omitting Hooper, Cooper and Foley and described the trio as not the right role models for the team. Hooper declined to respond, but current and former Wallabies were stunned. “It was really disappointing and it didn’t sit well with the players at all,” the Wallabies player said. “It felt like he was trying to blame what’s happened here for the last decade for all his problems. He experimented on a style of footy that hasn’t really been done before, with a really young group, and hasn’t really owned it.” With Waugh now back in Australia, discussions via Zoom began for an exit. Details of the negotiations are unclear, but the talks were swift. By Sunday evening news filtered out that Jones had resigned. Jones did an exit interview with The Australian , bemoaning the speed in which the game could achieve centralisation, and later told FitzSimons: “[I] gave it a run. Hopefully be the catalyst for change. Sometimes you have to eat shit for others to eat caviar further down the track.” Jones may be gone but the fallout of his 10-month rollercoaster is only just beginning. Fronting a press conference this week, Waugh said the RA leadership who’d gambled on Jones resurrecting the Wallabies would take ownership of the fact it, in fact, sank the Wallabies to a new low. But McLennan said he won’t follow Jones and resign. Waugh said Australian rugby’s voting members have the power to effect change on the Rugby Australia board, if they see fit. For the Wallabies players, the Jones saga – and the lost year of 2023 – just represents a wasted opportunity. Many won’t get another shot at playing in Rugby World Cup, or even wearing a Wallabies jersey. News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

India’s imposing total came on the back of three half-centuries from Shubman Gill (92), Virat Kohli (88) and Shreyas Iyer (82) but Madushanka certainly had a memorable game to become the tournament’s highest wicket taker with 18-wickets in seven games. The 23-year-old seamer stunned the Wankhede crowd into silence with a terrific delivery to remove Indian skipper Rohit Sharma in the second ball of the innings but a strong second wicket stand between Gill and Kohli set the tone for India’s mammoth total, after being put into bat first by Kusal Mendis. Sharma had clipped the first ball to the fine-leg boundary and was looking for the inswinger but an off-cutter nipped away with the angle, crashing to the off-stump to give marching orders to the Indian skipper. Both Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera generated plenty of movement off the deck to keep both Gill and Kohli in check as the hosts managed only 25 runs in the first five overs for the loss of Sharma’s wicket. India would have been two down, had Charith Asalanka at cover point grabbed a flying catch off Gill in the penultimate ball of Madushanka’s third over, but the ball burst through the hand to offer another life to Gill. Two balls later, Chameera nearly caught Kohli off his own bowling when the batsman got a leading edge, but the ball popped out of Chameera’s hand. Chameera operated with a perfect line and length and his first two overs conceded no run. But once the pitch settled, scoring looked easy as Gill and Kohli capitalised on those opportunities to stitch a massive second wicket stand and put hosts, who are eyeing their third World Cup title, in control. The partnership grew in stature at a steady pace and was threatening to take the game completely away from the Sri Lankans when Madushanka struck twice with his third spell. With both players in sight of their centuries, Madushanka sent Gill and Kohli back to the dressing room as Sri Lanka shed a sigh of relief. The two had scored 189 runs for the second wicket when Madushanka with a slow off-cutter in his third spell deceived Gill. Gill, who was just eight runs short of the century, attempted to guide the ball to deep-third-man area but the extra bounce saw him managing to channel it to the wicket-keeper. Gill’s run-a-ball innings included 11 boundaries and two sixes—one over mid-wicket and the other over long-on. The 23-year-old seamer then deceived the big fish, Kolhi, with another slower ball sending the vociferous Wankhede crowd into silence. Kohli was early into the drive and offered a simple catch to Pathum Nissanka at short-cover as Madushanka finished his third spell of two overs with two wickets for 12 runs. Kohli hit 88 off 94 balls with 11 boundaries. KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer then added a quick 60 runs off 47 balls between them before Chameera removed KL Rahul, caught by Dushan Hemantha, at short extra-cover. Madushanka, who is enjoying a remarkable success with the ball in the World Cup, then removed Suryakumar Yadav to grab his fourth wicket. Yadav looked to hook a short ball from Madushanka but did not make a connection as it passed to the wicket-keeper. The umpire was unmoved but Mendis reviewed to find a slight spike on ultra edge. Despite losing Rahul and Yadav quickly, Iyre continued the onslaught, hitting his 16th ODI half century. The left-hander hit 82 off 56 balls with six sixes and three boundaries before Madushanka claimed his first five-wicket haul. Irye was running riot, hitting Madushanka for two consecutive sixes when a slow ball did the trick as Iyre sliced it straight up in the air for Maheesh Theekshana to grab a straight forward chance. Ravindra Jadeja made a brisk 35 off 23 balls before he ran himself out in the last ball of their innings. Sri Lanka made one change to the playing XI with Dushan Hemantha coming in for misfiring Dhananjaya de Silva.

The Ashes adversaries meet on Saturday at Ahmedabad’s 130,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium, which will also host the tournament final on November 19. Only one of the two teams has any prospect of making it that far, with England propping up the table in 10th place after one win in six while Australia appear set fair for the knockouts after four victories. But Root refuses to believe a side who came in as defending champions and well fancied to defend their crown have slipped as far as the standings suggest. “Man for man, I’d have this team every day over the Australians,” he said, with an air of confidence that has largely eluded England since they touched down in India. “We might not have played as well as we can do but we know when we play our best stuff the best teams struggle to compete with us. “I look at this team and it’s more than capable of achieving way more than it has done throughout this tournament.

We have massively underachieved to date and have three opportunities to show the world what we are capable of doing and what I know we are capable of doing.” The statistical head-to-head makes for grim reading, with Australia boasting five centuries to England’s one, 61 sixes to England’s 27 and 47 wickets taken to England’s 36.

But Root is relying on the competitive juices that come with every meeting between these two teams to drag his side out of their torpor. England were 2-0 behind after the first two Tests of this year’s Ashes series but rallied to dominate the next three games and would surely have improved on a 2-2 draw had rain not intervened at Old Trafford. “One thing that the Ashes does is, we’ve played a lot of cricket against a number of their players. If we can use that in a positive way then we have to take it into the game,” he said. “You can always recall little things that can work in your favour.

A press conference clip of Australia captain Pat Cummins smirking and suppressing giggles as he contemplated England’s World Cup struggles has been duly noted but has not raised Root’s hackles. “Let’s face it, if it was the other way around would we be doing the same? Probably,” he said. “If it motivates us a little bit more, great. It hurts, but it always hurts to be in this position, sat at the bottom of the table. There is no better motivator for any group of English players than to play against the Aussies. “From my point of view, I throw everything into giving my absolute 100 per cent for England and can look people in the eye and shake them by the hand and move onto the next game.

The day began well for the Wombats with skipper John Moore winning the toss and sending Gippsland into bat. But initially it appeared to be a bad decision, with Bob Phillips injuring his knee in the first over and being unable to bowl again. Both openers belted the ball to all parts of the field until Carl Muscat bowled Andrew Smith 13 (14) and Jim Gregory trapped Fred Debono 12 (23) LBW. The Goannas were 2/42 in the 8th over and well on target to score over 200 runs. Captain Ian Southall 11 (15) was first batter to be stumped by Russell Ferguson, this time off the bowling of Gregory. The second stumping was Warren Dummett 14 (24) off the bowling of Muscat. The Goannas were 4/64 in the 15th over, before Steve Lincoln 25 (30) retired and the score was 4/89 after 20 overs. Tight bowling and good ground fielding restricted the run rate and the bowlers were hard to score off; this resulted in five wickets falling for 10 runs in a seven-over spell. Gordon Cowling 15 (20) was run out by a brilliant stop by Muscat…throwing to Keith Houghton. Graham Davey took the next two wickets, both bowled, with Barry Nunn 8 (11) and Dave Noble 4 (7) his two victims. Houghton then bowled the next two batters, Ron Lovel 5 (8) and Kel Bond 1 (5). Gregory took the 10th wicket when he bowled Wayne Tatterson 10 (20). The Wombats reject, Ron Milnes 5 (9) remained not out and after 30.5 overs the Goannas were all out for 128. Wombats Bowling: (Man of the Match) Jim Gregory 4.5-3/20, Graham Davey 6-2/20, Keith Houghton 5-2/15, Carl Muscat 6-2/15, Pieter Loos 3-0/18, Mike Newton 3-0/14, Brendon Thomas 2-0/15 and Bob Phillips 1-0/10. The Wombats opened with Barry Cain and Graham Davey, with accurate bowling by Gordon Cowling and Ron Lovel seeing only one run scored off the first four overs. Cain then straight drove Ron Lovel for four and the Wombats were away. Cain 5 (19) was unluckily run out by Andrew Smith with a direct throw from 25 meters that hit the wicket. Davey 18 (25) retired before the Wombats lost three wickets for 10 runs in three overs. Jon Martindale 18 (23) was caught by Fred Debono off the bowling of Barry Nunn, Pieter Loos 2 (3) caught by Warren Dummett off the bowling of Kel Bond, and Brendon Thomas 3 (7) was Bond’s second wicket when he was caught by Dave Noble. Carl Muscat 25 (28) retired before the 20th over when the Wombats were 4/85, this was four runs less than the Goannas total at the same time. David Wells 11 (10) retired hurt before the Wombats lost three wickets for three runs when Mike Newton 10 (20) was caught by Gordon Cowling off the bowling of Dave Noble, Jim Gregory was bowled for a second ball duck by Ian Southall, and Keith Houghton 13 (28) was bowled by Southall. The Wombats were now 7 for 111 in the 29th over, and the equation seemed simple with 18 runs required off 11 overs. But accurate bowling by the Goannas saw John Moore 2 (4) became Ian Southall’s third victim when he was bowled. By the 34th over the Wombats had crawled to 124, then there were three maidens in a row before Russell Ferguson 8 (25) retired. This brought the first retiree back to the crease, Graham Davey, who hit two fours in three balls to take the total to 132 on the 5th ball of the 37th over. Davey 26 (32) and the injured Bob Phillips 3 (22) were both not out. Goannas Bowling: Ian Southall 8-3/14, Gordon Cowling 7-0/12, Ron Lovel 7-0/21, Andrew Smith 2-0/22, Barry Nunn 2-1/10, Fred Debono 1-0/11. Ron Milnes 2-0/9, Dave Noble 4-1/9, Kel Bond 4.5-2/19. This was a great game of over 70’s cricket played in the right spirit, which could have gone either way, but finally the Wombats have won a game. The next game for the Wombats is on Sunday 12 November at Outtrim against the Glen Waverley Hawks. -John Moore-","pubDate":"2023-11-02 18:01:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"berwicknews_starcommunity","source_priority":4220755,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"5a49814b7599edfc0a6162ab04b55941","title":"Afghanistan won't reach semis by just talking about it, says Jonathan Trott","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/video/cwc-2023-afghanistan-wont-reach-semis-by-just-talking-about-it-says-jonathan-trott-ahead-of-netherlands-clash-2457379-2023-11-02?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Afghanistan won't reach semis by just talking about it, says Jonathan Trott","content":"World Cup 2023: Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott has said that Afghanistan won't reach the semi-finals by just talking about it.

The 302-run win is India’s biggest margin of victory by runs ever at a Men’s Cricket World Cup. It is also the second-biggest such margin by any team in the history of the tournament, falling only behind the 309-run record set by Australia against Netherlands a week ago. Only three times in the history of the Men’s ODI game has there been a bigger margin of victory by runs: Zimbabwe against USA in Harare in June of this year, Australia's win over the Dutch in this tournament, and India’s hammering of Sri Lanka back in January. That means of course that the four biggest wins by runs in Men’s ODI cricket history have all come in 2023. Mohammed Shami makes history Mohammed Shami is now India’s leading wicket-taker at Men’s Cricket World Cups. His 45 wickets have come in just 14 matches at an eye-watering average of 12.91. India’s previous highest wicket-taker in the tournament’s history was Zaheer Khan, whose 44 wickets came in 23 matches. Only seven bowlers have ever taken more Cricket World Cup wickets than Shami, with none doing so in as few matches and none having as close to as good an average. Shami has taken more wicket hauls of four or more in World Cups than any other bowler. His record of seven such feats surpasses Mitchell Starc (6) and Imran Tahir (5). Virat Kohli continues his fine form Virat Kohli has risen up a spot in the list of the Men’s Cricket World Cup’s greatest-ever run-scorers. His latest effort saw move to 1472 career runs in the tournament, and helped him leapfrog Australian David Warner into fourth in the all-time list. Only Kumar Sangakkara (1532), Ricky Ponting (1743) and Sachin Tendulkar (2278) have scored more in their careers. Kohli’s tally for the current tournament moved on to 442 in seven innings, just one run shy of his effort from the 2019 tournament, where he averaged 55.37 across nine matches. Dilshan Madushanka makes his mark It wasn’t just the India team making waves at the Wankhede. Dilshan Madushanka’s five-wicket haul means he is now the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 18. Shaheen Shah Afridi, Marco Jansen and Adam Zampa are the closest to the Sri Lankan with 16 apiece, while Jasprit Bumrah (15) and Mohammed Shami (14) are not much further behind.

By Tum Balogun For Mailonline Published: 22:00 GMT, 2 November 2023 | Updated: 22:00 GMT, 2 November 2023 e-mail View comments England and Manchester United goalkeeper Mary Earps has been named The Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year. The 30-year-old played a crucial role in the Lionesses' run to the final of the Women's World Cup and was awarded with the Golden Glove. Earps played every minute for Sarina Wiegman 's side at the tournament, keeping three clean sheets and conceding only four goals in seven matches. She also produced what looked at the time to be a crucial penalty save in the closing stages of August's final in Perth but England ultimately finished as runners-up to Spain. Ben Taylor, editor of The Sunday Times said : 'Mary Earps’ performance at the 2023 Football World Cup cemented her spot as one of the game's greatest goalkeepers.

The 30-year-old also produced a wonderful penalty save in the closing stages of the final 'Her and the rest of the Lionesses showed determination, skill, and resilience to reach the finals and will continue to inspire many young girls for years to come.' Two-time heptathlon world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson, seven-time Paralympic gold medallist Hannah Cockroft and English cricketer Tammy Beaumont were also among the nominees. The prestigious awards, which are now in the 36th year, recognise and celebrate the outstanding contribution made to sport by women at all levels. Previous winners of the Sportswoman of the Year accolade include Emma Raducanu, Dina Asher-Smith, Elise Christie, Sally Gunnell, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Denise Lewis, Dame Kelly Holmes, Zara Phillips, Victoria Pendleton, Christine Ohuruogu and Hollie Doyle. 2022 Commonwealth Games 10,000 metres champion, Eilish McColgan, took home the prize last year. Earps also scooped the The Best FIFA Women's Goalkeeper award last season The Man United stopper has seen her level of celebrity skyrocket following success with the Lionesses Away from the main prize, snowboarder Mia Brookes clinched the Young Sportswoman of the Year gong. The 16-year-old won gold in the slopestyle at the 2023 World Championships in Georgia. Cockroft claimed the Citi Disability Sportswoman of the Year, while three-time Olympic medallist Katie Archibald received the Helen Rollason Award for Inspiration. Taylor added: 'These awards also recognise that sport and exercise is vital for the physical and mental health of millions of women and congratulate our Grassroots winner Aimee Rees, and Tess Howard for winning the Changemaker award for campaigning to make female sports kits more accessible.' Wiegman's Lionesses' were also honoured on the night with the prize for Team of the Year. Earps's stellar campaign was recognised at the Ballon d'Or awards in Paris on Monday , where she placed fifth and achieved the highest-ever finish for a female footballer. She was also the subject of a PR own-goal from England's shirt manufacturer Nike, who took the peculiar decision to omit her jersey from their collection that went on sale ahead of the World Cup. Nike put the 'Earps 1' replica jerseys on sale following a backlash during the World Cup Earps hit out at the ‘extremely hurtful’ decision with over 170,000 people signing a petition calling on the sportswear giants to change their mind. It is understood Nike originally decided against selling Earps’ shirt for commercial reasons but a U-turn was made in August when they announced they would retail limited quantities. Replica jerseys finally went on sale earlier this month, though many fans were left disappointed as they quickly sold out . Earps's increased celebrity has seen her gain over a million followers on TikTok. She had considered retirement after being dropped by England in 2019 but has seen a remarkable turnaround in recent years. IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!

How did it go so wrong?","content":"In the last week of the Wallabies’ Rugby World Cup campaign, players and coaches were living in a state of purgatory; neither in the World Cup finals nor out of them. Having lost to Fiji and Wales , the Wallabies had effectively also lost their chance to play in knockout stages for the first time in World Cup history. But with Fiji needing to secure just one bonus point against Portugal a weekend later to make it official, the zombie Wallabies continued training for a week at their base in Saint-Etienne, a small French city about an hour’s drive from Lyon, for the remote chance they could make it through. As the week wore on, players tried to keep the mood light and a group of Wallabies coaching staff – without coach Eddie Jones – were spotted out drinking beers in the town square. But camp life carried a strange vibe, and Jones made it even more unusual when he started pulling players aside at the team hotel, according to a Wallabies player who spoke to the Herald on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise his employment. “There were a couple of very bizarre meetings in the last week of the World Cup, after Portugal. They felt like goodbye meetings,” the player recalled. “They were one-on-one meetings. Guys would come out and go ‘was that a goodbye? Don’t we have a plan for next year?’. Mate, it was bizarre.” Jones was contracted to coach the Wallabies for another four years. But five weeks after the Herald reported Jones had done a Zoom interview with Japan and 12 days after Jones stood at Coogee Oval and said he was in for the long haul through to 2027, the goodbye was finally made official. He resigned as Wallabies coach on October 29, citing unmet guarantees from Rugby Australia about resources and high-performance reform. Before revealing his resignation to media outlets, Jones sent a message to the Wallabies squad WhatsApp group. “It said, ‘I am proud to have worked with you. Contrary to media I haven’t signed anything (with Japan) and am going to spend the next month deciding my next move’,” the Wallaby player said. It ended a short but chaos-filled second-coming for Jones, which began with optimism and high hopes, but ended with Rugby Australia in its deepest ever hole. To understand how – and why – the Jones journey went off the rails so badly, the Herald has spoken to a large group of people directly involved in the slow-moving train wreck. At the end of 2022 - well before his return to Australia - Jones appeared to be in more immediate strife than his then-Wallabies counterpart Dave Rennie. As England coach, Jones was under heavy fire for the team’s lacklustre form and results, which had seen the English win just five from 12 Tests. The Wallabies hadn’t fared much better, with five wins from 14 Tests. But after also enduring an injury toll that saw 40 players sidelined in the Test winter, Wallabies players felt enthused about the 2023 Rugby World Cup, after a spring tour where they’d fielded a weakened team and only lost to the world No.1 and No.2 sides, Ireland and France, by the closest of margins. “We were a couple of penalty goals away from going five [wins] from five [Tests] and people going ‘look out for Australia’,” a Wallaby player, who requested anonymity to talk freely, said. RA commissioned former Olympic rower Bo Hanson to review the year, and a separate examination of the worrying injury toll was also completed. The results were shared with the players at the Wallabies’ first camp on the Gold Coast on January 10. As the rest of the nation was focused on the summer of cricket and tennis, Rennie gathered a 44-man squad to lay out the plans for the Rugby World Cup campaign to come. “Looking back, I guess what they were hoping to get out of it [the review] was that Rens [Rennie] had lost the room. But it came back glowingly in favour of him,” the Wallaby player said. “Everyone loved him and he was an incredible coach. There was no doubt we had problems with injury rates and all that, but to be honest, that review did what it needed to do.” Rugby Australia chairman Hamish McLennan was fuming about the Wallabies’ results on the spring tour, and in particular a loss to Italy on November 13. As RA’s representative in Florence, defeat was difficult viewing for McLennan at Stadio Artemio Franchi. The Wallabies were made to play five Tests in a row on that tour, an increase on the usual four. Knowing his first-choice side would struggle playing on five consecutive weekends, Rennie made 11 changes to his starting side and it backfired with a one-point loss. Rennie’s future was now in question, and McLennan had eyes for another coach. The well-connected Sydney business figure, who also is chairman of the REA Group and deputy chair of Magellan Financial Group, had already begun a charm offensive to woo Eddie Jones home as Wallabies coach in 2024, and through to the Rugby World Cup in Australia in 2027. Jones was on contract with the Rugby Football Union until the end of 2023. The pair first discussed the plan in July 2022 when Jones was in Sydney with England for the last game of a three-Test series. McLennan hosted a dinner for Jones at his Lavender Bay home, where they ate Portuguese chicken and salad made by the chairman’s wife Lucinda. The dinner occurred just days after Jones reacted angrily to a fan labelling him a “traitor” at the Sydney Cricket Ground. When McLennan discovered the RFU had not inserted a no-compete clause in their termination agreement with Jones, he saw his chance. Selling the vision of RA being on the cusp of a resources boom via a private equity deal, and with long-overdue centralisation reform now a matter of when, not if, McLennan convinced Jones to come a year early and a five-year deal was fleshed out. Rennie would need to be sacked but some on RA’s board – comprised of Brett Godfrey, Daniel Herbert, Phil Waugh, Pip Marlow, Karen Penrose, Jane Wilson, Matthew Hanning and the then-chief executive Andy Marinos – weren’t immediately sold. Sources familiar with the boardroom discussions, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said there were dissenting views, but after debating the risks and rewards, the board agreed to make the change. Behind the scenes, McLennan led the negotiations. Marinos disagreed with the call to appoint Jones. “Nothing was going to stop Hamish,” said a source familiar with discussions. “He went after Eddie. Hamish went and got his man. He believed it was going to be the magic pill.” With Rennie’s win percentage at 38, the board decided the chance to sign Jones was worth the gamble. McLennan argued ex-Wallabies were supportive of the move, and that Jones had a “hard edge” that Rennie did not. The chair later upset some players and fans by appearing to criticise Rennie’s penchant for playing guitar in team bonding sessions. “I would rather we have somebody who’s really tough and we win World Cups than we have a Kumbaya session, everyone holds hands and we fail,” McLennan said. Marinos publicly defended the decision to sack Rennie but resigned as chief executive five months later, after his relationship with McLennan became strained. Marinos declined to comment when contacted this week. McLennan rejects the argument that hiring Jones was a captain’s pick. “We went in with good faith ... we at Rugby Australia felt that we needed to make a change and it [appointing Jones] wasn’t just me, it went through the rugby committee and the board,” McLennan said this week at Sydney Airport. “There was an appropriate level of governance around that decision, but we weren’t tracking well. We lost a lot of games last year to big teams. And so all I’d just say to the rugby public, is that you’ve got to continue to make decisions, not all of them work out. If this was a business, you would find that you don’t get 100 per cent success rate and I stand by the calls.” Waugh, who replaced Marinos as RA chief executive, said on Tuesday of the Jones hiring: “Hindsight is a wonderful thing. When you make decisions at any time during your career ... you get presented information at the time and you make decisions based on that information.” Players had mixed emotions. On one hand, they were upset about Rennie’s departure, but on the other, the return of Jones - a noted Rugby World Cup specialist - generated buzz. “The guys were disappointed,” the Wallabies player said. “But a lot were also excited. If they were gonna get rid of Rens and bring someone in, Eddie Jones … look at what he has done. Everyone fell in love with the idea of a bloke coming in who has done well at World Cups.” The next six months were a honeymoon period. RA basked in the hyper-luminous glow of Jones, whose profile and personality immediately saw rugby back on the TV news and back pages of newspapers after spending too long in the wilderness. For a while, there wasn’t a lunch or school fundraiser on a Friday that didn’t have Jones on hand as a special guest. He answered questions, cracked jokes and built Australian rugby’s stocks back up one room at a time. Jones could have a room of coaches, business figures, sporting identities, members of the media, eating out of the palm of his hand with wisecracks and a confidence-inducing spiel about the Wallabies being a genuine chance to win the World Cup. He was often seen volunteering his time to coach juniors, too. NRL supremo and Nine broadcaster Phil Gould agreed to do a one-on-one interview with Jones in the sheds at Coogee Oval, which aired in February . One onlooker recalls marveling at the sight of Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley queueing patiently to get a ball signed by Jones after one function in Melbourne. However, the sailing wasn’t entirely smooth. Jones privately began bemoaning the quality of performances of Australian Super Rugby teams, and pulling together a coaching staff became a major struggle. Apart from forwards coach Dan McKellar, Jones didn’t want to carry forward any of Rennie’s crew. Experienced forwards coach Laurie Fisher was let go. McKellar did not accept an offer to stay and instead took the Leicester Tigers head coach job after getting a picture of how inexperienced Jones’ coaching staff would be. In the end, former rugby league player Brett Hodgson became defence coach, and Brad Davis – a former defence coach at London Irish– became attack coach. Brumbies scrum guru Dan Palmer took on a role as lineout coach, and little-known French coach Pierre-Henry Broncan – a former halfback – was employed as a maul coach. Super Rugby sides were supportive of Jones but one official, who did not want to be named because of their continued employment, said alarm bells about communication with the Wallabies program first rang when Jones held his first mid-season camp in April. Having left their Super Rugby teams for several days, but with games still to play on the weekend, the Wallabies did their training in the camp - but didn’t wear GPS devices to track the training loads, as is standard. Super Rugby teams were left in the dark and unclear about how much training players needed to do when they returned from the Gold Coast. The opacity of Jones’ long-term plans also became an issue in May. In Australian rugby circles, speculation that Jones would not see out his full, five-year contract had been bubbling since he landed in Australia in late January. But most expected the coach would at least stay until after the British and Irish Lions tour in 2025. Jones sidestepped questions about his future until he told former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio on an Evening Standard podcast on May 31 that he only intended to stay for one year with the Wallabies. “I’m only coaching ’til this World Cup,” Jones said. “I’ve signed [until the end of 2027], but as I’ve made the mistake before, I’ve stayed too long. So we win the World Cup, it will be time to go. If we lose the World Cup, it will be time to go.” It left Australian rugby stunned: did Jones just say the quiet part out loud? The Herald immediately messaged Jones to offer a chance to clarify, but he declined on several occasions. Senior RA officials privately dismissed the remarks as “Eddie being Eddie”, but when pushed by the media for a comment, a spokesman said Jones was contracted through to 2027 and the comment was referencing his single-minded focus on the 2023 Rugby World Cup. Five days later, Jones contacted the Herald and asked if his position could be clarified in print . “I am here for five years,” Jones said. “But my only concentration is this Rugby World Cup, so I don’t think past that.” Jones had been emphasising the need for strong leadership from senior players in the Wallabies’ 2023 campaign. At least once a week during Super Rugby, Jones convened the leadership group on Zoom calls, along with sports psychology experts. The message was drilled into them that a belief in the team’s ability to win the World Cup would be crucial to helping young players think the same way. “He painted a picture that experienced guys were going to be important to the World Cup,” a Wallaby player said. In late June, Jones had named Michael Hooper and James Slipper as co-captains and incumbent players were used in the Wallabies’ first two games against South Africa and Argentina. After the Wallabies travelled to South Africa, documentary crews began filming the team’s every move, with Jones wearing a microphone at training and in team meetings. A heavy kicking strategy was employed against the Springboks but they thumped the Wallabies 43-12 in Pretoria. When the Wallabies lost their second consecutive game a week later to Argentina at CommBank Stadium in Sydney in July, Jones lost faith in the senior players. Hooper missed the Test with a calf injury. “That was when everything changed. Some switch was flicked,” the Wallabies player recalled. Jones went for a younger team, and new leadership, to take on the All Blacks in two Tests in Melbourne and Dunedin. Having changed tactics to hold the ball more, and attack directly, the Wallabies began to find their groove. They lost at the MCG but a week later in Dunedin, the Wallabies led 17-3 before being beaten at the death 23-20. Players and coaches were slowly adjusting to life inside Camp Jones, some with more comfort than others. A notoriously hard taskmaster inclined to have blunt conversations, Jones is famous for churning through assistant coaches. But unlike in his first stint with the Wallabies, most players now didn’t feel like they were walking on eggshells. “There was a barrier. The staff would really cop it, the leaders were the next barrier and the players were mostly sheltered from it,” a Wallabies player said. “Hoops was the guy who stood up for the group. It wasn’t confrontational but in those meetings if someone wasn’t right, Hoops would say it. Maybe that was deemed as being too challenging.” Elsewhere, optimism about the Wallabies’ World Cup chances wasn’t in great supply. On July 20 – the night the Matildas began their soon-to-be famous World Cup campaign against Ireland at Homebush – RA sponsor RM Williams hosted an intimate dinner in the exclusive Clock Tower at Shell House in Sydney for rugby supporters, media executives and corporate supporters. The occasion was to launch a new RM Williams line of rugby apparel, but it doubled as a chance for RA to rally enthusiasm for the upcoming World Cup. Australia’s two World Cup-winning skippers, John Eales and Nick Farr-Jones, were asked to give a few words. They largely stuck to their stock anecdotes from the past. When the dessert course had been cleared and guests stood to chat, some privately shared concerns about the team’s World Cup chances. The Dunedin performance had given Wallabies fans a glimmer of hope but things took a sharp and unexpected turn when Jones settled on his 33-man squad for the Rugby World Cup. Jones left out many senior players – none more shocking than Hooper, who’d been battling a calf injury but was expected to be fit by the start of the World Cup; his last before international retirement. Quade Cooper, Pete Samu, Bernard Foley, Jed Holloway, Reece Hodge and Tom Wright were also omitted. A day before the public found out, however, the players were told. But in contrast to recent World Cup campaigns, where Michael Cheika organised for former Wallabies to ring players with the good news, the process for the 2023 announcement was flawed. The 33 players picked to go were told via a phone call from Wallabies general manager Chris Webb in the afternoon. One bolter, who’d had no contact with the Wallabies for weeks, had to hurriedly pack a bag for a flight the next day and re-arrange his winter plans. But by 7pm, unsuccessful candidates had still not been told about their fate, and there was a flight to Darwin early the next day for a camp. Sources with knowledge of the plan said Jones was due to make the calls to players who missed out. But the calls were delayed because the coach was on a flight back to Australia. Jones had dashed back to the UK after the Dunedin match with his wife to pick up their Papillon dog, Annie, and take it to their home in Japan. With the Wallabies’ WhatsApp group lighting up with excited chat, players who hadn’t been told began to phone Webb, asking what was going on. Jones ended up speaking to Hooper that night but Cooper didn’t take his call, and the pair still haven’t spoken. Jones later explained he’d left out Hooper and star centre Len Ikitau because he didn’t want to carry injured players who may not make the first game. But he also named Max Jorgensen, Samu Kerevi and Josh Kemeny who were all recovering from respective injuries. Jones pushed the button on a young squad for the World Cup and conceded he felt that senior players from the Rennie era had maxed out their potential. It was the youngest, most inexperienced Wallabies squad ever sent to a Rugby World Cup. The public were shocked by Jones’ inexperienced squad, and so were the Wallabies. “It just went against a lot of what he had said all year,” a Wallaby told the Herald . “He started saying things like ’27 is important. All of a sudden, it felt like ‘ah, he’s put in a safety net for us not doing well in France’. The belief levels – well, no-one spoke about it – but you could feel it, that he is grooming guys for the 2027 World Cup and this one isn’t important.” On the eve of the Wallabies’ departure from Australia, one of Jones’ assistants was unable to continue. Attack coach Davis, who’d been driven particularly hard by Jones, along with Hodgson, left the team camp in Darwin. RA announced Davis’ exit a few days later – citing “family reasons” – as the team gathered at the airport to fly out to the World Cup. “There’s a potential candidate ready to step up now,” Jones told reporters. “I think we’ll improve the coaching staff.” Jones, who hadn’t held in-person press conference since naming his World Cup squad, stood in front of members of the fourth estate at a media conference at Sydney Airport. Like the rest of the touring group, Jones had a brand new Akubra hat on his head. The squad was flying out to France for the Rugby World Cup but the mood was anything but celebratory. Jones bristled when the questions started. Why had Cooper not taken his call? Did Hooper, a Wallabies great, really have to ring team management to find out his World Cup dream was over? Jones snapped, labelling it the “worst press conference” he’d ever been involved in and inviting journalists to “give yourselves uppercuts” before walking through to customs. “There was no need for it,” said a Wallabies squad member. “It was funny but it’s not professional. It was just creating a circus when we should be focusing on rugby. Guys were wondering ‘is this really good for us?’.” About an hour after the press conference, Jones texted a reporter who had asked questions in the scrum. “Don’t ever contact me again,” Jones wrote. Asked why, Jones blocked the journalist’s number. During the World Cup, a Japanese media report emerged suggesting Jones was a candidate for that country’s head coaching role in 2024. “Bullshit and gossip,” Jones responded via a Wallabies spokesperson. The story wasn’t over, though. After Jones’ denials, the Herald’s Tom Decent received a tantalising tip that Jones took part in a secret Zoom interview with the Japanese Rugby Football Union days before the World Cup began. The Herald spent days investigating and fact-checking the information. Players were oblivious to the Japanese talks, until the Herald’s story broke hours before Australia’s match against Wales. Jones deflected questions about the Japan interview, saying: “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Captain Will Skelton told the press that the Herald’s story had not disrupted the preparation and that most players didn’t know anything about it. But a Wallabies player this week recounted a different version of events. “We were talking about it on the day of the game,” he said. “It was a bizarre mood after that game. We got the same line [from Jones] as the media got. That was alarm bells. He didn’t even trust us.” Jones told players, coaches and his bosses at RA there was nothing to the story. Press conferences were tense. At one point, a Wallabies media manager asked how much longer the probing would go on for. Jones’ inexperienced squad was only one part of the Wallabies’ problems heading into the Rugby World Cup. Tactically, the coach had elected to abandon the way the team had been playing for the last three years and focus on a game based on ad-lib attack. All major Test nations, and a majority of successful club teams, operate with attacking structures, which dictate default patterns players will attack from on the field. Jones decided the Wallabies wouldn’t play with any pre-set structures, and instead attack with more freedom, as they saw the opportunity before them. But also believing possession rugby was dead, Jones didn’t want to hold the ball for more than four phases. Prior to the last warm-up game against France, Jones changed the game plan again, to keep their style hidden. Australia lost to Fiji for the first time in 69 years and the next week their World Cup fate was sealed with a 40-6 loss to Wales. It was the heaviest defeat in Wallabies World Cup history. Jones covered his face with his hands. Wallabies fans, many who had paid large sums of money to be in France, walked out of the stadium in Lyon before the full-time whistle had sounded. Along with Jones’ links to Japan – which was now being reported by other world media outlets – the Wallabies’ disastrous campaign saw the heat intensify on Jones. When Jones returned home from France, he fronted a press conference at Coogee Oval on October 17. But despite speculation he may quit, Jones repeated he was in for the long haul. But public support was thin on the ground and within a week Jones had begun working on an exit strategy. In the week of the Rugby World Cup final, McLennan and RA hosted a function at the Australian Embassy in Paris on October 25, celebrating the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia. In a room looking out to the adjacent Eiffel Tower, World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont and New Zealand rugby boss Mark Robinson were among the distinguished guests. Unbeknown to most people in the room, Jones and his representatives informed RA earlier that day they did not see a future in Australia for the under-fire coach. There was one last flurry of headlines, when Jones told Herald columnist Peter FitzSimons, a former Wallaby, that he didn’t regret omitting Hooper, Cooper and Foley and described the trio as not the right role models for the team. Hooper declined to respond, but current and former Wallabies were stunned. “It was really disappointing and it didn’t sit well with the players at all,” the Wallabies player said. “It felt like he was trying to blame what’s happened here for the last decade for all his problems. He experimented on a style of footy that hasn’t really been done before, with a really young group, and hasn’t really owned it.” With Waugh now back in Australia, discussions via Zoom began for an exit. Details of the negotiations are unclear, but the talks were swift. By Sunday evening news filtered out that Jones had resigned. Jones did an exit interview with The Australian , bemoaning the speed in which the game could achieve centralisation, and later told FitzSimons: “[I] gave it a run. Hopefully be the catalyst for change. Sometimes you have to eat shit for others to eat caviar further down the track.” Jones may be gone but the fallout of his 10-month rollercoaster is only just beginning. Fronting a press conference this week, Waugh said the RA leadership who’d gambled on Jones resurrecting the Wallabies would take ownership of the fact it, in fact, sank the Wallabies to a new low. But McLennan said he won’t follow Jones and resign. Waugh said Australian rugby’s voting members have the power to effect change on the Rugby Australia board, if they see fit. For the Wallabies players, the Jones saga – and the lost year of 2023 – just represents a wasted opportunity. Many won’t get another shot at playing in Rugby World Cup, or even wearing a Wallabies jersey. News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

India’s imposing total came on the back of three half-centuries from Shubman Gill (92), Virat Kohli (88) and Shreyas Iyer (82) but Madushanka certainly had a memorable game to become the tournament’s highest wicket taker with 18-wickets in seven games. The 23-year-old seamer stunned the Wankhede crowd into silence with a terrific delivery to remove Indian skipper Rohit Sharma in the second ball of the innings but a strong second wicket stand between Gill and Kohli set the tone for India’s mammoth total, after being put into bat first by Kusal Mendis. Sharma had clipped the first ball to the fine-leg boundary and was looking for the inswinger but an off-cutter nipped away with the angle, crashing to the off-stump to give marching orders to the Indian skipper. Both Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera generated plenty of movement off the deck to keep both Gill and Kohli in check as the hosts managed only 25 runs in the first five overs for the loss of Sharma’s wicket. India would have been two down, had Charith Asalanka at cover point grabbed a flying catch off Gill in the penultimate ball of Madushanka’s third over, but the ball burst through the hand to offer another life to Gill. Two balls later, Chameera nearly caught Kohli off his own bowling when the batsman got a leading edge, but the ball popped out of Chameera’s hand. Chameera operated with a perfect line and length and his first two overs conceded no run. But once the pitch settled, scoring looked easy as Gill and Kohli capitalised on those opportunities to stitch a massive second wicket stand and put hosts, who are eyeing their third World Cup title, in control. The partnership grew in stature at a steady pace and was threatening to take the game completely away from the Sri Lankans when Madushanka struck twice with his third spell. With both players in sight of their centuries, Madushanka sent Gill and Kohli back to the dressing room as Sri Lanka shed a sigh of relief. The two had scored 189 runs for the second wicket when Madushanka with a slow off-cutter in his third spell deceived Gill. Gill, who was just eight runs short of the century, attempted to guide the ball to deep-third-man area but the extra bounce saw him managing to channel it to the wicket-keeper. Gill’s run-a-ball innings included 11 boundaries and two sixes—one over mid-wicket and the other over long-on. The 23-year-old seamer then deceived the big fish, Kolhi, with another slower ball sending the vociferous Wankhede crowd into silence. Kohli was early into the drive and offered a simple catch to Pathum Nissanka at short-cover as Madushanka finished his third spell of two overs with two wickets for 12 runs. Kohli hit 88 off 94 balls with 11 boundaries. KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer then added a quick 60 runs off 47 balls between them before Chameera removed KL Rahul, caught by Dushan Hemantha, at short extra-cover. Madushanka, who is enjoying a remarkable success with the ball in the World Cup, then removed Suryakumar Yadav to grab his fourth wicket. Yadav looked to hook a short ball from Madushanka but did not make a connection as it passed to the wicket-keeper. The umpire was unmoved but Mendis reviewed to find a slight spike on ultra edge. Despite losing Rahul and Yadav quickly, Iyre continued the onslaught, hitting his 16th ODI half century. The left-hander hit 82 off 56 balls with six sixes and three boundaries before Madushanka claimed his first five-wicket haul. Irye was running riot, hitting Madushanka for two consecutive sixes when a slow ball did the trick as Iyre sliced it straight up in the air for Maheesh Theekshana to grab a straight forward chance. Ravindra Jadeja made a brisk 35 off 23 balls before he ran himself out in the last ball of their innings. Sri Lanka made one change to the playing XI with Dushan Hemantha coming in for misfiring Dhananjaya de Silva.

The Ashes adversaries meet on Saturday at Ahmedabad’s 130,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium, which will also host the tournament final on November 19. Only one of the two teams has any prospect of making it that far, with England propping up the table in 10th place after one win in six while Australia appear set fair for the knockouts after four victories. But Root refuses to believe a side who came in as defending champions and well fancied to defend their crown have slipped as far as the standings suggest. “Man for man, I’d have this team every day over the Australians,” he said, with an air of confidence that has largely eluded England since they touched down in India. “We might not have played as well as we can do but we know when we play our best stuff the best teams struggle to compete with us. “I look at this team and it’s more than capable of achieving way more than it has done throughout this tournament.

We have massively underachieved to date and have three opportunities to show the world what we are capable of doing and what I know we are capable of doing.” The statistical head-to-head makes for grim reading, with Australia boasting five centuries to England’s one, 61 sixes to England’s 27 and 47 wickets taken to England’s 36.

But Root is relying on the competitive juices that come with every meeting between these two teams to drag his side out of their torpor. England were 2-0 behind after the first two Tests of this year’s Ashes series but rallied to dominate the next three games and would surely have improved on a 2-2 draw had rain not intervened at Old Trafford. “One thing that the Ashes does is, we’ve played a lot of cricket against a number of their players. If we can use that in a positive way then we have to take it into the game,” he said. “You can always recall little things that can work in your favour.

Probably,” he said. “If it motivates us a little bit more, great. It hurts, but it always hurts to be in this position, sat at the bottom of the table. There is no better motivator for any group of English players than to play against the Aussies. “From my point of view, I throw everything into giving my absolute 100 per cent for England and can look people in the eye and shake them by the hand and move onto the next game.

The day began well for the Wombats with skipper John Moore winning the toss and sending Gippsland into bat. But initially it appeared to be a bad decision, with Bob Phillips injuring his knee in the first over and being unable to bowl again. Both openers belted the ball to all parts of the field until Carl Muscat bowled Andrew Smith 13 (14) and Jim Gregory trapped Fred Debono 12 (23) LBW. The Goannas were 2/42 in the 8th over and well on target to score over 200 runs. Captain Ian Southall 11 (15) was first batter to be stumped by Russell Ferguson, this time off the bowling of Gregory. The second stumping was Warren Dummett 14 (24) off the bowling of Muscat. The Goannas were 4/64 in the 15th over, before Steve Lincoln 25 (30) retired and the score was 4/89 after 20 overs. Tight bowling and good ground fielding restricted the run rate and the bowlers were hard to score off; this resulted in five wickets falling for 10 runs in a seven-over spell. Gordon Cowling 15 (20) was run out by a brilliant stop by Muscat…throwing to Keith Houghton. Graham Davey took the next two wickets, both bowled, with Barry Nunn 8 (11) and Dave Noble 4 (7) his two victims. Houghton then bowled the next two batters, Ron Lovel 5 (8) and Kel Bond 1 (5). Gregory took the 10th wicket when he bowled Wayne Tatterson 10 (20). The Wombats reject, Ron Milnes 5 (9) remained not out and after 30.5 overs the Goannas were all out for 128. Wombats Bowling: (Man of the Match) Jim Gregory 4.5-3/20, Graham Davey 6-2/20, Keith Houghton 5-2/15, Carl Muscat 6-2/15, Pieter Loos 3-0/18, Mike Newton 3-0/14, Brendon Thomas 2-0/15 and Bob Phillips 1-0/10. The Wombats opened with Barry Cain and Graham Davey, with accurate bowling by Gordon Cowling and Ron Lovel seeing only one run scored off the first four overs. Cain then straight drove Ron Lovel for four and the Wombats were away. Cain 5 (19) was unluckily run out by Andrew Smith with a direct throw from 25 meters that hit the wicket. Davey 18 (25) retired before the Wombats lost three wickets for 10 runs in three overs. Jon Martindale 18 (23) was caught by Fred Debono off the bowling of Barry Nunn, Pieter Loos 2 (3) caught by Warren Dummett off the bowling of Kel Bond, and Brendon Thomas 3 (7) was Bond’s second wicket when he was caught by Dave Noble. Carl Muscat 25 (28) retired before the 20th over when the Wombats were 4/85, this was four runs less than the Goannas total at the same time. David Wells 11 (10) retired hurt before the Wombats lost three wickets for three runs when Mike Newton 10 (20) was caught by Gordon Cowling off the bowling of Dave Noble, Jim Gregory was bowled for a second ball duck by Ian Southall, and Keith Houghton 13 (28) was bowled by Southall. The Wombats were now 7 for 111 in the 29th over, and the equation seemed simple with 18 runs required off 11 overs. But accurate bowling by the Goannas saw John Moore 2 (4) became Ian Southall’s third victim when he was bowled. By the 34th over the Wombats had crawled to 124, then there were three maidens in a row before Russell Ferguson 8 (25) retired. This brought the first retiree back to the crease, Graham Davey, who hit two fours in three balls to take the total to 132 on the 5th ball of the 37th over. Davey 26 (32) and the injured Bob Phillips 3 (22) were both not out. Goannas Bowling: Ian Southall 8-3/14, Gordon Cowling 7-0/12, Ron Lovel 7-0/21, Andrew Smith 2-0/22, Barry Nunn 2-1/10, Fred Debono 1-0/11. Ron Milnes 2-0/9, Dave Noble 4-1/9, Kel Bond 4.5-2/19. This was a great game of over 70’s cricket played in the right spirit, which could have gone either way, but finally the Wombats have won a game. The next game for the Wombats is on Sunday 12 November at Outtrim against the Glen Waverley Hawks. -John Moore-","pubDate":"2023-11-02 18:01:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"berwicknews_starcommunity","source_priority":4220755,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"5a49814b7599edfc0a6162ab04b55941","title":"Afghanistan won't reach semis by just talking about it, says Jonathan Trott","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/video/cwc-2023-afghanistan-wont-reach-semis-by-just-talking-about-it-says-jonathan-trott-ahead-of-netherlands-clash-2457379-2023-11-02?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Afghanistan won't reach semis by just talking about it, says Jonathan Trott","content":"World Cup 2023: Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott has said that Afghanistan won't reach the semi-finals by just talking about it.

The 302-run win is India’s biggest margin of victory by runs ever at a Men’s Cricket World Cup. It is also the second-biggest such margin by any team in the history of the tournament, falling only behind the 309-run record set by Australia against Netherlands a week ago. Only three times in the history of the Men’s ODI game has there been a bigger margin of victory by runs: Zimbabwe against USA in Harare in June of this year, Australia's win over the Dutch in this tournament, and India’s hammering of Sri Lanka back in January. That means of course that the four biggest wins by runs in Men’s ODI cricket history have all come in 2023. Mohammed Shami makes history Mohammed Shami is now India’s leading wicket-taker at Men’s Cricket World Cups. His 45 wickets have come in just 14 matches at an eye-watering average of 12.91. India’s previous highest wicket-taker in the tournament’s history was Zaheer Khan, whose 44 wickets came in 23 matches. Only seven bowlers have ever taken more Cricket World Cup wickets than Shami, with none doing so in as few matches and none having as close to as good an average. Shami has taken more wicket hauls of four or more in World Cups than any other bowler. His record of seven such feats surpasses Mitchell Starc (6) and Imran Tahir (5). Virat Kohli continues his fine form Virat Kohli has risen up a spot in the list of the Men’s Cricket World Cup’s greatest-ever run-scorers. His latest effort saw move to 1472 career runs in the tournament, and helped him leapfrog Australian David Warner into fourth in the all-time list. Only Kumar Sangakkara (1532), Ricky Ponting (1743) and Sachin Tendulkar (2278) have scored more in their careers. Kohli’s tally for the current tournament moved on to 442 in seven innings, just one run shy of his effort from the 2019 tournament, where he averaged 55.37 across nine matches. Dilshan Madushanka makes his mark It wasn’t just the India team making waves at the Wankhede. Dilshan Madushanka’s five-wicket haul means he is now the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 18. Shaheen Shah Afridi, Marco Jansen and Adam Zampa are the closest to the Sri Lankan with 16 apiece, while Jasprit Bumrah (15) and Mohammed Shami (14) are not much further behind.

By Tum Balogun For Mailonline Published: 22:00 GMT, 2 November 2023 | Updated: 22:00 GMT, 2 November 2023 e-mail View comments England and Manchester United goalkeeper Mary Earps has been named The Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year. The 30-year-old played a crucial role in the Lionesses' run to the final of the Women's World Cup and was awarded with the Golden Glove. Earps played every minute for Sarina Wiegman 's side at the tournament, keeping three clean sheets and conceding only four goals in seven matches. She also produced what looked at the time to be a crucial penalty save in the closing stages of August's final in Perth but England ultimately finished as runners-up to Spain. Ben Taylor, editor of The Sunday Times said : 'Mary Earps’ performance at the 2023 Football World Cup cemented her spot as one of the game's greatest goalkeepers.

The 30-year-old also produced a wonderful penalty save in the closing stages of the final 'Her and the rest of the Lionesses showed determination, skill, and resilience to reach the finals and will continue to inspire many young girls for years to come.' Two-time heptathlon world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson, seven-time Paralympic gold medallist Hannah Cockroft and English cricketer Tammy Beaumont were also among the nominees. The prestigious awards, which are now in the 36th year, recognise and celebrate the outstanding contribution made to sport by women at all levels. Previous winners of the Sportswoman of the Year accolade include Emma Raducanu, Dina Asher-Smith, Elise Christie, Sally Gunnell, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Denise Lewis, Dame Kelly Holmes, Zara Phillips, Victoria Pendleton, Christine Ohuruogu and Hollie Doyle. 2022 Commonwealth Games 10,000 metres champion, Eilish McColgan, took home the prize last year. Earps also scooped the The Best FIFA Women's Goalkeeper award last season The Man United stopper has seen her level of celebrity skyrocket following success with the Lionesses Away from the main prize, snowboarder Mia Brookes clinched the Young Sportswoman of the Year gong. The 16-year-old won gold in the slopestyle at the 2023 World Championships in Georgia. Cockroft claimed the Citi Disability Sportswoman of the Year, while three-time Olympic medallist Katie Archibald received the Helen Rollason Award for Inspiration. Taylor added: 'These awards also recognise that sport and exercise is vital for the physical and mental health of millions of women and congratulate our Grassroots winner Aimee Rees, and Tess Howard for winning the Changemaker award for campaigning to make female sports kits more accessible.' Wiegman's Lionesses' were also honoured on the night with the prize for Team of the Year. Earps's stellar campaign was recognised at the Ballon d'Or awards in Paris on Monday , where she placed fifth and achieved the highest-ever finish for a female footballer. She was also the subject of a PR own-goal from England's shirt manufacturer Nike, who took the peculiar decision to omit her jersey from their collection that went on sale ahead of the World Cup. Nike put the 'Earps 1' replica jerseys on sale following a backlash during the World Cup Earps hit out at the ‘extremely hurtful’ decision with over 170,000 people signing a petition calling on the sportswear giants to change their mind. It is understood Nike originally decided against selling Earps’ shirt for commercial reasons but a U-turn was made in August when they announced they would retail limited quantities. Replica jerseys finally went on sale earlier this month, though many fans were left disappointed as they quickly sold out . Earps's increased celebrity has seen her gain over a million followers on TikTok. She had considered retirement after being dropped by England in 2019 but has seen a remarkable turnaround in recent years. IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!

How did it go so wrong?","content":"In the last week of the Wallabies’ Rugby World Cup campaign, players and coaches were living in a state of purgatory; neither in the World Cup finals nor out of them. Having lost to Fiji and Wales , the Wallabies had effectively also lost their chance to play in knockout stages for the first time in World Cup history. But with Fiji needing to secure just one bonus point against Portugal a weekend later to make it official, the zombie Wallabies continued training for a week at their base in Saint-Etienne, a small French city about an hour’s drive from Lyon, for the remote chance they could make it through. As the week wore on, players tried to keep the mood light and a group of Wallabies coaching staff – without coach Eddie Jones – were spotted out drinking beers in the town square. But camp life carried a strange vibe, and Jones made it even more unusual when he started pulling players aside at the team hotel, according to a Wallabies player who spoke to the Herald on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise his employment. “There were a couple of very bizarre meetings in the last week of the World Cup, after Portugal. They felt like goodbye meetings,” the player recalled. “They were one-on-one meetings. Guys would come out and go ‘was that a goodbye? Don’t we have a plan for next year?’. Mate, it was bizarre.” Jones was contracted to coach the Wallabies for another four years. But five weeks after the Herald reported Jones had done a Zoom interview with Japan and 12 days after Jones stood at Coogee Oval and said he was in for the long haul through to 2027, the goodbye was finally made official. He resigned as Wallabies coach on October 29, citing unmet guarantees from Rugby Australia about resources and high-performance reform. Before revealing his resignation to media outlets, Jones sent a message to the Wallabies squad WhatsApp group. “It said, ‘I am proud to have worked with you. Contrary to media I haven’t signed anything (with Japan) and am going to spend the next month deciding my next move’,” the Wallaby player said. It ended a short but chaos-filled second-coming for Jones, which began with optimism and high hopes, but ended with Rugby Australia in its deepest ever hole. To understand how – and why – the Jones journey went off the rails so badly, the Herald has spoken to a large group of people directly involved in the slow-moving train wreck. At the end of 2022 - well before his return to Australia - Jones appeared to be in more immediate strife than his then-Wallabies counterpart Dave Rennie. As England coach, Jones was under heavy fire for the team’s lacklustre form and results, which had seen the English win just five from 12 Tests. The Wallabies hadn’t fared much better, with five wins from 14 Tests. But after also enduring an injury toll that saw 40 players sidelined in the Test winter, Wallabies players felt enthused about the 2023 Rugby World Cup, after a spring tour where they’d fielded a weakened team and only lost to the world No.1 and No.2 sides, Ireland and France, by the closest of margins. “We were a couple of penalty goals away from going five [wins] from five [Tests] and people going ‘look out for Australia’,” a Wallaby player, who requested anonymity to talk freely, said. RA commissioned former Olympic rower Bo Hanson to review the year, and a separate examination of the worrying injury toll was also completed. The results were shared with the players at the Wallabies’ first camp on the Gold Coast on January 10. As the rest of the nation was focused on the summer of cricket and tennis, Rennie gathered a 44-man squad to lay out the plans for the Rugby World Cup campaign to come. “Looking back, I guess what they were hoping to get out of it [the review] was that Rens [Rennie] had lost the room. But it came back glowingly in favour of him,” the Wallaby player said. “Everyone loved him and he was an incredible coach. There was no doubt we had problems with injury rates and all that, but to be honest, that review did what it needed to do.” Rugby Australia chairman Hamish McLennan was fuming about the Wallabies’ results on the spring tour, and in particular a loss to Italy on November 13. As RA’s representative in Florence, defeat was difficult viewing for McLennan at Stadio Artemio Franchi. The Wallabies were made to play five Tests in a row on that tour, an increase on the usual four. Knowing his first-choice side would struggle playing on five consecutive weekends, Rennie made 11 changes to his starting side and it backfired with a one-point loss. Rennie’s future was now in question, and McLennan had eyes for another coach. The well-connected Sydney business figure, who also is chairman of the REA Group and deputy chair of Magellan Financial Group, had already begun a charm offensive to woo Eddie Jones home as Wallabies coach in 2024, and through to the Rugby World Cup in Australia in 2027. Jones was on contract with the Rugby Football Union until the end of 2023. The pair first discussed the plan in July 2022 when Jones was in Sydney with England for the last game of a three-Test series. McLennan hosted a dinner for Jones at his Lavender Bay home, where they ate Portuguese chicken and salad made by the chairman’s wife Lucinda. The dinner occurred just days after Jones reacted angrily to a fan labelling him a “traitor” at the Sydney Cricket Ground. When McLennan discovered the RFU had not inserted a no-compete clause in their termination agreement with Jones, he saw his chance. Selling the vision of RA being on the cusp of a resources boom via a private equity deal, and with long-overdue centralisation reform now a matter of when, not if, McLennan convinced Jones to come a year early and a five-year deal was fleshed out. Rennie would need to be sacked but some on RA’s board – comprised of Brett Godfrey, Daniel Herbert, Phil Waugh, Pip Marlow, Karen Penrose, Jane Wilson, Matthew Hanning and the then-chief executive Andy Marinos – weren’t immediately sold. Sources familiar with the boardroom discussions, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said there were dissenting views, but after debating the risks and rewards, the board agreed to make the change. Behind the scenes, McLennan led the negotiations. Marinos disagreed with the call to appoint Jones. “Nothing was going to stop Hamish,” said a source familiar with discussions. “He went after Eddie. Hamish went and got his man. He believed it was going to be the magic pill.” With Rennie’s win percentage at 38, the board decided the chance to sign Jones was worth the gamble. McLennan argued ex-Wallabies were supportive of the move, and that Jones had a “hard edge” that Rennie did not. The chair later upset some players and fans by appearing to criticise Rennie’s penchant for playing guitar in team bonding sessions. “I would rather we have somebody who’s really tough and we win World Cups than we have a Kumbaya session, everyone holds hands and we fail,” McLennan said. Marinos publicly defended the decision to sack Rennie but resigned as chief executive five months later, after his relationship with McLennan became strained. Marinos declined to comment when contacted this week. McLennan rejects the argument that hiring Jones was a captain’s pick. “We went in with good faith ... we at Rugby Australia felt that we needed to make a change and it [appointing Jones] wasn’t just me, it went through the rugby committee and the board,” McLennan said this week at Sydney Airport. “There was an appropriate level of governance around that decision, but we weren’t tracking well. We lost a lot of games last year to big teams. And so all I’d just say to the rugby public, is that you’ve got to continue to make decisions, not all of them work out. If this was a business, you would find that you don’t get 100 per cent success rate and I stand by the calls.” Waugh, who replaced Marinos as RA chief executive, said on Tuesday of the Jones hiring: “Hindsight is a wonderful thing. When you make decisions at any time during your career ... you get presented information at the time and you make decisions based on that information.” Players had mixed emotions. On one hand, they were upset about Rennie’s departure, but on the other, the return of Jones - a noted Rugby World Cup specialist - generated buzz. “The guys were disappointed,” the Wallabies player said. “But a lot were also excited. If they were gonna get rid of Rens and bring someone in, Eddie Jones … look at what he has done. Everyone fell in love with the idea of a bloke coming in who has done well at World Cups.” The next six months were a honeymoon period. RA basked in the hyper-luminous glow of Jones, whose profile and personality immediately saw rugby back on the TV news and back pages of newspapers after spending too long in the wilderness. For a while, there wasn’t a lunch or school fundraiser on a Friday that didn’t have Jones on hand as a special guest. He answered questions, cracked jokes and built Australian rugby’s stocks back up one room at a time. Jones could have a room of coaches, business figures, sporting identities, members of the media, eating out of the palm of his hand with wisecracks and a confidence-inducing spiel about the Wallabies being a genuine chance to win the World Cup. He was often seen volunteering his time to coach juniors, too. NRL supremo and Nine broadcaster Phil Gould agreed to do a one-on-one interview with Jones in the sheds at Coogee Oval, which aired in February . One onlooker recalls marveling at the sight of Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley queueing patiently to get a ball signed by Jones after one function in Melbourne. However, the sailing wasn’t entirely smooth. Jones privately began bemoaning the quality of performances of Australian Super Rugby teams, and pulling together a coaching staff became a major struggle. Apart from forwards coach Dan McKellar, Jones didn’t want to carry forward any of Rennie’s crew. Experienced forwards coach Laurie Fisher was let go. McKellar did not accept an offer to stay and instead took the Leicester Tigers head coach job after getting a picture of how inexperienced Jones’ coaching staff would be. In the end, former rugby league player Brett Hodgson became defence coach, and Brad Davis – a former defence coach at London Irish– became attack coach. Brumbies scrum guru Dan Palmer took on a role as lineout coach, and little-known French coach Pierre-Henry Broncan – a former halfback – was employed as a maul coach. Super Rugby sides were supportive of Jones but one official, who did not want to be named because of their continued employment, said alarm bells about communication with the Wallabies program first rang when Jones held his first mid-season camp in April. Having left their Super Rugby teams for several days, but with games still to play on the weekend, the Wallabies did their training in the camp - but didn’t wear GPS devices to track the training loads, as is standard. Super Rugby teams were left in the dark and unclear about how much training players needed to do when they returned from the Gold Coast. The opacity of Jones’ long-term plans also became an issue in May. In Australian rugby circles, speculation that Jones would not see out his full, five-year contract had been bubbling since he landed in Australia in late January. But most expected the coach would at least stay until after the British and Irish Lions tour in 2025. Jones sidestepped questions about his future until he told former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio on an Evening Standard podcast on May 31 that he only intended to stay for one year with the Wallabies. “I’m only coaching ’til this World Cup,” Jones said. “I’ve signed [until the end of 2027], but as I’ve made the mistake before, I’ve stayed too long. So we win the World Cup, it will be time to go. If we lose the World Cup, it will be time to go.” It left Australian rugby stunned: did Jones just say the quiet part out loud? The Herald immediately messaged Jones to offer a chance to clarify, but he declined on several occasions. Senior RA officials privately dismissed the remarks as “Eddie being Eddie”, but when pushed by the media for a comment, a spokesman said Jones was contracted through to 2027 and the comment was referencing his single-minded focus on the 2023 Rugby World Cup. Five days later, Jones contacted the Herald and asked if his position could be clarified in print . “I am here for five years,” Jones said. “But my only concentration is this Rugby World Cup, so I don’t think past that.” Jones had been emphasising the need for strong leadership from senior players in the Wallabies’ 2023 campaign. At least once a week during Super Rugby, Jones convened the leadership group on Zoom calls, along with sports psychology experts. The message was drilled into them that a belief in the team’s ability to win the World Cup would be crucial to helping young players think the same way. “He painted a picture that experienced guys were going to be important to the World Cup,” a Wallaby player said. In late June, Jones had named Michael Hooper and James Slipper as co-captains and incumbent players were used in the Wallabies’ first two games against South Africa and Argentina. After the Wallabies travelled to South Africa, documentary crews began filming the team’s every move, with Jones wearing a microphone at training and in team meetings. A heavy kicking strategy was employed against the Springboks but they thumped the Wallabies 43-12 in Pretoria. When the Wallabies lost their second consecutive game a week later to Argentina at CommBank Stadium in Sydney in July, Jones lost faith in the senior players. Hooper missed the Test with a calf injury. “That was when everything changed. Some switch was flicked,” the Wallabies player recalled. Jones went for a younger team, and new leadership, to take on the All Blacks in two Tests in Melbourne and Dunedin. Having changed tactics to hold the ball more, and attack directly, the Wallabies began to find their groove. They lost at the MCG but a week later in Dunedin, the Wallabies led 17-3 before being beaten at the death 23-20. Players and coaches were slowly adjusting to life inside Camp Jones, some with more comfort than others. A notoriously hard taskmaster inclined to have blunt conversations, Jones is famous for churning through assistant coaches. But unlike in his first stint with the Wallabies, most players now didn’t feel like they were walking on eggshells. “There was a barrier. The staff would really cop it, the leaders were the next barrier and the players were mostly sheltered from it,” a Wallabies player said. “Hoops was the guy who stood up for the group. It wasn’t confrontational but in those meetings if someone wasn’t right, Hoops would say it. Maybe that was deemed as being too challenging.” Elsewhere, optimism about the Wallabies’ World Cup chances wasn’t in great supply. On July 20 – the night the Matildas began their soon-to-be famous World Cup campaign against Ireland at Homebush – RA sponsor RM Williams hosted an intimate dinner in the exclusive Clock Tower at Shell House in Sydney for rugby supporters, media executives and corporate supporters. The occasion was to launch a new RM Williams line of rugby apparel, but it doubled as a chance for RA to rally enthusiasm for the upcoming World Cup. Australia’s two World Cup-winning skippers, John Eales and Nick Farr-Jones, were asked to give a few words. They largely stuck to their stock anecdotes from the past. When the dessert course had been cleared and guests stood to chat, some privately shared concerns about the team’s World Cup chances. The Dunedin performance had given Wallabies fans a glimmer of hope but things took a sharp and unexpected turn when Jones settled on his 33-man squad for the Rugby World Cup. Jones left out many senior players – none more shocking than Hooper, who’d been battling a calf injury but was expected to be fit by the start of the World Cup; his last before international retirement. Quade Cooper, Pete Samu, Bernard Foley, Jed Holloway, Reece Hodge and Tom Wright were also omitted. A day before the public found out, however, the players were told. But in contrast to recent World Cup campaigns, where Michael Cheika organised for former Wallabies to ring players with the good news, the process for the 2023 announcement was flawed. The 33 players picked to go were told via a phone call from Wallabies general manager Chris Webb in the afternoon. One bolter, who’d had no contact with the Wallabies for weeks, had to hurriedly pack a bag for a flight the next day and re-arrange his winter plans. But by 7pm, unsuccessful candidates had still not been told about their fate, and there was a flight to Darwin early the next day for a camp. Sources with knowledge of the plan said Jones was due to make the calls to players who missed out. But the calls were delayed because the coach was on a flight back to Australia. Jones had dashed back to the UK after the Dunedin match with his wife to pick up their Papillon dog, Annie, and take it to their home in Japan. With the Wallabies’ WhatsApp group lighting up with excited chat, players who hadn’t been told began to phone Webb, asking what was going on. Jones ended up speaking to Hooper that night but Cooper didn’t take his call, and the pair still haven’t spoken. Jones later explained he’d left out Hooper and star centre Len Ikitau because he didn’t want to carry injured players who may not make the first game. But he also named Max Jorgensen, Samu Kerevi and Josh Kemeny who were all recovering from respective injuries. Jones pushed the button on a young squad for the World Cup and conceded he felt that senior players from the Rennie era had maxed out their potential. It was the youngest, most inexperienced Wallabies squad ever sent to a Rugby World Cup. The public were shocked by Jones’ inexperienced squad, and so were the Wallabies. “It just went against a lot of what he had said all year,” a Wallaby told the Herald . “He started saying things like ’27 is important. All of a sudden, it felt like ‘ah, he’s put in a safety net for us not doing well in France’. The belief levels – well, no-one spoke about it – but you could feel it, that he is grooming guys for the 2027 World Cup and this one isn’t important.” On the eve of the Wallabies’ departure from Australia, one of Jones’ assistants was unable to continue. Attack coach Davis, who’d been driven particularly hard by Jones, along with Hodgson, left the team camp in Darwin. RA announced Davis’ exit a few days later – citing “family reasons” – as the team gathered at the airport to fly out to the World Cup. “There’s a potential candidate ready to step up now,” Jones told reporters. “I think we’ll improve the coaching staff.” Jones, who hadn’t held in-person press conference since naming his World Cup squad, stood in front of members of the fourth estate at a media conference at Sydney Airport. Like the rest of the touring group, Jones had a brand new Akubra hat on his head. The squad was flying out to France for the Rugby World Cup but the mood was anything but celebratory. Jones bristled when the questions started. Why had Cooper not taken his call? Did Hooper, a Wallabies great, really have to ring team management to find out his World Cup dream was over? Jones snapped, labelling it the “worst press conference” he’d ever been involved in and inviting journalists to “give yourselves uppercuts” before walking through to customs. “There was no need for it,” said a Wallabies squad member. “It was funny but it’s not professional. It was just creating a circus when we should be focusing on rugby. Guys were wondering ‘is this really good for us?’.” About an hour after the press conference, Jones texted a reporter who had asked questions in the scrum. “Don’t ever contact me again,” Jones wrote. Asked why, Jones blocked the journalist’s number. During the World Cup, a Japanese media report emerged suggesting Jones was a candidate for that country’s head coaching role in 2024. “Bullshit and gossip,” Jones responded via a Wallabies spokesperson. The story wasn’t over, though. After Jones’ denials, the Herald’s Tom Decent received a tantalising tip that Jones took part in a secret Zoom interview with the Japanese Rugby Football Union days before the World Cup began. The Herald spent days investigating and fact-checking the information. Players were oblivious to the Japanese talks, until the Herald’s story broke hours before Australia’s match against Wales. Jones deflected questions about the Japan interview, saying: “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Captain Will Skelton told the press that the Herald’s story had not disrupted the preparation and that most players didn’t know anything about it. But a Wallabies player this week recounted a different version of events. “We were talking about it on the day of the game,” he said. “It was a bizarre mood after that game. We got the same line [from Jones] as the media got. That was alarm bells. He didn’t even trust us.” Jones told players, coaches and his bosses at RA there was nothing to the story. Press conferences were tense. At one point, a Wallabies media manager asked how much longer the probing would go on for. Jones’ inexperienced squad was only one part of the Wallabies’ problems heading into the Rugby World Cup. Tactically, the coach had elected to abandon the way the team had been playing for the last three years and focus on a game based on ad-lib attack. All major Test nations, and a majority of successful club teams, operate with attacking structures, which dictate default patterns players will attack from on the field. Jones decided the Wallabies wouldn’t play with any pre-set structures, and instead attack with more freedom, as they saw the opportunity before them. But also believing possession rugby was dead, Jones didn’t want to hold the ball for more than four phases. Prior to the last warm-up game against France, Jones changed the game plan again, to keep their style hidden. Australia lost to Fiji for the first time in 69 years and the next week their World Cup fate was sealed with a 40-6 loss to Wales. It was the heaviest defeat in Wallabies World Cup history. Jones covered his face with his hands. Wallabies fans, many who had paid large sums of money to be in France, walked out of the stadium in Lyon before the full-time whistle had sounded. Along with Jones’ links to Japan – which was now being reported by other world media outlets – the Wallabies’ disastrous campaign saw the heat intensify on Jones. When Jones returned home from France, he fronted a press conference at Coogee Oval on October 17. But despite speculation he may quit, Jones repeated he was in for the long haul. But public support was thin on the ground and within a week Jones had begun working on an exit strategy. In the week of the Rugby World Cup final, McLennan and RA hosted a function at the Australian Embassy in Paris on October 25, celebrating the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia. In a room looking out to the adjacent Eiffel Tower, World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont and New Zealand rugby boss Mark Robinson were among the distinguished guests. Unbeknown to most people in the room, Jones and his representatives informed RA earlier that day they did not see a future in Australia for the under-fire coach. There was one last flurry of headlines, when Jones told Herald columnist Peter FitzSimons, a former Wallaby, that he didn’t regret omitting Hooper, Cooper and Foley and described the trio as not the right role models for the team. Hooper declined to respond, but current and former Wallabies were stunned. “It was really disappointing and it didn’t sit well with the players at all,” the Wallabies player said. “It felt like he was trying to blame what’s happened here for the last decade for all his problems. He experimented on a style of footy that hasn’t really been done before, with a really young group, and hasn’t really owned it.” With Waugh now back in Australia, discussions via Zoom began for an exit. Details of the negotiations are unclear, but the talks were swift. By Sunday evening news filtered out that Jones had resigned. Jones did an exit interview with The Australian , bemoaning the speed in which the game could achieve centralisation, and later told FitzSimons: “[I] gave it a run. Hopefully be the catalyst for change. Sometimes you have to eat shit for others to eat caviar further down the track.” Jones may be gone but the fallout of his 10-month rollercoaster is only just beginning. Fronting a press conference this week, Waugh said the RA leadership who’d gambled on Jones resurrecting the Wallabies would take ownership of the fact it, in fact, sank the Wallabies to a new low. But McLennan said he won’t follow Jones and resign. Waugh said Australian rugby’s voting members have the power to effect change on the Rugby Australia board, if they see fit. For the Wallabies players, the Jones saga – and the lost year of 2023 – just represents a wasted opportunity. Many won’t get another shot at playing in Rugby World Cup, or even wearing a Wallabies jersey. News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

India’s imposing total came on the back of three half-centuries from Shubman Gill (92), Virat Kohli (88) and Shreyas Iyer (82) but Madushanka certainly had a memorable game to become the tournament’s highest wicket taker with 18-wickets in seven games. The 23-year-old seamer stunned the Wankhede crowd into silence with a terrific delivery to remove Indian skipper Rohit Sharma in the second ball of the innings but a strong second wicket stand between Gill and Kohli set the tone for India’s mammoth total, after being put into bat first by Kusal Mendis. Sharma had clipped the first ball to the fine-leg boundary and was looking for the inswinger but an off-cutter nipped away with the angle, crashing to the off-stump to give marching orders to the Indian skipper. Both Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera generated plenty of movement off the deck to keep both Gill and Kohli in check as the hosts managed only 25 runs in the first five overs for the loss of Sharma’s wicket. India would have been two down, had Charith Asalanka at cover point grabbed a flying catch off Gill in the penultimate ball of Madushanka’s third over, but the ball burst through the hand to offer another life to Gill. Two balls later, Chameera nearly caught Kohli off his own bowling when the batsman got a leading edge, but the ball popped out of Chameera’s hand. Chameera operated with a perfect line and length and his first two overs conceded no run. But once the pitch settled, scoring looked easy as Gill and Kohli capitalised on those opportunities to stitch a massive second wicket stand and put hosts, who are eyeing their third World Cup title, in control. The partnership grew in stature at a steady pace and was threatening to take the game completely away from the Sri Lankans when Madushanka struck twice with his third spell. With both players in sight of their centuries, Madushanka sent Gill and Kohli back to the dressing room as Sri Lanka shed a sigh of relief. The two had scored 189 runs for the second wicket when Madushanka with a slow off-cutter in his third spell deceived Gill. Gill, who was just eight runs short of the century, attempted to guide the ball to deep-third-man area but the extra bounce saw him managing to channel it to the wicket-keeper. Gill’s run-a-ball innings included 11 boundaries and two sixes—one over mid-wicket and the other over long-on. The 23-year-old seamer then deceived the big fish, Kolhi, with another slower ball sending the vociferous Wankhede crowd into silence. Kohli was early into the drive and offered a simple catch to Pathum Nissanka at short-cover as Madushanka finished his third spell of two overs with two wickets for 12 runs. Kohli hit 88 off 94 balls with 11 boundaries. KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer then added a quick 60 runs off 47 balls between them before Chameera removed KL Rahul, caught by Dushan Hemantha, at short extra-cover. Madushanka, who is enjoying a remarkable success with the ball in the World Cup, then removed Suryakumar Yadav to grab his fourth wicket. Yadav looked to hook a short ball from Madushanka but did not make a connection as it passed to the wicket-keeper. The umpire was unmoved but Mendis reviewed to find a slight spike on ultra edge. Despite losing Rahul and Yadav quickly, Iyre continued the onslaught, hitting his 16th ODI half century. The left-hander hit 82 off 56 balls with six sixes and three boundaries before Madushanka claimed his first five-wicket haul. Irye was running riot, hitting Madushanka for two consecutive sixes when a slow ball did the trick as Iyre sliced it straight up in the air for Maheesh Theekshana to grab a straight forward chance. Ravindra Jadeja made a brisk 35 off 23 balls before he ran himself out in the last ball of their innings. Sri Lanka made one change to the playing XI with Dushan Hemantha coming in for misfiring Dhananjaya de Silva.

The Ashes adversaries meet on Saturday at Ahmedabad’s 130,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium, which will also host the tournament final on November 19. Only one of the two teams has any prospect of making it that far, with England propping up the table in 10th place after one win in six while Australia appear set fair for the knockouts after four victories. But Root refuses to believe a side who came in as defending champions and well fancied to defend their crown have slipped as far as the standings suggest. “Man for man, I’d have this team every day over the Australians,” he said, with an air of confidence that has largely eluded England since they touched down in India. “We might not have played as well as we can do but we know when we play our best stuff the best teams struggle to compete with us. “I look at this team and it’s more than capable of achieving way more than it has done throughout this tournament.

We have massively underachieved to date and have three opportunities to show the world what we are capable of doing and what I know we are capable of doing.” The statistical head-to-head makes for grim reading, with Australia boasting five centuries to England’s one, 61 sixes to England’s 27 and 47 wickets taken to England’s 36.

But Root is relying on the competitive juices that come with every meeting between these two teams to drag his side out of their torpor. England were 2-0 behind after the first two Tests of this year’s Ashes series but rallied to dominate the next three games and would surely have improved on a 2-2 draw had rain not intervened at Old Trafford. “One thing that the Ashes does is, we’ve played a lot of cricket against a number of their players. If we can use that in a positive way then we have to take it into the game,” he said. “You can always recall little things that can work in your favour.

Probably,” he said. “If it motivates us a little bit more, great. It hurts, but it always hurts to be in this position, sat at the bottom of the table. There is no better motivator for any group of English players than to play against the Aussies. “From my point of view, I throw everything into giving my absolute 100 per cent for England and can look people in the eye and shake them by the hand and move onto the next game.

The day began well for the Wombats with skipper John Moore winning the toss and sending Gippsland into bat. But initially it appeared to be a bad decision, with Bob Phillips injuring his knee in the first over and being unable to bowl again. Both openers belted the ball to all parts of the field until Carl Muscat bowled Andrew Smith 13 (14) and Jim Gregory trapped Fred Debono 12 (23) LBW. The Goannas were 2/42 in the 8th over and well on target to score over 200 runs. Captain Ian Southall 11 (15) was first batter to be stumped by Russell Ferguson, this time off the bowling of Gregory. The second stumping was Warren Dummett 14 (24) off the bowling of Muscat. The Goannas were 4/64 in the 15th over, before Steve Lincoln 25 (30) retired and the score was 4/89 after 20 overs. Tight bowling and good ground fielding restricted the run rate and the bowlers were hard to score off; this resulted in five wickets falling for 10 runs in a seven-over spell. Gordon Cowling 15 (20) was run out by a brilliant stop by Muscat…throwing to Keith Houghton. Graham Davey took the next two wickets, both bowled, with Barry Nunn 8 (11) and Dave Noble 4 (7) his two victims. Houghton then bowled the next two batters, Ron Lovel 5 (8) and Kel Bond 1 (5). Gregory took the 10th wicket when he bowled Wayne Tatterson 10 (20). The Wombats reject, Ron Milnes 5 (9) remained not out and after 30.5 overs the Goannas were all out for 128. Wombats Bowling: (Man of the Match) Jim Gregory 4.5-3/20, Graham Davey 6-2/20, Keith Houghton 5-2/15, Carl Muscat 6-2/15, Pieter Loos 3-0/18, Mike Newton 3-0/14, Brendon Thomas 2-0/15 and Bob Phillips 1-0/10. The Wombats opened with Barry Cain and Graham Davey, with accurate bowling by Gordon Cowling and Ron Lovel seeing only one run scored off the first four overs. Cain then straight drove Ron Lovel for four and the Wombats were away. Cain 5 (19) was unluckily run out by Andrew Smith with a direct throw from 25 meters that hit the wicket. Davey 18 (25) retired before the Wombats lost three wickets for 10 runs in three overs. Jon Martindale 18 (23) was caught by Fred Debono off the bowling of Barry Nunn, Pieter Loos 2 (3) caught by Warren Dummett off the bowling of Kel Bond, and Brendon Thomas 3 (7) was Bond’s second wicket when he was caught by Dave Noble. Carl Muscat 25 (28) retired before the 20th over when the Wombats were 4/85, this was four runs less than the Goannas total at the same time. David Wells 11 (10) retired hurt before the Wombats lost three wickets for three runs when Mike Newton 10 (20) was caught by Gordon Cowling off the bowling of Dave Noble, Jim Gregory was bowled for a second ball duck by Ian Southall, and Keith Houghton 13 (28) was bowled by Southall. The Wombats were now 7 for 111 in the 29th over, and the equation seemed simple with 18 runs required off 11 overs. But accurate bowling by the Goannas saw John Moore 2 (4) became Ian Southall’s third victim when he was bowled. By the 34th over the Wombats had crawled to 124, then there were three maidens in a row before Russell Ferguson 8 (25) retired. This brought the first retiree back to the crease, Graham Davey, who hit two fours in three balls to take the total to 132 on the 5th ball of the 37th over. Davey 26 (32) and the injured Bob Phillips 3 (22) were both not out. Goannas Bowling: Ian Southall 8-3/14, Gordon Cowling 7-0/12, Ron Lovel 7-0/21, Andrew Smith 2-0/22, Barry Nunn 2-1/10, Fred Debono 1-0/11. Ron Milnes 2-0/9, Dave Noble 4-1/9, Kel Bond 4.5-2/19. This was a great game of over 70’s cricket played in the right spirit, which could have gone either way, but finally the Wombats have won a game. The next game for the Wombats is on Sunday 12 November at Outtrim against the Glen Waverley Hawks. -John Moore-","pubDate":"2023-11-02 18:01:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"berwicknews_starcommunity","source_priority":4220755,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"5a49814b7599edfc0a6162ab04b55941","title":"Afghanistan won't reach semis by just talking about it, says Jonathan Trott","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/video/cwc-2023-afghanistan-wont-reach-semis-by-just-talking-about-it-says-jonathan-trott-ahead-of-netherlands-clash-2457379-2023-11-02?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Afghanistan won't reach semis by just talking about it, says Jonathan Trott","content":"World Cup 2023: Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott has said that Afghanistan won't reach the semi-finals by just talking about it.
