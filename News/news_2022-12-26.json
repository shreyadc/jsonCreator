Medical staff and police are in attendance on the level 2 balcony. LYON BRACING FOR ‘EMOTIONAL’ TRIBUTE TO THE REAL GOAT Star spinner Nathan Lyon is bracing for an emotional Boxing Day Test as cricket farewells the real GOAT – his childhood hero, Shane Warne. The Australian team will be just like most fans sitting in the stands at the MCG on Monday when they honour a sporting icon who inspired them to love the game. Fox Cricket has prepared a stirring tribute video that will be played on the big screens when the players, all wearing white floppy hats, are lined up on the field before play to pay tribute to one of the most larger than life characters Australia has known. Shane Warne with his iconic white Greg Chappell hat. Picture: Hamish Blair/Getty Images Warne’s son Jackson will join Fox Cricket’s coverage during the day for what the network is calling ‘The Shane Warne Boxing Day Test’, in memory of their beloved commentator. Lyon, an all-time Test great in his own right with more than 450 Test wickets, has paid tribute to the cricketer he looked up to ahead of a special day at the MCG. “I’ve got the nickname of the GOAT, which is a bit ridiculous,” Lyon said. “That’s Shane. He is the greatest. “It’s going to be a very emotional Test for everyone. It’s going to be very special that this is going to be the first Test since his passing at his home ground. “For us to be out in the middle with everyone else who is honouring Shane Warne, it’s going to be special.” Warne’s cap number 350 will be emblazoned on the MCG outfield for the duration of the Test and at 3.50pm on Boxing Day Warne’s image will appear on the big screen. During the Test, the Warne highlight reels will roll. Lyon admits he never quite got used to the thrill of turning up to a Test match and bumping into Warne out in the middle before play. Shane Warne provided advice for Nathan Lyon throughout his test career. Picture: Morne de Klerk/Getty Images After play finished on day four of the first Test of the 2019 Ashes tour in England, Warne asked to meet Lyon outside the dressing rooms. With Australia needing to take 10 wickets on the last day to take a 1-0 victory, Warne spoke to Lyon about how he must realise he had the power as the spinner in the side to “control the tempo” of the game and make England play on his terms. The next day Lyon took six wickets in a resounding victory which set the platform for Australia to reclaim the Ashes for the first time in two decades. “When you think back at it now, it’s absolutely incredible,” Lyon said. “Mind blowing stuff.” For Lyon, Warne made spin bowling cool, and the Australian star is committed to continuing his hero’s legacy of inspiring a new generation of young Aussie kids to give it a tweak. “It’s all about trying to keep the legacy alive I guess,” Lyon said. “I think it’s a massive role and massive opportunity for myself to keep the spin culture alive and well inside Australian cricket. “Warnie was obviously the biggest (influence) you could ever imagine. Especially as a young kid growing up in Australia, all I wanted to do was be like Shane Warne. More Coverage Cricket’s latest blow: South Africa’s final MCG Test? Boom TV rights offer looms as cricket’s ‘get out of jail card’ “If I can keep that dream going for a lot of kids, boys and girls out there in Australian cricket, then I’m doing my role.” Warne’s son Jackson, who spoke so brilliantly at the public funeral at the MCG earlier this year, will appear alongside his father’s old commentary sparring partners during the tea break on Fox Cricket.

But Shaheen has now deleted that tweet after the new board set-up, including chairman Najam Sethi, informed the players that their job was to focus on cricket and perform well as professionals for the country. “Sethi has given out a clear message that no more shenanigans on the social media or breaches of central contracts will be tolerated from any player,” the source said. Ramiz Raja, who was removed as chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) by the country’s government, had given plenty of liberty to the players during his tenure, allowing them to interact a lot on social media. But the players have now been told that they must avoid making comments on matters which are purely the domain of the cricket board. Pakistan captain Babar Azam said at a pre-match conference on Sunday that the changes in the board would not affect the players as they are professionals and are supposed to perform for the country. “There have been changes but we are not concerned with that, our main focus is to win the series against New Zealand. We have no say in matters of the board,” he said. Babar, whose Test captaincy is on the line after the whitewash against England, said that interim chief selector, Shahid Afridi had spoken to him before adding three more players to the national squad for the two Tests against New Zealand. Pace bowlers, Mir Hamza and Shahnawaz Dahani and off-spinner, Sajid Khan were added to the squad by the new national selection committee that also includes Abdul Razzaq, Rao Iftikher and Haroon Rasheed. —PTI PCB’s new cricket management committee tells players to abide by contractual clauses added by Press Trust of India on 1:35 am December 26, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-25 20:05:58","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ashwin, Iyer save India blushes","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/ashwin-iyer-save-india-blushes-774914","keywords":["Sports,Today NewsPaper,Cricket"],"creator":["The Hans India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Scores unbeaten 71-run stand to steer India to 2-0 series win over Bangladesh","content":"Dhaka: A magnificent unbeaten 71-run partnership off 105 balls between Ravichandran Ashwin and Shreyas Iyer took India out from jaws to defeat and steered the visitors' to a three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in the second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium on Sunday.On day four, India were needing 100 runs with six wickets in hand. But Shakib Al Hasan and Mehidy Hasan Miraz took three wickets in the first hour to leave India in spot of bother at 74/7. The wicket-taking balls from Bangladesh were on straighter deliveries at a pitch which was offering huge assistance to spinners, making life difficult for India. But Ashwin and Iyer, India's last-recognised batting pair, defended solidly, mixed caution with aggression and then brought out a flurry of boundaries at the end to take the visitors' over the line. In a cracking finish at Dhaka, the Ashwin-Iyer partnership lasted 17.3 overs and scored at a run-rate of 4.05. In securing a 2-0 series sweep, Ashwin was unbeaten on 42, while Iyer was 29 not out for India to complete a chase of 145 in 46 overs. Resuming from 45/4, India almost lost Jaydev Unadkat when Mehidy Hasan Miraz beat him on forward defence and survived by a whisker when replays showed impact was on the umpire's call. On the very next ball, Unadkat brought out the slog-sweep against the off-spinner over mid-wicket fence for six. Unadkat ran out of luck in the next over when he tried to cut off Shakib Al Hasan on backfoot, but the delivery from Bangladesh skipper skid to hit his back pad in front of stumps. He reviewed, but had to depart for 13 as replays showed the ball crashing into the stumps. Axar Patel pulled Mehidy off the backfoot through mid-wicket, while Pant welcomed Shakib with a reverse sweep along the ground through third man for India to get two boundaries in quick succession. But Mehidy took out Pant in his next over, getting a length ball on middle stump to drift in and hit the left-hander on his pads in front of stumps. After dismissing Pant for the third time in the series, Mehidy completed his five-wicket haul when Axar tried to flick off backfoot and missed it as the quicker delivery uprooted leg stump after deflecting off the pads. Mehidy could have got his sixth wicket had Mominul Haque not dropped Ravichandran Ashwin at short leg. Ashwin and Shreyas Iyer dug in for India, looking good while defending the ball on front and back foot, with not much attacking shots. When the loose deliveries came from the spinners, Iyer used his precise footwork to get boundaries. When Mehidy tossed up outside off stumps, Iyer got a stride forward and brought out a square drive through the gap at point. His aggression continued against Shakib, dancing down the pitch to loft over mid-off and when the left-arm spinner pitched it short, Iyer rocked back quickly to pull over mid-wicket to complete a brace of boundaries. When Mehidy bowled too short, Iyer was deep in the crease and punched the ball firmly through the gap at cover. Ashwin joined the boundary-hitting spree when he clipped pacer Khaled Ahmed through fine leg and then had an outside edge going wide to the left of gully to pick two boundaries. The duo's partnership meant Bangladesh began to feel the pressure, which was evident with Najmul Hossain Shanto misfielding at mid-off, giving India an extra run. Ashwin greeted Mehidy on his return with a one-handed pull off the backfoot over deep mid-wicket for six. He would hit back-to-back boundaries off Mehidy - lofting over mid-off and pulling past wide mid-on, second of which got India the victory in a cliffhanger of a game, putting off the tremendous fight shown by Bangladesh with bat and ball. Despite the series win, India still have many questions to answer, especially about the top order and the approach while playing against spinners in spin-friendly conditions. For now, they have Ashwin and Iyer to thank for securing a hard-fought win at Dhaka. Brief Scores: Bangladesh 227 in 73.5 overs and 231 in 70.2 overs lost to India 314 in 86.3 overs and 145/7 in 47 overs (Ravichandran Ashwin 42 not out, Axar Patel 34; Mehidy Hasan Miraz 5/63, Shakib Al Hasan 2/50) by three wickets.","pubDate":"2022-12-25 19:30:42","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/12/25/500x300_1326949-sports.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket’s latest blow: South Africa’s final MCG Test?","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/robert-craddock-proteas-poised-to-make-farewell-appearance-from-boxing-day-tests/news-story/6e536f63c1ca3f3ae65d1903240a4c82","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Hello ... goodbye.","content":"No South African player involved in the Boxing Day Test has ever played the fixture before and chances are no South African player ever will again.This is a deceptively significant and emotional Test match because if South Africa’s new T20 league, which starts next month, is anywhere near the success it needs to be then South Africa are basically done and dusted for MCG Boxing Day Tests.The fact that this seems set to be their 11th and final Test in Melbourne is a sad blow for cricket because the Proteas are such a magnificent foe.And they have always loved the ground.Respected South African broadcaster Neil Manthorp spent part of Christmas Day taking photos of parts of the MCG precinct believing this will be his sixth and final MCG Test, given the Proteas are likely to adopt the schedule of their past two tours here — play the series in November.Given that their window for hosting international cricket is now getting worrying small South Africa need to be at home playing their own Boxing Day Test.They normally are. The only reason this Test is in place because of a deal struck three years ago when Australia lured South Africa over on the promise of paying compensation for losing their own Boxing Day Test.But that board has since been disbanded and their cricket set-up has headed in a new direction and South Africa, while scheduled to tour Australia in four years time, are down-sizing their commitment to Test cricket with just 28 matches in the new four year cycle. The last Test match South Africa played at the MCG in 2008 is regarded as the greatest Proteas performance since they returned to international cricket post-isolation in 1991.The tourists had never won a series in Australia after 98 years of trying and, following their record-breaking 414-run chase at the WACA, they had their chance in 2008.But they were still eight runs away from avoiding the follow-on when they lost their seventh first innings wicket and looked doomed until fast bowler Dale Steyn (76) and J-P Duminy (166), in just his second Test, added 180 for the ninth wicket.Victory was secured by lunch on the final day with Steyn claiming 10 wickets in the match.The new league has been placed in the prime of the South African summer with no international cricket scheduled for the next five years in the mid-Jan to mid-Feb window. It effectively leaves only the December and March windows open for the country to host international cricket during holidays.Captain Dean Elgar said playing a Boxing Day Test at the MCG was “another surreal moment” and “the stuff of dreams.”Watch Australia v South Africa.

I remember thinking “who is this kid?’’ even though we had met earlier because our older brothers, who are the same age, had known each other.Eventually I joined his team and we became the big dogs in our rep team.Occasionally we look back and joke how on earth this has happened. All those years ago we were opening the bowling together, batting Nos 3 and 4 and just trying to hog everything.Now, 30 years on, we get to walk out together in his 100th Test. Incredible.Today’s milestone is all the more remarkable because initially there were plenty of people who never thought he would play one major red ball game never mind 100 Tests.I was there in NSW when no-one gave him a chance to play red ball cricket. “He just plays too many shots’ was the common cry.Then a few of us went on to play for Australia and spots opened up and the word was “he can only bat five or six.’’But because we had a decent middle order the cry became “look, we are just going to have to open with him.’’Nothing came easily. But you could tell after about 10 games of red ball cricket he was going to make it.THE KIDEven as a kid Davey was in everything and not all the cherries he propelled had six stitches.He went through a stage where he would chuck cherries at some of our teammates, leaving a stain which is particularly noticeable on whites.Our teammates mums would blow up and urge Davey’s mum Lorraine to tell him to stop throwing cherries.One mum he never fell out with was mine. Mum loves Davey. Even now when she sees Davey’s daughters Ivy, Indi and Isla she just sees him.She had a name for him – Shaytan, the Urdu term for Devil. She means it in an endearing way of course.He was always the sort of kid – and still is – who acts first then handles the fallout later.Davey went to Randwick Boys High which was very multicultural so a lot of his close mates were from Bangladesh, India or south-east Asia.He has always been very good to me and respectful of my culture and understood how I struggled coming up through the ranks.As a youngster I was better against the fast bowlers. He was a little bit scared of them and better against spin.Honestly, he just annihilated spinners. First ball he would just try and hit them for six. You would see these young spinners just melt away.THE EAGLE EYEDavey’s attention to detail is staggering. Absolutely nothing gets past him.We had a funny exchange when we were walking to the wicket to play the West Indies in the Perth Test.By that stage I am normally consumed by the thought of facing the first ball but they flashed our records up on the scoreboard. I didn’t even notice it but the man who misses nothing noted that my batting average (47.41) had just crept past his (46.28).He said “oh, you’ve passed me’’ and I chipped back with “but you are about to play your 100th Test and I have just passed 50 – I’ll take those 50 Tests if you want to swap!’’Imagine that. Two batsmen walking to the middle for the first Test of the summer and we are debating the merits of a quirky stat.I wouldn’t change my journey for anything but I wanted to pump his tyres up and I was thinking “you are David Warner . you have had an incredible career and nothing that happens now really matters.’’It always amazes me that whatever ground we go to he knows exactly where all the players’ partners’ boxes are.You will be having a mid-pitch conversation in a Test match and talking about someone and he will say “yeah, he’s just sitting up there.’’ I will say “how do you know? Are you concentrating on the game?’’THE GENEROUS MANI have long considered Davey the most generous cricketer I have played with.People don’t see the caring side of him. I’ve lost count of the amount of times I have seen him pick up a bar tab and you will say “mate you don’t have to do that’’ and he’d say “it’s done … all good.’’If he has a bit of love for you he will do anything for you. It’s one of the reasons why I have been such good friends with him for a long time.He will also admit it when he does something wrong. You will hear him say “sorry, my bad.’’I have spoken to his friends outside cricket and I know how much he is done for them.WORKING CLASS ROOTSI joke with him that “I am street smart and book smart but you are super street-smart.’’He’s no bookworm but don’t worry – he has always got his head to the ground. If there is something awry he’ll spot it.He grew up next to a housing commission and did it tough, just like myself.You simply cannot be naive in that environment. You couldn’t trust anyone.A lot of that vibe transfers from life into cricket. Davey has had to be cagey and smart otherwise people would have walked all over him. If a news story breaks in cricket he is always all over it. His brain never stops. He has an incredibly high awareness.He was a very confident young fellow. He had that bit of bravado and outward confidence. I was confident too but in a less obvious way and it traces back to our different cultures.One thing I think is that what you saw during his career in terms of his on-field behaviour was how people wanted him to play rather than how he wanted to play himself.He used to be told all the time “go out there and be brash, be in their faces.’’ Being the teammate he is he would say “yeah, I will do that.’’OUR FRIENDSHIPI have no problems in calling him out. If there’s something I feel is not right I will say “Davey, c’mon … that’s not cool.’’But the older he is getting the less that is happening. We have had that sort of old relationship where we joke that I am the only one he listens to if I tell him to pull his head in.I call him Mr 50% because if you believe 50% of everything Davey says you’ll be 100% correct.THE BATSMANI honestly believe the most underrated “silent stat’’ in cricket is where a player bats. In cricket we always talk about averages and centuries and strike rates but unless you open the batting you can never fully understand how incredibly testing it is.Matthew Hayden averaged 50 as an opener and Justin Langer 45 opening for much of his career. They batted when batting was toughest every single time. They didn’t get cheap runs. For Davey’s average to hover not far below 50 for the majority of his career is just extraordinary, particularly at an incredible strike rate of 71.I’ve seen from close range the effect Warner has on bowlers. Balls that I would let go outside off stump he will attack with relish. That rattles bowlers. I only learnt relatively late in my career that if you can put the pressure back on the bowler you can get a lot more freebies.This is something I have noticed that is a trait of Davey and almost every great batsman through the ages.Davey has been through a lot over his career plenty of ups and a plenty of downs. One thing I know for sure is when things looked most bleak such as after the South African series and his ball tampering sanctions he learned who his friends are and who they aren’t.And I know he places an extremely high value on those who are which is fair enough.Because one thing in life I know for sure, there is no such thing as a perfect human.Don’t be fooled.","pubDate":"2022-12-25 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia vs South Africa, 2nd Take a look at, Day 1 Dwell Rating Updates | Cricket Information","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/australia-vs-south-africa-2nd-take-a-look-at-day-1-dwell-rating-updates-cricket-information/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"AUS vs SA, 2nd Take a look at, Day 1 Dwell Updates: Australia face South The post Australia vs South Africa, 2nd Take a look at, Day 1 Dwell Rating Updates | Cricket Information appeared first on The Times of Bengal.","content":"AUS vs SA, 2nd Take a look at, Day 1 Dwell Updates: Australia face South Africa within the second Take a look at of the three-match sequence on the Melbourne Cricket Floor.

Usually, elite athletes, particularly cricketers, say that they don’t heed to the feedback from outdoors, calling it white noise. Simpler mentioned than carried out. Particularly, when it’s about short-pitched bowling. Not like different technical difficulties, there’s a fascination about how a batter handles the short-ball. It at all times makes for good drama on the sphere, regardless of who’s profitable the battle. It is usually one thing that would change into a go-to tactic for any bowling assault towards the mentioned batter. Which is why if somebody struggles towards the short-ball, there’s a very excessive recall worth. For the reason that time Shreyas made his worldwide debut, it’s one thing that has been related to him. As a lot as he prefers to be ignorant, Shreyas didn’t fail to acknowledge it and work on it. However probably the most attention-grabbing factor about how a batter handles the short-ball is that always all the great issues about them get overshadowed due to it. If it was Suresh Raina up to now, now it’s Shreyas. In 2022, the 28-year-old leads the ODI batting chart for India, is the second most run-scorer for India in Assessments, and has the third greatest T20I strike price (141.15) for an Indian batter with greater than 400 runs.

It’s not simply concerning the numbers although. For all of the discuss “Shreyas vs short ball”, his dominance towards spin does not appear to get the identical type of significance. Whereas Indian batters enjoying spin has been taken with no consideration up to now, at a time when a lot of the top-order battle towards spin, Shreyas’ energy is sort of invaluable for India. His Check common of 68.66 towards spin isn’t a surprise although. It’s one thing he has carried out for years in first-class cricket earlier than making his debut. Shreyas constructed his popularity dominating bowling assaults, particularly spinners, across the nation. A primary-class strike price of 78.8 is testomony to that. Ask Steve O’Keefe and Nathan Lyon what a 22-year-old Shreyas did to them again in 2017. Heck, ask his batting associate on Sunday, Ashwin, who has been on the receiving finish of some scathing counterattacks in Ranji Trophy. It’s what he does. It’s what he’s extremely good at. And the factor about Shreyas is he makes probably the most of what he’s good at much more usually than lacking out on account of his weaknesses. Even when the main target is on what he couldn’t or didn’t do than what he has up to now. As a spinner from the sub-continent, all via his profession, the argument round Ashwin has been what he hasn’t carried out greater than what he has. Whether or not his file within the SENA nations as a spinner, or the fixed comparability with Lyon or if he would have succeeded as a lot if the pitches weren’t as useful in Asia, the listing goes on. What has he carried out? He’s the second-highest wicket-taker in Assessments for India. He’s solely the second participant to have scored 3000 runs and brought 400-plus wickets within the format. He has the second-most participant of the collection awards (9), solely two lower than Muttiah Muralitharan. To not point out the batting performances which have helped India win and save matches. Granted, his Check batting dipped in late 2010s, however he has come again in that regard as effectively. Since 2020, Ashwin is the one one to have greater than 500 runs and 60 wickets. These are unimaginable numbers for a No. 8. For all of the struggles he has had towards quicks, Ashwin is likely one of the assured batters towards spin. Whether or not it’s Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar in 2012, Shane Shillingford in 2013, Adil Rashid in 2016, Lyon, Jack Leach and Moeen Ali in 2021, he has dealt with them with relative ease. This Bangladesh tour has been no completely different. Two fifties and 7 wickets in two matches even when he won’t have bowled his greatest. It’s honest to say that had Mominul Haque taken the catch when Ashwin was on 1, issues might have turned out rather a lot completely different. Shreyas, too, had his share of luck via the collection. However that, by no means, denies the truth that the 2 capitalised on it, placing India ready of energy. They confirmed persistence early on and as soon as the Kookaburra ball turned softer, they jumped on it. “If Shreyas was not the Participant of the Collection, I might have positively shared this award with him, however he’s, so I’ll take this dwelling,” Ashwin mentioned after being named Participant of the match. In the long run, Shreyas wasn’t the participant of the collection. Cheteshwar Pujara was.
