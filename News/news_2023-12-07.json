Jacks struck 73, his second ODI half-century, to help the tourists to a winning total of 4-206 in the 33rd over in a match that was low-scoring compared with the series-opener in which 651 runs were scored. England sent West Indies in at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium and bowled out the home team for 202 in 40 overs. Shai Hope top-scored with 68 for the hosts after his match-winning 109 not out in the first match, which his side won by four wickets. West Indies slumped to 4-23 after seven overs before Hope steadied the ship in a 129-run partnership with Sherfane Rutherford (63). Hope reached his 25th ODI half century from 44 balls as he tried to give impetus to an innings which flagged in the middle stages. Rutherford's maiden half-century came from 71 balls. Jacks gave England a solid foundation, sharing a 50-run partnership with Phil Salt (21) for the fourth wicket, and reached his half-century from 43 balls. Zac Crawley and Ben Duckett both fell for three before Harry Brook (43) and Jos Buttler (58no) took charge and carried England to victory with 17.1 overs to spare. At 36, Buttler has now scored 5000 ODI runs, following West Indies captain Hope who reached the same milestone in the first match.

Fraser-McGurk was a nine-year-old when the former Australian captain peeled off a record-breaking 329 not out during the 2012 New Year’s Test at the SCG, a knock the Victorian continues re-watching more than a decade later. Like so many young Australian cricket fans, he would spend hours in the nets trying to replicate Clarke’s straight drive, his backward cut, his flick through mid-wicket. “I watched it the other day as well, just on my phone before I go to bed,” Fraser-McGurk told Fox Cricket this week. “That’s amazing, that was just unbelievable stuff. “Kids these days, they’ve grown up watching a lot of T20 cricket. But when I was a kid, I was watching Test cricket for hours in the day. “Then after that, I’d go to the nets with my dad for like three hours until it’s dark.” The BBL is back!

Start Your Free Trial Today > Seven years later, Fraser-McGurk represented Australia at the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in South Africa, but his campaign was cut short when a monkey scratched his face at a nature reserve, returning home for precautionary medical treatment. The bizarre injury made global headlines, but the talented right-hander didn’t become a household name until earlier this summer when he peeled off a maiden List A century in extraordinary circumstances. He only needed 29 deliveries to reach triple figures against Tasmania at Adelaide’s Karen Rolton Oval in October, breaking the all-time record for fastest white-ball century in professional cricket. Fraser-McGurk’s 125 (38), which featured five singles and 13 sixes, established himself as one of Australian cricket’s brightest prospects, with plenty of buzz surrounding the 21-year-old in the months since. “My phone was blowing up,” he said. “I turned it off at some stage just because it was on a constant vibration.” Jake Fraser-McGurk of the Redbacks. Photo by Mark Brake/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Fraser-McGurk, who moved from Victoria to South Australia earlier this year, also notched a maiden first-class century against his former state at Adelaide Oval in late November, more than four years after making his Sheffield Shield debut. The Redbacks were in dire straits at 4-16 when he walked to the crease in the first innings, but that didn’t prevent him from playing his shots. In a swashbuckling counterattack, he raced towards his hundred in just 103 deliveries, steering South Australia towards a respectable first-innings total of 252. “To get that monkey off my back, to finally get that hundred, especially against my old side, was pretty special,” Fraser-McGurk continued. “I think that was more satisfying than the one-day hundred, just because red-ball cricket’s more mentally tough. “I can’t remember the last time I faced more than 100 balls in a game.” The performance mirrored what Redbacks teammate Travis Head has achieved in the Test arena over the past 24 months, with Fraser-McGurk confessing he has drawn inspiration from the left-hander’s attacking approach to batting. “He just backs his own style of play and has 100 per cent commitment to everything he does and every shot he plays,” Fraser-McGurk said. “Taking that out of his batting style and trying to implement it into mine, and just trusting my processes has really helped me this season. “Looking at Travis, maybe that’s someone that I can aspire to bat like, and it’s pretty good I’m in his state now. “It’s pretty much his state now, isn’t it? He’s probably got the keys to the city. He is the king of Adelaide.” Jake Fraser-McGurk of the Redbacks.

He’s watching it like a hawk, so I thought I could get something out of that and try to look for the seam on the ball, and then just reacting and backing my instincts.” Renegades fans will be desperate for Fraser-McGurk’s golden run of form to continue in the BBL, which gets underway on Thursday evening. He’s understandably eager to bat in the top three, which would allow him to take advantage of fielding restrictions during the Powerplay, but he’ll be up against the likes of former Australian captain Aaron Finch, veteran opener Shaun Marsh and South African wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. “Somewhere in the top, that be nice with two out, or just send me in when the Power Surge is on, get me off to a nice start,” Fraser-McGurk laughed. “Honestly, I’m happy with wherever I can get a spot and I’ll play a role for the team as best as I can. We’ve got such a strong team, mixed with experience and youth, so I’m hoping we go really far into this tournament, go a few steps further than we did last year.” Jake Fraser-McGurk of the Melbourne Renegades.

However, pursuing a baggy green remains the “number one” long-term goal for the rising star, who hopes to one day emulate Clarke’s heroics in the Australian Test side. “I grew up watching more Test cricket than anything. So that’s the goal, and that’s the ambition,” Fraser-McGurk declared. “If it if it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t. But yeah, that’s definitely the dream.” The Renegades get their BBL campaign underway on Friday evening, facing the Sydney Sixers﻿ at the SCG from 7.15pm AEDT. “We’ve known for a long time he’s a hell of a talent,” Sixers bowler Sean Abbott said of Fraser-McGurk this week. “He’s obviously had some success this year, but we’ve got a pretty good bowling line-up. It’ll be interesting to see how he approaches that on Friday in conditions that we know pretty well. “He’s certainly a player that I’ll be keeping an eye on. He’s immensely talented.”","pubDate":"2023-12-07 00:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"94e67e77706a2fa6d1055e920f793352","title":"'It was time to put in a performance' - Buttler","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/67644896","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England captain Jos Buttler says he is \"getting back to the player that I know I am\" after his unbeaten 58 in a six-wicket win over West Indies.","content":"Jos Buttler scored 58 not out in an unbeaten stand of 90 with Harry Brook Jos Buttler says he was getting \"fed up\" with his form and that it was \"time to put in a performance\" for England.

It was his first one-day international half-century since September after a poor World Cup where he managed 138 runs in nine innings as England exited at the group stage. \"I've been searching for form,\" Buttler said, after the series-levelling win. \"I have had moments where it has been frustrating. \"I was getting fed up with it so it was time to put in a performance and get back to the player that I know I am.\" Buttler took over the white-ball captaincy from World Cup-winning skipper Eoin Morgan in 2022 and despite their recent 50-over struggles, he led England to a T20 World Cup victory in November of the same year. He reached 5,000 ODI runs during his knock, taking him to fifth in the list of England's all-time run-scorers in the format. Buttler shared an unbroken stand of 90 for the fifth wicket with Harry Brook, who made 43, to steer England to victory. And despite the batter's recent struggles with both bat and captaincy, former England captain Sir Alastair Cook said the milestone was indicative of Buttler's class. \"It shows his quality over a long period of time, and today he showed all that quality,\" Cook told TNT Sports. \"Once he got past his first 10 balls, it was back to the Jos Buttler we know and love. \"He's a guy who's really responsible for a lot of England's change in white-ball cricket, the way he goes about his batting.\" Aside from his own performance, Buttler praised all-rounder Sam Curran, who was named player of the match for his 3-33 to bounce back from figures of 0-98 in the series opener. \"He's a brilliant character,\" said Buttler. \"He had a tough day the other day but he's always up for the challenge and never shies away from it. \"He led from the front for us today which is just what we needed.\" The ODI series decider takes place in Barbados on Saturday, 9 December at 17:30 GMT.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 00:34:14","image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/17A56/production/_131945869_buttlerbrook.jpg","source_id":"bbc","source_priority":103,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7817d21859361d147bedbbdc37430755","title":"Smooth as Silk: The science behind a Big Bash superfielder","link":"https://www.watoday.com.au/sport/cricket/smooth-as-silk-the-science-behind-a-big-bash-superfielder-20231206-p5epha.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":["Sport / Cricket"],"creator":["Iain Payten"],"video_url":null,"description":"Like a duck paddling, the ease of Jordan Silk’s freakish skills in the field for Sydney Sixers mask split-second computations involving physics, pitch types and swing habits.","content":"When Jordan Silk earns plaudits for his freakish work in the outfield for the Sydney Sixers, the praise comes in traditional areas: sure hands, steady balance, outstanding speed and athleticism.

But what often gets overlooked when understanding Silk the superfielder is a beautiful mind. And if that sounds a bit like Russell Crowe scribbling on Princeton windows, you’re on the right track. Silk will take his place on the Sydney Cricket Ground boundary on Friday night in the Sixers’ opening game of the BBL season, and if the past decade is any indication, the 31-year-old will do something incredible while he is there. As Silk has done in most of his 113 games in magenta that something may be a running catch, or a diving save. Or a running-and-diving combination of the two, like the “Superman” save he pulled off in 2020. Silk is so famed for his fielding people get to the ground early just to watch him warm up. But what will stand out most is how easy Silk makes it all look. When a ball is hoiked skyward, Silk will glide across the field and deny it a landing. And that’s exactly where the physics calculations come in. If a movie was to be made, the special effects team might overlay Silk seeing projectile motion diagrams. “You are just trying to find the apex of the ball as soon as possible,” Silk says, when asked what’s going through his head when a ball is hit to the heavens. “I am thinking ‘right, where is it at its highest point? Can I get there quickly and give myself as much time as possible?’.” Jordan Silk takes a flying leap to save a six in 2020. Credit: Channel 7 The split-second calculations involved in baseballers catching in the outfield were studied in the American Journal of Physics in the 1960s – Google “optical acceleration cancellation” – and most of us have a similar radar to help us play catch at the park. But when it comes to making a classic catch in the SCG outfield, the radar isn’t enough. You’ll also need a decade of studying bowlers, batsmen, pitch types and hitting habits. “As you play more cricket you start to understand the trajectory of the ball and you understand how different batters are hitting the ball and how they swing,” Silk said. “Are they hitting with topspin? Are they hitting it with backspin? If it’s backspin it will travel further so you don’t rush in. If it’s topspin you know it is going to sort of drop on you. That’s just stuff you learn as you go and factors that you keep in mind when you’re on the boundary to prepare you for what to expect. Cameron Bancroft watches as Jordan Silk takes a diving catch. Credit: Getty “You learn it as you play, and I have been lucky enough to play for a while. I feel like have a good grasp on a lot of players and what they’re trying to do, and what they’re trying to target late in the innings.” Penrith-raised Silk started playing for the Sixers in 2013-14, the third season of the BBL, and has been a mainstay ever since. His contributions as a middle-order batsman and gun fielder helped the Sixers win two titles, and finish as runners-up another three times. A screaming catch in 2014 had Ricky Ponting labelling him Australia’s best fielder, and Viv Richards rating him one of the best he’s ever seen. “Probably as a younger player, coming into that Sixers squad (who had won the 2011-12 BBL), I saw it as my opportunity of playing games,” Silk said. “I aimed to be the best fielder I possibly and work extremely hard at it, and I think my fielding probably got me games because I was hiding down at six and seven with the bat and not getting many opportunities there. But I felt like I could contribute in the field.” Jordan Silk times an epic running catch. Credit: Network Ten His training regimen is more short-and-focussed than his eager early days, but Silk still prepares for all scenarios. “We are constantly practising difficult catches, catches on the run, catches into the sun and lights, things like that,” he said. “It is more a trust thing for me. Knowing I have done the work.” In part because of his fielding heroics, Silk’s batting is undervalued. In a league of rope-clearing hitters, the right-hander is more of a gap-finding finisher in the mould of Michael Bevan, and though it’s without the rocket-fuelled strike rate of some, it’s effective. Silk is the Sixers’ second-highest run-scorer of all time and their top scorer last season. But those run tallies don’t even take into account another calculation that whirs through Silk’s mind every time he dives over the rope to stop a six, or hustle to restrict a two into a single.

Fraser-McGurk was a nine-year-old when the former Australian captain peeled off a record-breaking 329 not out during the 2012 New Year’s Test at the SCG, a knock the Victorian continues re-watching more than a decade later. Like so many young Australian cricket fans, he would spend hours in the nets trying to replicate Clarke’s straight drive, his backward cut, his flick through mid-wicket. “I watched it the other day as well, just on my phone before I go to bed,” Fraser-McGurk told Fox Cricket this week. “That’s amazing, that was just unbelievable stuff. “Kids these days, they’ve grown up watching a lot of T20 cricket. But when I was a kid, I was watching Test cricket for hours in the day. “Then after that, I’d go to the nets with my dad for like three hours until it’s dark.” The BBL is back!

Start Your Free Trial Today > Seven years later, Fraser-McGurk represented Australia at the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in South Africa, but his campaign was cut short when a monkey scratched his face at a nature reserve, returning home for precautionary medical treatment. The bizarre injury made global headlines, but the talented right-hander didn’t become a household name until earlier this summer when he peeled off a maiden List A century in extraordinary circumstances. He only needed 29 deliveries to reach triple figures against Tasmania at Adelaide’s Karen Rolton Oval in October, breaking the all-time record for fastest white-ball century in professional cricket. Fraser-McGurk’s 125 (38), which featured five singles and 13 sixes, established himself as one of Australian cricket’s brightest prospects, with plenty of buzz surrounding the 21-year-old in the months since. “My phone was blowing up,” he said. “I turned it off at some stage just because it was on a constant vibration.” Jake Fraser-McGurk of the Redbacks. Photo by Mark Brake/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Fraser-McGurk, who moved from Victoria to South Australia earlier this year, also notched a maiden first-class century against his former state at Adelaide Oval in late November, more than four years after making his Sheffield Shield debut. The Redbacks were in dire straits at 4-16 when he walked to the crease in the first innings, but that didn’t prevent him from playing his shots. In a swashbuckling counterattack, he raced towards his hundred in just 103 deliveries, steering South Australia towards a respectable first-innings total of 252. “To get that monkey off my back, to finally get that hundred, especially against my old side, was pretty special,” Fraser-McGurk continued. “I think that was more satisfying than the one-day hundred, just because red-ball cricket’s more mentally tough. “I can’t remember the last time I faced more than 100 balls in a game.” The performance mirrored what Redbacks teammate Travis Head has achieved in the Test arena over the past 24 months, with Fraser-McGurk confessing he has drawn inspiration from the left-hander’s attacking approach to batting. “He just backs his own style of play and has 100 per cent commitment to everything he does and every shot he plays,” Fraser-McGurk said. “Taking that out of his batting style and trying to implement it into mine, and just trusting my processes has really helped me this season. “Looking at Travis, maybe that’s someone that I can aspire to bat like, and it’s pretty good I’m in his state now. “It’s pretty much his state now, isn’t it? He’s probably got the keys to the city. He is the king of Adelaide.” Jake Fraser-McGurk of the Redbacks.

He’s watching it like a hawk, so I thought I could get something out of that and try to look for the seam on the ball, and then just reacting and backing my instincts.” Renegades fans will be desperate for Fraser-McGurk’s golden run of form to continue in the BBL, which gets underway on Thursday evening. He’s understandably eager to bat in the top three, which would allow him to take advantage of fielding restrictions during the Powerplay, but he’ll be up against the likes of former Australian captain Aaron Finch, veteran opener Shaun Marsh and South African wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. “Somewhere in the top, that be nice with two out, or just send me in when the Power Surge is on, get me off to a nice start,” Fraser-McGurk laughed. “Honestly, I’m happy with wherever I can get a spot and I’ll play a role for the team as best as I can. We’ve got such a strong team, mixed with experience and youth, so I’m hoping we go really far into this tournament, go a few steps further than we did last year.” Jake Fraser-McGurk of the Melbourne Renegades.

However, pursuing a baggy green remains the “number one” long-term goal for the rising star, who hopes to one day emulate Clarke’s heroics in the Australian Test side. “I grew up watching more Test cricket than anything. So that’s the goal, and that’s the ambition,” Fraser-McGurk declared. “If it if it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t.

The white-ball captain struck 58 not out in England's six-wicket victory over West Indies on Wednesday. It was his first one-day international half-century since September after a poor World Cup where he managed 138 runs in nine innings as England exited at the group stage. \"I've been searching for form,\" Buttler said, after the series-levelling win. \"I have had moments where it has been frustrating. \"I was getting fed up with it so it was time to put in a performance and get back to the player that I know I am.\" Buttler took over the white-ball captaincy from World Cup-winning skipper Eoin Morgan in 2022 and despite their recent 50-over struggles, he led England to a T20 World Cup victory in November of the same year. He reached 5,000 ODI runs during his knock, taking him to fifth in the list of England's all-time run-scorers in the format. Buttler shared an unbroken stand of 90 for the fifth wicket with Harry Brook, who made 43, to steer England to victory. And despite the batter's recent struggles with both bat and captaincy, former England captain Sir Alastair Cook said the milestone was indicative of Buttler's class. \"It shows his quality over a long period of time, and today he showed all that quality,\" Cook told TNT Sports. \"Once he got past his first 10 balls, it was back to the Jos Buttler we know and love. \"He's a guy who's really responsible for a lot of England's change in white-ball cricket, the way he goes about his batting.\" Aside from his own performance, Buttler praised all-rounder Sam Curran, who was named player of the match for his 3-33 to bounce back from figures of 0-98 in the series opener. \"He's a brilliant character,\" said Buttler. \"He had a tough day the other day but he's always up for the challenge and never shies away from it. \"He led from the front for us today which is just what we needed.\" The ODI series decider takes place in Barbados on Saturday, 9 December at 17:30 GMT.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 00:34:14","image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/17A56/production/_131945869_buttlerbrook.jpg","source_id":"bbc","source_priority":103,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7817d21859361d147bedbbdc37430755","title":"Smooth as Silk: The science behind a Big Bash superfielder","link":"https://www.watoday.com.au/sport/cricket/smooth-as-silk-the-science-behind-a-big-bash-superfielder-20231206-p5epha.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":["Sport / Cricket"],"creator":["Iain Payten"],"video_url":null,"description":"Like a duck paddling, the ease of Jordan Silk’s freakish skills in the field for Sydney Sixers mask split-second computations involving physics, pitch types and swing habits.","content":"When Jordan Silk earns plaudits for his freakish work in the outfield for the Sydney Sixers, the praise comes in traditional areas: sure hands, steady balance, outstanding speed and athleticism.

Buttler, who had been averaging 14.1 since the start of a miserable World Cup for himself and his team, gradually bloomed and his unbeaten 58 off 45 deliveries – his first fifty in 14 ODIs – sealed England’s six-wicket win. Harry Brook finished on 43 not out as England prevailed with 17.1 overs to spare although the architect of them ensuring a decider in Barbados on Saturday was Curran, who took three for 33 in seven overs. Series: LEVELLED 🦁 | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Having recorded the most expensive figures by an England bowler in Sunday’s four-wicket defeat, leaking 98 runs in 9.5 overs, the left-arm seamer snared top-order trio Keacy Carty, Brandon King and Shimron Hetmyer. After the Windies lurched to 23 for four, captain Shai Hope did his bit for nominative determinism, following up his match-winning ton a few days ago with a run-a-ball 68 and rookie Sherfane Rutherford chipped in with 63 before the pair were dismissed by Liam Livingstone, who took three for 39. Curran was initially wayward again and belted for three fours by King but an opening stand that put on 104 on Sunday was snuffed out for 15 here after Gus Atkinson scythed through Alick Athanaze, with England’s review for caught behind showing a big snick on UltraEdge. Curran’s fortunes shifted as angled deliveries took the edges of Carty and King to Zak Crawley before Hetmyer was rapped on the back pad by a fuller ball. The not-out verdict was overturned after Ben Duckett seemed to persuade Buttler into sending the decision upstairs. Curran’s three wickets in eight balls left Hope and Rutherford, in his second ODI, with a mountainous rebuild. A 129-run stand followed as smoke from the barbecue vendors beyond the stands occasionally drifted across the ground, Hope settling with three straight driven fours in an Atkinson over. Quality batting, 👏 Live Scorecard: | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Brydon Carse was taken the distance by Hope as the partnership grew, with both Windies batters going past fifties, Rutherford doing so with a mighty heave off the otherwise parsimonious Rehan Ahmed. Having been held back until the 26th over, Livingstone broke the union when Rutherford drove loosely to Phil Salt in the ring while Yannic Cariah was castled through the gate by a floaty off-spinner. Livingstone had the big fish with a precision piece of bowling, his leg-spinner leaving Hope in two minds, missing an indeterminate prod and his off-stump as a consequence. Livingstone’s figures were dented by Romario Shepherd’s four fours in an over but the Windies subsided after he holed out to Rehan, whose figures of 10-1-40-2 were identical to what he recorded on Sunday. Seamers 🤝 Spinners Our twirlers doing the job in the middle overs 💫 Scorecard: — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Despite tricky conditions, Salt and Jacks were authoritative from the off, evoking the spirit of predecessors Jason Roy and first Alex Hales then Jonny Bairstow. The pair rode their luck, edging wide of slip off Alzarri Joseph before Salt’s luck ran out on 21, bowled by Shepherd, after a 50-run stand. The early battle between Joseph and Jacks was worth the entry fee alone. A rising snorter took Jacks’ glove and ballooned over Hope but the opener responded by hammering over backward square-leg and then repeated the trick off Shepherd. Jacks then smeared Oshane Thomas over backward point for a third six. Crawley chopped on off Gudakesh Motie, who found the glove when Duckett went for a customary sweep before Brook edged agonisingly short of slip from his first ball as tension crept in. Nerves may have been jangling when Jacks was lbw to one that kept low from Rutherford, bringing out Buttler, who had been dismissed for single figures in five of his previous eight innings. He made a cagey start and was beaten twice on the outside edge by leg-spinner Cariah but he steadily grew in confidence alongside Brook. A whipped four off Joseph was followed by a skip down the track and thump for back-to-back sixes off Cariah as Buttler started to find some rhythm. The second of those monstrous blows was measured at 94 metres before another mighty mow off Thomas brought up a 43-ball half-century. Buttler took 16 off that Thomas over to level the scores. It was left to Brook to get over the line and he did so by sweeping Motie behind square for four in the 33rd over.","pubDate":"2023-12-06 23:41:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"06941f6d2533736fcfd3937501fd20d2","title":"Sam Curran and Jos Buttler return to form as England level series in Antigua","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23973515.sam-curran-jos-buttler-return-form-england-level-series-antigua/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Chasing 203, Will Jacks put England into the ascendancy with a sparkling 73 off 72 balls.","content":"Sam Curran redeemed himself after his weekend drubbing and England captain Jos Buttler rediscovered his Midas touch in his side’s series-levelling victory over the West Indies in Antigua.

After the Windies lurched to 23 for four, captain Shai Hope did his bit for nominative determinism, following up his match-winning ton a few days ago with a run-a-ball 68 and rookie Sherfane Rutherford chipped in with 63 before the pair were dismissed by Liam Livingstone, who took three for 39. Curran was initially wayward again and belted for three fours by King but an opening stand that put on 104 on Sunday was snuffed out for 15 here after Gus Atkinson scythed through Alick Athanaze, with England’s review for caught behind showing a big snick on UltraEdge. Curran’s fortunes shifted as angled deliveries took the edges of Carty and King to Zak Crawley before Hetmyer was rapped on the back pad by a fuller ball. The not-out verdict was overturned after Ben Duckett seemed to persuade Buttler into sending the decision upstairs. Curran’s three wickets in eight balls left Hope and Rutherford, in his second ODI, with a mountainous rebuild. A 129-run stand followed as smoke from the barbecue vendors beyond the stands occasionally drifted across the ground, Hope settling with three straight driven fours in an Atkinson over. Quality batting, 👏 Live Scorecard: | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Brydon Carse was taken the distance by Hope as the partnership grew, with both Windies batters going past fifties, Rutherford doing so with a mighty heave off the otherwise parsimonious Rehan Ahmed. Having been held back until the 26th over, Livingstone broke the union when Rutherford drove loosely to Phil Salt in the ring while Yannic Cariah was castled through the gate by a floaty off-spinner. Livingstone had the big fish with a precision piece of bowling, his leg-spinner leaving Hope in two minds, missing an indeterminate prod and his off-stump as a consequence. Livingstone’s figures were dented by Romario Shepherd’s four fours in an over but the Windies subsided after he holed out to Rehan, whose figures of 10-1-40-2 were identical to what he recorded on Sunday. Seamers 🤝 Spinners Our twirlers doing the job in the middle overs 💫 Scorecard: — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Despite tricky conditions, Salt and Jacks were authoritative from the off, evoking the spirit of predecessors Jason Roy and first Alex Hales then Jonny Bairstow. The pair rode their luck, edging wide of slip off Alzarri Joseph before Salt’s luck ran out on 21, bowled by Shepherd, after a 50-run stand. The early battle between Joseph and Jacks was worth the entry fee alone. A rising snorter took Jacks’ glove and ballooned over Hope but the opener responded by hammering over backward square-leg and then repeated the trick off Shepherd. Jacks then smeared Oshane Thomas over backward point for a third six. Crawley chopped on off Gudakesh Motie, who found the glove when Duckett went for a customary sweep before Brook edged agonisingly short of slip from his first ball as tension crept in. Nerves may have been jangling when Jacks was lbw to one that kept low from Rutherford, bringing out Buttler, who had been dismissed for single figures in five of his previous eight innings. He made a cagey start and was beaten twice on the outside edge by leg-spinner Cariah but he steadily grew in confidence alongside Brook. A whipped four off Joseph was followed by a skip down the track and thump for back-to-back sixes off Cariah as Buttler started to find some rhythm. The second of those monstrous blows was measured at 94 metres before another mighty mow off Thomas brought up a 43-ball half-century. Buttler took 16 off that Thomas over to level the scores. It was left to Brook to get over the line and he did so by sweeping Motie behind square for four in the 33rd over.","pubDate":"2023-12-06 23:41:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"northwaleschronicle","source_priority":2822327,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"69859dbb275caf041af8e4ca95154050","title":"Jacks, Curran star as England level West Indies series","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/jacks-curran-star-as-england-level-west-indies-series-c-12817095","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Writers"],"video_url":null,"description":"England quick Sam Curran, battered to all corners in the series opener, has returned figures of 3-33 in his side's six-wicket ODI win over West Indies.","content":"Will Jacks and Sam Curran were the standouts as England found form to beat West Indies by six wickets and draw level at 1-1 in their one-day international series.

Fraser-McGurk was a nine-year-old when the former Australian captain peeled off a record-breaking 329 not out during the 2012 New Year’s Test at the SCG, a knock the Victorian continues re-watching more than a decade later. Like so many young Australian cricket fans, he would spend hours in the nets trying to replicate Clarke’s straight drive, his backward cut, his flick through mid-wicket. “I watched it the other day as well, just on my phone before I go to bed,” Fraser-McGurk told Fox Cricket this week. “That’s amazing, that was just unbelievable stuff. “Kids these days, they’ve grown up watching a lot of T20 cricket. But when I was a kid, I was watching Test cricket for hours in the day. “Then after that, I’d go to the nets with my dad for like three hours until it’s dark.” The BBL is back!

Start Your Free Trial Today > Seven years later, Fraser-McGurk represented Australia at the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in South Africa, but his campaign was cut short when a monkey scratched his face at a nature reserve, returning home for precautionary medical treatment. The bizarre injury made global headlines, but the talented right-hander didn’t become a household name until earlier this summer when he peeled off a maiden List A century in extraordinary circumstances. He only needed 29 deliveries to reach triple figures against Tasmania at Adelaide’s Karen Rolton Oval in October, breaking the all-time record for fastest white-ball century in professional cricket. Fraser-McGurk’s 125 (38), which featured five singles and 13 sixes, established himself as one of Australian cricket’s brightest prospects, with plenty of buzz surrounding the 21-year-old in the months since. “My phone was blowing up,” he said. “I turned it off at some stage just because it was on a constant vibration.” Jake Fraser-McGurk of the Redbacks. Photo by Mark Brake/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Fraser-McGurk, who moved from Victoria to South Australia earlier this year, also notched a maiden first-class century against his former state at Adelaide Oval in late November, more than four years after making his Sheffield Shield debut. The Redbacks were in dire straits at 4-16 when he walked to the crease in the first innings, but that didn’t prevent him from playing his shots. In a swashbuckling counterattack, he raced towards his hundred in just 103 deliveries, steering South Australia towards a respectable first-innings total of 252. “To get that monkey off my back, to finally get that hundred, especially against my old side, was pretty special,” Fraser-McGurk continued. “I think that was more satisfying than the one-day hundred, just because red-ball cricket’s more mentally tough. “I can’t remember the last time I faced more than 100 balls in a game.” The performance mirrored what Redbacks teammate Travis Head has achieved in the Test arena over the past 24 months, with Fraser-McGurk confessing he has drawn inspiration from the left-hander’s attacking approach to batting. “He just backs his own style of play and has 100 per cent commitment to everything he does and every shot he plays,” Fraser-McGurk said. “Taking that out of his batting style and trying to implement it into mine, and just trusting my processes has really helped me this season. “Looking at Travis, maybe that’s someone that I can aspire to bat like, and it’s pretty good I’m in his state now. “It’s pretty much his state now, isn’t it? He’s probably got the keys to the city. He is the king of Adelaide.” Jake Fraser-McGurk of the Redbacks.

He’s watching it like a hawk, so I thought I could get something out of that and try to look for the seam on the ball, and then just reacting and backing my instincts.” Renegades fans will be desperate for Fraser-McGurk’s golden run of form to continue in the BBL, which gets underway on Thursday evening. He’s understandably eager to bat in the top three, which would allow him to take advantage of fielding restrictions during the Powerplay, but he’ll be up against the likes of former Australian captain Aaron Finch, veteran opener Shaun Marsh and South African wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. “Somewhere in the top, that be nice with two out, or just send me in when the Power Surge is on, get me off to a nice start,” Fraser-McGurk laughed. “Honestly, I’m happy with wherever I can get a spot and I’ll play a role for the team as best as I can. We’ve got such a strong team, mixed with experience and youth, so I’m hoping we go really far into this tournament, go a few steps further than we did last year.” Jake Fraser-McGurk of the Melbourne Renegades.

However, pursuing a baggy green remains the “number one” long-term goal for the rising star, who hopes to one day emulate Clarke’s heroics in the Australian Test side. “I grew up watching more Test cricket than anything. So that’s the goal, and that’s the ambition,” Fraser-McGurk declared. “If it if it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t. But yeah, that’s definitely the dream.” The Renegades get their BBL campaign underway on Friday evening, facing the Sydney Sixers﻿ at the SCG from 7.15pm AEDT. “We’ve known for a long time he’s a hell of a talent,” Sixers bowler Sean Abbott said of Fraser-McGurk this week. “He’s obviously had some success this year, but we’ve got a pretty good bowling line-up.

Buttler shared an unbroken stand of 90 for the fifth wicket with Harry Brook, who made 43, to steer England to victory. And despite the batter's recent struggles with both bat and captaincy, former England captain Sir Alastair Cook said the milestone was indicative of Buttler's class. \"It shows his quality over a long period of time, and today he showed all that quality,\" Cook told TNT Sports. \"Once he got past his first 10 balls, it was back to the Jos Buttler we know and love. \"He's a guy who's really responsible for a lot of England's change in white-ball cricket, the way he goes about his batting.\" Aside from his own performance, Buttler praised all-rounder Sam Curran, who was named player of the match for his 3-33 to bounce back from figures of 0-98 in the series opener. \"He's a brilliant character,\" said Buttler. \"He had a tough day the other day but he's always up for the challenge and never shies away from it. \"He led from the front for us today which is just what we needed.\" The ODI series decider takes place in Barbados on Saturday, 9 December at 17:30 GMT.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 00:34:14","image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/17A56/production/_131945869_buttlerbrook.jpg","source_id":"bbc","source_priority":103,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7817d21859361d147bedbbdc37430755","title":"Smooth as Silk: The science behind a Big Bash superfielder","link":"https://www.watoday.com.au/sport/cricket/smooth-as-silk-the-science-behind-a-big-bash-superfielder-20231206-p5epha.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":["Sport / Cricket"],"creator":["Iain Payten"],"video_url":null,"description":"Like a duck paddling, the ease of Jordan Silk’s freakish skills in the field for Sydney Sixers mask split-second computations involving physics, pitch types and swing habits.","content":"When Jordan Silk earns plaudits for his freakish work in the outfield for the Sydney Sixers, the praise comes in traditional areas: sure hands, steady balance, outstanding speed and athleticism.

Are they hitting it with backspin? If it’s backspin it will travel further so you don’t rush in. If it’s topspin you know it is going to sort of drop on you. That’s just stuff you learn as you go and factors that you keep in mind when you’re on the boundary to prepare you for what to expect. Cameron Bancroft watches as Jordan Silk takes a diving catch.

I feel like have a good grasp on a lot of players and what they’re trying to do, and what they’re trying to target late in the innings.” Penrith-raised Silk started playing for the Sixers in 2013-14, the third season of the BBL, and has been a mainstay ever since. His contributions as a middle-order batsman and gun fielder helped the Sixers win two titles, and finish as runners-up another three times. A screaming catch in 2014 had Ricky Ponting labelling him Australia’s best fielder, and Viv Richards rating him one of the best he’s ever seen. “Probably as a younger player, coming into that Sixers squad (who had won the 2011-12 BBL), I saw it as my opportunity of playing games,” Silk said. “I aimed to be the best fielder I possibly and work extremely hard at it, and I think my fielding probably got me games because I was hiding down at six and seven with the bat and not getting many opportunities there. But I felt like I could contribute in the field.” Jordan Silk times an epic running catch. Credit: Network Ten His training regimen is more short-and-focussed than his eager early days, but Silk still prepares for all scenarios. “We are constantly practising difficult catches, catches on the run, catches into the sun and lights, things like that,” he said. “It is more a trust thing for me. Knowing I have done the work.” In part because of his fielding heroics, Silk’s batting is undervalued. In a league of rope-clearing hitters, the right-hander is more of a gap-finding finisher in the mould of Michael Bevan, and though it’s without the rocket-fuelled strike rate of some, it’s effective. Silk is the Sixers’ second-highest run-scorer of all time and their top scorer last season. But those run tallies don’t even take into account another calculation that whirs through Silk’s mind every time he dives over the rope to stop a six, or hustle to restrict a two into a single. Jordan Silk takes a low catch. Credit: Getty “I see the fielding side accumulates into batting,” Silk said. “I might not have the best strike rate (124) or anything like that, with the bat. But I almost try and get ahead of that, with how many runs can I cut off in the field? And maybe propel your average from a 25/30 player to someone who maybe gets seen as a bloke who gives more value, because he’ll save us five to 10 runs in the field. Loading “That stuff adds up, particularly if a number of people are doing it. “They’re all little moments that we don’t let slip in the change room. We know the value of runs in T20 cricket. Every run you can stop can help you win games.” Sports news, results and expert commentary. Sign up for our Sport newsletter . Save Log in , register or subscribe to save articles for later.

Or a running-and-diving combination of the two, like the “Superman” save he pulled off in 2020. Silk is so famed for his fielding people get to the ground early just to watch him warm up. But what will stand out most is how easy Silk makes it all look. When a ball is hoiked skyward, Silk will glide across the field and deny it a landing. And that’s exactly where the physics calculations come in. If a movie was to be made, the special effects team might overlay Silk seeing projectile motion diagrams. “You are just trying to find the apex of the ball as soon as possible,” Silk says, when asked what’s going through his head when a ball is hit to the heavens. “I am thinking ‘right, where is it at its highest point? Can I get there quickly and give myself as much time as possible?’.” Jordan Silk takes a flying leap to save a six in 2020.

But when it comes to making a classic catch in the SCG outfield, the radar isn’t enough. You’ll also need a decade of studying bowlers, batsmen, pitch types and hitting habits. “As you play more cricket you start to understand the trajectory of the ball and you understand how different batters are hitting the ball and how they swing,” Silk said. “Are they hitting with topspin? Are they hitting it with backspin? If it’s backspin it will travel further so you don’t rush in. If it’s topspin you know it is going to sort of drop on you. That’s just stuff you learn as you go and factors that you keep in mind when you’re on the boundary to prepare you for what to expect. Cameron Bancroft watches as Jordan Silk takes a diving catch. Credit: Getty “You learn it as you play, and I have been lucky enough to play for a while. I feel like have a good grasp on a lot of players and what they’re trying to do, and what they’re trying to target late in the innings.” Penrith-raised Silk started playing for the Sixers in 2013-14, the third season of the BBL, and has been a mainstay ever since. His contributions as a middle-order batsman and gun fielder helped the Sixers win two titles, and finish as runners-up another three times. A screaming catch in 2014 had Ricky Ponting labelling him Australia’s best fielder, and Viv Richards rating him one of the best he’s ever seen. “Probably as a younger player, coming into that Sixers squad (who had won the 2011-12 BBL), I saw it as my opportunity of playing games,” Silk said. “I aimed to be the best fielder I possibly and work extremely hard at it, and I think my fielding probably got me games because I was hiding down at six and seven with the bat and not getting many opportunities there. But I felt like I could contribute in the field.” Jordan Silk times an epic running catch. Credit: Network Ten His training regimen is more short-and-focussed than his eager early days, but Silk still prepares for all scenarios. “We are constantly practising difficult catches, catches on the run, catches into the sun and lights, things like that,” he said. “It is more a trust thing for me. Knowing I have done the work.” In part because of his fielding heroics, Silk’s batting is undervalued. In a league of rope-clearing hitters, the right-hander is more of a gap-finding finisher in the mould of Michael Bevan, and though it’s without the rocket-fuelled strike rate of some, it’s effective. Silk is the Sixers’ second-highest run-scorer of all time and their top scorer last season. But those run tallies don’t even take into account another calculation that whirs through Silk’s mind every time he dives over the rope to stop a six, or hustle to restrict a two into a single. Jordan Silk takes a low catch. Credit: Getty “I see the fielding side accumulates into batting,” Silk said. “I might not have the best strike rate (124) or anything like that, with the bat. But I almost try and get ahead of that, with how many runs can I cut off in the field? And maybe propel your average from a 25/30 player to someone who maybe gets seen as a bloke who gives more value, because he’ll save us five to 10 runs in the field. “That stuff adds up, particularly if a number of people are doing it. “They’re all little moments that we don’t let slip in the change room.

Buttler, who had been averaging 14.1 since the start of a miserable World Cup for himself and his team, gradually bloomed and his unbeaten 58 off 45 deliveries – his first fifty in 14 ODIs – sealed England’s six-wicket win. Harry Brook finished on 43 not out as England prevailed with 17.1 overs to spare although the architect of them ensuring a decider in Barbados on Saturday was Curran, who took three for 33 in seven overs. Series: LEVELLED 🦁 | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Having recorded the most expensive figures by an England bowler in Sunday’s four-wicket defeat, leaking 98 runs in 9.5 overs, the left-arm seamer snared top-order trio Keacy Carty, Brandon King and Shimron Hetmyer. After the Windies lurched to 23 for four, captain Shai Hope did his bit for nominative determinism, following up his match-winning ton a few days ago with a run-a-ball 68 and rookie Sherfane Rutherford chipped in with 63 before the pair were dismissed by Liam Livingstone, who took three for 39. Curran was initially wayward again and belted for three fours by King but an opening stand that put on 104 on Sunday was snuffed out for 15 here after Gus Atkinson scythed through Alick Athanaze, with England’s review for caught behind showing a big snick on UltraEdge. Curran’s fortunes shifted as angled deliveries took the edges of Carty and King to Zak Crawley before Hetmyer was rapped on the back pad by a fuller ball. The not-out verdict was overturned after Ben Duckett seemed to persuade Buttler into sending the decision upstairs. Curran’s three wickets in eight balls left Hope and Rutherford, in his second ODI, with a mountainous rebuild. A 129-run stand followed as smoke from the barbecue vendors beyond the stands occasionally drifted across the ground, Hope settling with three straight driven fours in an Atkinson over. Quality batting, 👏 Live Scorecard: | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Brydon Carse was taken the distance by Hope as the partnership grew, with both Windies batters going past fifties, Rutherford doing so with a mighty heave off the otherwise parsimonious Rehan Ahmed. Having been held back until the 26th over, Livingstone broke the union when Rutherford drove loosely to Phil Salt in the ring while Yannic Cariah was castled through the gate by a floaty off-spinner. Livingstone had the big fish with a precision piece of bowling, his leg-spinner leaving Hope in two minds, missing an indeterminate prod and his off-stump as a consequence. Livingstone’s figures were dented by Romario Shepherd’s four fours in an over but the Windies subsided after he holed out to Rehan, whose figures of 10-1-40-2 were identical to what he recorded on Sunday. Seamers 🤝 Spinners Our twirlers doing the job in the middle overs 💫 Scorecard: — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Despite tricky conditions, Salt and Jacks were authoritative from the off, evoking the spirit of predecessors Jason Roy and first Alex Hales then Jonny Bairstow. The pair rode their luck, edging wide of slip off Alzarri Joseph before Salt’s luck ran out on 21, bowled by Shepherd, after a 50-run stand. The early battle between Joseph and Jacks was worth the entry fee alone. A rising snorter took Jacks’ glove and ballooned over Hope but the opener responded by hammering over backward square-leg and then repeated the trick off Shepherd. Jacks then smeared Oshane Thomas over backward point for a third six. Crawley chopped on off Gudakesh Motie, who found the glove when Duckett went for a customary sweep before Brook edged agonisingly short of slip from his first ball as tension crept in. Nerves may have been jangling when Jacks was lbw to one that kept low from Rutherford, bringing out Buttler, who had been dismissed for single figures in five of his previous eight innings. He made a cagey start and was beaten twice on the outside edge by leg-spinner Cariah but he steadily grew in confidence alongside Brook. A whipped four off Joseph was followed by a skip down the track and thump for back-to-back sixes off Cariah as Buttler started to find some rhythm. The second of those monstrous blows was measured at 94 metres before another mighty mow off Thomas brought up a 43-ball half-century. Buttler took 16 off that Thomas over to level the scores. It was left to Brook to get over the line and he did so by sweeping Motie behind square for four in the 33rd over.","pubDate":"2023-12-06 23:41:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"06941f6d2533736fcfd3937501fd20d2","title":"Sam Curran and Jos Buttler return to form as England level series in Antigua","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23973515.sam-curran-jos-buttler-return-form-england-level-series-antigua/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Chasing 203, Will Jacks put England into the ascendancy with a sparkling 73 off 72 balls.","content":"Sam Curran redeemed himself after his weekend drubbing and England captain Jos Buttler rediscovered his Midas touch in his side’s series-levelling victory over the West Indies in Antigua.
