England skipper Joe Root, who had made 13 not out, and injured all-rounder Ben Stokes, who was unbeaten on 16, will return after the break perhaps hoping that the dark clouds gathering on the horizon might produce some rain. The tourists had resumed on 13 without loss chasing an unlikely victory target of 388 and Zak Crawley led the resistance at the Sydney Cricket Ground with an authoritative 77 from a hundred balls. His fellow opener Haseeb Hameed looked less assured at the other end and had already been dropped when he prodded at a Scott Boland delivery and departed for nine to give the paceman his 12th wicket in four test innings. Dawid Malan had made four when he stepped back to a full-length Nathan Lyon delivery, which skidded on and rattled into the off stump. Crawley had hit 13 fours in his fifth test half century when Australia all-rounder Cameron Green got under his bat with a yorker. The batsman reviewed the lbw decision but the DRS video showed the ball had landed plumb on Crawley's toe as it headed towards the stumps. Australia lead the series 3-0 after big wins in Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne. The fifth test will be a day-night match in Hobart.

This is a very sensible analysis and likely scenario Katich on Khawaja: “I thought the case should have been closed for him to stay in the team for Hobart after the first innings, let alone a second innings. I think he’d done enough in that first innings given the way that he compiled the hundred and then to back it up yesterday, he was on autopilot.

He’s just in imperious form. There’s no way they can leave him out for Hobart. No way.” Simon Katich on SEN Radio this morning In the meantime we have an email from Finbar: “Good evening Sam, just wondered if there could be any other approach for England today other than guns blazing? Seems obvious doesn’t it? Nothing to lose and all that.” Graham Thorpe made comments last night setting sights on a draw, so while the suggestion titillates, I think we’re in for a day of dogged defence. Can England do it? I actually think they can. The wicket appears to improve as the day goes on, and Australia do historically struggle to remove the opposition once set. The alternative is they lose a few early and the rest go in a hurry. Khawaja: what to do now? He’s 35 and actualised. His rivals are ... not that. Geoff Lemon explores it all, here . For the sake of argument, I’d love to hear views - especially from the UK - on whether or not Khawaja should continue in the side. My view is that he should. While Australian teams deeply value incumbency when they’re winning, they’re also allowed to improve. Travis Head is a lock, so Marcus Harris looks precarious. So far missing from the conversation is Will Pucovski, who has his eye on the Pakistan tour. What do you think? Is there a case for retaining Harris? Hello all. Here we go: a fifth day, a docile-enough pitch, 10 wickets in play, and 98 overs to decide whether a whitewash is on or not. At 30-0, England have reason to believe they can – to use footballing parlance – “get something” from the Test. Though it came from an admittedly low base, last night Crawley and Hameed looked as assured as they have all series, and will be keen to continue on in the day’s opening exchanges. As the day wears on and wickets inevitably fall, the visitors, of course, will be relying on a number of guys carrying injury. Each of Stokes, Bairstow and Butler are walking wounded but are expected to bat. It’s a day for close-in fields, strange plans, and digging in. The weather, as ever, is dubious. The morning is meant to be OK, but it’s meant to get worse as the day goes on. Then again, they’ve said that for the last three days and rain has barely intervened.

England’s tour from hell continued on Saturday as Australia’s comeback king Usman Khawaja completed his twin centuries in the fourth Test at the SCG. Australia declared in both their innings and England are 0-30 heading into day five, requiring an imposing 358 runs to clinch an unlikely win. It has been the English batsmen who have copped the brunt of the criticism for most of the tour, but this time it was the “toothless” bowling attack who came under fire. “For all the laments over the state of England’s batting this series, a similar inquisition is warranted into the bowling,” Oliver Brown wrote in The Telegraph. “Rarely has it appeared even remotely penetrating enough: in four Tests, Australia have been bowled out just twice. “For all the plaudits attracted by Stuart Broad’s five-for here in Sydney, he still went for 101 runs. England's James Anderson (L) reacts as he talks with a teammate Stuart Broad on day four. Source: AFP “There was little suggestion of an encore either, as he and fellow old stager James Anderson both went wicketless (in the second innings), their lines and lengths deftly dealt with by the wily Khawaja. “While Khawaja has fashioned the most elegant riposte to his critics with his twin SCG centuries, there is little doubt that much of the bowling he faced was of rank mediocrity. “Even the giant Green, tentative and awkward with the bat to this point, was made to look like a world-beater.If England are ever to buck the trend of Ashes shellackings here in Australia, it is clear that they need to construct their next bowling attack around pure pace. “Bringing together their two speed kings, Wood and Archer, is their surest means of reviving an attack that has grown worryingly toothless.” England's paceman Stuart Broad. Source: AFP Joe Root has rarely escape the criticism this summer and day four in Sydney proved no different, with the calls growing louder for him to relinquish the captaincy. The Times’ Simon Hughes admitting Root has had little to work with this summer but nonetheless believes it’s time for him to move on. “But the question is, could he have done more, as captain, to influence the course of matches, and ultimately, is he the right man to lead England going forward? “There have been obvious mistakes in terms of selection and decision-making — the teams selected for Brisbane and Adelaide, the decision to bat first at the Gabba are easier to criticise in hindsight, and also not entirely attributable to Root alone. Joe Root of England. Getty Images Source: Getty Images “But there have been other odd strategies the blame for which could be placed at the captain’s door. The true skill of a captain is in recognising times and moments in games where momentum is in the balance and can be shifted one way or the other. Getting these choices right is one way of making the most of your players. “Root will know he hasn’t managed to make the most of (limited) resources and will reflect that, in the interests of the team and his own sanity, that it may be a worthwhile idea to let someone else have a go while he still has a full head of hair.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"Khawaja slams another ton as Oz take big lead","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/khawaja-slams-another-ton-as-oz-take-big-lead-723798","keywords":["Sports,Today NewsPaper,Cricket"],"creator":["The Hans India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australian batter Usman Khawaja etched his name in the record books, scoring an unbeaten century (101 not out) in the second innings as well as he put the hosts firmly in command in the fourth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday.","content":"Australian batter Usman KhawajaAustralian batter Usman KhawajaSydney: Australian batter Usman Khawaja etched his name in the record books, scoring an unbeaten century (101 not out) in the second innings as well as he put the hosts firmly in command in the fourth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday.Thanks to Khawaja's second century in the fourth Test, Australia declared early on 265/6 in 68.5 overs, giving England a 388-run target to win. At stumps on Day 4, England were 30 for no loss. The day again belonged to 35-year-old Khawaja as he joined just five other Australian batters to score twin tons in a single Ashes Test. Hitting 10 fours and two sixes with a mix of touch and occasional force in his 138-ball essay, Khawaja made runs through an array of shots all around the wicket. Bereft of ideas in response, England's plans against him brought little success, with a number of sweeps and reverse sweeps adding to a host of drives through the cover region, as well as his trademark pull shot. Coming in at 68/3, Khawaja at first provided a mix of stability and proactivity, after the hosts made a slight stumble earlier in the day, trying to accelerate. David Warner (3) and Marnus Labuschagne (29) both fell to Mark Wood (2/65) who was the pick of the quick bowlers, with the under-pressure Marcus Harris unable to convert his start of 27 into a bigger score. Harris fell to Jack Leach who finished with figures of 4/84, though a pair of Leach's wickets came in the final moments of Australia's innings, as they made a late scamper with the bat. Only recalled after Travis Head tested positive for COVID-19, Khawaja was joined by Cameron Green in a partnership of 179 from just 238 balls, as the pair bludgeoned the opposition to all corners of the ground. Green was seemingly freed by the match situation, and posted 74, his second Test half-century. Interestingly, his other Test fifty was made at the same ground last year against India. Having scored 137 in the first innings, Khawaja finished unbeaten after the fall of Green and Alex Carey first ball, making back-to-back centuries for the first time in his first-class career. He joins compatriots Doug Walters and Ricky Ponting as the only players to score centuries in both innings of a Test at the SCG, the first to do so in an Ashes series. He also accompanies Steve Smith, Matthew Hayden, Steve Waugh, Arthur Morris and Warren Bardsley as the only Australian men to record twin tons in Ashes history. In response, Zak Crawley made 22 not out in the final hour of play, and will be joined by Haseeb Hameed (8 not out) when play resumes on Sunday.","pubDate":"2022-01-08 18:38:16","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/01/08/500x300_1172355-usman-khawaja.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia"},{"title":"Ashes, 4th Test, Day 5, Australia vs England Live Cricket Updates","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ashes-4th-test-day-5-australia-vs-england-live-cricket-updates-2697281","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ashes, 4th Test, Day 5, Australia vs England Live Cricket Updates: Australia will look to take a 4-0 lead in the Ashes when play resumes on the fifth day of the fourth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-08 18:21:19","full_description":"Ashes, 4th Test, Day 5, Australia vs England Live Cricket Updates: Australia will look to take a 4-0 lead in the Ashes when play resumes on the fifth day of the fourth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday. England were 30/0 at stumps on the fourth day, chasing a total of 388 to win. Earlier, Usman Khawaja scored his second century of the match to place Australia in a commanding position. The Pakistan-born Khawaja has been in imperious form in his comeback from a 30-month Test exile, hitting 137 in the first innings before adding an unbeaten 101 to break English hearts. His domineering 179-run partnership with youngster Cameron Green set up a late declaration and left a beleaguered England having to defy history with a formidable target of 388. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) Right then. This is the game. 98 overs. 10 wickets. A bit of wet weather. How will Sunday pan out? The first ball will be bowled at 4.30 am IST (2300 GMT), WEATHER PERMITTING. But our buildup will begin well in advance. So do tune in early then. In the meanwhile, you can catch all the action from the Big Bash and also the first ODI between West Indies and Ireland. Also, Sunday marks the opening day of the second New Zealand-Bangladesh Test and as per the instagram post by the Black Caps, one can hardly differentiate between the grass on the pitch and beside. Enjoy the carnival of cricket but do remember to catch the fifth day's action here and see if we get a good game of cricket. ADIOS! TAKE CARE! All is not gloomy for England, though. They may not be in a position to win this game but certainly can make a statement with a solid batting display in the fourth innings. They will hope for some help from the weather but would ideally prefer to get the draw by grinding it out, than by luck. They have begun well, with Adam Gilchrist informing on air that this is the best opening stand for England in the series! That ends a mixed day of cricket. Australia began well, dismissing England off quickly but then the visitors fought back with the ball, taking 4 wickets reasonably quickly. However, the Khawaja-Green stand just pushed the English out of the Test. He does survive! Length and on off, this one shapes back in a touch. Crawley looks to defend but it goes off the inner half to square leg. THAT WILL BE STUMPS ON DAY 4! A single which means Hameed has done his job for the day! Shorter and on the pads, Hameed nudges it on the leg side for one. Crawley will face the last ball of the day. Two! Hameed wanted two there! On the pads, this is worked through square leg for a couple. It has gone dark and the umpires are having a quick discussion. Play on for now. Three balls played, three to go! On the stumps, it is played back to the bowler. Yet again on a length and outside off, it is left alone. Good length and on off, at 140 KPH. defended. That is brilliantly taken! Down the leg side, Crawley looks to flick but misses. This one seams away further. Carey dives and takes it with one hand. The crowd gets excited but the Australians are rushing to the other end as they want another one to be bowled. Outside off, Crawley shoulders arms to this one. Outside off, left alone. On middle, Crawley blocks. Another delivery outside off, left alone. EDGY FOUR! That is a nasty delivery! First ball to misbehave in this innings! Fortune favors Crawley. This is also the highest opening stand for England in this series. Length and on off, this one takes off after landing. Crawley looks to defend but it hits the shoulder and over the slip cordon. Warner hares after it and then dives but his effort goes in vain. Good shot but only one! Fuller and on off, this is driven nicely but Lyon at mid off dives to his left, makes a half stop. Keeps it to one. Outside off, left alone. Just outside off yet again, another very good leave by Crawley. That one skid through nicely! Outside off, left alone. Crawley lets it be. That slapped into Carey's gloves.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-01/k2pk5j6o_ashes-afp_625x300_08_January_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"New Zealand vs Bangladesh, 2nd Test, Day 1 Live Cricket Score Updates","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/new-zealand-vs-bangladesh-2nd-test-day-1-live-cricket-score-updates-2697269","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand vs Bangladesh, 2nd Test, Day 1 Live Cricket Score Updates: Bangladesh's young guns will look to disprove talk of Hagley Oval being a graveyard for visiting teams in the second Test against...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-08 18:07:02","full_description":"New Zealand vs Bangladesh, 2nd Test, Day 1 Live Cricket Score Updates: Bangladesh's young guns will look to disprove talk of Hagley Oval being a graveyard for visiting teams in the second Test against New Zealand in Christchurch starting Sunday.

New Zealand also have the additional incentive of providing a victorious farewell for senior batsman Ross Taylor in his final Test before retiring from international cricket. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) There is something about underdogs emerging victorious against an overwhelming favourite opponent. New Zealand are the World Test Champions and are playing their best cricket across formats for the last few years. So, when the first Test started of this two-match Test series against Bangladesh everyone expected New Zealand to roll over Bangladesh without breaking much sweat. Instead, Bangla Tigers ended New Zealand’s 17-match unbeaten run in home Tests. There were many other records broken on the way as Bangladesh won their first-ever game against New Zealand across formats on New Zealand soil. They have taken 1-0 lead over New Zealand in this two-match series and are in with a great chance to level the series. It will not be an easy task though as Kiwis will be eyeing a strong comeback as action now moves to Christchurch for the second and the final Test of this series. Ross Taylor will be playing his final Test match and we can expect him and other Kiwi players to come out all guns blazing to level the series and give a fitting send-off to one of their greatest players of all time. Bangladesh outplayed New Zealand in both batting and bowling departments in the first Test as New Zealand’s dangerous four-pronged bowling attack failed to make an impact. Their batting too after a brilliant century by Devon Conway in the first innings crumbled in pressure in the second innings. Bangladesh batting has been a problem for them for quite a long time now but almost everyone contributed in the first Test match with four batters getting fifty in the first innings. One of the, most critical parts of winning a Test match is taking 20 wickets and Bangladesh bowlers delivered with Ebadot Hossain taking a six-wicket haul in New Zealand’s second innings. The victory in the first Test can be the start of a new era in Bangladesh’s Test cricket history and a series victory here will go a long way in taking Bangladesh cricket to new heights. Can they get their first-ever series victory on New Zealand soil? Or will New Zealand bounce back to level the series on their home turf? Either way, we can expect some riveting Test cricket at Hagley Oval in the second and the final Test of this series.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-01/hj80td7_ban-nz-afp_625x300_08_January_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"BCCI may consider reducing venues for India-WI series due to rising COVID-19 cases","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/bcci-may-consider-reducing-venues-for-india-wi-series-due-to-rising-covid-19-cases-2022-01-08-753449","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rapidly rising COVID-19 cases across the country may force the BCCI to reduce the number of venues for the upcoming white-ball series against the West Indies but the cricket body has not yet formally discussed options.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-08 17:10:12","full_description":"Rapidly rising COVID-19 cases across the country may force the BCCI to reduce the number of venues for the upcoming white-ball series against the West Indies but the cricket body has not yet formally discussed options. The third wave of coronavirus is fast gripping the country and several states have introduced curbs, including weekend lockdowns, to prevent the spread of infection. India will host West Indies for six white-ball games -- three ODIs and as many T20Is -- at six venues, starting with the first 50-over match at Ahmedabad on February 6. \"Nothing has been decided as of now. This is a fluid situation and we are keeping an eye on the situation, and we will take a call at appropriate time,\" a senior BCCI official told PTI. Apart from Ahmedabad, the other venues which are scheduled to host the matches are Jaipur (February 9), Kolkata (February 12), Cuttack (February 15) Visakhapatnam (February 18) and Thiruvananthapuram (February 20). Given the current COVID situation in the country, the Board might look to host the six games at three centres to avoid too much travelling as it might make the players vulnerable to infections. The West Indies team is scheduled to undergo a three-day isolation after landing in Ahmedabad on February 1. There will be practice sessions on February 4 and 5 before the action begins with the first ODI at Motera on February 6. The BCCI was recently forced to postpone major domestic tournaments including Ranji Trophy and the Col CK Naidu Trophy due to a surge in COVID-19 cases across the country.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"“The only person that can take over is Ben Stokes”: Ricky Ponting reckons Ben Stokes as candidate for England Test captain in near future","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-the-only-person-that-can-take-over-is-ben-stokes-ricky-ponting-reckons-ben-stokes-as-candidate-for-england-test-captain-in-near-future/","keywords":["Cricket","Ashes","Ben Stokes","Ricky Ponting"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ricky Ponting reckons Ben Stokes as the most potential candidate to take over as England’s Test team captain after Joe Root.

Cometh the New Year, England team’s misfortunes keeps getting caught up in a never-ending spiral, carrying on with the old year misery and woes refusing to heal. On the back of back-to-back centuries in a single Test coming from Usman Khawaja’s bat, the Aussies move one step further towards a likely 5-0 whitewash in the ongoing Ashes Test series, with the 4th Test match underway at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Australians aged 35+ to have scored two centuries in a Test: Don Bradman Usman Khawaja#Ashes — Adam Burnett (@AdamBurnett09) January 8, 2022 With a touch over 10 Overs remaining in the 4th day’s play, Australia, declaring at 265/6 had set an improbable 388-run target for Joe Root’s men to open their account in the series. Although the pair of Zak Crawley (22*) and Haseeb Hameed (8*) managed to survive the 11 Overs they batted during the fag end of the day, the most they can do now is manage a Draw. Decorated former Aussie skipper Ricky Ponting, post the day’s play reflected on Joe Root’s Test captaincy future, and was of the view that Root’s further continuation as England’s Test captain would wear him down. Ricky Ponting reckons Ben Stokes as the most potential candidate The 47-year-old reckons star England all-rounder Ben Stokes as the most suitable replacement for Joe Root as England’s Test captain as in the best interest of the team going forward. “The only person that can take over is Ben Stokes. I think Stokes would actually grow as a player if he was the captain of that side. I think with a bit of extra responsibility, he might become an even better player and that might have a good impact on the rest of the team,” Ponting was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. “You’ll find instances right the way through even with top-order batters where it hasn’t worked. It just sits well with some and doesn’t with others. I don’t know Ben Stokes that well, but if I was trying to change the face of English cricket and trying to give a bit more of a heartbeat and a bit more soul, then I think he’d be the one that I’d be looking at to lead the team. Even with what we saw yesterday, to stand up under that much physical pain says a lot about him, and his teammates will thrive off that. Anyone that plays underneath him, I’m sure will grow an arm and a leg,” Ponting further added. Stokes, alongside Jonny Bairstow (113) had managed to notch up his half-century with a 91-ball 61 in the first innings, despite having suffered a side injury towards his left while bowling earlier, to pull England out of yet another collapse with the team down to 36/4 at one point in time. Ponting further warned Root that continuing as Test captain after the ongoing Ashes could wear him down, drawing parallels with the final days of his own captaincy stint and Root’s current scenario. “I just think it’s going to grind him down. Even looking back on my career, I played a couple of years longer — and potentially even captained a couple of years longer — than I should have. The challenge just gets harder and harder, and it weighs you down.”     The post “The only person that can take over is Ben Stokes”: Ricky Ponting reckons Ben Stokes as candidate for England Test captain in near future appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-08 17:08:37","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Cricket South Africa Refuses To Give NOC To Players For PSL","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/cricket-south-africa-refuses-to-give-noc-to-players-for-psl-2697087","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Proteas players will not be able to participate in the upcoming Pakistan Super League (PSL) as NOCs for South African cricketers have been rejected to prioritise domestic tournaments.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-08 16:08:49","full_description":"Proteas players will not be able to participate in the upcoming Pakistan Super League (PSL) as NOCs for South African cricketers have been rejected to prioritise domestic tournaments.

There's the odd spot there, which is horrible. It's just taking off and smacking you. It's only here and there, and you hope you can get out of the way of it or hit the gloves or something. It will be interesting to see how tomorrow plays out.\" \"Fingers-crossed, we get some good weather because we probably need all those 98 overs that we have It's going to be a bit of a grind, but I think if we can keep on that grind for long enough and just keep asking questions over and over and over again.

Post the Ashes series which culminates with the 5th Test at Hobart on January 18, the team will have to immediately brace itself for three ODIs and a T20I against New Zealand, followed by five-match T20I series against Sri Lanka that ends on February 20.

With Australia currently leading the Ashes Test 3-0, and managing to retain the coveted urn, Dodemaide has made an impressive debut yet again for Australia, although as a national selector this time around. The 58-year-old had smashed a half-century and also picked up a six-fer in his maiden appearance in Test for Australia during the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in 1987. Moreover, he had also picked up a five-wicket haul in his ODI debut against Sri Lanka at the WACA in January 1988. In totality, he played a total of 10 Test matches and 24 ODIs for Australia at the highest level. As far as the other two selectors are concerned, the 39-year-old George Bailey currently heads the three-person selection panel, having taken up the role in February 2020. He has played a total of 90 ODIs in Australian colours and has amassed a total of 3044 runs at an average of 40.58. He has also featured in 30 T20Is from 2012-2017, scoring 473 runs at an average of 24.89. The third member in the panel is Australia’s current head coach Justin Langer.

After a full eight players debuted on Thursday night in a loss against the Melbourne Renegades, there was another fresh face in Saturday night’s clash with the Hobart Hurricanes – and the Aussie mystery spinner had Michael Vaughan raving. Watch every game of the KFC Big Bash League Live & On-Demand on Kayo or catch up for FREE with minis on Kayo Freebies. Join Kayo Now > 24-year-old Paddy Dooley, a former Australian under-16 representative, opened the bowling for the Heat as they tried to defend their total of 144. And it didn’t take long for the left arm spinner to stun Fox Cricket’s commentary team. Mark Howard said as Dooley opened the innings: “Paddy Dooley on debut, arms everywhere – that’ll be difficult to see exactly what’s going on. Bit of a windmill style operation.” Michael Vaughan replied: “I like that, I like that a lot. My favourite, Peter Hatzoglou, he’s got a few arms going. He’s washing the windows!” ‘What’s he doing? Bless his soul’: Symonds in stitches after hilarious run-out Thunder claim humiliating 129-run win over woeful ‘Gades after star’s best-ever knock Vaughan added: “I like this kid already … Just watch the way he holds it (the ball) out in front of him there, it’s like Jonny Wilkinson with a drop kick!” “It’s a lot like Jonny Wilkinson,” Howard replied, before Dooley nearly had Ben McDermott caught out on his third ball after McDermott sent one flying into the open field. “Where’s Patty Dooley been?” Michael Hussey asked. “Look at us, we’re glued to this!” “This is a tremendous start,” Vaughan said. Mark Howard said: “He’s listed as a left arm orthodox,” but Vaughan laughed as he replied: “He’s never been orthodox. There’s no orthodoxy about this action!” Vaughan continued: “Just look at the grip here … he’s gripping that with the middle finger. You just don’t see that in cricket!” And when asked to explain what Dooley was bowling, Vaughan added: “I’ve got no clue. He’s arms everywhere, he’s like doing a trick!” Dooley conceded just three off his first over, and four runs off his second over later in the innings. His third over was the 11th of the innings, and he had McDermott – then having reached his half-ton – nearly out once again only for the ball to be dropped in the deep. He finished with figures of 0-25 from four overs. Confusion cost Thunder easy run-out | 00:31 It wasn’t just the commentators who couldn’t understand Dooley’s bowling, with fresh teammate Jake Lehmann revealing he was similarly stumped by the confusing action. Lehmann, who was another recent call-up in the wake of the Covid-19 wave of cases at the club, said: “We went down to Geelong and had a net (session) beforehand (prior to Thursday’s clash). I was absolutely rattled for my first half a dozen balls. He just kind of flicks them out the front.” Lehmann said being one of the many last-minute arrivals to the team was a rollercoaster experience. “It’s been a crazy couple of days for a few of us out here,” he said, and later added: “I’ve learned a lot about other players I never would have even known about.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"Danushka Gunathilaka, 30, retires from Test cricket","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/danushka-gunathilaka-30-retires-from-test-cricket/article38187941.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["PTI"],"video_url":null,"description":"The left-handed batsman wants to focus on the shorter formats","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-08 12:17:51","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu"},{"title":"Over rate new ICC T20 rules: What is the over rate new rule in T20 cricket?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-over-rate-new-icc-t20-rules-what-is-the-over-rate-new-rule-in-t20-cricket/","keywords":["Cricket","ICC","T20I"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Over rate new ICC T20 rules: Fielding teams will now be imposed with a penalty if they don’t complete their overs in a stipulated time period.

For a format which was brought into play to reduce the otherwise prolonged duration of a cricket match, even T20Is had started to become a victim of slow over rates in the lately. Considering a growth in this tendency of fielding teams not caring about the over rate in a T20I, ICC (International Cricket Council) have now introduced curbs to ensure that teams complete their quota of 20 overs within a stipulated time. Any team which will fail to do so will be handed with an in-game penalty which will take away the cushion of having five fielders outside the 30-yard circle in the 20th over. In simple words, defaulting teams will have a fielder less on the boundary in the last over of an innings which has it in it to turn the tables in a T20I. Over rate new ICC T20 rules The new rule, which will be valid for both men’s and women’s T20Is from the one-off T20I between West Indies and Ireland on January 17, will require teams to start their 20th over by the 85th minute of an uninterrupted innings. In case of innings where there will be interruptions (minor due to injury/DRS or major due to weather), the deadline will be adjusted accordingly and will be informed to the fielding captain. The third umpire will be responsible for noting the time taken by a team to complete an innings. “In delayed or interrupted matches where there has been a reduction of 3 or more overs the fielding side shall be in position to bowl the first ball of the penultimate over of the innings by the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time for the innings,” the ICC said in a statement. Very interesting (and imo good) to see the ICC go the T20 Blast way for over rate penalties. One fielder less if the rate is slow. The Blast is one of the quickest T20 comps worldwide, perhaps because of the penalties they have: in game rather than match fee cuts after the game. pic.twitter.com/ZSZ9DPw5I7 — Snehal Pradhan #MaskUp (@SnehalPradhan) January 7, 2022 In addition to this over rate, ICC have also introduced an optional 150-second drinks break right at the middle of an innings. The same will be discussed by teams before the start of a series.

Another intriguing Day 5 of a Test match awaits fans all across the world as Australia and England will lock horns with all three results possible at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Chasing a 388-run target, England need as many as 358 more runs to win with 10 wickets in hand. Agreed that an English victory is the least possible of all the results, a record-breaking chase will perform a hat-trick as far as weaker teams winning Test matches in 2022 is concerned. Australia, who couldn’t manage to make early inroads in the 11 overs that they bowled on Day 4, would be keen to win their fourth match in a row especially after recovering from a far lesser position of strength on the back of a 179-run partnership for the fifth wicket between batter Usman Khawaja (101*) and all-rounder Cameron Green (74) Weather forecast for Sydney Sydney, which has managed to host a fascinating Test match so far despite poor weather predictions for a majority of days, might not be able to be as conducive for play tomorrow as it has been till now. According to AccuWeather, the morning session itself has a 51% rain probability which makes a strong case for interruptions between play. The number is expected to remain almost the same in the second session as well. While the evening session will also be played under a cloud cover, the rain probability is likely to drop around 30% towards the evening. One of many @FoxCricket #Ashes montages but this is one of my favs. Just a guy with tremendous perspective, feeling grateful for his opp @Uz_Khawaja While it’s come v Eng, I’m sure you can appreciate how much he’s loving being out there.

Stokes suffered a side strain in the current Sydney test while Bairstow, who smashed the only century by an England batsman in the series, and Jos Buttler sustained painful blows to their fingers while batting. All three had scans on Saturday but caretaker coach Graham Thorpe said the trio would bat on Sunday when the visitors, set a daunting target of 388, begin day five on 30 for no loss at the Sydney Cricket Ground. \"I'm sure the lads will take whatever they need to take to get themselves in a position where they're capable of performing tomorrow,\" Thorpe, in charge while head coach Chris Silverwood completes his COVID-19 isolation, told reporters. \"So they'll all bat and they will do their very best.\" England have already added Sam Billing to their squad and Thorpe confirmed the uncertainty around the availability of the injured trio. \"It's possible (that the three players could miss the next test), but we will be assessing all of that at the end of the game. \"Obviously, Sam has been called into the group and that’s obviously a good indicator of some of the concerns we have with the injuries.\" England will have to conjure something special to deny Australia a 4-0 lead in the five-test series and Thorpe said the batsmen should take a leaf out of Bairstow's brave first-innings hundred despite a thumb injury. \"...for players to be able to stay in the team as well, you have to perform,\" the former test player said. \"Jonny played fantastically well showing great courage and skill.

The 35-year-old left-hander came into the Australia XI for the fourth Test after Travis Head tested positive for Covid-19 and having already marked his first Test since August 2019 with a century in the first innings, he followed it up with an unbeaten 101 on day four in the second. Having set England an improbable 388 to win, Australia need 10 wickets on the last day to take a 4-0 series lead but regardless of the outcome, Khawaja does not anticipate featuring in Hobart next week. \"At the moment I'm quite resigned to the fact that I'll probably miss out,\" he said. \"That's just from talking to [head selector] George Bailey about continuity. That's important, I'm not totally against that process. \"I felt like throughout my career, a lot of changes were made and I was on the wrong side of them so I'm the first to say that I think there needs to be structure and stability. \"I actually like the processes that the selectors have been taking throughout the series so at the moment I'm not really expecting to play the next match.\" Despite spending the first three Tests on the sidelines and carrying drinks, Khawaja has shown few signs of rustiness across his two innings, appearing in complete control as he notched his ninth and 10th red-ball centuries for Australia. \"This game is not easy, you don't always get games like these, back-to-back hundreds, I wasn't supposed to be playing this game either,\" he told BT Sport . \"Fortune had it that I was in for Heady and it's amazing how it's worked out. I couldn't have written it better myself.\" Graham Thorpe admits he does not know whether Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow or Jos Buttler will be fit for England's Ashes finale in Hobart. All three sustained painful injuries during a taxing fourth Test in Sydney, with Stokes awaiting scan results on a side problem while Buttler (left index finger) and (Bairstow (right thumb) both fear that X-rays will confirm fractures. The trio will all be needed to dig deep and help their team scrap for a draw on day five, with England facing the prospect of 98 overs at the crease when they resume on 30 without loss and 358 adrift. But for one, two or all three of them, whatever effort they give could be their last contribution of the campaign. Sam Billings has already been added to the squad as wicketkeeping cover for Buttler and Bairstow, with Saturday's emergency stand-in Ollie Pope and Dan Lawrence also waiting in the wings. Assistant coach Thorpe, who is leading the squad while Chris Silverwood completes his Covid-19 isolation, said: \"We've obviously got some blows. It's possible [they will miss the final Test] but we will be assessing all of that at the end of the game. \"Obviously, Sam has been called into the group and that's obviously a good indicator of some of the concerns we have with the injuries. \"But I am sure the lads will take whatever they need to take to get themselves in a position where they are capable of performing on the final day. They will all bat and they will all do their very best, I know that. \"At the end of the game we have to assess who is potentially going to be available. With Stokes, his injury is not a great one being an all-rounder.\"","image_url":"https://e1.365dm.com/22/01/1920x1080/skysports-usman-khawaja-australia_5635549.jpg?20220108034056","source_id":"skysports"}]}
