LSG managed 153 for 8 before their bowlers rallied to restrict Punjab to 133 for eight. \"I was disappointed and fuming at the end of the first innings. Stupid cricket with the bat,\" Rahul said at the post match presentation. \"We need to get better with the bat. Half-time, when Quinny (de Kock) and Deepak (Hooda) were batting. They paced it really really well to get to 60 in 9 overs on a tricky wicket. Had we batted smartly, we could have gotten to 180-190. \"I think we just need to be smarter in reading the game. If we could have not played too many shots we could have done better. We have been good on the field and good with the ball. Just need to keep repeating the good things.\" After an underwhelming show with the bat, LSG bowlers put up a spirited display as pacer Dushmantha Chameera (2/17) and Krunal Pandya (2/11) grabbed two wickets each. \"The way we responded with the ball was phenomenal. Krunal has been brilliant throughout the tournament. This season he has really worked on his bowling. Bowling economically is important but he has been giving us two, three wickets in the middle overs,\" Rahul added. Meanwhile, a disappointed Punjab Kings skipper Mayank Agarwal rued the dismal batting effort. \"I think we just kept losing wickets. We had batsmen who were set and we kept getting out. So many soft dismissals for us. It is disappointing and we have to face the truth. We didn't bat well enough and we were below par with the bat.\" Our code of editorial values Printable version | Apr 30, 2022 4:14:03 am | https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2022-we-played-stupid-cricket-with-the-bat-says-lucknow-captain-kl-rahul/article65369371.ece ¬© THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Faf du Plessis vs Rashid Khan IPL record: Rashid Khan vs RCB record and Faf du Plessis at Brabourne Stadium stats","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-faf-du-plessis-vs-rashid-khan-ipl-record-rashid-khan-vs-rcb-record-and-faf-du-plessis-at-brabourne-stadium-stats/","keywords":["Cricket","Gujarat Titans","IPL 2022","RCB","Faf Du Plessis","GT","Indian Premier League","rashid khan","Royal Challengers Bangalore"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Faf du Plessis vs Rashid Khan: The captain of Royal Challengers Bangalore and vice-captain of Gujarat Titans will be locking horns for the seventh time in T20s.

It is worth mentioning that this will be only the third time (after 2009 and 2014) when Sharma will be playing an IPL match on his birthday.

Over the fielder and a boundary! A good way to get off the mark and that is how Bhanuka Rajapaksa will play. He will go for it! steps out and gets to the pitch of the ball, hits it over covers for a boundary. 6.4 overs (0 Run) Fuller and on off, Bhanuka Rajapaksa pushes it back to the bowler. Bishnoi fumbles but no run. Bhanuka Rajapaksa is the new batter in. 6.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! TIMBER! That is a huge, huge wicket. Shikhar Dhawan's struggle ends. He was the man in-form for Punjab and he is now dismissed! This is full and on middle, Dhawan looks to sweep but the length is not right. It is way too full. It goes under the bat and the middle pole is uprooted. All those dots by Dhawan probably led to his wicket. He was under the pump and looked to target Bishnoi. Probably picked the wrong bowler. 6.2 overs (0 Run) Another dot! Fuller and on off, Dhawan plays it to the right of the bowler. 6.1 overs (0 Run) A very quick full toss on off, Dhawan mistimes it to covers. Ravi Bishnoi comes into the attack now. 5.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Thumped down the ground! The last ball spoils the over totally! A poor ball to end! Short and outside off, Bairstow slaps it past mid off and this races away to the fence. A decent Powerplay for Punjab, they are 46 for 1 after the first 6. Another 108 needed in 84. 5.5 overs (0 Run) Yet again, does not time it that well! Shorter and outside off, Jonny Bairstow looks to cut but it goes off the underedge towards cover. 5.4 overs (1 Run) On the pads, Dhawan looks to flick but misses, it hits the pad and rolls on the leg side. A leg bye taken. 5.3 overs (1 Run) Good length and on off, Jonny Bairstow opens the face of the bat and guides it down to third man for one. 5.2 overs (0 Run) Length and outside off, Jonny Bairstow slaps it but to covers. 5.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! That races away to the fence! Fortunate boundary! Shorter and outside off, Jonny Bairstow slashes at it, it goes off the outside edge, just wide of the first slip fielder and into the third man fence.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637868673549414165.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: Cheteshwar Pujara Scores 3rd Consecutive Century In County Cricket","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/cheteshwar-pujara-scores-3rd-consecutive-century-in-county-cricket-watch-2933118","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cheteshwar Pujara carried on his stellar form in the County Championship for Sussex as he brought up a third consecutive century.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-29 16:17:33","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-04/5kduv688_cheteshwar-pujara_625x300_18_April_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄúThis guy is a Test bowler‚Äù: Kevin Pietersen makes case for Umran Malik‚Äôs Test debut during England tour after remarkable IPL 2022 for SRH","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-this-guy-is-a-test-bowler-kevin-pietersen-makes-case-for-umran-maliks-test-debut-during-england-tour-after-remarkable-ipl-2022-for-srh/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Sunrisers Hyderabad","Indian Premier League","IPL","kevin pietersen","Umran Malik"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kevin Pietersen makes case for Umran Malik‚Äôs Test debut for India after yet another impressive display of fast bowling in IPL 2022.

Joining the list was former England skipper Kevin Pietersen, who, impressed with his remarkable aforementioned five-fer against GT, went on to make a case for his Test debut for India against England in July this year. ‚ÄúI think so [on playing Umran]. I‚Äôm playing him. I‚Äôm gonna be calling that Test match, and he better be playing,‚Äù Pietersen remarked on Star Sports. Pietersen further asserted that no batter in the world likes to face the pace at which Umran bowls and that the Indian team could well build their fast-bowling around the 22-year-old quick. ‚ÄúJust have a look at some of the great sides, some of the great Australian sides that we‚Äôve played against, [they had] the Brett Lees, the Mitchell Johnsons. This guy is a Test bowler, no one likes to face this [pace]. ‚ÄúLook at those figures, 5-25, the best figures in this year‚Äôs IPL. You can bowl him for an over, bowl him for two overs, bowl him for three overs. Let him run in, bowl around him. Build your fast-bowling around him,‚Äù Pietersen further added.

Dhawan had sported the headgear in his first match of IPL 2022 against Chennai Super Kings on Sunday. The Himachal Pradesh captain had suffered a blow on the face in a Ranji Trophy match following which he had to undergo surgery and decided to wear the face shield to prevent further injury. What's more dangerous than a lion?. #SherSquad , tune in to this video to find out the reason behind @rishid100 's initial absence & how he is all set for a roaring comeback now #SaddaPunjab #PunjabKings #IPL2022 # #RishiDhawan pic.twitter.com/mnKKULSSrz \"I felt very happy when I saw that Punjab Kings had bid for me. I feel good coming back to Punjab Kings because I've been a player here for four years and I've come back for my fifth year. I have a lot of memories of when I was here last time and I hope we do one better than the loss in the IPL 2014 final this year. I'm making an IPL comeback after four (six) years so it was a little disheartening when I got injured in the Ranji Trophy. I had to go through surgery which ruled me out of the first four matches but I'm totally fine and available for selection now. I've been training hard and hope to have a strong comeback. \"It was absolutely a low phase for me because I had worked so hard to make a comeback and I finally got a chance in the IPL after four (six) years. I performed well in domestic cricket. I tried continuously for three to four years to make a comeback so I was a little scared wondering whether I would miss out on playing due to my injury. But this happens in cricket. Sometimes we are happy and other times we are sad. My experience has helped me realise that there will be ups and downs. I kept myself mentally strong thinking I would overcome this and make a good comeback. Everything has gone well till now. I have missed four games but I hope I prove myself whenever I get the chance and try to make a good comeback,\" Dhawan said. The 32-year-old is making his IPL comeback this season after six years, having last played a match in the marquee T20 league in 2016. Dhawan was roped in for Rs. 55 lakh by Punjab Kings at the IPL 2022 auctions and immediately made an impression, picking the wickets of Shivam Dube and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and returning figures of two for 39 in his quota of four overs.","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄúOne game I wouldn‚Äôt be wishing well for Mayank‚Äù: KL Rahul gives funny reply on playing vs Punjab Kings captain Mayank Agarwal in 2022 IPL","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-one-game-i-wouldnt-be-wishing-well-for-mayank-kl-rahul-gives-funny-reply-on-playing-vs-punjab-kings-captain-mayank-agarwal-in-2022-ipl/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Lucknow Super Giants","Punjab Kings","Indian Premier League","KL Rahul","LSG","Mayank Agarwal","PBKS"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"KL Rahul given funny reply: The star Indian batter is playing a match against Punjab Kings after as many as six years.

Why is Manish Pandey not playing vs Punjab Kings today? Unlike PBKS, Lucknow Super Giants have made a lone change to their Playing XI by bringing in fast bowler Avesh Khan for batter Manish Pandey. Readers must note that this is their first-ever match at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium. ‚ÄúWhen dew is not around, it‚Äôs quite an even game. It‚Äôs important for us to start well, really assess the conditions in the first couple of overs, set-up a really solid base and then enjoy our batting and explode. I have played here before, we‚Äôll have to bat smartly,‚Äù Rahul told Star Sports at the toss. Pandey, who has scored 88 runs in six innings this season at an average and strike rate of 14.66 and 110 respectively, appeared to be the likeliest of names to be left out (for the second time this season) when his team was looking to play an extra bowler at this particular venue. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a high boundary-scoring ground, one extra bowler would give more options. It‚Äôll be a good opportunity for Jason to bat at seven. Ideally wouldn‚Äôt want him to bat, but if he does, it‚Äôs a good opportunity to show his batting skills,‚Äù Rahul added. In his seven IPL 2022 matches, Avesh has picked 11 wickets at an average of 20.09, an economy rate of 8.28 and a strike rate of 14.5 to be LSG‚Äôs highest wicket-taker this season thus far.

On off, this is pushed to mid off for one. A much-needed over for Lucknow. 4.5 overs (1 Run) Hooda takes one! Length and on off, this one takes off after landing. It hits the splice of the bat as Hooda looks to drive, it goes to mid off for one. 4.4 overs (1 Run) Now takes one, good sensible batting! On middle, this is pushed down to mid on for one. 4.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! BANG! That is trademark de Kock! This is probably his favourite shot! This is shortish and on off, de Kock picks the length early and heaves it over the mid-wicket fence for a biggie. Two in a row and he has surely got going. 4.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! That has hit the fence on the full! Will this get de Kock going now? This is full and right in the slot, it is smashed down the ground, it hits the ropes on the full and it is the first biggie of the game. 4.1 overs (0 Run) De Kock is probably trying to hit the ball way too hard here! This is a full toss, a low one outside off. De Kock swings but it goes off the underedge and to the keeper. 4.1 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Good take in the end! This is well wide outside off, swings away further. De Kock goes after it but misses. 3.6 overs (0 Run) Yet another dot! Lucknow really struggling to get going here! Length and outside off, Hooda waits and then guides it but straight to short third man. 3.5 overs (1 Run) Just the single again! Length and on off, de Kock pushes it to mid off and gets to the other end. 3.4 overs (1 Run) Cracked away! There is a fielder in the deep though! Shorter and outside off, Hooda cuts it through point and takes one. 3.3 overs (1 Run) De Kock gets off strike! Shorter and outside off, this is cut to point for one. 3.2 overs (0 Run) That is yet another lovely delivery! Begins on middle and then moves away. De Kock looks to go downtown this time but is beaten. Some nice bounce for the bowlers. 3.1 overs (0 Run) Slashes but misses! This is wide outside off, room on offer. De Kock goes after it but misses. 2.6 overs (0 Run) A good delivery to welcome the new batter! Goes full and straight, on middle, this is pushed to mid on. End of a wicket-taking over from Rabada. Deepak Hooda walks out at number 3. 2.5 overs (0 Run) OUT! EDGED AND TAKEN! Rabada strikes in the Powerplay yet again and he gets the big fish, the in-form KL Rahul! Another beauty of a delivery. This starts on middle, it is angling in but then leaves the batter. Rahul is rooted to his crease and ends up pushing ahead of his body, this goes off the outside edge and it is a low catch taken by Sharma by diving to his right behind the sticks. Early wicket for Punjab, just the start they needed. 2.4 overs (0 Run) That is a good comeback! After serving a half volley on the last ball, Rabada bowls this one on a length and around middle, Rahul looks to defend but it goes off the outer half to short third man. 2.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! That is beautifully timed! Length and on off, shaping away. Rahul leans into it and creams it through covers for a boundary. 2.2 overs (1 Run) Probably de Kock was a little surprised there! This one is a full toss, Rabada was going for a yorker but end up bowling a full toss, de Kock is early in the flick, it goes off the inner half wide of mid on for one. 2.1 overs (1 Run) A quick run! On middle, Rahul pushes it to mid on for a single. 1.6 overs (0 Run) Looks to be innovative but it does not come off! This one is well wide outside off, de Kock looks to play the scoop on the leg side but misses by a long way. Really good start by Sandeep. 1.5 overs (0 Run) Really good five deliveries! Length and on off, de Kock pushes it to covers. 1.4 overs (0 Run) Leading edge but safe! This starts around the leg pole. Shapes away. De Kock looks to flick, it is against the swing, it goes off the leading edge but lands well short of point. 1.3 overs (1 Run) Rahul is off the mark! Length and on middle, this is pushed down to long on for one. 1.2 overs (0 Run) Slashes but misses! Outside off, shaping away. Rahul goes after it but no connection. 1.1 overs (1 Run) Some shape for Sandeep too! Fuller and around off, this one moves away. De Kock looks to drive, it goes off the outer half through point for one. Who will bowl from the other end? It will be Sandeep Sharma. 0.6 over (4 Runs) FOUR LEG BYES! Fails to end the over well! Ends up with one on the pads, Rahul does not put bat on ball but it hits the pad, goes past the keeper and into the fine leg fence. First boundary of the game. A steady start for Lucknow. 0.5 over (0 Run) Now gets this one to shape away! Length and on off, Rahul hangs back and defends. Can he end the over well now? 0.4 over (0 Run) Another loud appeal but it is probably going down leg! Yet again, Arshdeep Singh gets nice amount of movement into the right-hander. The line though is on the pads, Rahul looks to flick but misses to get hit on the pads. Sharma from behind the stumps indicates it is going down leg. 0.3 over (0 Run) Yet again, this one shapes back in nicely but the length is slightly short, on middle, Rahul has enough time to adjust and defend it. 0.2 over (0 Run) This one does come back in a touch! The line is a little too straight though. Rahul looks to flick but misses to get hit on the pads. 0.1 over (1 Run) De Kock and Lucknow are underway! Length and on off, shaping away. De Kock opens the face of the bat and guides it towards point for one. Time for the action to begin! The players make their way out to the middle. Quinton de Kock and KL Rahul are the openers for Lucknow. Arshdeep Singh has the new ball in hand. Here we go... Marcus Stoinis is up for a chat. He says he is looking forward to the game after a 5-day break. Mentions he bats when needed, they are still not sure about his best position. He adds he would love to bat up the order but he will bat wherever needed. Mentions the bowling is going good but not sure if he will be needed. Ends by saying, the wicket seems like it will have good bounce. KL Rahul says there has not been much dew and hence, it is an even game and whoever plays well, will win. States it is now about enjoying their batting and they need to bat smartly. Informs they have one change, Manish misses out and Avesh Khan comes in. Mayank Agarwal says they would want to know what they are chasing and informs they are playing the same team. Mentions the dew does not arrive and it is now more about trying to restrict them early and chase whatever they put up on board. Mentions the guys are quite flexible and if they win, then who plays and who does not is not an issue. Ends by saying he is looking forward to play against Rahul. LUCKNOW (PLAYING XI) - Quinton de Kock (WK), KL Rahul (C), Deepak Hooda, Marcus Stoinis, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Jason Holder, Dushmantha Chameera, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan (IN FOR Manish Pandey), Mohsin Khan. PUNJAB (PLAYING XI) - Mayank Agarwal (C), Shikhar Dhawan, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Jonny Bairstow, Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Rishi Dhawan, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Sandeep Sharma, Arshdeep Singh. TOSS - Punjab win the toss and ELECT TO FIELD! PITCH REPORT - Danny Morrison says the straighter boundaries are longer. Adds one needs to bowl length and probably short on this wicket and there is even covering of grass in that area and the pacers will love it. Lucknow have been really good so far. They sit in the top 4 with 5 games won and three lost out of the 8 they have played. Punjab on the other hand, have won and lost the same number of games. They have been a tad inconsistent so far but head into this game on the back of a good win. Can they continue the good work is what we will have to see. A win here will see them go level on points with the sides placed on 3rd and 4th. They'll have to play really well if they are to beat Lucknow. Toss and teams in a bit‚Ä¶ Three of the most successful franchise are struggling big time as Kolkata tasted yet another defeat at the hands of Delhi. It is a new day and two new teams will be facing of as the action shifts to Pune. It is a clash between the new entrants this year, Lucknow and Punjab. This promises to be an absolute cracker. ...

You can switch on the TV and watch him bat all day.\" Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan said the right-handed batter plays according to the situation. Irfan said, \"Lokesh Rahul is the batsman who can increase or decrease the striker rate according to the situation. He has the style, the elegance and aggression to build his innings the way he wants. Promoted \"He has a sound technique and a good temperament. He is gauging the situations and batting accordingly. Rahul knows very well when he needs to shift gears.\" (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/4b24gmpo_sunil-gavaskar_625x300_08_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are great players, they will get back in form: Sourav Ganguly","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/virat-kohli-and-rohit-sharma-are-great-players-they-will-get-back-in-form-sourav-ganguly-10614661.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are great players, they will get back in form: Sourav Ganguly","content":"Former India captain and BCCI president Sourav Ganguly has come out in support of batting stalwarts Virat Kohl and Rohit Sharma who are both struggling for runs in the ongoing IPL 2022.Current India skipper and Mumbai Indians captain Rohit has only accumulated 153 runs in eight matches so far at a dismal average of 19.13. Kohli had had an even worse run, with only 128 runs to his name in nine matches He has averaged 16.Ganguly, in an interview with News18, said that both Rohit and Kohli are players of high calibre and will soon be back in form.\"They are great players and I am sure they will get back in form. I hope they start scoring runs soon. I don‚Äôt know what is going on in Virat Kohli‚Äôs head but I am sure he will regain his form and get some good runs. He is a great player,\" Ganguly said.Kohli's form in particular has become a cause for major concern. The batter who ruled the batting charts for many years has not scored a competitive hundred since 2019. In this IPL, for the first time, he registered consecutive first-ball ducks in the cash-rich league.Many former cricketers including Ravi Sharti and Kevin Pietersen have adviced Kohli to take a break from the game to recharge his batteries, while Yuvraj Singh has asked him to get back to his old self to find his form back.Meanwhile, Ganguly also shared his opinion on the ongoing IPL and latest pace sensation Umran Malik.\"Oh, it‚Äôs very interesting, I am watching [the IPL]. Any team can win and everyone is playing well. The two new teams - Gujrat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants - are doing well. Umran Malik‚Äôs bowling has been eye-catching. Umesh Yadav too has bowled well and so has Khalil Ahmed. I would say Umran Malik has been the outstanding face of the league so far,\" Ganguly added.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPL Live Score, IPL 2022 schedule, IPL 2022 Points table and Entertainment News.

Both teams are coming into this contest with a win in their respective last matches. One of the biggest headaches for LSG is their No 3 position. No batter who has been tried so far in this slot - Evin Lewis and Manish Pandey - have performed as per expectations. @im_manishpandey back in the nets prepping for the next big day. #IPL2022 _ #bhaukaalmachadenge #lsg #LucknowSuperGiants #T20 #TataIPL #Lucknow #UttarPradesh #LSG2022 pic.twitter.com/mFw8lI8cZi ‚Äî Lucknow Super Giants (@LucknowIPL) April 27, 2022 Manish, in particular, has been struggling to get going, not being able to score runs with a healthy strike rate. Even in the last match, he scored a run-a-ball 22 which put extra pressure on KL Rahul. Problem with Manish at No 3 is that LSG then have two many anchors in their team. Rahul plays that role already and with Manish also playing cautiously or getting stuck at the crease, it affects the team's total at the end of the innings. The one good option in the team to replace Manish is Manan Vohra who is not new to IPL. He has played previously for RCB and PBKS. But has not got any chance so far at LSG. With Manish struggling for form, Vohra can be tried. The last call however is KL Rahul's.

Stokes was unveiled as Joe Root's successor on Thursday with England hoping for a turnaround in their test fortunes under the talismanic all-rounder. England won just one of their last 17 tests with Root at the helm, a run which included a 4-0 Ashes thrashing in Australia and a 1-0 series defeat in West Indies. \"The point is that Ben is his own man. He's driven, he's got a good cricket brain ...,\" Hussain wrote in his Daily Mail column. \"Ben will have to use his gut, and my only advice is that he shouldn't captain by committee. \"Sometimes with Root there was too much input from those off the field, so he never found a gut feel for tactics.\" Stokes has battled injuries in recent times and took a break last year to look after his mental health. Hussain said Rob Key, who was appointed the new managing director of England men's cricket earlier this month, would have to protect Stokes from burnout. \"Clearly, his workload will need managing. Key has to work out what, in golf terms, are his majors,\" added Hussain. \"For a team who have won just one out of 17 and are bottom of the World Test Championship, stringing together some victories is the No 1 priority.\" Hussain expected Stokes to either skip bilateral one-day series or play those purely as a batter \"Whatever happens, if he needs resting - and Stokes will have to be honest with Key and the selectors - then England should pay attention. \"There is no point bowling himself into the ground, which then affects the balance of the team. He should be England's fifth bowler, no more.\" Stokes begins his tenure with a two-test series against the country of his birth, New Zealand, in June.
