The South London venue has hosted over 100 Test matches in its rich history, and in June will welcome the top two Test sides in the ICC World Test Championship standings, which will compete for the ICC WTC Mace following two years of hard-fought competition. The ICC WTC Final is the pinnacle event in the Test calendar and is a week-long celebration of the longest format of the game. This Ultimate Test is the culmination of two years of intense competition in the ICC WTC, spanning 61 Test matches over 24 series played to date. While the two competing nations may not yet be known, there are a host of significant fixtures due to be played in the coming weeks to determine the finalists. Australia currently top the standings, with India in hot pursuit in second place, and both the teams go head-to-head across a four-Test series starting in Nagpur on Thursday. While six teams in total stand a chance of qualification, among the frontrunners to challenge the top two are Sri Lanka, who sit third in the standings and South Africa in fourth, who take on reigning WTC champions New Zealand and the West Indies respectively over two two-Test series during February and March. On the potential of securing their place at the showpiece event, Australia skipper Pat Cummins said, “The prospect of playing in the World Test Championship Final has been a big motivator for us over the last couple of years, more so now having missed out on over rates last time. “To play at a neutral venue like The Oval adds another element for both sides who make the Final. It’s exciting and has been a goal of ours for a while now. “We are confident we can secure a place while here in India after a really strong 12 months. The Final would be a great reward for the players and staff who have done so well.” India captain Rohit Sharma looks ahead to what could be a second successive WTC Final encounter. “Leading Team India out onto the field of play at the World Test Championship Final would be special,” he said. “We have grown and developed as a team during this competition and to be in with a chance of lifting the Mace at the Oval in June, we know we first need to overcome a tough Australia side. “There have been so many dramatic moments in Test cricket lately, and there are undoubtedly more to come. I am excited by the prospect of booking our place at the Final and hopefully creating history later in the year.” PTI WTC final to be held at The Oval from June 7 to 11: ICC added by Press Trust of India on 1:46 am February 9, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-02-08 20:16:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"This Aussie team doesn’t carry baggage of past: Pat Cummins","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/02/09/this-aussie-team-doesnt-carry-baggage-of-past-pat-cummins/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Nagpur: Australian cricket teams haven’t won a Test series in India for the past 19 years but current skipper Pat Cummins would tell anyone who cares to listen that his unit doesn’t carry the baggage of victories and defeats of his predecessors.

As Cummins leads Australia to one of its toughest assignments in India, the skipper also underlined the importance of a good first-innings score, which will be crucial in the context of the series. “No, this team is very different to a lot of the teams that have played here in the past. So we don’t carry the wins, we don’t carry the losses,” Cummins told reporters when asked if past results would weigh heavily on his mind. “We know it’s tough to tour here, India are a really good cricket side, especially at home, so we are excited. And, yeah, we will give it our best shot,” Cummins added. Asked about first-innings totals, the world’s premier speedster said,”Yeah, I think it’s more important here than anywhere else in the world, that first-innings lead, hopefully. You just got to find a way to put a big total on the board, especially thinking if it is going to spin, it’s going to get really hard in that second innings.”. The Australian media has already started raising a hue and cry about “doctored pitches” with one article in Sydney Morning Herald predicting the nature of the wicket even before a ball has been bowled on the VCA stadium track. Cummins, however, put things in perspective, saying his lineup being loaded with left-handers had prompted curators to dry areas where India’s right-hand seamers will create rough spots for the host spinners to exploit. “Potentially, yes. Looks a little bit dry for the left-handers and knowing how much traffic will probably go through there from the right-arm bowlers, potentially might be a fair bit of rough out there,” Cummins said. But unlike his country’s media, Cummins wants to embrace the challenge. “Again, that’s something we’ve just got to embrace. It’s going to be fun. It’s going to be challenging at times but our batters will relish the chance to problem-solve on their feet, and quite a few of them will get their chances to do that.” Cummins, however, didn’t want to predict a first-innings score. “You have got to bat big in the first innings. It might not be the same for every venue. At some, 250 might be a good score, there might be other venues where you might need 500. Reading the wicket can be a bit difficult at times but you have to be ready for everything.”. Cummins also made no bones about Nathan Lyon expected to bowl bulk of the overs during the series. “Nathan’s going to be right up there with our most important bowlers for this series. He’s got to bowl lots of overs, he’s got the experience here. He’s up for the challenge, he can’t wait. He’s been working with a lot of the other spin bowlers that are over here as well. He will lead our attack this series.” PTI This Aussie team doesn’t carry baggage of past: Pat Cummins added by Press Trust of India on 1:44 am February 9, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-02-08 20:14:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rilee Rossouw stars with bat and ball to power Pretoria Capitals into SA20 final","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/domestic/rilee-rossouw-stars-with-bat-and-ball-to-power-pretoria-capitals-into-sa20-final-baf4e0c7-33d9-4768-83f4-1dfb3a9c0217","keywords":null,"creator":["Zaahier Adams"],"video_url":null,"description":"Rilee Rossouw inspired Pretoria Capitals to an impressive win over Paarl Royals on Wednesday to book their spot in the SA20 final.","content":"Johannesburg — The Pretoria Capitals are the first team through to the inaugural Betway SA20 final. The Capitals held their nerve in the big moments during a tense first semi-final against the Paarl Royals to emerge victors by 29 runs at the Wanderers on Wednesday evening. The match was delayed by 35 minutes due to an earlier downpour, but that did nothing to stem the excitement inside the Bullring. Rilee Rossouw showed all his experience with 56 off 41 balls that helped the Capitals post 153/8. It was an uncharacteristic innings from the Proteas T20 top-order batter, but it was required under the circumstances. Rossouw played well within himself due to wickets falling around him and a surface that was not conducive to his regular free-flowing strokeplay. The Royals were disciplined in their efforts with the ball, particularly Proteas all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo, as he tore through the Capitals’ middle-order. Phehlukwayo picked up Jimmy Neesham (4) and Eathan Bosch (22) to follow up the good work of spinners Bjorn Fortuin (1/24) and Tabraiz Shamsi (2/19). Rossouw, though, absorbed the pressure before breaking free with a couple of clean strikes down the ground. Unfortunately just when Rossouw was about to cut loose, Phehlukwayo returned to attack to send the southpaw back to the pavilion. But the Capitals would still have believed that they had a defendable total at the interval. And so it proved with all the Capitals bowlers putting in a solid shift on the night. Eathan Bosch led the way by removing England international opener Jason Roy two balls into the run chase. Bosch went one better in the following over when he clean bowled the in-form Jos Buttler. The Royals were immediately on the back foot at 16/2 in the third over and they never quite recovered from the early setbacks. JP Duminy’s team continued to lose wickets at regular intervals despite being ahead of the run-rate and when Rossouw turned his arm over to claim Eoin Morgan’s scalp the challenge became even steeper. The Royals’ last hope was captain David Miller, and although the skipper struck a few lusty blows to keep his team in the contest, the challenge was ended with the return of Anrich Nortje at the death. The Capitals now await the winner of the second semi-final between Joburg Super Kings and the Sunrisers Eastern Cape on Thursday at Centurion to see who their opponents will be in Saturday’s final.

News24 Sport looks at how they went through their oscillations.","content":"The group stages of the first-ever SA20 are over, and they did not disappoint. Without looking at the points table, here's how News24 Sport judged the teams: The team that went according to form: Pretoria Capitals - FIRST The Capitals, under Wayne Parnell's sound leadership, sought destruction wherever they went on their way to finishing at the top. They were five points clear of the Joburg Super Kings and collected bonus points like they were going out of fashion. They were stymied by Johannesburg and Paarl, then unexpectedly humbled at home by Durban's Super Giants, but they always looked like the team to beat. They seemed to have the team for all conditions and this was proven by the fact that they won in Durban, Gqeberha and Cape Town, where the manner of their successes spoke to their adaptability. They had a measure of revenge when they beat the Paarl Royals by 59 runs on Tuesday, who had beaten them in Paarl, but they'll have to do it again on Wednesday when the sides meet at the Wanderers for what is sure to be a grudge match semi-final on Wednesday. Home bully boys: Joburg Super Kings - SECOND On the coast, they were dodgy, even though they won two from four. They were badly beaten by the Capitals, but take them to the Wanderers, and they play like bulls charging at a red flag at the Bullring. After their terrible loss to the Capitals at the halfway mark, their coach Stephen Fleming said they had a few things they needed to sort out, especially with their batting. They had a few home games to get that right and, largely through the free-scoring form of Faf du Plessis, they've made the Corlett Drive-based ground a hard one for visiting teams. They were the only side that didn't drop a home game in the tournament and deserve to host a semi-final, with the Sunrisers Eastern Cape being their opponents at SuperSport Park on Thursday. The team that's surprised: Sunrisers Eastern Cape - THIRD The feeling existed that the Gqeberha-based team wasn't strong from a recruitment perspective, but they were the perfect example of a team that moved between hot and cold. They were as unpredictable as the Gqeberha weather, winning games they were expected to lose and vice-versa. They brought the unpredictability factor to the tournament, and one could never know in which shade they would rock up for a particular fixture. Finishing third ahead of their more fancied coastal rivals was a testament to their resourceful cricket. However, they'll need to step up a gear to beat a Super Kings side that did the double over them in the round-robin stages. The tournament's joker in the pack: Paarl Royals - FOURTH The Paarl Royals looked like a team that could only really play their cricket in Paarl. The fact that the Royals only won in Paarl and Gqeberha spoke to how they armed their team for one set of conditions and not the other. It was similar to how formidable their parent team, the Rajasthan Royals, were in Jaipur, but toothless elsewhere. That said, they found a way to finish fourth and qualify for the semi-finals, even though they sneaked in despite a heavy loss to the Capitals on Tuesday. What they do have in their armour for Wednesday's semi-final is the dangerous Jos Buttler, but he'll need help from a batting group that while talented, hasn't always come off. The team that didn't fire consistently: Durban's Super Giants - FIFTH From being the first side to make a 200-plus total, to being the first side to make two consecutive sub-100 scores, to scoring the highest team total in the round-robin stage, they veered between the sublime and ridiculous. That told the story of a Super Giants side that, packed with all-rounders, found different ways to gel and come apart during the tournament. Their blistering defeat of the Capitals was one game where everything came together, but did so too late in the competition to have a material effect on the log. Two of their home wins out of the five came against Paarl Royal and MI Cape Town, with the weather intervening in the other game. They'll need to be smarter with their batting recruitment next season to complement their excellent bevy of all-rounders. The team that flopped badly: MI Cape Town - SIXTH The less said about MI Cape Town, the better. On paper, they looked like a very competent side, but when it came to translating that to performance, that wasn't the case. They seemed to be a side that picked Highveld batters for coastal combat, and this showed up badly before the tournament moved up to the Highveld. They had the all-conditions bowlers, but what they didn't have were the all-conditions batters to navigate what were tricky coastal pitches that proved to be their undoing. The crowd that mattered - Gqeberha The whistle-podu of the Wanderers suited the imposing nature of the ground while the laid-back nature of SuperSport Park and Newlands meant the crowds were always more engaged in the game and the catching. Kingsmead's fans finally made some cricket sense to watch games there while Paarl's heat made things uncomfortable for their fans. St George's Park was an Orange-coloured cauldron from start to finish and it was quite the ground to watch the cricket. The band created an unmatchable atmosphere that was also accompanied by some excellent cricket despite the assortment of surfaces. It pumped from start to finish and the weather also played ball, something that can’t always be said of Gqeberha.","pubDate":"2023-02-08 18:14:34","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Five Proteas to watch in T20 World Cup opener","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/proteas-women/five-proteas-to-watch-in-t20-world-cup-opener-a0047e90-d091-4c4c-a468-9f533a101fb3","keywords":null,"creator":["IOL"],"video_url":null,"description":"IOL Sport selects five game-changers in the Proteas women’s squad who are set to make a significant impact in their T20 World Cup opener against Sri Lanka on Friday.","content":"By Ongama Gcwabe Gqeberha — The Proteas women’s team completed their preparations for the T20 World Cup with a six-wicket victory over Pakistan in their final warm-up game at Boland Park on Wednesday. IOL Sport selects five game-changers in the Proteas squad who are set to make a significant impact when they face Sri Lanka in the tournament’s opening game at Newlands on Friday: Chloe Tryon The all-rounder has been a revelation for the Proteas recently. She has eased the concerns that came with the omission of Dane van Niekerk by showing just how capable she is with both bat and ball. A batting strike-rate of 140 in T20 internationals proves how dangerous she is. She followed up her unbeaten 57 in the Tri-Series final earlier this month with a career-best 65 in the warm-up match against England. She has taken 24 wickets to go with the 957 runs she has accumulated in her T20 international career. Chloe Tryon is a shining light for the Proteas heading into the World Cup and is one to keep an eye on. Marizanne Kapp The name needs no introduction. Marizanne Kapp has already reached legendary status in the game with her incredible performances and fierce competitive spirit. She embodies the South African spirit. Her 67 wickets at an economy rate just over five runs to the over in T20 internationals make her an exceptional performer. On the batting front, she has two half-centuries under her belt in the shortest format. Kapp is undoubtedly an impact player in the squad. Nonkululeko Mlaba At only 22-years of age, Nonkululeko Mlaba has broken into the top bowlers list in T20s. She currently sits at second place on the rankings behind England’s Sophie Ecclestone. She has made a name for herself as one of the few off-spinners who relish bowling with the new ball in the unforgiving powerplay. With 22 wickets in only 27 matches, Mlaba is one to watch at the World Cup. Laura Wolvaardt Since making her debut in 2016, Wolvaardt has proven to be a rock in the Proteas’ batting order. She is known for her consistency with the bat and her stunning catches in the field. She has smashed 857 runs in only 47 T20s and has four half-centuries to her name. Batting at the top of the order, Wolvaardt will grace supporters with her stunning cover drives and entertain the crowd during the World Cup. Ayabonga Khaka A silent assassin off the field but a competitor on it, Ayabonga Khaka is one of the senior players in the Proteas team. At 30-years-old and 11 years into her international career, Khaka carries a wealth of experience that should benefit South Africa at the World Cup. Her experience makes her calm in high-pressure situations and she forms a potent pace trio with Shabnim Ismail and Kapp. @ imongamagcwabe IOL Sport Share","pubDate":"2023-02-08 18:12:03","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/2cf258be-1ca2-5592-ae29-3082d3a905f8&operation=CROP&offset=0x84&resize=4500x2528","source_id":"iol","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: What activity keeps MS Dhoni busy in learning ?","link":"https://www.livemint.com/sports/cricket-news/watch-what-activity-keeps-ms-dhoni-busy-in-learning-in-his-farmhouse-ranchi-11675883583400.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Livemint"],"video_url":null,"description":"In the new video MS Dhoni is seen riding a tractor in a bid to plough a field which seems like is at his farmhouse Ranchi.","content":"Mahendra Singh Dhoni has reappeared on Instagram and how.

The South London venue has hosted over 100 Test matches in its rich history, and in June will welcome the top two Test sides in the ICC World Test Championship standings, which will compete for the ICC WTC Mace following two years of hard-fought competition. The ICC WTC Final is the pinnacle event in the Test calendar and is a week-long celebration of the longest format of the game. This Ultimate Test is the culmination of two years of intense competition in the ICC WTC, spanning 61 Test matches over 24 series played to date. While the two competing nations may not yet be known, there are a host of significant fixtures due to be played in the coming weeks to determine the finalists. Australia currently top the standings, with India in hot pursuit in second place, and both the teams go head-to-head across a four-Test series starting in Nagpur on Thursday. While six teams in total stand a chance of qualification, among the frontrunners to challenge the top two are Sri Lanka, who sit third in the standings and South Africa in fourth, who take on reigning WTC champions New Zealand and the West Indies respectively over two two-Test series during February and March. On the potential of securing their place at the showpiece event, Australia skipper Pat Cummins said, “The prospect of playing in the World Test Championship Final has been a big motivator for us over the last couple of years, more so now having missed out on over rates last time. “To play at a neutral venue like The Oval adds another element for both sides who make the Final. It’s exciting and has been a goal of ours for a while now. “We are confident we can secure a place while here in India after a really strong 12 months. The Final would be a great reward for the players and staff who have done so well.” India captain Rohit Sharma looks ahead to what could be a second successive WTC Final encounter. “Leading Team India out onto the field of play at the World Test Championship Final would be special,” he said. “We have grown and developed as a team during this competition and to be in with a chance of lifting the Mace at the Oval in June, we know we first need to overcome a tough Australia side. “There have been so many dramatic moments in Test cricket lately, and there are undoubtedly more to come. I am excited by the prospect of booking our place at the Final and hopefully creating history later in the year.” PTI WTC final to be held at The Oval from June 7 to 11: ICC added by Press Trust of India on 1:46 am February 9, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-02-08 20:16:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"This Aussie team doesn’t carry baggage of past: Pat Cummins","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/02/09/this-aussie-team-doesnt-carry-baggage-of-past-pat-cummins/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Nagpur: Australian cricket teams haven’t won a Test series in India for the past 19 years but current skipper Pat Cummins would tell anyone who cares to listen that his unit doesn’t carry the baggage of victories and defeats of his predecessors.

As Cummins leads Australia to one of its toughest assignments in India, the skipper also underlined the importance of a good first-innings score, which will be crucial in the context of the series. “No, this team is very different to a lot of the teams that have played here in the past. So we don’t carry the wins, we don’t carry the losses,” Cummins told reporters when asked if past results would weigh heavily on his mind. “We know it’s tough to tour here, India are a really good cricket side, especially at home, so we are excited. And, yeah, we will give it our best shot,” Cummins added. Asked about first-innings totals, the world’s premier speedster said,”Yeah, I think it’s more important here than anywhere else in the world, that first-innings lead, hopefully. You just got to find a way to put a big total on the board, especially thinking if it is going to spin, it’s going to get really hard in that second innings.”. The Australian media has already started raising a hue and cry about “doctored pitches” with one article in Sydney Morning Herald predicting the nature of the wicket even before a ball has been bowled on the VCA stadium track. Cummins, however, put things in perspective, saying his lineup being loaded with left-handers had prompted curators to dry areas where India’s right-hand seamers will create rough spots for the host spinners to exploit. “Potentially, yes. Looks a little bit dry for the left-handers and knowing how much traffic will probably go through there from the right-arm bowlers, potentially might be a fair bit of rough out there,” Cummins said. But unlike his country’s media, Cummins wants to embrace the challenge. “Again, that’s something we’ve just got to embrace. It’s going to be fun. It’s going to be challenging at times but our batters will relish the chance to problem-solve on their feet, and quite a few of them will get their chances to do that.” Cummins, however, didn’t want to predict a first-innings score. “You have got to bat big in the first innings. It might not be the same for every venue. At some, 250 might be a good score, there might be other venues where you might need 500. Reading the wicket can be a bit difficult at times but you have to be ready for everything.”. Cummins also made no bones about Nathan Lyon expected to bowl bulk of the overs during the series. “Nathan’s going to be right up there with our most important bowlers for this series. He’s got to bowl lots of overs, he’s got the experience here. He’s up for the challenge, he can’t wait. He’s been working with a lot of the other spin bowlers that are over here as well. He will lead our attack this series.” PTI This Aussie team doesn’t carry baggage of past: Pat Cummins added by Press Trust of India on 1:44 am February 9, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-02-08 20:14:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rilee Rossouw stars with bat and ball to power Pretoria Capitals into SA20 final","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/domestic/rilee-rossouw-stars-with-bat-and-ball-to-power-pretoria-capitals-into-sa20-final-baf4e0c7-33d9-4768-83f4-1dfb3a9c0217","keywords":null,"creator":["Zaahier Adams"],"video_url":null,"description":"Rilee Rossouw inspired Pretoria Capitals to an impressive win over Paarl Royals on Wednesday to book their spot in the SA20 final.","content":"Johannesburg — The Pretoria Capitals are the first team through to the inaugural Betway SA20 final. The Capitals held their nerve in the big moments during a tense first semi-final against the Paarl Royals to emerge victors by 29 runs at the Wanderers on Wednesday evening. The match was delayed by 35 minutes due to an earlier downpour, but that did nothing to stem the excitement inside the Bullring. Rilee Rossouw showed all his experience with 56 off 41 balls that helped the Capitals post 153/8. It was an uncharacteristic innings from the Proteas T20 top-order batter, but it was required under the circumstances. Rossouw played well within himself due to wickets falling around him and a surface that was not conducive to his regular free-flowing strokeplay. The Royals were disciplined in their efforts with the ball, particularly Proteas all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo, as he tore through the Capitals’ middle-order. Phehlukwayo picked up Jimmy Neesham (4) and Eathan Bosch (22) to follow up the good work of spinners Bjorn Fortuin (1/24) and Tabraiz Shamsi (2/19). Rossouw, though, absorbed the pressure before breaking free with a couple of clean strikes down the ground. Unfortunately just when Rossouw was about to cut loose, Phehlukwayo returned to attack to send the southpaw back to the pavilion. But the Capitals would still have believed that they had a defendable total at the interval. And so it proved with all the Capitals bowlers putting in a solid shift on the night. Eathan Bosch led the way by removing England international opener Jason Roy two balls into the run chase. Bosch went one better in the following over when he clean bowled the in-form Jos Buttler. The Royals were immediately on the back foot at 16/2 in the third over and they never quite recovered from the early setbacks. JP Duminy’s team continued to lose wickets at regular intervals despite being ahead of the run-rate and when Rossouw turned his arm over to claim Eoin Morgan’s scalp the challenge became even steeper. The Royals’ last hope was captain David Miller, and although the skipper struck a few lusty blows to keep his team in the contest, the challenge was ended with the return of Anrich Nortje at the death. The Capitals now await the winner of the second semi-final between Joburg Super Kings and the Sunrisers Eastern Cape on Thursday at Centurion to see who their opponents will be in Saturday’s final.

The Terriers, third from bottom in the Sky Bet Championship, will begin the search for their fifth permanent head coach in less than three years after their winless league run was extended to five matches on Tuesday night. Huddersfield announced on Twitter: “@htafc have terminated the contract of head coach Mark Fotheringham with immediate effect. “Kenny Miller has also left the club. Narcis Pelach will take control of the team for Saturday’s Sky Bet Championship game at Wigan Athletic.” Fotheringham, 39, was handed his first managerial job by Huddersfield in September after they had sacked Danny Schofield, who lost seven of his nine league games in charge. The Terriers were in 23rd place at the time, but have failed to climb out of the relegation zone under Fotheringham, who won just five of his 20 league games at the helm.

We all know that’s unacceptable and we’ve let the club down.” Huddersfield, relegated from the Premier League in 2019, reached the Championship play-off final under former manager Carlos Corberan last season.

The Terriers, third from bottom in the Sky Bet Championship, will begin the search for their fifth permanent head coach in less than three years after their winless league run was extended to five matches on Tuesday night. Huddersfield announced on Twitter: “@htafc have terminated the contract of head coach Mark Fotheringham with immediate effect. “Kenny Miller has also left the club. Narcis Pelach will take control of the team for Saturday’s Sky Bet Championship game at Wigan Athletic.” Fotheringham, 39, was handed his first managerial job by Huddersfield in September after they had sacked Danny Schofield, who lost seven of his nine league games in charge. The Terriers were in 23rd place at the time, but have failed to climb out of the relegation zone under Fotheringham, who won just five of his 20 league games at the helm.

Town have dropped seven points from winning positions since the turn of the year and Fotheringham said afterwards: “To get yourself in a situation to take home three points, it’s absolutely unacceptable. I’m lost for words to be honest. “There’s a real collective anger in there. We all know that’s unacceptable and we’ve let the club down.” Huddersfield, relegated from the Premier League in 2019, reached the Championship play-off final under former manager Carlos Corberan last season. They have won only seven league games since and face another relegation rival, Wigan, at the DW Stadium on Saturday.

News24 Sport looks at how they went through their oscillations.","content":"The group stages of the first-ever SA20 are over, and they did not disappoint. Without looking at the points table, here's how News24 Sport judged the teams: The team that went according to form: Pretoria Capitals - FIRST The Capitals, under Wayne Parnell's sound leadership, sought destruction wherever they went on their way to finishing at the top. They were five points clear of the Joburg Super Kings and collected bonus points like they were going out of fashion. They were stymied by Johannesburg and Paarl, then unexpectedly humbled at home by Durban's Super Giants, but they always looked like the team to beat. They seemed to have the team for all conditions and this was proven by the fact that they won in Durban, Gqeberha and Cape Town, where the manner of their successes spoke to their adaptability. They had a measure of revenge when they beat the Paarl Royals by 59 runs on Tuesday, who had beaten them in Paarl, but they'll have to do it again on Wednesday when the sides meet at the Wanderers for what is sure to be a grudge match semi-final on Wednesday. Home bully boys: Joburg Super Kings - SECOND On the coast, they were dodgy, even though they won two from four. They were badly beaten by the Capitals, but take them to the Wanderers, and they play like bulls charging at a red flag at the Bullring. After their terrible loss to the Capitals at the halfway mark, their coach Stephen Fleming said they had a few things they needed to sort out, especially with their batting. They had a few home games to get that right and, largely through the free-scoring form of Faf du Plessis, they've made the Corlett Drive-based ground a hard one for visiting teams. They were the only side that didn't drop a home game in the tournament and deserve to host a semi-final, with the Sunrisers Eastern Cape being their opponents at SuperSport Park on Thursday. The team that's surprised: Sunrisers Eastern Cape - THIRD The feeling existed that the Gqeberha-based team wasn't strong from a recruitment perspective, but they were the perfect example of a team that moved between hot and cold. They were as unpredictable as the Gqeberha weather, winning games they were expected to lose and vice-versa. They brought the unpredictability factor to the tournament, and one could never know in which shade they would rock up for a particular fixture. Finishing third ahead of their more fancied coastal rivals was a testament to their resourceful cricket. However, they'll need to step up a gear to beat a Super Kings side that did the double over them in the round-robin stages. The tournament's joker in the pack: Paarl Royals - FOURTH The Paarl Royals looked like a team that could only really play their cricket in Paarl. The fact that the Royals only won in Paarl and Gqeberha spoke to how they armed their team for one set of conditions and not the other. It was similar to how formidable their parent team, the Rajasthan Royals, were in Jaipur, but toothless elsewhere. That said, they found a way to finish fourth and qualify for the semi-finals, even though they sneaked in despite a heavy loss to the Capitals on Tuesday. What they do have in their armour for Wednesday's semi-final is the dangerous Jos Buttler, but he'll need help from a batting group that while talented, hasn't always come off. The team that didn't fire consistently: Durban's Super Giants - FIFTH From being the first side to make a 200-plus total, to being the first side to make two consecutive sub-100 scores, to scoring the highest team total in the round-robin stage, they veered between the sublime and ridiculous. That told the story of a Super Giants side that, packed with all-rounders, found different ways to gel and come apart during the tournament. Their blistering defeat of the Capitals was one game where everything came together, but did so too late in the competition to have a material effect on the log. Two of their home wins out of the five came against Paarl Royal and MI Cape Town, with the weather intervening in the other game. They'll need to be smarter with their batting recruitment next season to complement their excellent bevy of all-rounders. The team that flopped badly: MI Cape Town - SIXTH The less said about MI Cape Town, the better. On paper, they looked like a very competent side, but when it came to translating that to performance, that wasn't the case. They seemed to be a side that picked Highveld batters for coastal combat, and this showed up badly before the tournament moved up to the Highveld. They had the all-conditions bowlers, but what they didn't have were the all-conditions batters to navigate what were tricky coastal pitches that proved to be their undoing. The crowd that mattered - Gqeberha The whistle-podu of the Wanderers suited the imposing nature of the ground while the laid-back nature of SuperSport Park and Newlands meant the crowds were always more engaged in the game and the catching. Kingsmead's fans finally made some cricket sense to watch games there while Paarl's heat made things uncomfortable for their fans. St George's Park was an Orange-coloured cauldron from start to finish and it was quite the ground to watch the cricket. The band created an unmatchable atmosphere that was also accompanied by some excellent cricket despite the assortment of surfaces. It pumped from start to finish and the weather also played ball, something that can’t always be said of Gqeberha.","pubDate":"2023-02-08 18:14:34","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Five Proteas to watch in T20 World Cup opener","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/proteas-women/five-proteas-to-watch-in-t20-world-cup-opener-a0047e90-d091-4c4c-a468-9f533a101fb3","keywords":null,"creator":["IOL"],"video_url":null,"description":"IOL Sport selects five game-changers in the Proteas women’s squad who are set to make a significant impact in their T20 World Cup opener against Sri Lanka on Friday.","content":"By Ongama Gcwabe Gqeberha — The Proteas women’s team completed their preparations for the T20 World Cup with a six-wicket victory over Pakistan in their final warm-up game at Boland Park on Wednesday. IOL Sport selects five game-changers in the Proteas squad who are set to make a significant impact when they face Sri Lanka in the tournament’s opening game at Newlands on Friday: Chloe Tryon The all-rounder has been a revelation for the Proteas recently. She has eased the concerns that came with the omission of Dane van Niekerk by showing just how capable she is with both bat and ball. A batting strike-rate of 140 in T20 internationals proves how dangerous she is. She followed up her unbeaten 57 in the Tri-Series final earlier this month with a career-best 65 in the warm-up match against England. She has taken 24 wickets to go with the 957 runs she has accumulated in her T20 international career. Chloe Tryon is a shining light for the Proteas heading into the World Cup and is one to keep an eye on. Marizanne Kapp The name needs no introduction. Marizanne Kapp has already reached legendary status in the game with her incredible performances and fierce competitive spirit. She embodies the South African spirit. Her 67 wickets at an economy rate just over five runs to the over in T20 internationals make her an exceptional performer. On the batting front, she has two half-centuries under her belt in the shortest format. Kapp is undoubtedly an impact player in the squad. Nonkululeko Mlaba At only 22-years of age, Nonkululeko Mlaba has broken into the top bowlers list in T20s. She currently sits at second place on the rankings behind England’s Sophie Ecclestone. She has made a name for herself as one of the few off-spinners who relish bowling with the new ball in the unforgiving powerplay. With 22 wickets in only 27 matches, Mlaba is one to watch at the World Cup. Laura Wolvaardt Since making her debut in 2016, Wolvaardt has proven to be a rock in the Proteas’ batting order. She is known for her consistency with the bat and her stunning catches in the field. She has smashed 857 runs in only 47 T20s and has four half-centuries to her name. Batting at the top of the order, Wolvaardt will grace supporters with her stunning cover drives and entertain the crowd during the World Cup. Ayabonga Khaka A silent assassin off the field but a competitor on it, Ayabonga Khaka is one of the senior players in the Proteas team. At 30-years-old and 11 years into her international career, Khaka carries a wealth of experience that should benefit South Africa at the World Cup. Her experience makes her calm in high-pressure situations and she forms a potent pace trio with Shabnim Ismail and Kapp. @ imongamagcwabe IOL Sport Share","pubDate":"2023-02-08 18:12:03","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/2cf258be-1ca2-5592-ae29-3082d3a905f8&operation=CROP&offset=0x84&resize=4500x2528","source_id":"iol","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: What activity keeps MS Dhoni busy in learning ?","link":"https://www.livemint.com/sports/cricket-news/watch-what-activity-keeps-ms-dhoni-busy-in-learning-in-his-farmhouse-ranchi-11675883583400.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Livemint"],"video_url":null,"description":"In the new video MS Dhoni is seen riding a tractor in a bid to plough a field which seems like is at his farmhouse Ranchi.","content":"Mahendra Singh Dhoni has reappeared on Instagram and how.

The South London venue has hosted over 100 Test matches in its rich history, and in June will welcome the top two Test sides in the ICC World Test Championship standings, which will compete for the ICC WTC Mace following two years of hard-fought competition. The ICC WTC Final is the pinnacle event in the Test calendar and is a week-long celebration of the longest format of the game. This Ultimate Test is the culmination of two years of intense competition in the ICC WTC, spanning 61 Test matches over 24 series played to date. While the two competing nations may not yet be known, there are a host of significant fixtures due to be played in the coming weeks to determine the finalists. Australia currently top the standings, with India in hot pursuit in second place, and both the teams go head-to-head across a four-Test series starting in Nagpur on Thursday. While six teams in total stand a chance of qualification, among the frontrunners to challenge the top two are Sri Lanka, who sit third in the standings and South Africa in fourth, who take on reigning WTC champions New Zealand and the West Indies respectively over two two-Test series during February and March. On the potential of securing their place at the showpiece event, Australia skipper Pat Cummins said, “The prospect of playing in the World Test Championship Final has been a big motivator for us over the last couple of years, more so now having missed out on over rates last time. “To play at a neutral venue like The Oval adds another element for both sides who make the Final. It’s exciting and has been a goal of ours for a while now. “We are confident we can secure a place while here in India after a really strong 12 months. The Final would be a great reward for the players and staff who have done so well.” India captain Rohit Sharma looks ahead to what could be a second successive WTC Final encounter. “Leading Team India out onto the field of play at the World Test Championship Final would be special,” he said. “We have grown and developed as a team during this competition and to be in with a chance of lifting the Mace at the Oval in June, we know we first need to overcome a tough Australia side. “There have been so many dramatic moments in Test cricket lately, and there are undoubtedly more to come. I am excited by the prospect of booking our place at the Final and hopefully creating history later in the year.” PTI WTC final to be held at The Oval from June 7 to 11: ICC added by Press Trust of India on 1:46 am February 9, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-02-08 20:16:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"This Aussie team doesn’t carry baggage of past: Pat Cummins","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/02/09/this-aussie-team-doesnt-carry-baggage-of-past-pat-cummins/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Nagpur: Australian cricket teams haven’t won a Test series in India for the past 19 years but current skipper Pat Cummins would tell anyone who cares to listen that his unit doesn’t carry the baggage of victories and defeats of his predecessors.

As Cummins leads Australia to one of its toughest assignments in India, the skipper also underlined the importance of a good first-innings score, which will be crucial in the context of the series. “No, this team is very different to a lot of the teams that have played here in the past. So we don’t carry the wins, we don’t carry the losses,” Cummins told reporters when asked if past results would weigh heavily on his mind. “We know it’s tough to tour here, India are a really good cricket side, especially at home, so we are excited. And, yeah, we will give it our best shot,” Cummins added. Asked about first-innings totals, the world’s premier speedster said,”Yeah, I think it’s more important here than anywhere else in the world, that first-innings lead, hopefully. You just got to find a way to put a big total on the board, especially thinking if it is going to spin, it’s going to get really hard in that second innings.”. The Australian media has already started raising a hue and cry about “doctored pitches” with one article in Sydney Morning Herald predicting the nature of the wicket even before a ball has been bowled on the VCA stadium track. Cummins, however, put things in perspective, saying his lineup being loaded with left-handers had prompted curators to dry areas where India’s right-hand seamers will create rough spots for the host spinners to exploit. “Potentially, yes. Looks a little bit dry for the left-handers and knowing how much traffic will probably go through there from the right-arm bowlers, potentially might be a fair bit of rough out there,” Cummins said. But unlike his country’s media, Cummins wants to embrace the challenge. “Again, that’s something we’ve just got to embrace. It’s going to be fun. It’s going to be challenging at times but our batters will relish the chance to problem-solve on their feet, and quite a few of them will get their chances to do that.” Cummins, however, didn’t want to predict a first-innings score. “You have got to bat big in the first innings. It might not be the same for every venue. At some, 250 might be a good score, there might be other venues where you might need 500. Reading the wicket can be a bit difficult at times but you have to be ready for everything.”. Cummins also made no bones about Nathan Lyon expected to bowl bulk of the overs during the series. “Nathan’s going to be right up there with our most important bowlers for this series. He’s got to bowl lots of overs, he’s got the experience here. He’s up for the challenge, he can’t wait. He’s been working with a lot of the other spin bowlers that are over here as well. He will lead our attack this series.” PTI This Aussie team doesn’t carry baggage of past: Pat Cummins added by Press Trust of India on 1:44 am February 9, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-02-08 20:14:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rilee Rossouw stars with bat and ball to power Pretoria Capitals into SA20 final","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/domestic/rilee-rossouw-stars-with-bat-and-ball-to-power-pretoria-capitals-into-sa20-final-baf4e0c7-33d9-4768-83f4-1dfb3a9c0217","keywords":null,"creator":["Zaahier Adams"],"video_url":null,"description":"Rilee Rossouw inspired Pretoria Capitals to an impressive win over Paarl Royals on Wednesday to book their spot in the SA20 final.","content":"Johannesburg — The Pretoria Capitals are the first team through to the inaugural Betway SA20 final. The Capitals held their nerve in the big moments during a tense first semi-final against the Paarl Royals to emerge victors by 29 runs at the Wanderers on Wednesday evening. The match was delayed by 35 minutes due to an earlier downpour, but that did nothing to stem the excitement inside the Bullring. Rilee Rossouw showed all his experience with 56 off 41 balls that helped the Capitals post 153/8. It was an uncharacteristic innings from the Proteas T20 top-order batter, but it was required under the circumstances. Rossouw played well within himself due to wickets falling around him and a surface that was not conducive to his regular free-flowing strokeplay. The Royals were disciplined in their efforts with the ball, particularly Proteas all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo, as he tore through the Capitals’ middle-order. Phehlukwayo picked up Jimmy Neesham (4) and Eathan Bosch (22) to follow up the good work of spinners Bjorn Fortuin (1/24) and Tabraiz Shamsi (2/19). Rossouw, though, absorbed the pressure before breaking free with a couple of clean strikes down the ground. Unfortunately just when Rossouw was about to cut loose, Phehlukwayo returned to attack to send the southpaw back to the pavilion. But the Capitals would still have believed that they had a defendable total at the interval. And so it proved with all the Capitals bowlers putting in a solid shift on the night. Eathan Bosch led the way by removing England international opener Jason Roy two balls into the run chase. Bosch went one better in the following over when he clean bowled the in-form Jos Buttler. The Royals were immediately on the back foot at 16/2 in the third over and they never quite recovered from the early setbacks. JP Duminy’s team continued to lose wickets at regular intervals despite being ahead of the run-rate and when Rossouw turned his arm over to claim Eoin Morgan’s scalp the challenge became even steeper. The Royals’ last hope was captain David Miller, and although the skipper struck a few lusty blows to keep his team in the contest, the challenge was ended with the return of Anrich Nortje at the death. The Capitals now await the winner of the second semi-final between Joburg Super Kings and the Sunrisers Eastern Cape on Thursday at Centurion to see who their opponents will be in Saturday’s final.

News24 Sport looks at how they went through their oscillations.","content":"The group stages of the first-ever SA20 are over, and they did not disappoint. Without looking at the points table, here's how News24 Sport judged the teams: The team that went according to form: Pretoria Capitals - FIRST The Capitals, under Wayne Parnell's sound leadership, sought destruction wherever they went on their way to finishing at the top. They were five points clear of the Joburg Super Kings and collected bonus points like they were going out of fashion. They were stymied by Johannesburg and Paarl, then unexpectedly humbled at home by Durban's Super Giants, but they always looked like the team to beat. They seemed to have the team for all conditions and this was proven by the fact that they won in Durban, Gqeberha and Cape Town, where the manner of their successes spoke to their adaptability. They had a measure of revenge when they beat the Paarl Royals by 59 runs on Tuesday, who had beaten them in Paarl, but they'll have to do it again on Wednesday when the sides meet at the Wanderers for what is sure to be a grudge match semi-final on Wednesday. Home bully boys: Joburg Super Kings - SECOND On the coast, they were dodgy, even though they won two from four. They were badly beaten by the Capitals, but take them to the Wanderers, and they play like bulls charging at a red flag at the Bullring. After their terrible loss to the Capitals at the halfway mark, their coach Stephen Fleming said they had a few things they needed to sort out, especially with their batting. They had a few home games to get that right and, largely through the free-scoring form of Faf du Plessis, they've made the Corlett Drive-based ground a hard one for visiting teams. They were the only side that didn't drop a home game in the tournament and deserve to host a semi-final, with the Sunrisers Eastern Cape being their opponents at SuperSport Park on Thursday. The team that's surprised: Sunrisers Eastern Cape - THIRD The feeling existed that the Gqeberha-based team wasn't strong from a recruitment perspective, but they were the perfect example of a team that moved between hot and cold. They were as unpredictable as the Gqeberha weather, winning games they were expected to lose and vice-versa. They brought the unpredictability factor to the tournament, and one could never know in which shade they would rock up for a particular fixture. Finishing third ahead of their more fancied coastal rivals was a testament to their resourceful cricket. However, they'll need to step up a gear to beat a Super Kings side that did the double over them in the round-robin stages. The tournament's joker in the pack: Paarl Royals - FOURTH The Paarl Royals looked like a team that could only really play their cricket in Paarl. The fact that the Royals only won in Paarl and Gqeberha spoke to how they armed their team for one set of conditions and not the other. It was similar to how formidable their parent team, the Rajasthan Royals, were in Jaipur, but toothless elsewhere. That said, they found a way to finish fourth and qualify for the semi-finals, even though they sneaked in despite a heavy loss to the Capitals on Tuesday. What they do have in their armour for Wednesday's semi-final is the dangerous Jos Buttler, but he'll need help from a batting group that while talented, hasn't always come off. The team that didn't fire consistently: Durban's Super Giants - FIFTH From being the first side to make a 200-plus total, to being the first side to make two consecutive sub-100 scores, to scoring the highest team total in the round-robin stage, they veered between the sublime and ridiculous. That told the story of a Super Giants side that, packed with all-rounders, found different ways to gel and come apart during the tournament. Their blistering defeat of the Capitals was one game where everything came together, but did so too late in the competition to have a material effect on the log. Two of their home wins out of the five came against Paarl Royal and MI Cape Town, with the weather intervening in the other game. They'll need to be smarter with their batting recruitment next season to complement their excellent bevy of all-rounders. The team that flopped badly: MI Cape Town - SIXTH The less said about MI Cape Town, the better. On paper, they looked like a very competent side, but when it came to translating that to performance, that wasn't the case. They seemed to be a side that picked Highveld batters for coastal combat, and this showed up badly before the tournament moved up to the Highveld. They had the all-conditions bowlers, but what they didn't have were the all-conditions batters to navigate what were tricky coastal pitches that proved to be their undoing. The crowd that mattered - Gqeberha The whistle-podu of the Wanderers suited the imposing nature of the ground while the laid-back nature of SuperSport Park and Newlands meant the crowds were always more engaged in the game and the catching. Kingsmead's fans finally made some cricket sense to watch games there while Paarl's heat made things uncomfortable for their fans. St George's Park was an Orange-coloured cauldron from start to finish and it was quite the ground to watch the cricket. The band created an unmatchable atmosphere that was also accompanied by some excellent cricket despite the assortment of surfaces. It pumped from start to finish and the weather also played ball, something that can’t always be said of Gqeberha.","pubDate":"2023-02-08 18:14:34","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Five Proteas to watch in T20 World Cup opener","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/proteas-women/five-proteas-to-watch-in-t20-world-cup-opener-a0047e90-d091-4c4c-a468-9f533a101fb3","keywords":null,"creator":["IOL"],"video_url":null,"description":"IOL Sport selects five game-changers in the Proteas women’s squad who are set to make a significant impact in their T20 World Cup opener against Sri Lanka on Friday.","content":"By Ongama Gcwabe Gqeberha — The Proteas women’s team completed their preparations for the T20 World Cup with a six-wicket victory over Pakistan in their final warm-up game at Boland Park on Wednesday. IOL Sport selects five game-changers in the Proteas squad who are set to make a significant impact when they face Sri Lanka in the tournament’s opening game at Newlands on Friday: Chloe Tryon The all-rounder has been a revelation for the Proteas recently. She has eased the concerns that came with the omission of Dane van Niekerk by showing just how capable she is with both bat and ball. A batting strike-rate of 140 in T20 internationals proves how dangerous she is. She followed up her unbeaten 57 in the Tri-Series final earlier this month with a career-best 65 in the warm-up match against England. She has taken 24 wickets to go with the 957 runs she has accumulated in her T20 international career. Chloe Tryon is a shining light for the Proteas heading into the World Cup and is one to keep an eye on. Marizanne Kapp The name needs no introduction. Marizanne Kapp has already reached legendary status in the game with her incredible performances and fierce competitive spirit. She embodies the South African spirit. Her 67 wickets at an economy rate just over five runs to the over in T20 internationals make her an exceptional performer. On the batting front, she has two half-centuries under her belt in the shortest format. Kapp is undoubtedly an impact player in the squad. Nonkululeko Mlaba At only 22-years of age, Nonkululeko Mlaba has broken into the top bowlers list in T20s. She currently sits at second place on the rankings behind England’s Sophie Ecclestone. She has made a name for herself as one of the few off-spinners who relish bowling with the new ball in the unforgiving powerplay. With 22 wickets in only 27 matches, Mlaba is one to watch at the World Cup. Laura Wolvaardt Since making her debut in 2016, Wolvaardt has proven to be a rock in the Proteas’ batting order. She is known for her consistency with the bat and her stunning catches in the field. She has smashed 857 runs in only 47 T20s and has four half-centuries to her name. Batting at the top of the order, Wolvaardt will grace supporters with her stunning cover drives and entertain the crowd during the World Cup. Ayabonga Khaka A silent assassin off the field but a competitor on it, Ayabonga Khaka is one of the senior players in the Proteas team. At 30-years-old and 11 years into her international career, Khaka carries a wealth of experience that should benefit South Africa at the World Cup. Her experience makes her calm in high-pressure situations and she forms a potent pace trio with Shabnim Ismail and Kapp. @ imongamagcwabe IOL Sport Share","pubDate":"2023-02-08 18:12:03","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/2cf258be-1ca2-5592-ae29-3082d3a905f8&operation=CROP&offset=0x84&resize=4500x2528","source_id":"iol","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"}]}
