Maxwell's absence from RCB's match against Sunrisers Hyderabad here on Monday was initially attributed to a finger injury he suffered during the previous match against Mumbai Indians. But he later admitted to dropping himself from the squad. \"It was a pretty easy decision. I went to Faf and the coaches after the last game (vs Mumbai Indians) and said it was probably time we tried someone else (in his place),\" Maxwell said in the post-match press meet. \"It's actually a good time to give myself a bit of a mental and physical break, get my body right. If I'm required to get in during the tournament, I can, hopefully, get back into a solid mental and physical space where I can make an impact,\" he added. This is the second time in his career that Maxwell has opted out of competitive cricket in order to gather himself. He had taken a similar break in October 2019, stating that he felt mentally and physically ruined at that time. The 35-year-old made his comeback a couple of months later. In the ongoing IPL, Maxwell has been quite underwhelming with the bat in the six matches he has played this season, contributing just 32 runs at an average of 5.33 and a strike-rate of 94. Twenty eight of those 32 runs came against Kolkata Knight Riders alone, helped to a great degree by two dropped catches. \"I have been in this situation in the past where you can keep playing and get yourself deeper into a hole. We have had a pretty big deficiency after the power play, which has been my area of strength over the last couple of seasons. \"I felt like I wasn't contributing with the bat, and with the results and the position we find ourselves on the table, I think it's a good time to give someone else an opportunity to show their wares, and hopefully, someone can make that spot their own,\" a candid Maxwell said. The big-hitting Australian, however, still hoped to return and make an impact in the later stages of the tournament. \"The management here has been outstanding. I don't think I've had a better six months in cricket leading into this tournament. \"So, it's frustrating when it ends up like this. But if I can get my body and my mind right, there's no reason I can't finish the tournament well if I do get another opportunity,\" he said. The sudden dip in his form was surprising, considering the hot run he had in the run-up to the IPL. Maxwell had made 552 runs from 17 T20Is from November onwards, averaging 42 and his strike-rate was an impressive 185. But the Victorian started the IPL with a first-ball duck against Chennai Super Kings in an away match, and from that point his fortunes plummeted. \"T20 cricket is a pretty fickle game. Even if you look at the first game, I ran one off the middle of the bat to the keeper. I picked up the length, saw a scoring opportunity, but opened the face a little bit too much. \"When you are going well, that goes wide of the (wicketkeeper's) gloves, you get a boundary. You are 4 off 1, and you are away for the tournament,\" he noted. Maxwell said luck was not on his side in this tournament. \"I probably just haven't got away. In the first few games, I feel I made reasonably good decisions (for shot selection). But I was finding ways to get out. \"It can happen in T20 cricket and when it snowballs like that, you can go searching and try too hard and forget the basics of the game,\" he said.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-04-16 13:34:43","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2024/4/2024_4$largeimg_1794990794.webp","source_id":"tribuneindia","source_priority":7916,"source_url":"https://www.tribuneindia.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/tribuneindia.png","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"e124c29df6054781b2bfb62957ef92cb","title":"I would have Rishabh Pant in Indian team every day of week: Ricky Ponting on T20 World Cup selection","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/i-would-have-rishabh-pant-in-indian-team-every-day-of-week-ricky-ponting-on-t20-world-cup-selection-611413","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi, April 16 In Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting's Indian team for the upcoming T20 World Cup, Rishabh Pant will feature \"every day of the week\" despite some established keeper-batters staking claim with their exploits in the ongoing IPL. Ponting was not sure whether Pant would be able to play again after the horrific car accident in December, 2022. But having seen the manner in which Pant has been making an impact since returning to action on the back of his remarkable resilience, the DC head coach is left with no doubt about who should board the plane to New York at the end of the IPL. \"Do I believe whether Rishabh should be there in the World Cup squad? Absolutely I do. He deserves to be in that WT20 squad by the end of the IPL,\" Ponting told PTI in an exclusive interview. \"I think we have seen Rishabh play the way we have seen him play in last five or six years in IPL, and now back playing for India,\" added the Australian batting great. While he acknowledged that there are lots of options for Indian selectors as far as choosing a keeper-batter goes, Pant remains the No.1 choice for him. \"One thing we certainly know that there is lot of depth around Indian cricket. With keeper-batters, I feel some guys are in really good form at the moment. (Ishan) Kishan is playing well, (Sanju) Samson is playing well and KL Rahul is playing well. \"There are a lot of options but if I was picking a team, I would have Rishabh Pant in it every day of the week,\" the 'Punter' made his call. Since his entry as DC coach, Ponting has shared a special bond with Pant and he is a touch emotional seeing him in full flow once again. \"Rishabh's comeback to international cricket is nothing short of remarkable. I spent a lot of time with him during last IPL and a lot of us were actually sceptical that whether he will actually play the game again, such a horrific accident and I had spoken to him about it, I wasn't sure whether he will play again.\" But like with all champions, Pant refused to throw in the towel. \"There was never any doubt in his mind that he will be back playing again. As each game goes by, we are starting to see a better and better version of Rishabh Pant, his batting has had more impact in last couple of games compared to start of the tournament, he is starting to move well behind the stumps,\" the coach sounded ecstatic.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-04-16 13:34:04","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2024/4/2024_4$largeimg_1067783691.webp","source_id":"tribuneindia","source_priority":7916,"source_url":"https://www.tribuneindia.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/tribuneindia.png","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"86a363a7c56ab2311373b0819351eec3","title":"Babar-led Pakistan face New Zealand in World Cup build-up","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/babar-led-pakistan-face-new-zealand-in-world-cup-build-up/","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"ISLAMABAD (AFP): Babar Azam makes his return as Pakistan captain in a five-match Twenty20 series starting Thursday against an understrength New Zealand with the World Cup weeks away.

Maxwell's absence from RCB's match against Sunrisers Hyderabad here on Monday was initially attributed to a finger injury he suffered during the previous match against Mumbai Indians. But he later admitted to dropping himself from the squad. \"It was a pretty easy decision. I went to Faf and the coaches after the last game (vs Mumbai Indians) and said it was probably time we tried someone else (in his place),\" Maxwell said in the post-match press meet. \"It's actually a good time to give myself a bit of a mental and physical break, get my body right. If I'm required to get in during the tournament, I can, hopefully, get back into a solid mental and physical space where I can make an impact,\" he added. This is the second time in his career that Maxwell has opted out of competitive cricket in order to gather himself. He had taken a similar break in October 2019, stating that he felt mentally and physically ruined at that time. The 35-year-old made his comeback a couple of months later. In the ongoing IPL, Maxwell has been quite underwhelming with the bat in the six matches he has played this season, contributing just 32 runs at an average of 5.33 and a strike-rate of 94. Twenty eight of those 32 runs came against Kolkata Knight Riders alone, helped to a great degree by two dropped catches. \"I have been in this situation in the past where you can keep playing and get yourself deeper into a hole. We have had a pretty big deficiency after the power play, which has been my area of strength over the last couple of seasons. \"I felt like I wasn't contributing with the bat, and with the results and the position we find ourselves on the table, I think it's a good time to give someone else an opportunity to show their wares, and hopefully, someone can make that spot their own,\" a candid Maxwell said. The big-hitting Australian, however, still hoped to return and make an impact in the later stages of the tournament. \"The management here has been outstanding. I don't think I've had a better six months in cricket leading into this tournament. \"So, it's frustrating when it ends up like this. But if I can get my body and my mind right, there's no reason I can't finish the tournament well if I do get another opportunity,\" he said. The sudden dip in his form was surprising, considering the hot run he had in the run-up to the IPL. Maxwell had made 552 runs from 17 T20Is from November onwards, averaging 42 and his strike-rate was an impressive 185. But the Victorian started the IPL with a first-ball duck against Chennai Super Kings in an away match, and from that point his fortunes plummeted. \"T20 cricket is a pretty fickle game. Even if you look at the first game, I ran one off the middle of the bat to the keeper. I picked up the length, saw a scoring opportunity, but opened the face a little bit too much. \"When you are going well, that goes wide of the (wicketkeeper's) gloves, you get a boundary. You are 4 off 1, and you are away for the tournament,\" he noted. Maxwell said luck was not on his side in this tournament. \"I probably just haven't got away. In the first few games, I feel I made reasonably good decisions (for shot selection). But I was finding ways to get out. \"It can happen in T20 cricket and when it snowballs like that, you can go searching and try too hard and forget the basics of the game,\" he said.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-04-16 13:34:43","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2024/4/2024_4$largeimg_1794990794.webp","source_id":"tribuneindia","source_priority":7916,"source_url":"https://www.tribuneindia.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/tribuneindia.png","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"e124c29df6054781b2bfb62957ef92cb","title":"I would have Rishabh Pant in Indian team every day of week: Ricky Ponting on T20 World Cup selection","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/i-would-have-rishabh-pant-in-indian-team-every-day-of-week-ricky-ponting-on-t20-world-cup-selection-611413","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi, April 16 In Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting's Indian team for the upcoming T20 World Cup, Rishabh Pant will feature \"every day of the week\" despite some established keeper-batters staking claim with their exploits in the ongoing IPL.

While he acknowledged that there are lots of options for Indian selectors as far as choosing a keeper-batter goes, Pant remains the No.1 choice for him. \"One thing we certainly know that there is lot of depth around Indian cricket. With keeper-batters, I feel some guys are in really good form at the moment. (Ishan) Kishan is playing well, (Sanju) Samson is playing well and KL Rahul is playing well. \"There are a lot of options but if I was picking a team, I would have Rishabh Pant in it every day of the week,\" the 'Punter' made his call. Since his entry as DC coach, Ponting has shared a special bond with Pant and he is a touch emotional seeing him in full flow once again. \"Rishabh's comeback to international cricket is nothing short of remarkable. I spent a lot of time with him during last IPL and a lot of us were actually sceptical that whether he will actually play the game again, such a horrific accident and I had spoken to him about it, I wasn't sure whether he will play again.\" But like with all champions, Pant refused to throw in the towel. \"There was never any doubt in his mind that he will be back playing again. As each game goes by, we are starting to see a better and better version of Rishabh Pant, his batting has had more impact in last couple of games compared to start of the tournament, he is starting to move well behind the stumps,\" the coach sounded ecstatic.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-04-16 13:34:04","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2024/4/2024_4$largeimg_1067783691.webp","source_id":"tribuneindia","source_priority":7916,"source_url":"https://www.tribuneindia.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/tribuneindia.png","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"86a363a7c56ab2311373b0819351eec3","title":"Babar-led Pakistan face New Zealand in World Cup build-up","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/babar-led-pakistan-face-new-zealand-in-world-cup-build-up/","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"ISLAMABAD (AFP): Babar Azam makes his return as Pakistan captain in a five-match Twenty20 series starting Thursday against an understrength New Zealand with the World Cup weeks away.

While he acknowledged that there are lots of options for Indian selectors as far as choosing a keeper-batter goes, Pant remains the No.1 choice for him. \"One thing we certainly know that there is lot of depth around Indian cricket. With keeper-batters, I feel some guys are in really good form at the moment. (Ishan) Kishan is playing well, (Sanju) Samson is playing well and KL Rahul is playing well. \"There are a lot of options but if I was picking a team, I would have Rishabh Pant in it every day of the week,\" the 'Punter' made his call. Since his entry as DC coach, Ponting has shared a special bond with Pant and he is a touch emotional seeing him in full flow once again. \"Rishabh's comeback to international cricket is nothing short of remarkable. I spent a lot of time with him during last IPL and a lot of us were actually sceptical that whether he will actually play the game again, such a horrific accident and I had spoken to him about it, I wasn't sure whether he will play again.\" But like with all champions, Pant refused to throw in the towel. \"There was never any doubt in his mind that he will be back playing again. As each game goes by, we are starting to see a better and better version of Rishabh Pant, his batting has had more impact in last couple of games compared to start of the tournament, he is starting to move well behind the stumps,\" the coach sounded ecstatic.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-04-16 13:34:04","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2024/4/2024_4$largeimg_1067783691.webp","source_id":"tribuneindia","source_priority":7916,"source_url":"https://www.tribuneindia.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/tribuneindia.png","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"}]}
