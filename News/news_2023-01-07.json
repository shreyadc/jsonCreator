Start your free trial now >Stars wicketkeeper Joe Clarke firstly missed an opportunity to run Vince out, catching a long throw from the outfield but producing an air swing when attempting to take the stumps as an exhausted Vince scrambled to make his ground.“Is that the season (for the Stars)?” Brett Lee said on Fox Cricket. After a Vince single, Silk heaved a Luke Wood delivery over the long-on boundary for six, meaning the Sixers only required two runs to win off three balls.Then after Silk missed a cut shot that went through to the keeper, Vince called Silk through for a single. Wood gathered the shy from the keeper and hit the stumps at the non-striker’s end, leading to a unique ‘combined review’ for the umpires to check the run out and the Stars to question whether Silk edge the ball through to Clarke.Silk was ultimately given out caught behind, despite replays showing a distance between the bat and ball when a spike on ‘snicko’ appeared. Silk appeared to strongly disagree with the decision, staying out on the field and giving the ‘review’ signal — despite the fact the decision had already been reviewed by Adam Zampa. But he had to go.Asked if he nicked the ball, Silk told Fox Cricket post-game: “I definitely heard a noise as it went past my bat and I saw up there that there was a spike on snicko as it was going past (my bat). But then the front-on camera showed I was about that far away from it, so I’m not sure how they’ve come up with that.“That’s what I saw on the screen, so that what was I was going off (when I tried to review). But I reckon I was run out at the other end anyway.“It’s following me at the moment, controversy. I don’t know, it was a bizarre moment. I went from thinking I was out on the snicko and then I saw a gap on the other camera.“It could’ve blown up, no doubt.”But Christian’s boundary ensured there would be no significant post-match fallout for the Sixers.Josh Philippe was first man out for the Sixers caught by Campbell Kellaway off Nathan Coulter-Nile for 10 from 13 balls. Daniel Hughes scored 28 from 22 before he was caught by Kellaway off Beau Webster. Moises Henriques smashed two fours and a six in his 23 from 14 balls before he was caught by Rogers to give Trent Boult a wicket in his last match of BBL12. Earlier the Melbourne Stars made 5-173 from their 20 overs after being sent in by the Sydney Sixers at the MCG, with Marcus Stoinis top scoring with 52 from just 28 balls for the hosts. Clarke was first man out for the Stars caught behind by Josh Philippe off the bowling of spinner Izharulhaq Naveed for 12. Tom Rogers blasted three fours and two sixes in his 48 off 33 balls, before he fell to a brilliant diving catch from Chris Jordan in the deep. However, the umpire sent it upstairs for review with a soft signal of not out much to the dismay of Jordan. But replays confirmed Jordan made the catch with ease and had his fingers were under the ball at all times. Hilton Cartwright got 36 from 31 after being promoted to No. 3, before he was caught by Jordan Silk off Sean Abbott. Marcus Stoinis continued his season revival after a slow start, blasting 52 from 28 balls, including seven fours and two sixes, before he was Abbott’s second scalp caught by Dan Christian. “That is Marcus Stoinis at his very best. He’s back,” West Indies legend Brian Lara told Fox Cricket“He played a beautiful innings a couple of matches ago, tonight this has been special.”Beau Webster only managed 8 and Nick Larkin 5 and Campbell Kellaway 2 finished unbeaten to take the Stars to 173 from their 20 overs.

The ACC, in its statement, categorically stated that PCB were sent the itinerary on December 22, 2022 along with other member nations but no communication came from the latter’s side. On Thursday, Shah had announced the ACC calendar 2023-24 and pathway structure for the continental body along with ODI Asia Cup slated in September. However, the calendar didn’t have the host country’s name as BCCI secretary Shah had already said last October (2022) that the tournament will be shifted out of Pakistan as India won’t be able to travel. Sethi’s predecessor Ramiz Raja had then made a counter-threat of pulling out of the ODI World Cup being held in India later this year. Sethi, who is back in the hot seat, had reacted sharply to BCCI supremo Shah’s announcement of ACC itinerary on twitter. “Thank you Jay Shah for unilaterally presenting ACC structure & calendars 2023-24 especially relating to Asia Cup 2023 for which Pakistan is the event host. While you are at it, you might as well present structure & calendar of our PSL 2023! A swift response will be appreciated,” Sethi’s sarcasm-laden tweet wasn’t lost on anyone. The ACC led by Shah, on the day, released a strongly-worded statement calling out PCB chairman’s bluff. “It has come to our knowledge that PCB Chairman Najam Sethi has made a comment on the ACC President (Shah) unilaterally taking the decision on finalising the calendar and announcing the same. The ACC wants to clarify that it has followed established due process,” ACC said in its statement. In fact, the statement also shared the timeline with the media which effectively means that the PCB chairman was lying. “The calendar was approved by its Development Committee and Finance & Marketing Committee in a meeting held on December 13th, 2022. The calendar was then communicated to all the participating members individually, including Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), via an e-mail dated December 22nd, 2022,” it further stated. The PCB in the last two weeks didn’t seek any modification in the proposed calender and hence there was a public announcement. “While responses were received from certain Member Boards, no comments or suggested modifications were received from PCB. In view of the above, Sethi’s comments on a social media platform are baseless and are vehemently denied by the ACC,” the statement concluded. The socio-political tension between India and Pakistan has prevented the neighbours engaging in any bilateral cricket since 2012 and India has not visited the country post the 2008 Asia Cup. The arch-rivals are only pitted against each other in multi-nation events and that too on neutral venues. While the Asia Cup is a multi-nation event, the decision of the ACC Board to award the hosting rights to Pakistan hasn’t gone down well with the BCCI. For PCB, the contention is if Australia, England and currently New Zealand can tour its country then why can’t India? In case of the BCCI, the decision of sending a cricket team to Pakistan will completely be the central government’s prerogative. —PTI.

Dravid felt inexperience was one of the main reasons for India’s 16-run defeat to Sri Lanka in the second T20I here. The former India captain pointed out that while the visitors had a pretty sorted playing XI, the hosts fielded a completely different side than the one which played the T20 World Cup less than two months back. “They (youngsters in the team) are very skilful, but as they are learning, it’s a tough (job). It’s not easy learning in international cricket and you have to learn on the job. So, we’ve got to have a little bit of patience with these guys,” Dravid said at the post-match press conference on Thursday. Dravid said the team was in the rebuilding phase, given the “next cycle of the T20 (World Cup)” had started. He added that youngsters will be handled patiently and will continue to get support from the team management, hinting that it could be the end of the road for the likes of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul. “For us, it was a slightly different scenario (in the T20I series against Sri Lanka) in the sense that from the last game we played against England in the semifinal of the World Cup, we’ve probably only 3-4 boys in the playing XI (now). “So, we are in a slightly different stage of looking at the next cycle of (the) T20 (World Cup). So, a slightly younger team.” With the focus shifting to the 50-over World Cup in India, Dravid feels it is the right time to give as many opportunities to youngsters in T20s as possible. “The good thing is this year we have the (50-over) World Cup. Because a lot of focus will be on the 50-over World Cup, and the World Test Championship, at least the T20 games that we have, it probably gives us the opportunity to try out a lot of the younger guys.” India are fielding a new-look side comprising youngsters including Shivam Mavi, Umran Malik, Shubman Gill and Rahul Tripathi. “Hopefully give them opportunities and just back and support them. I think we’ve got to be patient with a lot of these young kids. If you look at this team, there are a lot of youngsters playing, especially our bowling attack. “We all need to be patient with them and we need to be understanding that games like this can happen.” With openers Ishan Kishan and Gill and Tripathi — playing his debut match — not firing, Dravid defended them, saying they’ve only played a couple of games, and asserted that no chopping and changing will take place for the Rajkot game. —PTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2023-01-06 18:46:47","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Yorkshire facing uncertain future with Lord Patel to stand down as chairman","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/06/lord-patel-to-stand-down-as-yorkshire-chairman-in-march","keywords":["Yorkshire","Cricket","Sport","ECB"],"creator":["Simon Burnton"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chairman to leave in March after ‘sobering’ 16 months in chargePatel ‘surprised and disappointed’ at lack of contact from ECBYorkshire have announced that Kamlesh Patel is to step down as chair in March after a wildly dramatic and sometimes controversial 16 months in the role.

Our policy, in general, is that we maintain strong support of our international and contracted players playing in domestic leagues where this helps their development, provides cricket during gaps in our calendar and provides additional income for the player. “We release players to play in a high-quality domestic franchise event which the selectors deem beneficial to the player’s development, and which do not compromise the national team’s performance or development. We will generally not release players after a squad selection has been announced. Franchise cricket opportunities have become an increasing feature of modern-day cricket, so we remain somewhat flexible in our response to offers that arise, but in general we will maintain an ‘Ireland-first’ policy when the potential for conflict arises. “Our approach also allows us to blood new players who might not otherwise get game time for Ireland.

It’s why we get him back every year, to win games like that.”Despite the controversy, veteran Dan Christian clipped the ball off his pads for a boundary, securing the Sixers a six-wicket win.Daniel Hughes (28 off 22) and Moises Henriques (23 off 14) also played key roles in the run chase.Earlier, Marcus Stoinis continued his return to form with a powerful 52 runs from just 28 balls, lifting the Stars to a total of 5-173.Stoinis blitzed seven fours and two sixes, with coach Dave Hussey claiming the Stars had started to get back to their “blue collar Stars cricket”.The Stars cruised through the powerplay and for just the third time this season, did not lose a wicket in the opening four overs.They lost Englishman Joe Clarke shortly after however, when Sixers keeper Josh Philippe juggled and held on to a catch off the bowling of Naveed.Sean Abbott was the pick of the Sixers bowlers taking 3/31 from his four overs.The loss means the Stars are languishing on the bottom of the table, with just two wins to show from the season so far.Records tumble in impossible chase after no-ball drama— Jason PhelanSomething special happened at Adelaide Oval on Thursday night.Chasing the Hobart Hurricanes’ equal season-high total of 4-229, the Adelaide Strikers pulled off the biggest run chase in BBL history to score a stunning seven-wicket win.In a night of enthralling twists and turns, Matt Short hit the winning runs with three balls to spare.Short’s boundary was greeted by thunderous applause from the home fans and brought up his maiden BBL century from 59 balls.It was a fitting end to a truly remarkable contest, which was also Rashid Khan’s last game of the season.The Hurricanes would have been confident of a win after notching their highest total in franchise history, but the Strikers were up to the task.HAVE A BATWith Peter Siddle out with a back injury, stand-in skipper Short won the bat flip and made the brave decision to give an opening pairing that blasted 86 runs from 8.1 overs against his side three days ago first use of a good batting pitch.It looked an error early, but Short knew what he was doing on a pitch that flattened as the night wore on.Openers Ben McDermott and Caleb Jewell flayed the attack to all parts of Adelaide Oval, McDermott’s 57 from 30 balls including three fours and four sixes and Jewell’s 54 from 25 balls including seven fours and three sixes.Zak Crawley, fresh from England’s Test tour of Pakistan, joined the party in his first game with an unbeaten 54.The in-form pair launched the innings with gusto, with 38 runs of a team season-high power play total of 48 coming in boundaries.The opening partnership ended on 88 runs when Jewell was caught off the second ball of the seventh over.The ‘Canes were 1-112 with 10 overs gone, with their innings including 18 fours and 14 sixes.BASH BROTHERSAmazingly, the Strikers were 1-111 at the same point in their run chase after Chris Lynn formed a new Bash Brothers partnership with Short.The pair smacked nine fours and seven sixes in an equal season-high partnership of 124 to have the home fans believing something special might be afoot.NO BALL!The visitors looked set to regain the upper hand when Tim David pulled off a superb outfield catch to dismiss Adam Hose in the 17th over.But with the Englishman on his way back to the dugout the umpires called for a review of Faheem’s delivery, which was deemed a no ball.Instead of being 3-180, Hose was called back and smoked the free hit for six to make it 36 runs required from the last three overs.The equation dropped to 25 from the last two overs, then 12 from the final over, with Short sealing a historic victory.No-ball pollWE’LL MISS YOU, RASHMuch-loved spinner Rashid departs for the new South Africa T20 League where he will captain MI Cape Town.The master spinner’s eight matches perhaps didn’t produce as many wickets or runs as he’s accustomed to, but his mesmerising deliveries and helicopter shots were no less entertaining.His best figures of 3-21 came in the season opener against the Sixers, with his highest score an unbeaten 24 against the Stars on New Year’s Eve.The 24-year-old finished the tournament with six wickets.Rashid’s bid to become the fastest bowler to 100 BBL wickets will have to wait until next season, the Afghan superstar with 98 wickets from 69 games after he finished with figures of 0-25 against the ‘Canes.","pubDate":"2023-01-06 11:29:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'I can dab, I can do what I want!': Khawaja on celebrations | Alinta News Wrap -

Sri Lanka captain Shanaka smashed 56 runs off 22 balls with 2 fours and 6 sixes. The score went from 113/4 to 206 runs. The fact that Hardik Pandya was just showing body language during these periods and did not think he would bowl for the team even if he was injured raises questions about his selfishness. Hardik Pandya, who gave only 2 over 13 runs, why is he afraid? One is the fear of injury, if I can’t play in the IPL it will be a “disaster”! If another one ends up getting hit, his market value will decrease, how much trouble will poor Hardik Pandya have?! Batting too, he hit 12 balls for 15 runs with a six and a four. So 10 runs have come in 2 balls. He has scored only 5 runs in 10 balls, this is how smart strike rate should be seen in T20 cricket. On the contrary, Sri Lankan captain Shanaka smashed 56 off 22 balls and bowled the last over as captain to bowl Akshar Patel and Shivam Mavi to win. Why would Shanaka have given one over left to Hazaranga and given a pep talk that we are preparing our players for this! He didn’t. This is the difference between the likes of Hardik and the likes of Shanaka. How many matches has Dhoni carried the responsibility on his head and finished? How many matches has Kohli won? An all-rounder constantly shirking his responsibilities, that too as a captain, does not augur well for the future of the Indian team. Hardik Pandya is more accomplished than Dhoni, but he doesn’t really have the flair or spirit for captaincy, except for his body language drama. What does Hardik Pandya mean by calling Arshdeep Singh’s noballs a ‘crime’ and shirking responsibility without bowling? Arshdeep Singh’s no-balls! – First we have to ask Dravid in an interview whether he will explain the Indian team selection confusion, why Siraj is not in the team, Kuldeep Yadav is not? Why not give a fast bowler like Umran Malik a new ball? What is the magic of continuing in the team even if Sehal is beaten? Who makes the decision to ‘sit’ Kuldeep Yadav who took 8 wickets and 40 runs? What’s going on in the team? Can someone explain? The media that should be questioned is plowing through statistical illusions. Arshdeep Singh last played in November 2022, why should he be included in the squad while he is recovering from an ill health? Why should Siraj in Pharm be seated? Rahul Dravid and skipper Hardik Pandya are picking the team without knowing that Arshdeep Singh’s biggest problem is no-bagal. Arshdeep Singh has bowled 14 no-balls in T20s since his debut, including 5 no-balls yesterday. Arshdeep Singh’s no-balls were the reason why Gusal Mendis got up with his bat yesterday. Sri Lanka were 7/0 at the last ball of the 2nd over. Mendis was batting hard when Arshdeep brought in 3 no-balls in a row, Mendis hit a boundary and a six on the free hit to reach 19 runs in that over. After this, Pandya did not give him the next over. Can we give him the 19th over at such a crucial stage? This time Shanaka was caught by him but it was a no-ball. This is the 4th no-ball. At that time, Shanaka scored 30 runs off 14 balls and was in semi-touch. Arshdeep gave him life with a no-ball. Shanaka smashed 22 runs off the next 8 balls to take the score past 200 runs. Hardik Pandya called on the inexperienced Umran Malik to bowl before the 19th over, his yorkers still unsharpened. Due to this, he gave away 21 runs in that over. After 2 overs in the power play, Umran Malik should be finished with 1 over in the 10th over and 1 over in the 12th. But Hardik Pandya doesn’t seem to know!! Our question is why should we select unfit bowlers in the team as if they are not on the bench. So many questions arise after Rahul Dravid took charge of coaching, will he rise to the leadership of BCCI? Unknown Both are from Karnataka. Expect Rahul Dravid’s coaching skills to be in question in the upcoming Test series against Australia.","pubDate":"2023-01-06 08:37:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Indian Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra urges BCCI to provide psychological support to Pant","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/indian-olympic-gold-medallist-abhinav-bindra-urges-bcci-to-provide-psychological-support-to-pant-631781","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bindra urges BCCI to provide “psychological support” to injured India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant in his recovery post a horrific car accident.","content":"NEW DELHI: Abhinav Bindra, who won India's first individual gold medal in the Olympics, has urged the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to provide \"psychological support\" to injured India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant in his recovery post a horrific car accident.As per a BCCI statement on Wednesday, Pant is set to undergo surgery and subsequent procedures for ligament tears at the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Medical Research Institute in Mumbai, for which he was airlifted from Max Hospital, Dehradun.

The first batch, composed of cricketers who are not the part of the ongoing T20 Series, will land in Guwahati on January 7. The remaining cricketers and Sri Lanka team will touch down in the city next day evening, January 8. After a long time Assam cricket Association is going to host an ODI at the ACA Stadium, Barsapara. Last time a ODI was held at the same venue in 2018 where Kohli-led India won against West Indies by 8 wickets. India chased 323 successfully with centuries from Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. Addressing a media gathering the president of the Assam Cricket Association Taranga Gogoi said, \"As per the itinerary sent by the BCCI Indian team will arrive in the city in two parts. In the first batch those cricketers will arrive on January 7 who are not the part of the current T20I series. Other team members and the Sri Lanka team will reach on January 8. Both the teams will attend the net session on January 9.\" Meanwhile the sale of the tickets for the forthcoming match is going on full swing. Gogoi informed that around 17,000 tickets were sold out. \"We had started to sell the tickets in December and around 10,000 tickets were already sold online through bookmy show. Another 7000 tickets are purchased by the cricket lovers through our affiliated district units across the state. We have already opened one offline ticket counter at the Nehru Stadium and hope that the remaining tickets will be finished very soon,\" Gogoi said. It may be mentioned here that although the capacity of the ACA Stadium is nearly 34,000 but around 27,000 tickets are kept reserved for the common spectators. This time the minimum price of the ticket is Rs 1500 and highest is Rs 6,000. The price of a student ticket is fixed at Rs 475. Meanwhile the preparation of the match is going on full swing at the ACA Stadium. The ACA officials felt that the game is a crucial one for them as the association is on the line to host a few games in next edition of IPL and also a contender to host the 50-over World cup match which India will host this year. Highlighting the point Gogoi said, \"We are trying our best to provide every facility that is mentioned in the guidelines so that players and the crowds don't face any trouble during the match day. We are the strong contender to host a few IPL games this season and also the World cup Cricket which India will host this year. Several upgradation works are going on in various areas and we are optimistic that ACA will host the match successfully.\" The joint secretary of the ACA Rajendra Singh and treasurer Chiranjib Langthasa also attended the media briefing along with the other officials of the organization.

But in the end, the task was too stiff for the Gujarat batter who played some sensational shots including three sixes off successive deliveries in the 14th over. Dasun Shanaka got him out in the final over as India's hopes ended. India looked in deep trouble after losing four wickets for 34 runs and it became 57/5 in the 10th over before Yadav and Patel came together for a 91-run partnership that had the 30,460 spectators rocking and cheering. However, in the end, it proved too good to last as they were restricted to 190/8, falling short by 16 runs as Sri Lanka levelled the three-match series 1-1. Earlier, opener Kiusal Mendis and skipper Dasun Shanaka blasted quick-fire half-centuries as Sri Lanka powered to 206/6 off 20 overs. Mendis hammered a 31-ball 52 and Shanaka raced to an unbeaten 56 off 22 balls, hitting the fastest fifty on this ground off 20 deliveries as Sri Lanka made merry against an Indian attack that struggled to make a mark. After Mendis had given the visitors a good start by racing to his fifty off 27 deliveries on being asked to bat first, Shanaka went better as he blazed to a half-century off 20 balls -- both of them feasting on some ineffective medium-pace bowling. Shanaka was totally dominant in the death overs and with Charith Asalanka hammering a 19-ball 37, Sri Lanka blasted 77 runs for loss of two wickets in the last five overs, thus reaching the second-highest score on this ground. For India, Umran Malik claimed 3-48 while Axar Patel took 2-24. Shivam Mavi, the hero of India's 2-run victory in the first match, conceded 53 runs without success in four overs while Arshdeep, who was brought in place of Harshal Patel, gave away 37 runs off two overs, sending down five no-balls in the process. Brief scores: Sri Lanka 206/6 in 20 overs (Kusal Mendis 52, Dasun Shanaka 56 not out, Charith Asalanka 37, Pathum Nissanka 33; Umran Malik 3-48, Axar Patel 2-24) beat India ?190/8 in 20 overs (Suryakumar Yadav 51, Axar Patel 65, Shivam Mavi 26; Dasun Shanaka 2-4, Kasun Rajitha 2-22, Dilshan Madushanka 2-45) by 16 runs.

Sydney Sixers won the toss and opted to bowl first on a brilliant track at the MCG. However, a couple of BBL 12 games are played here already, and they are won by the teams batting first. Melbourne Stars need a win here in order to kickstart their campaign again. This will be Trent Boult’s last BBL match, and he would want to make it count for the Stars. Joe Clarke has batted really well, but he will need good support from Marcus Stoinis here at the MCG. Sydney Sixers have been really good in the tournament so far, and they are certainly a team to beat in the tournament. With Daniel Hughes’ arrival, the batting of the side has become a lot more potent. The bowlers of the side have been great as well so far in the tournament. Why is Ben Dwarshuis not playing today’s BBL 12 match Sydney Sixers have made a couple of changes in their playing 11 for the match against Melbourne Stars at the MCG. Ben Dwarshius and Steve O’Keefe have been replaced by Todd Murphy and Izharulhaq Naveed. Both Dwarshius and O’Keefe are important players in the Sixers’ setup. Here is our playing XI for tonight’s match against the Stars in Melbourne! We have won the bat flip and are bowling first. #BBL12 pic.twitter.com/mOmCXaGwN7 — Sydney Sixers (@SixersBBL) January 6, 2023 The left-arm pacer Dwarshius has scalped 7 wickets in the tournament so far, and he has been leading the attack of the side for the last few seasons. There are no injury concerns reported and the Sixers rotate their pacers in every match in order to maintain their workload, and the same can be the reason here as well. The players like Sean Abbott, Chris Jordan and Jackson Bird have also been rested in between. Additionally, the bigger boundaries of the MCG may have also tempted the side to play with a couple of spinners in this match. The duo of Murphy and Naveed can be an interesting one to watch out for.
