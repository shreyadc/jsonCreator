India and South Africa recently concluded their Test series, ending in a 1-1 draw. While India lost the first Test by an innings and 32 runs, they made a comeback to seal a seven-wicket win in a match at Cape Town which lasted just two days. India ended the SA tour without losing in any format, registering 2-1 series wins in ODIs and T20Is, with several youngsters performing well. The Test series drew criticism from fans and cricketers for featuring only two matches. On his YouTube channel, De Villiers said, “I am not happy with the fact that there is not a third Test. You have to blame the T20 cricket going around the world for that. I do not know exactly whom to blame but I definitely sense something is wrong. If you want to see all the teams compete and see who is the best Test team in the world, something has to change.” On the Proteas’ selection for the New Zealand tour, consisting of two Tests, which coincide with the second season of SA20 from January 10 to February 10, the former batter said that Test cricket is under pressure and the system is turning towards T20 cricket. Proteas named a 14-player squad for their two-match Test series against New Zealand next month. Uncapped batter Neil Brand has been named as the skipper along with six uncapped players in the squad. The changes have been imposed due to the SA20 and the Test series being held simultaneously where most of the contracted Test players will feature. The first Test will start from February 4 while the second Test from February 13 onwards. “It has sent shockwaves around the cricketing world and has made it clear that Test cricket is under pressure, for that matter even ODI cricket and the whole system is turning around T20 cricket. The players, the board and coaches will turn towards where there is more money. You cannot blame them for thinking about their future with their family. That is ultimately what it comes down to,” he said. Talking about the pitch at Cape Town for the second Test against India, De Villiers said, “It (Cape Town) was a pretty stock-standard wicket in my opinion. I remember jumping around there on Day 1. If you can just get through the first session on Day 1, it gets easier. If you see the players who were playing their shots and not hanging around, they were the ones doing well.” “I remember Ben Stokes scoring a double hundred there. I myself scored some hundreds there. You cannot allow bowlers like Vernon Philander, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Kagiso Rabada to keep bowling on off-stump,” he concluded.

Players lined up to shake hands with the women dressed in pink, but footage shows Rizwan opting against the handshake and continuing walking. Cricket fans and pundits were quick to notice the incident and took to social media to criticise the wicketkeeper. 'All Pakistan players shook hands with female members in Glenn McGrath's family but Mohammad Rizwan didn't,' posted cricket journalist Farid Khan.

All Pakistan players shook hands with female members in Glenn McGrath's family but Mohammad Rizwan didn't 💯 #AUSvPAK pic.twitter.com/uxxCzcja8v — Farid Khan (@_FaridKhan) January 6, 2024 Rizwan copped criticism for his decision to not shake hands on the pink carpet 'That's discrimination against woman,' commented a third. Others didn't see a problem with his actions. 'Didn't have to, as long as he showed appreciation for the charity cause,' one fan commented. 'Mohammad Rizwan is great man,' replied another. Rizwan (28) and Aamir Jamal (18) put up some resistance on Saturday morning, putting on 42 for the eighth wicket. But when Nathan Lyon (3-36) had Rizwan caught at leg slip, they folded quickly. The win cements Australia's newly crowned status as the world's No.1-ranked Test team, with two matches against West Indies to come later in January. Pakistan captain Shan Masood gifted retiring David Warner Babar Azam's signed jersey after the match. Rizwan put on 28 runs on Saturday morning against the Aussies at the SCG The Pakistan team presented Warner with Babar Azam's shirt as a parting gift Masood asked the veteran opener to join him on stage during the post-match ceremony and presented him with the gift. 'If we could just give as a token of appreciation and as a parting gift to David Warner,' he said. 'If he can come up to the stage, please. We just thought the whole squad would give you Babar Azam's shirt as a gesture as a parting gift, and we wish you all the best in your future endeavours.' Warner was impressed with the classy gesture and thanked the Pakistani team.

Perry has been an integral part of the Australian side in their multiple World Cup triumphs. She is among the greatest players to have ever played the sport. Perry is now on the brink of creating an all-time record for Australia. The all-rounder is set to become the first from her country to appear in 300 International matches. Australian women's cricket has seen several stalwarts embracing the game but none other so far has been able to touch the elusive 300-game mark. The 33-year-old all-rounder will mark the historic game in the 2nd T20I against India on Sunday in Navi Mumbai. Meanwhile, Perry is open to playing even 400 games for her country. Speaking ahead of the match, she said that she is open to keep going for Australia. \"I don't know what's in store ...but if it's meant to be down the track and I'm still around playing ...I'm really open to what happens,\" she said. \"I don't have a set time frame on it. Either way, it doesn't really matter, it's just another number. For as long as I can contribute to the team and it's something I find really motivating and enjoyable, I'd love to be here,\" Perry added. India and Australia are currently taking on each other in an all-format series at the former's home. The Women in Blue registered a historic first Test win over Australia last month, while the Aussies have clean-swept the ODI series. 's team defeated the Alyssa Healy-led side in the first T20I and now are on the brink of a series win. This Australian team is a one with the post-Meg Lanning era and the legacy left behind by the most successful captain ever. Alyssa Healy is the full-time captain and a rising prodigy - Phoebe Litchfield has been impressing everyone a lot. \"It's a great time for us, of evolution. You've seen a lot of that in the way that Phoebe Litchfield has performed in those one-day matches; Annabel Sutherland, her last 12 months,\" Perry added further. \"That's something we're incredibly conscious of - (to) maintain the success we've had, but equally evolve that, to look a little bit different in the way the team plays. The game is moving at such a rapid pace. There's a new environment. In a lot of ways the sky's the limit in terms of where it can go,\" she said.","pubDate":"2024-01-07 03:56:18","image_url":"https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2024/01/kohli-92-1704599750.jpg","source_id":"indiatvnews","source_priority":10055,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"afd1feb026a867b71deee4f34af9b90f","title":"Leander Paes on Hall of Fame induction — ‘My parents’ encouragement and constant love are the reasons I could achieve it all’","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/tennis/leander-paes-interview-tennis-hall-of-fame-interview-records-opinion/article67702417.ece","keywords":["tennis"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Leander Paes, who won 18 Grand Slam titles in men’s and mixed doubles, has been elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.","content":"Leander Paes reflects as the winter sun fades in Kolkata, the city where his childhood aspirations of tennis greatness took root. From the penthouse of an iconic building, he gazes over the vast green expanse known as the Maidan, lost in a flood of memories. The Maidan, home to major city clubs, holds a special place in Leander’s heart, where he accompanied his accomplished athlete parents and found the inspiration to become a champion himself. Leander shared with the significance of being the first male player from Asia to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame (player category). He dedicated this prestigious award to his greatest motivators — his parents — and the millions of Indians who supported him. I always like to lead by example, and this, I hope, inspires all the youth in our country and shows them that from playing gully cricket or playing gully football barefoot, I could come so far. So, if they have enough passion and can work hard, they, too, can get into the Hall of Fame. It’s about telling them that if you believe in yourself and put in the hard work, it is possible to fulfil your dreams. Being the first Asian male to be nominated in the player’s category, it’s a tribute that I would like to give to my parents. Their encouragement and constant love are the reasons I could achieve it all. They allowed an 11-year-old boy to leave home and pursue his dreams. That’s not common in Indian culture, and that too in a sport like tennis, where India has never had a Grand Slam winner before me. The sport did not have an Olympic champion before me, so it was not easy for them to allow me to chase my dreams. Allowing your child to pursue disciplines like cricket or hockey was one thing but allowing him to pursue a global sport like tennis, where the risks are so high, was not easy. I appreciate my parents for their love, unconditional support, and belief in what I was trying to achieve. I dedicate this to them. Being born into a legacy is a great responsibility. I could understand, at a very young age, what that responsibility meant. It was more about playing for my family and trying to emulate what my father had achieved (Vece Paes won the 1972 Olympic bronze in hockey). It was also about representing my school, city, and the wishes of more than a billion people in my country. The responsibility became even bigger as I had to achieve excellence in a sport that did not have the infrastructure when I was growing up in the 1980s. There were no Grand Slam champions or even Asian champions to pave the path for me. Yes, there were a lot of good players like Ramanathan Krishnan, who served as a good role model, and I was lucky to travel with his son Ramesh. I am also grateful to the Amritraj family, who supported me a lot with the BAT junior programme that helped nurture my junior career. But there was no system in place to guide me on how to win Wimbledon or an Olympic medal. My dream was to win an Olympic medal and prove to Indians that we could be world champions. For the people, of the people: “For me, it was about representing my school, city, and the wishes of more than a billion people in my country,” says Paes. | Photo Credit: DEBASISH BHADURI I think champions are first made in the mind. Physical prowess is just a repetition of perfect practice. By doing 10,000 hours and three million repetitions, you can master anything. It takes about 10 years. The reason that I had a long career (of 38 years, including the junior years) was because of the repetition of gym, push-ups, skipping, yoga, meditation, recovery, and the relentless practice in various aspects of the game. When I won one Grand Slam, people said it was a fluke. Then I did it the second time, and they called it a fluke again. I won the four slams on all the surfaces after that, and it continued, and now I am sitting on 20 Slam titles (Two junior singles Grand Slams and 18 senior doubles Grand Slams). It was a humbling experience, and it was the determination to prove myself again and again that got me to the position where I stand now. Champions are made of intelligence, grit, passion to live out big dreams, and the ability to stand up every time you fall. Champions are made of special stuff, and it is all out there in the mind. The ability to make a simple decision under pressure is what separates champions from normal sportspersons. You can get lucky once, but repeating that success over and over again is what makes a champion. I had a simple and single-minded dream, and that was to prove to the world that, as Indians, we could win Olympic medals in individual sports. We had medals in field hockey, but in individual sporting events, it was a long wait since KD Jadhav’s bronze medal in 1952. There were no guidelines that could teach us how to win and be successful in an individual sport like tennis. So, becoming a pioneer in that field took great hardships. I hitch-hiked through Europe, and I had to sleep in locker rooms as there was no money to book a hotel room. I was even mugged in New York, but those things only kept me going. It was a journey to be the only Indian on tour for a large part because, by then, Ramanathan Krishnan had retired, as had Vijay (Amritraj) and Ramesh (Krishnan). Before I picked Mahesh (Bhupathi) for doubles, there were no other Indians, so travelling alone on ATP tours was not easy. Hundred per cent! I see that scar every single time I put on a match shirt. Every single night I went to bed, missing home, I reminded myself of the years of sacrifice and the hard work I had already put in. There was no other option for me but to be successful. I grew up in a generation where Indian athletes were perceived to be submissive and a bit soft, and that’s one of the reasons why I became so rugged. That’s one of the reasons why I could come back from losing matches or get through the hard years of missing home. It was not easy to be far away from home and miss out on several festivals and occasions, be it birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, New Year’s, or Diwali. I gave up my whole youth and a lot of family life for 38 years and dedicated everything to my sport and craft. Everything was dedicated to my country and our people. I feel sad right now, looking at the state of Indian tennis. It’s sad to see that the tradition has not been continued. That being said, I have tremendous respect for the players who, without funding, a support system, or any real guidance, are still out there, persevering to pursue a professional tennis career, even though there are so many other options that are out there that are even better or safer. So, it almost seems like it has come back to square one. I played across three decades, but now we are back to a phase where individuals are trying to muster up the courage, the finances, the knowledge, and the support system to be even out there. Individual tennis players have come out and said, ‘I need funding’ and that’s a sad realisation. Tennis is one of the toughest sports on the planet. As a sport, it is demanding, and it’s also hard physically, mentally, and financially.

RAGU When you are looking at any form of funding, people are looking for returns on that funding. They’re not running a charity. They’re looking for some sort of marketing behind it, some sort of publicity behind it, and some sort of return on the money that they spend on it. Otherwise, they would rather put it in the equity market, where they get a solid return. So, in that sense, it’s also an ecosystem that needs to be created, not just for tennis but for all Olympic sports. The BCCI is doing a phenomenal job with the system that they’ve created to not just look after their past champions and their past cricketers, but to also nurture the present athletes and, more importantly, to create over 100,000 cricket clubs around the country. Today, I would be surprised if there were even 100,000 tennis players in the country! And here, you have 100,000 cricket clubs, so a minimum of 11 in each club. So, you see the numbers that are being churned and produced. Very much like tennis, cricket is not a cheap sport; you need a kit, and then there are coaching, diet, and transportation costs. BCCI’s model can be replicated by the governing bodies of other sports. I don’t want to get into that because, in that, there are also different perspectives. Everyone has different perspectives and different thought processes. So, I am not the best one to answer that question. I just know that when I had an obstacle, I would just persevere and work tremendously hard with my family to find a solution. My expertise lies in the nurturing of talent and sports education. So, I have a business model where I am taking my father’s (Dr Vece Paes) sixty years of sports science, my Olympic-winning mentality knowledge, and clubbing knowledge and spreading it to the youth of the entire country through sports education in schools, colleges, tier-2 and tier-3 centres, and in rural areas. I think our real sporting talent lies in those rural areas. In the metros, the kids have more options — eSports or gaming — but the options are still limited in rural areas. So, that’s where I want to cater. I want to go out there, recognise talents, test those talents, nurture them, and ensure that they are injury-free with the help of sports science. It’s a long process, as you are picking kids when they are young, and it takes hours and hours to create champions out of them. (Laughs) I get calls from Prajnesh (Gunneswaran), and he would ask about his equipment or from Arjun Kadhe, who talks about his fitness regime. I get calls from a lot of youngsters who ask about their physical fitness, mental fitness, or diet, but it’s just that we don’t speak about it. That’s personal friendship. Tsitipas’ manager called me to work with him, and it was a learning experience. But at the end of the day, my work involves the masses, and it’s about going out there and nurturing talents. One has lived at the top of the pyramid for three decades, so he knows how to pick athletes as and when they develop and create a winning atmosphere for them. So, whether it was speaking to RVS Rathore at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics about the mental side of things or when he finally won his medal, he said, ‘Hey Lee, thanks so much…’, so those are the things you do out of friendship. You are asking me, What’s wrong with tennis today? Where’s the feeder system? In football, hockey, and javelin, where’s the feeder system? In such a huge country, how many have access to world-class tennis facilities? I am not talking about the infrastructure needed to play sports; I am not talking about the maidans. I am talking about the systematic training academy or high-performance centres that would pick talents at the age of 10 or 12 and tell that person that they will stick with them for the next 20 years and make them a champion. You look at countries like England, Spain, and Holland and their approaches to football. Or look at Australia and how they excel in every Olympic sport — the reason they have won six cricket World Cups is because there’s a tradition there. Sport is a big part of their education curriculum, but that’s not the case here. The infrastructure of sports has developed a lot in our country. The synthetic turfs have been introduced, we have floodlights, and the gyms are being used a lot more. But I think it’s one thing to go to the gym to become a professional athlete and a world champion, and it’s completely different to play the sport at an amateur level. However, that differentiation is not being recognised. There’s a huge difference between the two, and we need to understand that. My realisation as a young boy was to achieve an Olympic medal in an individual sport. Not many people understood it, let alone wanted to realise that achievement for themselves. Not many people were willing to put in those hard yards or go through the lifestyle it takes to compete at seven Olympics. People didn’t understand it, so obviously people misunderstood me. The purpose that I had was basically to rewrite history books. Ironically, we’re having this conversation when I’m being inducted into the Hall of Fame. I can’t expect people to understand what my journey was. I felt it was better to lead by example than waste time explaining it. I lived my life the best I could, and when I decided to shift to doubles and mixed doubles after enjoying success in singles, it came with the belief that we could win Grand Slams. And today, sitting here having won two junior singles Grand Slams and 18 senior doubles Grand Slams is a satisfying feeling. I have been very blessed to have had a phenomenal career, and I dedicate it to my team, which has been with me through thick and thin. In times like these, where everyone is busy projecting an image, on social media or in public, I just let my racquet do the talking.

Agence France-Presse January 07, 2024 09:23:25 IST Sri Lanka's Charith Asalanka celebrates scoring a century during the first ODI against Zimbabwe. AP Rain put an early finish to Sri Lanka’s opening one-day match against Zimbabwe on Saturday, with Zimbabwe struggling on 12-2 after four overs when the downpour hit. Play was called off at 9:00 pm local time (1330 GMT) after left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka dismissed opener Tinashe Kamunhukamwe for a first-ball duck. Madushanka, who was sold for $553,000 to Mumbai Indians in December’s IPL auction, claimed a second wicket in the same over when he had captain Craig Ervine caught at first slip by Sahan Arachchige. Both of Madushanka’s overs were maidens.

Opener Avishka Fernando departed for none from five balls in the first over, leaving Kusal Mendis (46) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (41) to post a 63-run stand. But the pair failed to make the most of their starts, with Samarawickrama offering a gentle catch to first slip and Mendis run out. Left-hander Asalanka stitched several partnerships with the lower order including a 52-run eighth-wicket stand with Dushmantha Chameera to keep Sri Lanka in the hunt before he was run out in the final over. Richard Ngarava was the pick of the Zimbabwe bowlers after early breakthroughs with the new ball, finishing 2-39 after claiming Fernando and Samarawickrama. The left-arm seamer came back for a second spell in the death overs but had to withdraw after sending down just four deliveries due to cramps. The teams will play two more one-day matches on Monday and Thursday followed by three T20 games, all in Colombo.

India and South Africa recently concluded their Test series, ending in a 1-1 draw. While India lost the first Test by an innings and 32 runs, they made a comeback to seal a seven-wicket win in a match at Cape Town which lasted just two days. India ended the SA tour without losing in any format, registering 2-1 series wins in ODIs and T20Is, with several youngsters performing well. The Test series drew criticism from fans and cricketers for featuring only two matches. On his YouTube channel, De Villiers said, “I am not happy with the fact that there is not a third Test. You have to blame the T20 cricket going around the world for that. I do not know exactly whom to blame but I definitely sense something is wrong. If you want to see all the teams compete and see who is the best Test team in the world, something has to change.” On the Proteas’ selection for the New Zealand tour, consisting of two Tests, which coincide with the second season of SA20 from January 10 to February 10, the former batter said that Test cricket is under pressure and the system is turning towards T20 cricket. Proteas named a 14-player squad for their two-match Test series against New Zealand next month. Uncapped batter Neil Brand has been named as the skipper along with six uncapped players in the squad. The changes have been imposed due to the SA20 and the Test series being held simultaneously where most of the contracted Test players will feature. The first Test will start from February 4 while the second Test from February 13 onwards. “It has sent shockwaves around the cricketing world and has made it clear that Test cricket is under pressure, for that matter even ODI cricket and the whole system is turning around T20 cricket. The players, the board and coaches will turn towards where there is more money. You cannot blame them for thinking about their future with their family. That is ultimately what it comes down to,” he said. Talking about the pitch at Cape Town for the second Test against India, De Villiers said, “It (Cape Town) was a pretty stock-standard wicket in my opinion. I remember jumping around there on Day 1. If you can just get through the first session on Day 1, it gets easier. If you see the players who were playing their shots and not hanging around, they were the ones doing well.” “I remember Ben Stokes scoring a double hundred there. I myself scored some hundreds there. You cannot allow bowlers like Vernon Philander, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Kagiso Rabada to keep bowling on off-stump,” he concluded.

Players lined up to shake hands with the women dressed in pink, but footage shows Rizwan opting against the handshake and continuing walking. Cricket fans and pundits were quick to notice the incident and took to social media to criticise the wicketkeeper. 'All Pakistan players shook hands with female members in Glenn McGrath's family but Mohammad Rizwan didn't,' posted cricket journalist Farid Khan. 'Wow disrespecting women.. what a shame, posted popular cricket page Drinks Break. All Pakistan players shook hands with female members in Glenn McGrath's family but Mohammad Rizwan didn't 💯 #AUSvPAK pic.twitter.com/uxxCzcja8v — Farid Khan (@_FaridKhan) January 6, 2024 Rizwan copped criticism for his decision to not shake hands on the pink carpet 'That's discrimination against woman,' commented a third. Others didn't see a problem with his actions. 'Didn't have to, as long as he showed appreciation for the charity cause,' one fan commented. 'Mohammad Rizwan is great man,' replied another. Rizwan (28) and Aamir Jamal (18) put up some resistance on Saturday morning, putting on 42 for the eighth wicket. But when Nathan Lyon (3-36) had Rizwan caught at leg slip, they folded quickly. The win cements Australia's newly crowned status as the world's No.1-ranked Test team, with two matches against West Indies to come later in January. Pakistan captain Shan Masood gifted retiring David Warner Babar Azam's signed jersey after the match. Rizwan put on 28 runs on Saturday morning against the Aussies at the SCG The Pakistan team presented Warner with Babar Azam's shirt as a parting gift Masood asked the veteran opener to join him on stage during the post-match ceremony and presented him with the gift. 'If we could just give as a token of appreciation and as a parting gift to David Warner,' he said. 'If he can come up to the stage, please. We just thought the whole squad would give you Babar Azam's shirt as a gesture as a parting gift, and we wish you all the best in your future endeavours.' Warner was impressed with the classy gesture and thanked the Pakistani team.

Perry has been an integral part of the Australian side in their multiple World Cup triumphs. She is among the greatest players to have ever played the sport. Perry is now on the brink of creating an all-time record for Australia. The all-rounder is set to become the first from her country to appear in 300 International matches. Australian women's cricket has seen several stalwarts embracing the game but none other so far has been able to touch the elusive 300-game mark. The 33-year-old all-rounder will mark the historic game in the 2nd T20I against India on Sunday in Navi Mumbai. Meanwhile, Perry is open to playing even 400 games for her country. Speaking ahead of the match, she said that she is open to keep going for Australia. \"I don't know what's in store ...but if it's meant to be down the track and I'm still around playing ...I'm really open to what happens,\" she said. \"I don't have a set time frame on it. Either way, it doesn't really matter, it's just another number. For as long as I can contribute to the team and it's something I find really motivating and enjoyable, I'd love to be here,\" Perry added. India and Australia are currently taking on each other in an all-format series at the former's home. The Women in Blue registered a historic first Test win over Australia last month, while the Aussies have clean-swept the ODI series. 's team defeated the Alyssa Healy-led side in the first T20I and now are on the brink of a series win. This Australian team is a one with the post-Meg Lanning era and the legacy left behind by the most successful captain ever. Alyssa Healy is the full-time captain and a rising prodigy - Phoebe Litchfield has been impressing everyone a lot. \"It's a great time for us, of evolution. You've seen a lot of that in the way that Phoebe Litchfield has performed in those one-day matches; Annabel Sutherland, her last 12 months,\" Perry added further. \"That's something we're incredibly conscious of - (to) maintain the success we've had, but equally evolve that, to look a little bit different in the way the team plays. The game is moving at such a rapid pace. There's a new environment. In a lot of ways the sky's the limit in terms of where it can go,\" she said.","pubDate":"2024-01-07 03:56:18","image_url":"https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2024/01/kohli-92-1704599750.jpg","source_id":"indiatvnews","source_priority":10055,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"afd1feb026a867b71deee4f34af9b90f","title":"Leander Paes on Hall of Fame induction — ‘My parents’ encouragement and constant love are the reasons I could achieve it all’","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/tennis/leander-paes-interview-tennis-hall-of-fame-interview-records-opinion/article67702417.ece","keywords":["tennis"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Leander Paes, who won 18 Grand Slam titles in men’s and mixed doubles, has been elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.","content":"Leander Paes reflects as the winter sun fades in Kolkata, the city where his childhood aspirations of tennis greatness took root. From the penthouse of an iconic building, he gazes over the vast green expanse known as the Maidan, lost in a flood of memories. The Maidan, home to major city clubs, holds a special place in Leander’s heart, where he accompanied his accomplished athlete parents and found the inspiration to become a champion himself. Leander shared with the significance of being the first male player from Asia to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame (player category). He dedicated this prestigious award to his greatest motivators — his parents — and the millions of Indians who supported him. I always like to lead by example, and this, I hope, inspires all the youth in our country and shows them that from playing gully cricket or playing gully football barefoot, I could come so far. So, if they have enough passion and can work hard, they, too, can get into the Hall of Fame. It’s about telling them that if you believe in yourself and put in the hard work, it is possible to fulfil your dreams. Being the first Asian male to be nominated in the player’s category, it’s a tribute that I would like to give to my parents. Their encouragement and constant love are the reasons I could achieve it all. They allowed an 11-year-old boy to leave home and pursue his dreams. That’s not common in Indian culture, and that too in a sport like tennis, where India has never had a Grand Slam winner before me. The sport did not have an Olympic champion before me, so it was not easy for them to allow me to chase my dreams. Allowing your child to pursue disciplines like cricket or hockey was one thing but allowing him to pursue a global sport like tennis, where the risks are so high, was not easy. I appreciate my parents for their love, unconditional support, and belief in what I was trying to achieve. I dedicate this to them. Being born into a legacy is a great responsibility. I could understand, at a very young age, what that responsibility meant. It was more about playing for my family and trying to emulate what my father had achieved (Vece Paes won the 1972 Olympic bronze in hockey). It was also about representing my school, city, and the wishes of more than a billion people in my country. The responsibility became even bigger as I had to achieve excellence in a sport that did not have the infrastructure when I was growing up in the 1980s. There were no Grand Slam champions or even Asian champions to pave the path for me. Yes, there were a lot of good players like Ramanathan Krishnan, who served as a good role model, and I was lucky to travel with his son Ramesh. I am also grateful to the Amritraj family, who supported me a lot with the BAT junior programme that helped nurture my junior career. But there was no system in place to guide me on how to win Wimbledon or an Olympic medal. My dream was to win an Olympic medal and prove to Indians that we could be world champions. For the people, of the people: “For me, it was about representing my school, city, and the wishes of more than a billion people in my country,” says Paes. | Photo Credit: DEBASISH BHADURI I think champions are first made in the mind. Physical prowess is just a repetition of perfect practice. By doing 10,000 hours and three million repetitions, you can master anything. It takes about 10 years. The reason that I had a long career (of 38 years, including the junior years) was because of the repetition of gym, push-ups, skipping, yoga, meditation, recovery, and the relentless practice in various aspects of the game. When I won one Grand Slam, people said it was a fluke. Then I did it the second time, and they called it a fluke again. I won the four slams on all the surfaces after that, and it continued, and now I am sitting on 20 Slam titles (Two junior singles Grand Slams and 18 senior doubles Grand Slams). It was a humbling experience, and it was the determination to prove myself again and again that got me to the position where I stand now. Champions are made of intelligence, grit, passion to live out big dreams, and the ability to stand up every time you fall. Champions are made of special stuff, and it is all out there in the mind. The ability to make a simple decision under pressure is what separates champions from normal sportspersons. You can get lucky once, but repeating that success over and over again is what makes a champion. I had a simple and single-minded dream, and that was to prove to the world that, as Indians, we could win Olympic medals in individual sports. We had medals in field hockey, but in individual sporting events, it was a long wait since KD Jadhav’s bronze medal in 1952. There were no guidelines that could teach us how to win and be successful in an individual sport like tennis. So, becoming a pioneer in that field took great hardships. I hitch-hiked through Europe, and I had to sleep in locker rooms as there was no money to book a hotel room. I was even mugged in New York, but those things only kept me going. It was a journey to be the only Indian on tour for a large part because, by then, Ramanathan Krishnan had retired, as had Vijay (Amritraj) and Ramesh (Krishnan). Before I picked Mahesh (Bhupathi) for doubles, there were no other Indians, so travelling alone on ATP tours was not easy. Hundred per cent! I see that scar every single time I put on a match shirt. Every single night I went to bed, missing home, I reminded myself of the years of sacrifice and the hard work I had already put in. There was no other option for me but to be successful. I grew up in a generation where Indian athletes were perceived to be submissive and a bit soft, and that’s one of the reasons why I became so rugged. That’s one of the reasons why I could come back from losing matches or get through the hard years of missing home. It was not easy to be far away from home and miss out on several festivals and occasions, be it birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, New Year’s, or Diwali. I gave up my whole youth and a lot of family life for 38 years and dedicated everything to my sport and craft. Everything was dedicated to my country and our people. I feel sad right now, looking at the state of Indian tennis. It’s sad to see that the tradition has not been continued. That being said, I have tremendous respect for the players who, without funding, a support system, or any real guidance, are still out there, persevering to pursue a professional tennis career, even though there are so many other options that are out there that are even better or safer. So, it almost seems like it has come back to square one. I played across three decades, but now we are back to a phase where individuals are trying to muster up the courage, the finances, the knowledge, and the support system to be even out there. Individual tennis players have come out and said, ‘I need funding’ and that’s a sad realisation. Tennis is one of the toughest sports on the planet. As a sport, it is demanding, and it’s also hard physically, mentally, and financially.

RAGU When you are looking at any form of funding, people are looking for returns on that funding. They’re not running a charity. They’re looking for some sort of marketing behind it, some sort of publicity behind it, and some sort of return on the money that they spend on it. Otherwise, they would rather put it in the equity market, where they get a solid return. So, in that sense, it’s also an ecosystem that needs to be created, not just for tennis but for all Olympic sports. The BCCI is doing a phenomenal job with the system that they’ve created to not just look after their past champions and their past cricketers, but to also nurture the present athletes and, more importantly, to create over 100,000 cricket clubs around the country. Today, I would be surprised if there were even 100,000 tennis players in the country! And here, you have 100,000 cricket clubs, so a minimum of 11 in each club. So, you see the numbers that are being churned and produced. Very much like tennis, cricket is not a cheap sport; you need a kit, and then there are coaching, diet, and transportation costs. BCCI’s model can be replicated by the governing bodies of other sports. I don’t want to get into that because, in that, there are also different perspectives. Everyone has different perspectives and different thought processes. So, I am not the best one to answer that question. I just know that when I had an obstacle, I would just persevere and work tremendously hard with my family to find a solution. My expertise lies in the nurturing of talent and sports education. So, I have a business model where I am taking my father’s (Dr Vece Paes) sixty years of sports science, my Olympic-winning mentality knowledge, and clubbing knowledge and spreading it to the youth of the entire country through sports education in schools, colleges, tier-2 and tier-3 centres, and in rural areas. I think our real sporting talent lies in those rural areas. In the metros, the kids have more options — eSports or gaming — but the options are still limited in rural areas. So, that’s where I want to cater. I want to go out there, recognise talents, test those talents, nurture them, and ensure that they are injury-free with the help of sports science. It’s a long process, as you are picking kids when they are young, and it takes hours and hours to create champions out of them. (Laughs) I get calls from Prajnesh (Gunneswaran), and he would ask about his equipment or from Arjun Kadhe, who talks about his fitness regime. I get calls from a lot of youngsters who ask about their physical fitness, mental fitness, or diet, but it’s just that we don’t speak about it. That’s personal friendship. Tsitipas’ manager called me to work with him, and it was a learning experience. But at the end of the day, my work involves the masses, and it’s about going out there and nurturing talents. One has lived at the top of the pyramid for three decades, so he knows how to pick athletes as and when they develop and create a winning atmosphere for them. So, whether it was speaking to RVS Rathore at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics about the mental side of things or when he finally won his medal, he said, ‘Hey Lee, thanks so much…’, so those are the things you do out of friendship. You are asking me, What’s wrong with tennis today? Where’s the feeder system? In football, hockey, and javelin, where’s the feeder system? In such a huge country, how many have access to world-class tennis facilities? I am not talking about the infrastructure needed to play sports; I am not talking about the maidans. I am talking about the systematic training academy or high-performance centres that would pick talents at the age of 10 or 12 and tell that person that they will stick with them for the next 20 years and make them a champion. You look at countries like England, Spain, and Holland and their approaches to football. Or look at Australia and how they excel in every Olympic sport — the reason they have won six cricket World Cups is because there’s a tradition there. Sport is a big part of their education curriculum, but that’s not the case here. The infrastructure of sports has developed a lot in our country. The synthetic turfs have been introduced, we have floodlights, and the gyms are being used a lot more. But I think it’s one thing to go to the gym to become a professional athlete and a world champion, and it’s completely different to play the sport at an amateur level. However, that differentiation is not being recognised. There’s a huge difference between the two, and we need to understand that. My realisation as a young boy was to achieve an Olympic medal in an individual sport. Not many people understood it, let alone wanted to realise that achievement for themselves. Not many people were willing to put in those hard yards or go through the lifestyle it takes to compete at seven Olympics. People didn’t understand it, so obviously people misunderstood me. The purpose that I had was basically to rewrite history books. Ironically, we’re having this conversation when I’m being inducted into the Hall of Fame. I can’t expect people to understand what my journey was. I felt it was better to lead by example than waste time explaining it. I lived my life the best I could, and when I decided to shift to doubles and mixed doubles after enjoying success in singles, it came with the belief that we could win Grand Slams. And today, sitting here having won two junior singles Grand Slams and 18 senior doubles Grand Slams is a satisfying feeling. I have been very blessed to have had a phenomenal career, and I dedicate it to my team, which has been with me through thick and thin. In times like these, where everyone is busy projecting an image, on social media or in public, I just let my racquet do the talking.

Agence France-Presse January 07, 2024 09:23:25 IST Sri Lanka's Charith Asalanka celebrates scoring a century during the first ODI against Zimbabwe. AP Rain put an early finish to Sri Lanka’s opening one-day match against Zimbabwe on Saturday, with Zimbabwe struggling on 12-2 after four overs when the downpour hit. Play was called off at 9:00 pm local time (1330 GMT) after left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka dismissed opener Tinashe Kamunhukamwe for a first-ball duck. Madushanka, who was sold for $553,000 to Mumbai Indians in December’s IPL auction, claimed a second wicket in the same over when he had captain Craig Ervine caught at first slip by Sahan Arachchige. Both of Madushanka’s overs were maidens.

Opener Avishka Fernando departed for none from five balls in the first over, leaving Kusal Mendis (46) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (41) to post a 63-run stand. But the pair failed to make the most of their starts, with Samarawickrama offering a gentle catch to first slip and Mendis run out. Left-hander Asalanka stitched several partnerships with the lower order including a 52-run eighth-wicket stand with Dushmantha Chameera to keep Sri Lanka in the hunt before he was run out in the final over. Richard Ngarava was the pick of the Zimbabwe bowlers after early breakthroughs with the new ball, finishing 2-39 after claiming Fernando and Samarawickrama. The left-arm seamer came back for a second spell in the death overs but had to withdraw after sending down just four deliveries due to cramps. The teams will play two more one-day matches on Monday and Thursday followed by three T20 games, all in Colombo.

India and South Africa recently concluded their Test series, ending in a 1-1 draw. While India lost the first Test by an innings and 32 runs, they made a comeback to seal a seven-wicket win in a match at Cape Town which lasted just two days. India ended the SA tour without losing in any format, registering 2-1 series wins in ODIs and T20Is, with several youngsters performing well. The Test series drew criticism from fans and cricketers for featuring only two matches. On his YouTube channel, De Villiers said, “I am not happy with the fact that there is not a third Test. You have to blame the T20 cricket going around the world for that. I do not know exactly whom to blame but I definitely sense something is wrong. If you want to see all the teams compete and see who is the best Test team in the world, something has to change.” On the Proteas’ selection for the New Zealand tour, consisting of two Tests, which coincide with the second season of SA20 from January 10 to February 10, the former batter said that Test cricket is under pressure and the system is turning towards T20 cricket. Proteas named a 14-player squad for their two-match Test series against New Zealand next month. Uncapped batter Neil Brand has been named as the skipper along with six uncapped players in the squad. The changes have been imposed due to the SA20 and the Test series being held simultaneously where most of the contracted Test players will feature. The first Test will start from February 4 while the second Test from February 13 onwards. “It has sent shockwaves around the cricketing world and has made it clear that Test cricket is under pressure, for that matter even ODI cricket and the whole system is turning around T20 cricket. The players, the board and coaches will turn towards where there is more money. You cannot blame them for thinking about their future with their family. That is ultimately what it comes down to,” he said. Talking about the pitch at Cape Town for the second Test against India, De Villiers said, “It (Cape Town) was a pretty stock-standard wicket in my opinion. I remember jumping around there on Day 1. If you can just get through the first session on Day 1, it gets easier. If you see the players who were playing their shots and not hanging around, they were the ones doing well.” “I remember Ben Stokes scoring a double hundred there. I myself scored some hundreds there. You cannot allow bowlers like Vernon Philander, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Kagiso Rabada to keep bowling on off-stump,” he concluded.

Players lined up to shake hands with the women dressed in pink, but footage shows Rizwan opting against the handshake and continuing walking. Cricket fans and pundits were quick to notice the incident and took to social media to criticise the wicketkeeper. 'All Pakistan players shook hands with female members in Glenn McGrath's family but Mohammad Rizwan didn't,' posted cricket journalist Farid Khan. 'Wow disrespecting women.. what a shame, posted popular cricket page Drinks Break. All Pakistan players shook hands with female members in Glenn McGrath's family but Mohammad Rizwan didn't 💯 #AUSvPAK pic.twitter.com/uxxCzcja8v — Farid Khan (@_FaridKhan) January 6, 2024 Rizwan copped criticism for his decision to not shake hands on the pink carpet 'That's discrimination against woman,' commented a third. Others didn't see a problem with his actions. 'Didn't have to, as long as he showed appreciation for the charity cause,' one fan commented. 'Mohammad Rizwan is great man,' replied another. Rizwan (28) and Aamir Jamal (18) put up some resistance on Saturday morning, putting on 42 for the eighth wicket. But when Nathan Lyon (3-36) had Rizwan caught at leg slip, they folded quickly. The win cements Australia's newly crowned status as the world's No.1-ranked Test team, with two matches against West Indies to come later in January. Pakistan captain Shan Masood gifted retiring David Warner Babar Azam's signed jersey after the match. Rizwan put on 28 runs on Saturday morning against the Aussies at the SCG The Pakistan team presented Warner with Babar Azam's shirt as a parting gift Masood asked the veteran opener to join him on stage during the post-match ceremony and presented him with the gift. 'If we could just give as a token of appreciation and as a parting gift to David Warner,' he said. 'If he can come up to the stage, please. We just thought the whole squad would give you Babar Azam's shirt as a gesture as a parting gift, and we wish you all the best in your future endeavours.' Warner was impressed with the classy gesture and thanked the Pakistani team.

Perry has been an integral part of the Australian side in their multiple World Cup triumphs. She is among the greatest players to have ever played the sport. Perry is now on the brink of creating an all-time record for Australia. The all-rounder is set to become the first from her country to appear in 300 International matches. Australian women's cricket has seen several stalwarts embracing the game but none other so far has been able to touch the elusive 300-game mark. The 33-year-old all-rounder will mark the historic game in the 2nd T20I against India on Sunday in Navi Mumbai. Meanwhile, Perry is open to playing even 400 games for her country. Speaking ahead of the match, she said that she is open to keep going for Australia. \"I don't know what's in store ...but if it's meant to be down the track and I'm still around playing ...I'm really open to what happens,\" she said. \"I don't have a set time frame on it. Either way, it doesn't really matter, it's just another number. For as long as I can contribute to the team and it's something I find really motivating and enjoyable, I'd love to be here,\" Perry added. India and Australia are currently taking on each other in an all-format series at the former's home. The Women in Blue registered a historic first Test win over Australia last month, while the Aussies have clean-swept the ODI series. 's team defeated the Alyssa Healy-led side in the first T20I and now are on the brink of a series win. This Australian team is a one with the post-Meg Lanning era and the legacy left behind by the most successful captain ever. Alyssa Healy is the full-time captain and a rising prodigy - Phoebe Litchfield has been impressing everyone a lot. \"It's a great time for us, of evolution. You've seen a lot of that in the way that Phoebe Litchfield has performed in those one-day matches; Annabel Sutherland, her last 12 months,\" Perry added further. \"That's something we're incredibly conscious of - (to) maintain the success we've had, but equally evolve that, to look a little bit different in the way the team plays. The game is moving at such a rapid pace. There's a new environment. In a lot of ways the sky's the limit in terms of where it can go,\" she said.","pubDate":"2024-01-07 03:56:18","image_url":"https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2024/01/kohli-92-1704599750.jpg","source_id":"indiatvnews","source_priority":10055,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"afd1feb026a867b71deee4f34af9b90f","title":"Leander Paes on Hall of Fame induction — ‘My parents’ encouragement and constant love are the reasons I could achieve it all’","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/tennis/leander-paes-interview-tennis-hall-of-fame-interview-records-opinion/article67702417.ece","keywords":["tennis"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Leander Paes, who won 18 Grand Slam titles in men’s and mixed doubles, has been elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.","content":"Leander Paes reflects as the winter sun fades in Kolkata, the city where his childhood aspirations of tennis greatness took root. From the penthouse of an iconic building, he gazes over the vast green expanse known as the Maidan, lost in a flood of memories. The Maidan, home to major city clubs, holds a special place in Leander’s heart, where he accompanied his accomplished athlete parents and found the inspiration to become a champion himself. Leander shared with the significance of being the first male player from Asia to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame (player category). He dedicated this prestigious award to his greatest motivators — his parents — and the millions of Indians who supported him. I always like to lead by example, and this, I hope, inspires all the youth in our country and shows them that from playing gully cricket or playing gully football barefoot, I could come so far. So, if they have enough passion and can work hard, they, too, can get into the Hall of Fame. It’s about telling them that if you believe in yourself and put in the hard work, it is possible to fulfil your dreams. Being the first Asian male to be nominated in the player’s category, it’s a tribute that I would like to give to my parents. Their encouragement and constant love are the reasons I could achieve it all. They allowed an 11-year-old boy to leave home and pursue his dreams. That’s not common in Indian culture, and that too in a sport like tennis, where India has never had a Grand Slam winner before me. The sport did not have an Olympic champion before me, so it was not easy for them to allow me to chase my dreams. Allowing your child to pursue disciplines like cricket or hockey was one thing but allowing him to pursue a global sport like tennis, where the risks are so high, was not easy. I appreciate my parents for their love, unconditional support, and belief in what I was trying to achieve. I dedicate this to them. Being born into a legacy is a great responsibility. I could understand, at a very young age, what that responsibility meant. It was more about playing for my family and trying to emulate what my father had achieved (Vece Paes won the 1972 Olympic bronze in hockey). It was also about representing my school, city, and the wishes of more than a billion people in my country. The responsibility became even bigger as I had to achieve excellence in a sport that did not have the infrastructure when I was growing up in the 1980s. There were no Grand Slam champions or even Asian champions to pave the path for me. Yes, there were a lot of good players like Ramanathan Krishnan, who served as a good role model, and I was lucky to travel with his son Ramesh. I am also grateful to the Amritraj family, who supported me a lot with the BAT junior programme that helped nurture my junior career. But there was no system in place to guide me on how to win Wimbledon or an Olympic medal. My dream was to win an Olympic medal and prove to Indians that we could be world champions. For the people, of the people: “For me, it was about representing my school, city, and the wishes of more than a billion people in my country,” says Paes. | Photo Credit: DEBASISH BHADURI I think champions are first made in the mind. Physical prowess is just a repetition of perfect practice. By doing 10,000 hours and three million repetitions, you can master anything. It takes about 10 years. The reason that I had a long career (of 38 years, including the junior years) was because of the repetition of gym, push-ups, skipping, yoga, meditation, recovery, and the relentless practice in various aspects of the game. When I won one Grand Slam, people said it was a fluke. Then I did it the second time, and they called it a fluke again. I won the four slams on all the surfaces after that, and it continued, and now I am sitting on 20 Slam titles (Two junior singles Grand Slams and 18 senior doubles Grand Slams). It was a humbling experience, and it was the determination to prove myself again and again that got me to the position where I stand now. Champions are made of intelligence, grit, passion to live out big dreams, and the ability to stand up every time you fall. Champions are made of special stuff, and it is all out there in the mind. The ability to make a simple decision under pressure is what separates champions from normal sportspersons. You can get lucky once, but repeating that success over and over again is what makes a champion. I had a simple and single-minded dream, and that was to prove to the world that, as Indians, we could win Olympic medals in individual sports. We had medals in field hockey, but in individual sporting events, it was a long wait since KD Jadhav’s bronze medal in 1952. There were no guidelines that could teach us how to win and be successful in an individual sport like tennis. So, becoming a pioneer in that field took great hardships. I hitch-hiked through Europe, and I had to sleep in locker rooms as there was no money to book a hotel room. I was even mugged in New York, but those things only kept me going. It was a journey to be the only Indian on tour for a large part because, by then, Ramanathan Krishnan had retired, as had Vijay (Amritraj) and Ramesh (Krishnan). Before I picked Mahesh (Bhupathi) for doubles, there were no other Indians, so travelling alone on ATP tours was not easy. Hundred per cent! I see that scar every single time I put on a match shirt. Every single night I went to bed, missing home, I reminded myself of the years of sacrifice and the hard work I had already put in. There was no other option for me but to be successful. I grew up in a generation where Indian athletes were perceived to be submissive and a bit soft, and that’s one of the reasons why I became so rugged. That’s one of the reasons why I could come back from losing matches or get through the hard years of missing home. It was not easy to be far away from home and miss out on several festivals and occasions, be it birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, New Year’s, or Diwali. I gave up my whole youth and a lot of family life for 38 years and dedicated everything to my sport and craft. Everything was dedicated to my country and our people. I feel sad right now, looking at the state of Indian tennis. It’s sad to see that the tradition has not been continued. That being said, I have tremendous respect for the players who, without funding, a support system, or any real guidance, are still out there, persevering to pursue a professional tennis career, even though there are so many other options that are out there that are even better or safer. So, it almost seems like it has come back to square one. I played across three decades, but now we are back to a phase where individuals are trying to muster up the courage, the finances, the knowledge, and the support system to be even out there. Individual tennis players have come out and said, ‘I need funding’ and that’s a sad realisation. Tennis is one of the toughest sports on the planet. As a sport, it is demanding, and it’s also hard physically, mentally, and financially.

RAGU When you are looking at any form of funding, people are looking for returns on that funding. They’re not running a charity. They’re looking for some sort of marketing behind it, some sort of publicity behind it, and some sort of return on the money that they spend on it. Otherwise, they would rather put it in the equity market, where they get a solid return. So, in that sense, it’s also an ecosystem that needs to be created, not just for tennis but for all Olympic sports. The BCCI is doing a phenomenal job with the system that they’ve created to not just look after their past champions and their past cricketers, but to also nurture the present athletes and, more importantly, to create over 100,000 cricket clubs around the country. Today, I would be surprised if there were even 100,000 tennis players in the country! And here, you have 100,000 cricket clubs, so a minimum of 11 in each club. So, you see the numbers that are being churned and produced. Very much like tennis, cricket is not a cheap sport; you need a kit, and then there are coaching, diet, and transportation costs. BCCI’s model can be replicated by the governing bodies of other sports. I don’t want to get into that because, in that, there are also different perspectives. Everyone has different perspectives and different thought processes. So, I am not the best one to answer that question. I just know that when I had an obstacle, I would just persevere and work tremendously hard with my family to find a solution. My expertise lies in the nurturing of talent and sports education. So, I have a business model where I am taking my father’s (Dr Vece Paes) sixty years of sports science, my Olympic-winning mentality knowledge, and clubbing knowledge and spreading it to the youth of the entire country through sports education in schools, colleges, tier-2 and tier-3 centres, and in rural areas. I think our real sporting talent lies in those rural areas. In the metros, the kids have more options — eSports or gaming — but the options are still limited in rural areas. So, that’s where I want to cater. I want to go out there, recognise talents, test those talents, nurture them, and ensure that they are injury-free with the help of sports science. It’s a long process, as you are picking kids when they are young, and it takes hours and hours to create champions out of them. (Laughs) I get calls from Prajnesh (Gunneswaran), and he would ask about his equipment or from Arjun Kadhe, who talks about his fitness regime. I get calls from a lot of youngsters who ask about their physical fitness, mental fitness, or diet, but it’s just that we don’t speak about it. That’s personal friendship. Tsitipas’ manager called me to work with him, and it was a learning experience. But at the end of the day, my work involves the masses, and it’s about going out there and nurturing talents. One has lived at the top of the pyramid for three decades, so he knows how to pick athletes as and when they develop and create a winning atmosphere for them. So, whether it was speaking to RVS Rathore at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics about the mental side of things or when he finally won his medal, he said, ‘Hey Lee, thanks so much…’, so those are the things you do out of friendship. You are asking me, What’s wrong with tennis today? Where’s the feeder system? In football, hockey, and javelin, where’s the feeder system? In such a huge country, how many have access to world-class tennis facilities? I am not talking about the infrastructure needed to play sports; I am not talking about the maidans. I am talking about the systematic training academy or high-performance centres that would pick talents at the age of 10 or 12 and tell that person that they will stick with them for the next 20 years and make them a champion. You look at countries like England, Spain, and Holland and their approaches to football. Or look at Australia and how they excel in every Olympic sport — the reason they have won six cricket World Cups is because there’s a tradition there. Sport is a big part of their education curriculum, but that’s not the case here. The infrastructure of sports has developed a lot in our country. The synthetic turfs have been introduced, we have floodlights, and the gyms are being used a lot more. But I think it’s one thing to go to the gym to become a professional athlete and a world champion, and it’s completely different to play the sport at an amateur level. However, that differentiation is not being recognised. There’s a huge difference between the two, and we need to understand that. My realisation as a young boy was to achieve an Olympic medal in an individual sport. Not many people understood it, let alone wanted to realise that achievement for themselves. Not many people were willing to put in those hard yards or go through the lifestyle it takes to compete at seven Olympics. People didn’t understand it, so obviously people misunderstood me. The purpose that I had was basically to rewrite history books. Ironically, we’re having this conversation when I’m being inducted into the Hall of Fame. I can’t expect people to understand what my journey was. I felt it was better to lead by example than waste time explaining it. I lived my life the best I could, and when I decided to shift to doubles and mixed doubles after enjoying success in singles, it came with the belief that we could win Grand Slams. And today, sitting here having won two junior singles Grand Slams and 18 senior doubles Grand Slams is a satisfying feeling. I have been very blessed to have had a phenomenal career, and I dedicate it to my team, which has been with me through thick and thin. In times like these, where everyone is busy projecting an image, on social media or in public, I just let my racquet do the talking.

Agence France-Presse January 07, 2024 09:23:25 IST Sri Lanka's Charith Asalanka celebrates scoring a century during the first ODI against Zimbabwe. AP Rain put an early finish to Sri Lanka’s opening one-day match against Zimbabwe on Saturday, with Zimbabwe struggling on 12-2 after four overs when the downpour hit. Play was called off at 9:00 pm local time (1330 GMT) after left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka dismissed opener Tinashe Kamunhukamwe for a first-ball duck. Madushanka, who was sold for $553,000 to Mumbai Indians in December’s IPL auction, claimed a second wicket in the same over when he had captain Craig Ervine caught at first slip by Sahan Arachchige. Both of Madushanka’s overs were maidens.

Opener Avishka Fernando departed for none from five balls in the first over, leaving Kusal Mendis (46) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (41) to post a 63-run stand. But the pair failed to make the most of their starts, with Samarawickrama offering a gentle catch to first slip and Mendis run out. Left-hander Asalanka stitched several partnerships with the lower order including a 52-run eighth-wicket stand with Dushmantha Chameera to keep Sri Lanka in the hunt before he was run out in the final over. Richard Ngarava was the pick of the Zimbabwe bowlers after early breakthroughs with the new ball, finishing 2-39 after claiming Fernando and Samarawickrama. The left-arm seamer came back for a second spell in the death overs but had to withdraw after sending down just four deliveries due to cramps. The teams will play two more one-day matches on Monday and Thursday followed by three T20 games, all in Colombo.
