These prices are consistent with the PCB’s commitment of making tickets affordable for the Pakistan cricket fans. Cricket fans, upon submitting their immunisation certificates, can purchase a maximum of five tickets against one CNIC, following which the sixth ticket will be free. This incentive is for the three ODIs only. At the time of entering the Gaddafi Stadium on match days, fans will have to show their Covid-19 immunisation certificates and valid CNICs. Salman Mesud, PCB Head of Commercial informed: “Spectator convenience, entertainment and facilities have been the forefront of our fan-engagement strategy. In line with this philosophy, we have not only priced tickets that are affordable, but will also put in place additional facilities to enhance the experience of our passionate cricket fans.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PCB's plan for Australian drop-in pitches shelved","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/944380-pcb-s-plan-for-australian-drop-in-pitches-shelved","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: Pakistan’s cricket authorities have decided to shelve plans to bring drop-in pitches from Australia, according to reports.Pakistan Cricket Board is now likely to hire a consultant who will first advise it on whether it is feasible to have the Australian-made pitches in Pakistan....","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-25 01:00:00","full_description":"LAHORE: Pakistan’s cricket authorities have decided to shelve plans to bring drop-in pitches from Australia, according to reports. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is now likely to hire a consultant who will first advise it on whether it is feasible to have the Australian-made pitches in Pakistan. According to Cricinfo, PCB is likely to get soil in from Australia and seed it at multiple venues as part of a trial. The original plan was to have two readymade pitches as a short-term solution to help Pakistan prepare for the upcoming T20 World Cup, which is to be held in Australia in October-November. It was also part of a broader plan to overhaul the standard of pitches across the country - a key plank in the chairmanship of Ramiz Raja. The company given the contract to import the drop-in pitches has been asked to hold the purchase, which, in any case, would have been a fairly lengthy process, potentially taking up to 10 months. The PCB had signed an MoU with the investment company Arif Habib Group, which was to bear the Rs37 crore procurement cost. That money is still likely to be used in the development of pitches. Since he took over as PCB chairman, Ramiz has been vocal about various issues that he sees afflicting Pakistan cricket. Pitches have become his most urgent priority. “It is Ramiz’s vision and mission to improve the quality of the pitches at all international and domestic cricket venues,” a PCB spokesperson told Cricinfo. “In this regard, we’ve hired an Australian expert on drop-in pitches as a consultant, who will tour Pakistan in April and visit all potential venues for a complete assessment and evaluation before suggesting next steps. “As we don’t have experts on drop-in pitches, we need to have a feasibility about everything around it. There are several critical elements to the success of this initiative, including weather conditions, usage of the venues, soil requirements and overall design and outlook of the venue.” Drop-in pitches are prominent in Australia and New Zealand, where a number of stadiums host multiple sports. A portable turf pitch is installed whenever a cricket match is to take place. In Pakistan, however, the PCB either leases out cricket stadiums or owns them directly, and cricket is the only sport played at these venues. The PCB maintains all stadiums through the year, employing their own curators for each venue. Pitches have been in the spotlight during Pakistan’s ongoing Test series against Australia, in general for their flat, docile nature. In particular, the surface in Rawalpindi came in for heavy criticism after just 14 wickets fell over five days of a drawn first Test, and it ultimately earned a “below average” rating from the ICC. Soon after, Ramiz conceded that the pitch had been prepared, in part, to nullify Australia’s strengths and account for injury-enforced absences in the Pakistan side. The nature of that pitch was in contrast to Rawalpindi’s reputation as the most seam-friendly of Pakistan’s main venues. In fact, Pakistan’s pitches since the return of Test cricket to the country in late 2019 and until this series had been widely viewed as sporting surfaces with something in them for batters, fast bowlers and spinners. But the surfaces for the first two Tests against Australia in Rawalpindi and Karachi pushed the PCB to hire Australian curator Toby Lumsden to assist the local curator while preparing the pitch for the ongoing third Test in Lahore, in a bid to produce a more helpful track for spinners. But the Test match has been dominated by the fast bowlers, who took 17 of the 20 wickets to fall on the first three days.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England eye World Cup semis after romp past Pakistan","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/944381-england-eye-world-cup-semis-after-romp-past-pakistan","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CHRISTCHURCH: Defending champions England continued their Women’s Cricket World Cup resurgence with an emphatic nine-wicket win over Pakistan Thursday to stand on the brink of the semi-finals.England pace bowler Katherine Brunt roared back into form after an indifferent tournament, taking...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-25 01:00:00","full_description":"CHRISTCHURCH: Defending champions England continued their Women’s Cricket World Cup resurgence with an emphatic nine-wicket win over Pakistan Thursday to stand on the brink of the semi-finals. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ England pace bowler Katherine Brunt roared back into form after an indifferent tournament, taking 3-17 as she and Sophie Ecclestone helped bundle Pakistan out for 105 in Christchurch. Brunt had taken only one wicket in five previous matches at this year’s one-day showcase but formed a potent attack with Ecclestone, who took 3-18. Danni Wyatt then shook off her own tentative start to the tournament, smashing an unbeaten 76 to see England home. The result moves England into the top four at the expense of India on a better net run rate and they can confirm a place in the semi-finals with victory over Bangladesh on Sunday. Captain Heather Knight said the 2017 champions were building momentum after making a disastrous start to the tournament with three straight losses. “It’s about reminding the girls that it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish,” she said. “We’re not there yet and we’ve got a big game coming up against Bangladesh.” England made the perfect start after putting Pakistan into bat when Brunt dismissed opener Nahida Khan with the first ball of the innings, coaxing an outside edge that went straight to first slip. Pakistan captain Bismah Maroof then threw away her wicket when she was run out for nine trying to sneak a second run to square leg. The run rate slowed to a crawl and Pakistan were 33-3 when Omaima Sohail was also run out on 11 with a direct hit from Tammy Beaumont. Sidra Ameen tried to rebuild but was bowled for 32 and Sidra Nawaz was the only other batter to offer resistance, making 23 as Pakistan were bowled out for 105 in 41.3 overs. Maroof said Pakistan’s batting was too tentative and they need to adopt a more positive approach. “We need to believe in ourselves, that’s important,” she said. “We have hitters who can play shots but you have to back yourself and apply yourself in the middle.” Rain meant play was abandoned in Thursday’s other scheduled match between South Africa and the West Indies in Wellington, with South Africa advancing to the semi-finals after each side received one point. The “no result” lifted West Indies to third in the table on seven points after completing their group matches, but they will have to rely on other results to remain in the top four and make the semi-finals. England and India, fourth and fifth in the standings, can both overtake the West Indies by winning their final matches on Sunday, against Bangladesh and South Africa respectively.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SA face struggle to qualify for Cricket World Cup","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/944386-sa-face-struggle-to-qualify-for-cricket-world-cup","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CENTURION: Cricket World Cups have caused more heartache for South African supporters than any other format of the game.There have been agonising near-misses and numerous disappointments - but actually qualifying for the tournament has never previously been an issue.Now, though, South Africa need...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-25 01:00:00","full_description":"CENTURION: Cricket World Cups have caused more heartache for South African supporters than any other format of the game. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ There have been agonising near-misses and numerous disappointments - but actually qualifying for the tournament has never previously been an issue. Now, though, South Africa need to find some dramatically improved form or face taking the long road if they want to play in the main event in India in October and November 2023. A home series defeat to Bangladesh has put the Proteas in a precarious position. They languish ninth on the World Cup Super League log. Only eight teams, including hosts India, qualify automatically. The bottom five teams in the Super League will have to endure a qualifying tournament in June 2023, along with five associate nations, with only two places available for India. “The alarm bells are there and we’re putting ourselves under pressure,” said head coach Mark Boucher after Bangladesh clinched a series victory with a nine-wicket win in Centurion on Wednesday. South Africa have only won four of their 13 Super League fixtures - and they have tough three-match series against England, India and Australia to come. They will, however, expect to win two postponed fixtures against the Netherlands, although the first match of a Covid-shortened series in November was rained off. Boucher said South Africa “went to sleep” against Bangladesh and needed to improve. But he said automatic qualification was not out of reach. “We’ve beaten the best sides in the world before and we’ll have to beat them again to qualify for the World Cup,” said Boucher. “If we arrive with confidence we can beat anyone.” Boucher is contracted until the World Cup but is not certain to be in charge by then. He faces a disciplinary hearing on charges of racial discrimination in May which could lead to his dismissal South African captain Temba Bavuma said he was struggling to understand how a team that beat India 3-0 in a series in January could play so poorly against Bangladesh. Ironically for South Africa, the series against India was not part of the Super League. “In the series against India our intensity was at another level but in this series we were not good enough,” said Bavuma. He gave credit to Bangladesh. “The skill and execution of Bangladesh was at a high level.” Eight of the players who appeared against Bangladesh are contracted to play in the Indian Premier League, which starts on Sunday. The IPL issue was the source of much speculation leading up to the series, with the IPL players deciding collectively that they would be available for the one-day games but not for two Test matches which start on March 31. Asked whether the IPL debate was a distraction, Bavuma said, “Individually the guys will have ask themselves that question but it is not an excuse I will be using.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SA make World Cup semis after match washed out","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/944382-sa-make-world-cup-semis-after-match-washed-out","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WELLINGTON: South Africa reached the semi-finals of the Women’s Cricket World Cup on Thursday when rain washed out their crunch match against the West Indies in Wellington.Both teams received a point from the abandoned fixture, putting South Africa second in the table to Australia and beyond...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-25 01:00:00","full_description":"WELLINGTON: South Africa reached the semi-finals of the Women’s Cricket World Cup on Thursday when rain washed out their crunch match against the West Indies in Wellington. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ Both teams received a point from the abandoned fixture, putting South Africa second in the table to Australia and beyond the reach of their rivals for the playoff spots. The West Indies can still make the top four but need results involving India and England to go their way. A downpour delayed the start of the match in the New Zealand capital for more than four hours, then officials attempted to proceed with innings of 26 overs apiece. But that was scrapped after 10.5 overs with South Africa 61-4 and looking to rebuild with Mignon du Preez unbeaten on 38 from 31 balls. Chinelle Henry took 3-19 and West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor felt they were on top when play was called off. “It’s not the way we’d like (the match to end) but you can’t do much about God’s plan, it’s something we can’t control,” she said. South Africa captain Sune Luus said her players were “pumped” at having the chance to make the final for the first time after semi appearances in 2000 and 2017. “Everyone’s extremely excited and obviously very happy to be in the semi-finals,” she said.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Smith becomes fastest man to score 8,000 Test runs","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/944388-smith-becomes-fastest-man-to-score-8-000-test-runs","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: Australia’s experienced batter Steve Smith eclipsed Sri Lanka’s legendary batter Kumar Sangakkara to become the fastest to score 8,000 runs in Test cricket, here on Thursday.Smith, 32, reached the exceptional milestone in the second innings of the ongoing third Test between...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-25 01:00:00","full_description":"LAHORE: Australia’s experienced batter Steve Smith eclipsed Sri Lanka’s legendary batter Kumar Sangakkara to become the fastest to score 8,000 runs in Test cricket, here on Thursday. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ Smith, 32, reached the exceptional milestone in the second innings of the ongoing third Test between Pakistan and Australia here at Gaddafi stadium.

It IS raining Current scenes in Wellington 🥴 #CWC22 pic.twitter.com/lyAt8toS3A Hello and welcome to the latest chapter of Australia’s World Cup domination OBO of Australia vs Bangladesh in Wellington. We’ve reached the 25 th match of this World Cup, a stage in proceedings where an Aussie win is as sure as the rising and setting of the sun, as certain as death and taxes. Meg Lanning’s side have conquered all comers so far in this tournament – it’s played six, won six for them. They’ve pulled off record run chases, blown sides away with the ball and hung on to some gravity defying catches. A berth safely booked in the semi-finals they will be looking to continue their unbeaten run and carry that buzz word ‘momentum’ into the sharp end of the tournament. Ellyse Perry is out of this game after suffering (horrible phrase) back spasms during the defeat of South Africa. The word around the traps is that she’ll be ok in time for the semis. The Aussies may well throw in a few changes in this their final trot out of the group stages. Bangladesh? Well, they had their historic day in Hamilton, chalking up a first ever World Cup win in beating Pakistan by nine runs. They’ve been mercurial but perhaps deserve to be higher in the table than second bottom. Fielding and bowling are their strongest suits and they’ve already pushed West Indies to the wire and given India a fright. Can they take some of the sheen off Australia’s golden run? Probably not . But you just never know, which is why we’re all here, I guess. Play is due to get underway in Wellington at 11am local time/9am AEDT/10pm GMT - but there is due to be some rain around. I’ll bring news of toss, teams and possible precipitation shortly.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0ae33c7965b8746e141fe7606edc585e95dc7e/0_288_5015_3010/master/5015.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4925dae541e6caa68f1b9293fb2e1d2f","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England in West Indies: Jack Leach and Saqib Mahmood share stunning 90-run stand to spare England's blushes - Sky Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5za3lzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvbmV3cy8xMjEyMy8xMjU3NDQzMC9lbmdsYW5kLWluLXdlc3QtaW5kaWVzLWphY2stbGVhY2gtYW5kLXNhcWliLW1haG1vb2Qtc2hhcmUtc3R1bm5pbmctOTAtcnVuLXN0YW5kLXRvLXNwYXJlLWVuZ2xhbmRzLWJsdXNoZXPSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England in West Indies: Jack Leach and Saqib Mahmood share stunning 90-run stand to spare England's blushes  Sky SportsWest Indies v England: third Test, day one – as it happened!  The GuardianSaqib Mahmood admits seeing team-mates ready to field spurred on last-wicket duo  The IndependentEngland pass 200 as last-wicket stand stuns West Indies recap!  Sky SportsWest Indies vs England live stream: how to watch 3rd Test cricket online from anywhere  TechRadarView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-24 21:53:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England legend Kevin Pietersen names the two best T20 bowlers ever ahead of new IPL season","link":"https://metro.co.uk/2022/03/24/cricket-kevin-pietersen-names-best-t20-bowlers-ever-new-ipl-2022-16340357/","keywords":["Cricket","Australia cricket","Bangladesh cricket","Cricket World Cup","England cricket","India Cricket","Indian Premier League","Kevin Pietersen","New Zealand cricket","Pakistan Cricket","South Africa cricket","Sri Lanka Cricket","West Indies Cricket"],"creator":["Louis Sealey"],"video_url":null,"description":"'He was as good as it gets'","content":"Kevin Pietersen has named the two best T20 bowlers ever (Picture: Getty) Kevin Pietersen has hailed Sri Lanka legend Lasith Malinga and West Indies hero Sunil Narine as two of the best T20 bowlers of all time. A panel of current and former cricketers were asked to name their T20 greats across five categories in an interview with Betway. Former England star Pietersen chose Malinga as the greatest death bowler in history and Narine as the best T20 spinner, admitting he had ‘no idea’ how to play the West Indian. Elsewhere, South Africa batter Rassie van der Dussen and Indian cricket commentator Aakash Chopra labelled Virat Kohli the greatest run-machine in T20 cricket, while West Indies legend Chris Gayle was described as the best six-hitter in the history of the white-ball game. Current and former stars assess the T20 greats Consistent run-scorer Rassie van der Dussen: ‘Virat Kohli just always seems to be making runs. He has sort of a simple technique, a classic technique, which helps him in Test cricket. But he also has the power game.’ Aakash Chopra: ‘He actually changed the perception completely that 30 is the new 50 in T20 cricket because he was averaging 50 for a very long time.’ Six-hitter Aakash Chopra: ‘In my opinion, no one comes close to Christopher Henry Gayle.’ Kevin Pietersen: ‘His pick-up over mid-on, just the flat-bat smack, it’s so dismissive.’ Lungi Ngigi: ‘Looking at him from the top of your run-up, it looks like he’s standing right next to you. One swing and it’s out of the stadium.’ Ian Bishop: ‘He changed and helped evolve the way T20 batting went and that’s why I see him as the GOAT of T20 batting.’ Spinner Kevin Pietersen: ‘Sunil Narine because of his variations. I had no idea which way it was going.’ Aakash Chopra: ‘It’s like going to a foreign country and not understanding anything, you are completely at sea. Somebody bowling a maiden super over?

A panel of current and former cricketers were asked to name their T20 greats across five categories in an interview with Betway . Former England star Pietersen chose Malinga as the greatest death bowler in history and Narine as the best T20 spinner, admitting he had ‘no idea’ how to play the West Indian. Elsewhere, South Africa batter Rassie van der Dussen and Indian cricket commentator Aakash Chopra labelled Virat Kohli the greatest run-machine in T20 cricket, while West Indies legend Chris Gayle was described as the best six-hitter in the history of the white-ball game. Consistent run-scorer Rassie van der Dussen: ‘Virat Kohli just always seems to be making runs. He has sort of a simple technique, a classic technique, which helps him in Test cricket. But he also has the power game.’ Aakash Chopra: ‘He actually changed the perception completely that 30 is the new 50 in T20 cricket because he was averaging 50 for a very long time.’ Six-hitter Aakash Chopra: ‘In my opinion, no one comes close to Christopher Henry Gayle.’ Kevin Pietersen: ‘His pick-up over mid-on, just the flat-bat smack, it’s so dismissive.’ Lungi Ngigi: ‘Looking at him from the top of your run-up, it looks like he’s standing right next to you. One swing and it’s out of the stadium.’ Ian Bishop: ‘He changed and helped evolve the way T20 batting went and that’s why I see him as the GOAT of T20 batting.’ Spinner Kevin Pietersen: ‘Sunil Narine because of his variations. I had no idea which way it was going.’ Aakash Chopra: ‘It’s like going to a foreign country and not understanding anything, you are completely at sea. Somebody bowling a maiden super over? It takes some doing. Ian Bishop: ‘I remember that over clearly actually, it was unfair really!’ Death bowler Kevin Pietersen: ‘Lasith Malinga.

Ravindra Jadeja, undoubtedly one of the best all-rounders across formats in modern-day cricket, will be adding another skill to his repertoire in IPL 2022 season opener between Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders in Mumbai on Saturday. A couple of days before the start of what will be his ninth season at Super Kings, Jadeja has been promoted to lead the team. The development has come some four months after Jadeja was retained as the franchise’s first-choice player ahead of Mahendra Singh Dhoni before IPL 2022 mega auction. Dhoni, who leaves behind a stupendous captaincy legacy, will continue to play as a specialist wicket-keeper batter. In what will be his 15th season of the Indian Premier League, it will only be for the second time when Dhoni won’t be leading an IPL team. Back in 2017, Dhoni had represented Rising Pune Supergiants under Steven Smith. Ravindra Jadeja captaincy record Speaking in a video posted by CSK across their social media handles, Jadeja sounded unperturbed despite him needing to “fill big boots”. The 33-year old player remained confident primarily because of the fact that Dhoni would still be there to provide him with on-field suggestions this season. “Feeling good. At the same time, I also need to fill in big boots like Mahi bhai [MS Dhoni], [he] has already set the big legacy so I need to carry [that] forward. I don’t need to worry too much because he is here so whatever I have a question to ask, I’ll definitely go to him. He’ll be my go-to person. He was and still he is today, so I’m not worried too much,” Jadeja said in the video. While Jadeja himself possesses of a wide-ranging 200-match (sixth-highest number of matches) IPL experience, it is noteworthy that he has never led an IPL team in the past. Jadeja, who will become only the third captain at Super Kings, has actually never led in any of his 113 first-class, 221 List A and 276 T20 matches in over a decade-and-a-half. 76 cricketers have led 13 teams in 884 matches across 14 IPL seasons. Ravindra Jadeja never one of them. Not an iota of doubt on his all-round skills but it will be very interesting to see how he goes about as not just another captain but MS Dhoni’s replacement. https://t.co/NE5g0SejBt — Dixit Bhargav (@dixitbhargav09) March 24, 2022 It is worth mentioning that Jadeja had once led an India U-19 team (comprising of Virat Kohli, Manish Pandey, Saurabh Tiwary and Abhinav Mukund) against Bangladesh U-19 in Colombo 15 years ago.

Jadeja, who will become only the third captain at Super Kings , has actually never led in any of his 113 first-class, 221 List A and 276 T20 matches in over a decade-and-a-half. 76 cricketers have led 13 teams in 884 matches across 14 IPL seasons. Ravindra Jadeja never one of them. Not an iota of doubt on his all-round skills but it will be very interesting to see how he goes about as not just another captain but MS Dhoni’s replacement. https://t.co/NE5g0SejBt — Dixit Bhargav (@dixitbhargav09) March 24, 2022 It is worth mentioning that Jadeja had once led an India U-19 team (comprising of Virat Kohli, Manish Pandey, Saurabh Tiwary and Abhinav Mukund) against Bangladesh U-19 in Colombo 15 years ago.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Chennai was fortunate to have a leader like him”: Virender Sehwag heaps praise on MS Dhoni after he retires as CSK captain ahead of IPL 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-chennai-was-fortunate-to-have-a-leader-like-him-virender-sehwag-heaps-praise-on-ms-dhoni-after-he-retires-as-csk-captain-ahead-of-ipl-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","CSK","IPL 2022","chennai super kings","csk","IPL","MS Dhoni","Virender Sehwag"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Virender Sehwag heaps praise on MS Dhoni after latter’s decision to step down as captain of the Chennai Super Kings ahead of IPL 2022.

A new chapter will begin at not just Chennai Super Kings but the Indian Premier Premier League following legendary captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s decision to step down from captaincy. First captain to win both second and consecutive Indian Premier League titles, Dhoni has passed Super Kings’ reigns after leading them to as many as four IPL season victories (only behind Rohit Sharma’s five for Mumbai Indians) and nine finals (in total). A 64-match lead in the list of most IPL matches as captain speaks highly of Dhoni’s longevity as a leader in the biggest T20 tournament across the globe. The fact that Dhoni led CSK in all the 190 matches that he played for them is apt reason why his decision has resulted in the “end of an era”. India and Chennai all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who apart from playing eight IPL seasons under Dhoni, has also played 152 international matches across formats under Dhoni (178 with him in the Playing XI) will be superseding him at CSK. Another criteria to judge Dhoni’s captaincy domination at Super Kings is the fact that Jadeja will only be the third captain in what will be the 13th season for the franchise. While Jadeja is at No. 6 on the list of most matches played in the IPL on the back of his 200-match experience, the 33-year old player has never led a team in representative cricket.

What a nonsense.’ Elite sport is hard. But yeah, it’s hard to fathom a plan with him; surely this would’ve been a good series in which to give him a twirl? Seems unlikely he’s getting a go against New Zealand in May/June, and nothing about Joe Root’s captaincy suggests he’s tossing in an untried leggy against South Africa. West Indies: 1 Kraigg Brathwaite (captain), 2 John Campbell, 3 Shamarh Brooks, 4 Nkrumah Bonner, 5 Jermaine Blackwood, 6 Kyle Mayers, 7 Jason Holder, 8 Joshua Da Silva (wk), 9 Alzarri Joseph, 10 Kemar Roach, 11 Jayden Seales. England: 1 Alex Lees, 2 Zak Crawley, 3 Joe Root (captain), 4 Dan Lawrence, 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jonny Bairstow, 7 Ben Foakes (wk), 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Craig Overton, 10 Jack Leach, 11 Saqib Mahmood. Email! “I suspect there’s a simple answer to your Fisher/Overton puzzlement,” writes Geoff Wignall. “As ‘being good in the dressing room’ appears to have become the primary criterion for selection (and for Root’s continuing captaincy), creating the opportunity to look at new players could mean exactly that: having a look at them. No need for them to leave the dressing room to achieve that. Though more likely the thinking is that Overton offers a very marginally better chance of the win needed to leave Root securely set to reach 100 matches as captain.” I find it hard to envisage a situation in which he’s the difference, but I’m regularly wrong; ‘being good in the dressing room’ has been important since they binned KP and arguably before. This is a big morning for Alex Lees, who’s done alright without making a serious score. One today will earn him the New Zealand series, at least, but this pitch looks like it might do more than the other two. Daunting. Nothing to do with cricket whatsoever, but this made me laugh. Thinking about the time a games mag, possibly PC Gamer, ran a competition asking readers to 'scare us' and someone sent in a load of telephoto lens shots of the team leaving the office. Dunno if they won but they should have. Ch ch changes: no debut for Philip after all, Kyle Mayers replacing Veerasammy Permaul, while England also make one change, Overton for Fisher. It must’ve been a tricky call – big first-innings runs are helpful – but today will likely be the best day for bowling. We’re now taking a closer look at the pitch and there is indeed grass, along with some moisture! Let’s see. MA Butcher, meanwhile, is wearing loafers with bare feet. Still, he’ll always have that square-cut six against Australia in 2001. Love a debut. All that work, pain and suffering, then a moment. Beautiful. The Windies huddle had a big round of applause a short while ago, so wonder if Anderson Philip, the right-arm seamer from Trinidad, is making his debut. Toss in five mins. Other hand, I enjoyed Saqib Mahmood’s performance in Barbados, and think he’s got a big future in the side because his kind of skiddy reverse is useful not just in England but the subcontinent too. If someone could please revelate me: what’s the point of leaving out Branderson to have a look at new players, to bin Fisher for Overton? Get it I do not. Mark Butcher confirms there are “thick patches” of grass on a length, and Daniel Harris confirms that there are mustard chinos on David Gower’s legs. Butcher adds that Kemar Roach was imploring the groundsman not to shave the pitch, so perhaps it’ll do something, Michael Vaughan is back in the BT studio. Hmmmm. Carlos Brathwaite has been told to “expect runs”, and his experience of watching and playing cricket in Grenada tells him that too. There’s a bit more grass on the pitch, he says, but thinks it’ll be flat. Thing is, flat tracks aren’t the problem – Test tracks should be flat – but they shouldn’t be dead. There needs to be pace for the best quicks, turn for the best spinners, and bounce for the best of both. Don Draper didn’t teach us much – we were self-regarding, self-mythologising bores long before we knew him – but his – well Teddy’s – vort that nostalgia “literally means ‘the pain from an old wound’” gives an interesting insight into contemporary Britain. We’ve been deep in a nostalgia trap these last few years, people reminiscing fondly, not just about Mr Benn, the Smiths Crisps advert and white dog turds, but about poverty, racism and mortal danger they never actually experienced; a heady mix. And Test cricket is currently experiencing something similar, two three-match series locked at 0-0 with just the final encounter to go. Who doesn’t feel a twinge in their heart thinking about sport that is a million times more stultifying than the thrilling fare we’re used to nowadays? Yeah yeah, alright, there’s not much our to-do has in common with Pakistan v Australia – the action has been devastatingly slow for much of the piece and there’s no particular reason to think this won’t be more of the same. But it’s still worth our time, for the fascinating subplots and individual peaks we’ve enjoyed nevertheless, and because simply by existing, Test cricket allows us to travel the way a child travels - around and around, and back home again, to a place where we know are loved.

High scores are pretty common on this ground as the ball skids and comes on to the bat quite well. Spinners could prove to be important in the middle overs. Wicketkeeper C. Hacksaw has been in good form for his side. He scored 38 runs in 23 balls in the last match and a similar innings is expected of him this time too. Batters R. Cato is yet to hit his peak form in the tournament. He has scored 48 runs in three matches and will be hoping for a longer stay at the crease. All-rounders J. James is a brilliant all-rounder who has been consistent lately. He has scored 67 runs in just three matches and has also taken four wickets. James can also prove to be an exciting captaincy choice for your FCS vs GRD Dream11 fantasy team. A. Hooper is one of the standout players for Grenadines Divers. He has scored 47 runs and has collected three wickets. Hooper will be a player worth keeping an eye out for. Bowlers Wesrick Strough has been nothing short of fantastic for Grenadines Divers. He has scalped four wickets thus far and will be hoping to add more. J. James (FCS) – 239 points A. Hooper (GRD) – 184 points W. Strough (GRD) – 136 points I. Joseph (GRD) – 125 points R.
