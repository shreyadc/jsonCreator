The MI Cape Town, led by leg-spinner maestro Rashid Khan certainly look like the team to beat in the tournament. Apart from the all round skills of Rashid, the squad also boasts of some of the big T20 stars in Sam Curran, Kagiso Rabada, Jofra Archer, Liam Livingstone, and Dewald Brevis to name a few. On the other hand, the Paarl Royals, led by David Miller also consists of some marquee talents in Jason Roy, Jos Buttler, Lungi Ngidi, Tabraiz Shamsi et al. Akin most T20 leagues around the world, only a maximum of four overseas players will be allowed in the playing XI of teams during a match in the SA20 as well. Moreover, for the very first time in a T20 league, the team captains will have the advantage of naming their playing XI for the day post the conduction of the Toss, but will have to nominate 13 players before the same. Newlands Cape Town pitch report The last T20I that the Newlands Cricket Ground hosted was back in December 2020, and the contest turned out to be a high-scoring affair. Across the 21 men’s T20I matches played at this venue, the average score stands at 159.8 runs, which makes the pitch here conducive enough for the batters. Having said that, the pitch here also has a reputation of providing significant pace and bounce to the fast bowlers, and the likes of Archer, Rabada, Ngidi etc. would certainly be licking their lips at the sight of the pitch tomorrow especially with the new ball in hand.

Having started their campaign with a draw against Tamil Nadu, they suffered losses in the next three games. With just one point after four games, Hyderabad are languishing at the bottom in Group B. They will face a stern test when they host Saurashtra – a team that is on a roll – in the round five match at Gymkhana from Tuesday. With Hyderabad set to host the India, New Zealand first ODI on January 18 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Uppal, the Gymkhana will host this round of match. The campaign for Hyderabad didn’t go according to their plans. The team, which is short on experience with only a few players like Tanmay Agarwal and T Ravi Teja playing more matches, most of the players in the squad have played only a couple of matches. Hyderabad coach Milap Mewada also feels the inexperience of the side is one of the reasons for their poor campaign. “See, all the other teams have players who have played more matches unlike our team. We have a very young team and most of them have played very few matches. A few made their debut this season while others are playing after a gap. So it is a bit difficult. The red ball game requires a lot of patience. We need to be patient with this team,” said the coach. For Hyderabad, it was only the captain Tanmay Agarwal (463 runs from 4 matches) who was doing bulk of the scoring while others failed to make their presence felt. Barring K Rohit Rayudu and Mickhil Jaiswal’s rare success, lack of consistency has been their nemesis. In the bowling department, it was only all-rounder Ravi Teja and Kartikeya Kak, who picked up 15 wickets each, who looked like posing a threat. The remaining bowling attack looks lackluster. On the other hand, Saurashtra are at the top of the table with 19 points with two wins and two draws. The visitors are runaway favourites as they are coming into this match on the back morale-boosting an innings and 214 runs win over Delhi. Their skipper Jaydev Unadkat scripted history when he took a first-over hat-trick en route to a 8/39 first-inning bowling figures. Their batting too looks solid with Harvik Desai, Jay Goil and Arpit Vasavada in good knick. The hosts need to play out of their skin to thwart the visitors.  ","pubDate":"2023-01-09 12:59:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"बुमराह का फिर से बाहर होना सभी को हैरान कर गया, फैंस हैरान, तो बीसीसीआई पर उठी उंगली","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/hindi/cricket/fans-are-too-surprised-at-jasprit-bumrah-being-ruled-out-again-finger-is-raised-at-bcci-3676980#publisher=newsstand","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Sri Lanka 1st ODI: जिस तरह बुमराह (Japsrit Bumrah) को लेकर रवैया दिखा है, उसके कारण बीसीसीआई की जमकर मजाक बन रहा है.","content":"जसप्रीत बुमराह को लेकर बीसीसीआई के मन में क्या चल रहा है, यह तो अच्छी तरह बोर्ड ही बता सकता है, लेकिन जिस तरह से बुमराह (Bumrah is ruled out) के मामले को बीसीसीआई के अधिकारियों ने हैंडल किया है, वह जरूर फैंस और पंडितों के बीच मजाक का विषय बन गया है. वास्तव में यह स्थिति बीसीसीआई जैसी पेशेवेर संस्था के काम-काज के तरीके पर भी सवाल खड़ा करता है. कारण यह है कि करीब छह दिन पहले ही जनवरी तीन बोर्ड ने खुद  आधिकारिक मेल जारी करके यह सूचना दी कि बुमराह को श्रीलंका के खिलाफ तीन वनडे मैचों की सीरीज के लिए मूल टीम में जोड़ा गया है, लेकिन बहुत ही ज्यादा हैरानी का बात यह रही कि छह दिन बाद ही सोमवार को पहले वनडे की पूर्व संध्या पर फिर से मेल आया कि बुमराह चोट के कारण सीरीज से बाहर हो गए हैं. और इसी ने बीसीसीआई पर सवाल खड़े कर दिए हैं. यह भी पढ़ें:इस वजह से एहतियात के तौर पर बुमराह को श्रीलंका सीरीज से दूर रखा गयाजसप्रीत बुमराह श्रीलंका के खिलाफ वनडे सीरीज से बाहरसवाल यह कि पहली बार बुमराह को बिना फिटनेस टेस्ट के ही टीम में जगह दे दी गई? आखिरकार बोर्ड कि मेडिकल टीम ने किस आधार पर बुमराह को हरी झंडी दी? जब बुमराह अभी ही फिट नहीं हैं, तो तब बुमराह कैसे फिट थे? बुमराह को लेकर इतनी जल्दबाजी क्यों? वास्तव में इस बार-बारी मेला-मेली ने पूरे विषय को एकदम मजाक का विषय बना दिया है. और इस तरह की ही घटनाएं होती हैं, जो बोर्ड के लिए बदनामी और उसका मजाक उड़ाने का सबब बनती हैं. देखिए कि फैंस क्या कह रहे हैं. बहुत ही सहलाते हुए ताना मारा गया हैJasprit Bumrah rules out of ODI series against Sri Lanka and he will be fit and fine for IPL 2023.— Farrago Abdullah Parody (@abdullah_0mar) January 9, 2023अब यह तो सुनना ही पड़ेगाRespect for #mitchellstarc #IndianCricketTeam #JaspritBumrah #BCCI #BCCISelectionCommittee #iPL pic.twitter.com/8OGXtcL5UH— Sanjeev Kumar jha (@the_sanjeev13) January 5, 2023यह देखिए..Hahaha before that IPL he will be fully fit to play for his Club nd after that asusual he will get injured nd take Rest until next IPL that's the story of dis Bumrah.— Bennu (@Belagavi3) January 9, 2023ज्यादातर आलोचकों की जुबां पर यही बात हैOur legend getting rest for the biggest tournament than the world cup. #JaspritBumrah pic.twitter.com/CyMkitiG6b— ??

Even as a mate of a lot of these guys I like to see it first-hand,” Cummins said.“I love sports documentaries. When it’s people you know as well, it gives it that little bit extra.Starc praised Cummins for the environment created – which he says is the best he’s ever experienced in his decade-long Test career.“It’s just a happy group at the moment on and off the field. And I think we’ll see that in the documentary,” Starc said.“… I think the last 18 months-24 months has been as happy a group and together a group as I’ve seen and that comes from the players and staff we have in this group.”","pubDate":"2023-01-09 09:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Walking on eggshells’: Aussies slam Langer","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/walking-on-eggshells-australian-players-were-afraid-of-justin-langer/news-story/e99f785137d681bb2a97266084be757c","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Australian cricket team has shed more light on what led to Justin Langer’s departure as coach, revealing players were “walking on eggshells” around him.","content":"Cricket Australia and Langer mutually agreed to part ways last February after players expressed concerns over his coaching style and Langer rejected a reduced contract extension.It came as a surprise, given Australia had won the T20 World Cup for the first time and retained the Ashes with a dominant 4-0 series win over England at home.Watch BBL12.

Start your free trial now >Both of those triumphs occurred under Langer’s watch, although many believe his successor Andrew McDonald was effectively in charge of the team after Langer was told to cool his intense coaching style.Now the full extent of Langer’s passionate ways have been detailed in the second season of the documentary series The Test, which premieres on Amazon Prime on Friday.“There was plenty of guys who don’t speak up, who don’t talk, and were afraid of JL,” Usman Khawaja says in the documentary.“That’s the truth.”Nathan Lyon described Langer’s coaching style as an emotional rollercoaster.“I’ve always said you can never criticise someone who is extremely passionate in what they do, and that’s exactly what JL is,” Lyon said.“Did I struggle with some of the ups and downs? Yeah. Probably the biggest feedback from myself was just emotional levels (from) JL.”Warner said: “People express passion in different ways and his was riding every ball.”Ashton Agar added: “It was sort of at the point where JL realised he had to pull back massively and he did that.”“Players and staff really crave consistency,” Australian captain Pat Cummins said in The Test.“Over the last couple of years, there were times when the environment just wasn’t that. “Some people felt like they were walking on eggshells.“The players wanted to create their own environment and it’s us taking responsibility for the team.”The players said Langer took a back seat and did everything asked of him, but they were clearly eager for a change.“JL was given feedback from the senior players in our group around certain things they wanted him to improve on I guess as a coach,” Mitch Marsh said.“He listened and he did everything that was asked of him as the playing group.”Khawaja added: “I genuinely believe that JL brought humility back into the Australian cricket team.”Speaking to news.com.au ahead of the documentary’s premiere, players were reluctant to criticise Langer by name, instead emphasising Andrew McDonald is the right coach for now and praising the culture of the current Australian team.The team raved about their mantra of “own your space”, which refers to allowing every player to be themselves and train and prepare how they want to, even if that means not warming up.“I felt like certainly since Andrew McDonald came in it’s been probably a little bit more like that compared to prior,” Marnus Labuschagne told news.com.au.“It’s been a great environment for a long time now over the last couple of years and I think that’s continued now with Andrew and Pat in charge,” Mitchell Starc said.“Just the freedom to express yourselves as players and people off the field. It’s shown on the field as a group. To see the smiles on faces and the enjoyment of the group and each other’s success. “The performance we’ve put on over a number of series now speaks to that.”Cummins said: “If you’re in the Australian cricket team, you know your game pretty well.“You know what makes yourself tick. You’re not dealing with kids.”Langer featured heavily in the first season of The Test, coming across as a demanding coach in the mould of a stern English football manager.But he isn’t interviewed in the second instalment — the players are front and centre, which is perhaps a reflection of them taking “ownership” and “responsibility” for the team.Labuschagne insisted neither Langer or McDonald’s coaching styles are “wrong or right”, but simply suit different teams at different stages.“It’s just different,” the Australian No. 3 batter said. “Two different paths. Two different people going about coaching in a different way. There’s never a wrong or right. “I think for this team and right now, Andrew McDonald’s done a great job in creating a comfortable space for everyone to go about their business.“But this is a much different to the team that first played in 2019. So it’s hard to go, ‘would this approach have worked back then?’ Maybe, maybe not. “But right now for this team, the approach we have now is really balancing well.”Australia wrapped up an unbeaten summer at home, sealing 2-0 series victories over the West Indies and South Africa.The next task is a daunting tour of India next month before an away Ashes series in the UK.Australia hasn’t won a series in India or England in 20 years.","pubDate":"2023-01-09 09:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
