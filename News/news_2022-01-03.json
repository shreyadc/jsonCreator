He is experiencing mild symptoms and is isolating at home with his family. Hockley has not had any recent direct contact with team members from either Australia or England. His diagnosis comes after Aussie legend Glenn McGrath tested positive , putting his involvement in the famous “Pink Test” in Sydney in jeopardy. England coach Chris Silverwood has also contracted the virus and will be unable to be in Sydney for the next Test, starting on Wednesday, as he isolates in Melbourne with his family. Three of Silverwood’s five family members have now tested positive to Covid and there are nine positive cases within the England camp. The head coach isn’t the only key member of the England camp to be affected. Bowling coach Jon Lewis, spin bowling coach Jeetan Patel and strength and conditioning coach Darren Veness are also in isolation after contracting the virus. Batting coach Graham Thorpe will take over from Silverwood for the Sydney Test, which will see Joe Root and his men try to restore some pride after being thrashed by an innings and 14 runs in Melbourne. Australia has also been hit, losing batter Travis Head to the virus . The South Australian is isolating in Melbourne after testing positive last week. Mitchell Marsh, Nic Maddinson and Josh Inglis have been drafted into the squad as cover, while the governing body is hopeful Head will be available for the fifth match against England in Hobart. It was a tough day for New Zealand as underdogs Bangladesh proved size really doesn’t matter when it comes to fortunes on the cricket field. Cricket fans were lost for words when a Sydney Thunder rookie made BBL history with an insane bowling performance on debut.

The tourists were 2/175 at the close of play, trailing New Zealand by 153 with eight wickets in hand and the pitch playing true. Catch every moment of The Ashes live and ad-break free during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Try 14-days free now . It was only the third innings in Tests for the 21-year-old Joy, who was dismissed for nought and six in his one previous outing against Pakistan last month. But he played with plenty of maturity on a day that belonged to the tourists, facing 211 deliveries for his unbeaten 70 and forging a 104-run partnership with 23-year-old Shanto which impressed New Zealand’s only successful bowler Neil Wagner. “The younger guys that played today played phenomenally,” Wagner said. “They played quite patiently, they didn’t give many opportunities and they sort of hung in there. “When the ball was there to score, they scored and when we looked like trying to get them out they left well and defended well.” But Wagner said the Test outcome was still far from clear with three days remaining. “There’s still a lot of cricket left and that’s the beauty of Test cricket going five days,” he said. “The wicket might take turn but also create opportunities later down the track if those cracks do come into play.” One of the more amusing sights from the day involved 203cm tall New Zealand fast bowler Kyle Jamieson, who was snapped next to Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque, who only stands 161cm tall. It was similar to a recent photo in South Africa highlighting the enormous height difference between Proteas teammates Temba Bavuma (162cm) and Marco Jansen (203cm) . New Zealand resumed the second morning at 5/258 and were all out before lunch for 328, their lowest score on a home wicket in nine Tests against Bangladesh. Bangladesh then enjoyed ideal batting conditions as they made a solid reply. They survived several near misses early in a test of concentration, but what began as a fight to survive gave way to an abundance of free-flowing shots by Shanto and Joy. They put on 104 for the second wicket with Shanto bringing up his 50 with a huge six over the long-leg boundary. He then played an audacious one-day stroke when he stepped away from a short Neil Wagner delivery, exposing all three stumps, and guided the ball past the close-catching cordon for four. Wagner proved the most dangerous of the New Zealand bowlers and claimed the wicket of opener Shadman Islam for 22 with a diving catch after a low full toss was chipped back. He then saw off Shanto with a succession of short deliveries before pitching up an outswinger which the batsman edged to Will Young in the gully. He had struck Shanto on the body with his first ball to the new batsman and, when Joy was on 20, was frustrated by having an appeal for LBW turned down. New Zealand decided not to review and ball-tracking technology indicated the ball would have hit the stumps. New Zealand, having made a promising start to be 1/139 on day one, fell apart on the second morning to be all out for 328 with only last man out Henry Nicholls (75) showing any resistance as the Bangladesh spinners did the damage. Mehidy Hasan took 3/3 in the space of 21 deliveries while Mominul, a part-time spinner, removed Nicholls to go with the dismissal of Devon Conway to lift his total career scalps to six in 48 Tests. Of the recognised bowlers, Shoriful Islam finished with 3/69 and Mehidy took 3/86. Cricket fans were lost for words when a Sydney Thunder rookie made BBL history with an insane bowling performance on debut. Melbourne has emerged as a possible frontrunner if a centralised hub-style is adopted by the Big Bash to avoid the spectre of Covid which is biting the competition at every turn. He’s long been earmarked as Nathan Lyon’s successor but Aussie cricket legends are divided on whether he should make his Test debut.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"New Zealand vs Bangladesh, 1st Test, Day 3 Live Cricket Score Updates from Bay Oval Mount Maunganui LIVE Score","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-vs-bangladesh-1st-test-live-cricket-score-updates-nz-vs-ban-first-test-day-3-live-score-latest-scorecard-live-streaming-752444","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand vs Bangladesh, 1st Test, Day 3 Live Cricket Score Updates  ","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-02 20:37:11","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"Photo exposes laughable cricket mismatch","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/kiwi-cricket-star-towers-over-rival-in-laughable-cricket-photo-mismatch/news-story/6d02e192d03ce7a07f88c2ef1d49972b","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"An unbeaten 70 by Mahmudul Hasan Joy, backed by 64 from Najmul Hossain Shanto, put Bangladesh in a strong position at stumps on day two of the first Test against New Zealand at Mount Maunganui on Sunday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-02 20:12:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost"},{"title":"'Oh my god': Cricket world erupts over 'insane' Big Bash history","link":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/cricket-big-bash-muhammad-hasnain-history-three-wickets-first-over-debut-200937526.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-02 20:09:37","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9a961260-6c07-11ec-92ee-2a831fba4d9b","source_id":"yahoo"},{"title":"England stars set to be pulled from Big Bash","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/bbl-2022-england-stars-set-for-early-exit-as-t20-series-in-west-indies-looms/eaed0c8a-e3f5-4357-8b7c-4f69afc14a16","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"Several English players have been advised by the ECB to leave the Big Bash immediately, with an international tour on the horizon.","content":"Several English players have been advised by the England and Wales Cricket Board to leave the Big Bash immediately, with an international tour of the Caribbean on the horizon.England will begin a five-match series with the West Indies later this month, and are due to fly out of England in a couple of weeks.

Earlier on Sunday, an unbeaten 70 by Mahmudul Hasan Joy, backed by 64 from Najman Hossain Shanto, put Bangladesh in a strong position at stumps on day two. The tourists were 175 for two at the close of play, trailing New Zealand by 153 with eight wickets in hand and the pitch playing true. It was only the third innings in Tests for the 21-year-old Joy, who was dismissed for nought and six in his one previous outing against Pakistan last month. But he played with plenty of maturity on a day that belonged to the tourists, facing 211 deliveries for his unbeaten 70 and forging a 104-run partnership with 23-year-old Shanto. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) Right then. Bangladesh have their noses in front and would hope to continue on their merry way. While, the Kiwis will be looking forward for the second new ball to trouble the batters. The action continues on Monday at 3.30 am IST (10.00 pm GMT, previous day). Till then take care and goodbye. Not the day New Zealand would like! Traditionally, in New Zealand, teams always struggle to bat first and the team batting second gets the best of the pitches to bat on. However, given the home side's dominance in the last few years, it has managed to post totals in excess of 400 consistently while batting first and dismiss oppositions under 200 if bowling first. 2022 has not quite gone to that plan yet.Their bowlers toiled really hard in the sun but the batters were always up for the task and negotiated really well. But it was Wagner yet again who came to the rescue and broke a crucial partnership in the middle. The hosts would’ve thought they had a sniff but were not able to capitalize on it. Neil Wagner was the star of the pack for the Kiwis. The hosts would hope the moving day swings in their favour. Bangladesh would've loved to see Shanto and Joy to see off the day but the former was sent back. Although, Joy and Haque made sure they do not loose any more wickets till Stumps. The runs came in at a brisk rate for the visitors and had some luck riding along with them. They now trail by 153 runs and the wicket is a friendly pitch to bat on as well. The batters would be eager to come out in the morning on Day 3. End of a really good day for Bangladesh. It was their bowlers who set the tone and their batters continued the momentum. New Zealand were not able to cause much problems for the batters and Bangladesh batters cruised on this wicket. Oh boy! That was close! Good-length ball, on middle, nipping back in. Mominul Haque looks to defend but gets beaten on the inside edge. He gets thudded on the pads. Loud shout for an lbw but the umpire says no. New Zealand players discuss whether to take the review or not and in the end, decides against it. Replay shows that the ball was going over the stumps. So good decision not to take the review. THAT WILL BE STUMPS ON DAY 2! On a good length, around off, coming back in. Mominul Haque watches the ball closely and make a leave. Finally getting the radar right is Kyle Jamieson. Much better! Good-length ball, outside off. Mominul Haque offers no shot. Same again! Kyle Jamieson is not able to get his radar right from 'round the wicket. Another length ball, going down leg. Left alone. Sprays this one down leg. Mominul Haque looks to flick but misses. Tim Southee at second slip appeals for a catch but there was nothing on it. Back of a length, on middle. Mominul Haque blocks it on the leg side. Goes wide of the crease and bowls an in-angler, on middle and leg. Mahmudul Hasan Joy looks to defend but misses and gets struck on the thigh pad. FOUR! Nearly chopped it on! Length ball, outside off. Mahmudul Hasan Joy looks to push. The ball goes off the inside edge and goes past the off stump to fine leg for a boundary. He is riding his luck now. That was inches away from hitting the off stump. Well, he has been batting brilliantly and deserves a little bit of luck perhaps. Play halted! The physio comes out in the middle as Mahmudul Hasan Joy gets hit on his leg. The physio has a look and the player is fine to continue. Tight single! On a length, on off. Mominul Haque taps it towards covers for a quick single. The fielder has a shy at the keeper's end but misses. Hits Mahmudul Hasan Joy's left leg instead. Bangladesh wouldn't want to lose a wicket at the stroke of Stumps. On a length, on middle. Clipped to mid-wicket for a single. Length ball, outside off. Mahmudul Hasan Joy lets it through. Back of a length, outside off. Left alone. Another one shaping away but well outside off. Mominul Haque with an easy leave. Back of a length, on middle. Mominul Haque hops and blocks it down the deck. Outside off, on a length, Mominul Haque lets it through.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-01/4va3qtjg_ban-afp_625x300_02_January_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"Never mind England’s misery, celebrate Australia’s Ashes brilliance | Sam Perry","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/never-mind-englands-misery-celebrate-australias-ashes-brilliance","keywords":["Ashes 2021-22","The Ashes","Australia cricket team","England cricket team","Cricket","Sport","Australia sport"],"creator":["Sam Perry"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia won the Ashes in twelve days playing superb cricket, despite starting the series under pressureHave Australia been good or have England been bad?

And it allows us to fling open the door to a frenzy of sizzling takes through its zero sum, binary veneer. “Hapless England” certainly makes for engaging copy. Not only can we pick at the carcass of an on-field humiliation, but we can opine on the macro social, cultural and economic forces that shape Haseeb Hameed’s low hands. It allows David Warner to gift advice on syntho preparation. The Barmy Army can become cricket’s version of an industry lobbyist . And while “Chris Cooke bowling spells the death of Test cricket” might offer a lively conversation point, it conveniently ignores the fact he actually hoops them . It is also true, though unpopular, to say that Australia have been good. Six weeks ago this was a team that had more questions hovering over it than Prince Andrew. David Warner was turning 35. The young prodigy deigned to partner him had withdrawn, and the alternatives failed to inspire. Steve Smith hadn’t dominated for a while. Marnus Labuschagne was due a downturn. There was a yawning gap in the middle order. Cameron Green was an all-rounder without a wicket. The frontline bowlers didn’t deliver last summer. The team hadn’t played in nearly a year. The rare units of the triumphant T20 team weren’t around to offset the coach. If England could just apply some pressure, would the team return to old dynamics? Then the skipper resigned amid scandal. We chin-stroked over a bowling captain, irrespective of his eyes and his blazer fitting just-so. We weren’t used to new keepers. For a cricketing nation welded to a tradition of conservatism and incumbency, there was a fair bit of flux. These were conditions ripe for a surprise. Instead, the Ashes were secured in twelve days. Beyond the influence of white balls and private schools on England’s cricket, the component parts of Australia’s victory are worth exploring. Most significantly, every single player involved has contributed something meaningful to a win. This is important, because it illustrates a team with a complete working configuration, rare for Australia in modern times. Previous series wins, however close or dominant, tended to happen on the back of one or two outsized contributions, particularly with the bat. Warner against Pakistan. labuschagne against New Zealand. Smith in England. Here, every incumbent has firmed their grip on their position. Warner navigated the Gabba with a grizzled opener’s maturity, before an altogether more complete contribution in Adelaide. Labuschagne did the same, but in the reverse fixture. Smith almost capped a return to the captaincy with a century. Travis Head upended a rare moment of English pressure with a violent, match-winning hundred. Cameron Green graduated from gun-barrel to gun with the ball. Alex Carey has twice played the sort of brisk, keeper’s innings to close the door on opposition opportunity. He’s also gloved the ball well enough and eschewed the stardom of the stump mic. Of the batters, last to join the party was Marcus Harris. He was retained by selectors in Melbourne despite growing calls for change, and responded with an innings of 76 runs from 190 balls, outstripping the entire opposition’s second innings for balls faced. This was a match-winning innings, yet in some quarters it merely cemented views on Harris’s low ceiling. There is a unique phenomenon in Australia, possibly born of the pathways ideology, where we regard players for their future, not current, output, but Harris’ innings would’ve warmed the hardest opener’s heart, and seasoned eyes understand these types of knocks are vital to the consistency of any outfit. Australia will need more of these. Not least because they ensure bowlers always have something to work with. “The Cartel” have been irrepressible, with hard statistics showing their rewards aren’t simply a function of English ineptitude. For many years track-suited coaches have been wont to say that bowling is a closed skill, and CricBuzz’s Freddie Wilde gave Australia’s efforts some teeth, noting that, “Australia’s bowling in the Ashes has been the best in a 3+ match series in our ball-tracking database. No team on record has bowled as fast (38% above 140kph) & as accurately (41% on good line & length).” The world class operators have delivered, and each understudy has impressed. Where Scott Boland’s spirit soared after he stood on the shoulders of his ancestral giants, it was also reward for years and years of pounding the bitumen-esque Junction Oval with hard length after hard length. There is harmony in the unit too. There has been no macho bullshit, yet. The leadership dynamics overseeing present life are not yet clear, but one suspects the rising influence of calm heads like George Bailey, Tony Dodemaide, Michael Di Venuto, Andrew McDonald and Pat Cummins have helped. Justin Langer – whether through direction or design – has permitted this and must be afforded credibility for doing so. It begs an awkward question: what does Langer do now? To be fair to him, whatever it is (or isn’t), it’s working. Cummins will be the key voice in his renewal. For now, the going is good, and the Australian cricketing public is rightly accepting the home Ashes opiate, because like England, the home country has its own systemic problems ready to be revealed once stronger opponents line up in less homely conditions. That’s when when we’ll learn more about the merits of this perennial “almost-team”, as they ready themselves for another trip to explore the summit.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1e8d3a0a56500575f2fe7e04e983f5235336ee4/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8656a6ebc1cf8f3fabfa8c95f31c2001","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Cricket-S Africa seamer Jansen called up for India ODI series","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/01/02/cricket-s-africa-seamer-jansen-called-up-for-india-odi-series","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Tall left-arm seamer Marco Jansen has received his first call-up to the South Africa One-Day International squad for their three-match home series against India later this month.

The home team were beaten by 113 runs in last week’s first test in Pretoria and if they lose again will concede a home series to India for the first time. “We don't need to panic,” the South Africa skipper told a virtual news conference on Sunday. “I still think we've got a lot of capable players even if they are, in the main, quite inexperienced, but they also have to take the responsibility. “One or two poor innings with the bat does not make them bad cricketers and backing them is an extremely important thing going forward in test cricket. That's how you build and grow your test team.” Elgar said there had been some “hard conversations” in the days following the first test defeat where South Africa failed to get 200 runs in either innings. “There were definite areas that we spoke about, looking to go back to the basic principles of batting and tightening up on our bowling.\" South Africa were also hit by the sudden retirement of wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock from test cricket, which Elgar admitted had come as shock. De Kock, 29, gave family reasons for his decision, made within minutes of the first-test defeat, but will continue to play limited-overs cricket. He was due to miss the second and third test in any case because of the imminent birth of his first child. “I was pretty shocked, I wasn't aware this was going to happen. But sitting down with Quinny that evening and him explaining to me the reason for it, means I very much respect his decision,\" Elgar said. “It’s disappointing not having Quinny around and something we need to get over.” Kyle Verreynne, 24, will replace De Kock as wicketkeeper for the remaining tests but Elgar said no other changes had been decided. He suggested South Africa would continue to play spinner Keshrav Maharaj along with their seam attack and predicted the Wanderers wicket might be more batting friendly than that at Centurion last week.

India wrapped up a 113-run victory on Thursday in the first game of the three-match series at Centurion Park, where Kohli continued his run of low scores that has seen him unable to profit from good starts to his innings. Dravid admitted there had been a lot of \"noise\" around Kohli in the last few weeks after he was axed as captain of the One-Day International side, causing some controversy back home. But he said there were no concerns about his form with the bat as India seek a first-ever test series win in South Africa. \"Virat has been phenomenal over the last 20 days we have been here, the way he has trained and connected with the group,\" Dravid told reporters on Sunday. \"I could not speak more highly about him and the way he has committed to his own preparation and his own practice. On and off the field he has been a fantastic leader. \"We were in a very good space leading into the first test and a lot of that was led by Virat. It is a pleasure to work with someone like him. He batted well but cannot convert those starts.\" Dravid believes the runs will come for Kohli, who has not scored a test century in more than two years. He has managed 652 runs in his last 14 tests at an average of 26.08, almost half his career average of 50.34. \"I really feel there is going to be a big run of scores coming in from him,\" Dravid said. \"It might not happen in the next game, though I hope it does, but it will click in place. \"He has been a credit to himself and Indian cricket in the last few weeks.\" (Reporting by Nick Said; editing by Clare Fallon)","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/01/02/1428983.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my"},{"title":"Weather in Johannesburg South Africa: What is the weather prediction for IND vs SA Day 1 at The Wanderers?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-weather-in-johannesburg-south-africa-what-is-the-weather-prediction-for-ind-vs-sa-day-1-at-the-wanderers/","keywords":["Cricket","India","India tour of South Africa 2021-22","South Africa"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Weather in Johannesburg: The SportsRush presents for you the detailed weather prediction for Day 1 of second SA vs IND Test.

South Africa and India are all in readiness of locking horns in the second of this three-match Test series after a three-day gap as proceedings have moved from Centurion to Johannesburg. 1-0 up in the series, it is a rare situation where India are leading in a Test series in South Africa. Yet to win a Test series despite playing in South Africa for three decades, India are also chasing history for a victory in this match will provide them with an unassailable 2-0 lead.

Barring any forced change, fans can expect South Africa and India to make a change each (at maximum) in their respective bowling units.

During the 32nd match of the ongoing 11th season of the Big Bash League between Sydney Thunder and Adelaide Strikers in Sydney, Sydney Thunder beat Adelaide Strikers by 28 runs. Thunder, who have won their fifth match of the season, have jumped to the third position on the points table. Meanwhile, Strikers continue to struggle on the penultimate position on the back of seven BBL 11 losses. Chasing a 173-run target, Strikers were bundled out for 144 in 19.1 overs after not being able to recover from debutant fast bowler Mohammad Hasnain’s first over. Introduced into the attack for the first time in BBL, Hasnain picked as many as three wickets in the third over to reduce the visitors to 25/3. In what started with Strikers opening batter Matthew Short (13) flicking a Hasnain delivery straight to Daniel Sams at deep square leg, his opening partner Jake Weatherald (10) was the next played to be dismissed after being found wanting in front of the stumps. On the penultimate delivery of the over, Jonathan Wells’ (0) attempt of pulling Hasnain resulted Thunder all-rounder Ben Cutting grabbing a stunning catch at short mid-wicket. Hasnain, who started his BBL career with a three-wicket maiden, gave away only 20 runs in his next three overs to begin well down under. However, it was Thunder opening batter Matthew Gilkes who was awarded the ‘Man of the Match’ award for smashing his second T20 half-century. Opening the batting with Cutting (34), Gilkes had scored a match-winning 93 (57) with the help of nine fours and three sixes. Mohammad Hasnain BBL debut TRIPLE. WICKET. MAIDEN. ON.

But India's weakness still remains their middle order batting.

He said, \"Could be a variety of factors, it happens to people. You feel you are batting well but big scores don't come. It is so happening that 2 or 3 of them are going through it at the same time. They are batting well and playing well. They know how to convert. They are practicing very well, they are in a good space. These are challening conditions, they know how to do it.

He said that the 32-year-old has been quite professional in the way he has gone about things in nets and training sessions. Outside there has been a lot of noise around the Kohli vs BCCI controversy, but Dravid said that the captain has handled himself pretty well, training hard, connecting with the team on or off the field and gelling well with the unit. \"I know there has been a lot of noise outside but keeping the morale high has not been difficult. Virat has been phenomenal in last 20 days, the way he has practised and trained. He has been a true leader and the way he has connected with group on and off he has been a fantastic leader and good captain.
