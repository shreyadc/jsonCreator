Invited to bat first, the visitors recovered from 111-6 to post 274-9 in their allotted 50 overs before the home side rode on scintillating innings from Kushal Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee to reach 275-7 with 18 balls to spare. Chasing a modest target, Nepal were reduced to 77-5 after top order faltered. But Malla and Airee shared a 100-run partnership for the sixth wicket to bring the home team back into the match. After the fall of Malla in the 28th over, Airee and Gulsan Jha added 43 runs for the seventh wicket, before Airee and Sompal Kami took the team home with a 55- run partnership for the unbroken eighth wicket. Player-of-the-match Airee remained unbeaten on 85 off 116 balls that included eight boundaries and a six, while Malla hit nine fours and four sixes in his 67-ball 81. Sompal Kami, who hit the winning runs, scored 32- ball 24 not out with the help of three boundaries. Jha (17) and opener Kushal Bhurtel (16) contributed in double figures. Chris Sole (3-72) and Mark Watt (3-43) shared six wickets between them for Scotland, while Michael Leask grabbed a wicket. Earlier, Leask top scored for the tourists with an unbeaten 107 off 85 balls that included three fours and nine sixes. Scotland were reduced to 111-6 in 24.2 oversbefore Leask and Jack Jarvis added 82 runs for the seventh wicket to help the team post challenging score. Jarvis was the second best scorer for Scotland with 38-ball 26, while Mark Watt contributed 20. Opener Christopher McBride and Brandon McMullen scored 22 each, while skipper Richie Berrington and Tomas Mackintosh contributed 19 apiece. Chris Greaves (16) also scored in double figures for Scotland. Sandeep Lamichhane was the pick of the Nepali bowlers taking 3-27 from 10 overs, while Kushal Malla grabbed 2-49. Sompal Kami, Kushal Bhurtel and Dipendra Singh Airee claimed one each for the home team. The victory turned out to be a bitter one for Lamichhane and Nepali team after Scotland players refused to shake hands with the rape-accused legspinner, who is currently out on bail. Scotland, who confirmed the championship with a 10-wicket victory over Namibia on Wednesday, are at the top of the seven-team table with 48 points, while Nepal remained unchanged at sixth on 22 despite their second straight victory. Oman are second on 44 points, while Namibia are third on 37, two more than United States. The United Arab Emirates, who also have 10 matches remaining like Nepal, are at the fifth position with 27 points. Papua New Guinea are at the bottom of the table with five points Nepali players greet the crowd as they celebrate after beating Scotland in the ODI tri-series match under the ICC Cricket World Cup League-II at the TU Stadium in Kathmandu on Friday. from 28 teams.

Nepal defeated ICC Cricket World Cup League-II champions Scotland by three wickets in the One Day International match at the TU Stadium today and coach Desai lauded his boys after their second consecutive victory. \"I have been saying one thing from the start - we are trying to build a story. And I am happy to see that people [cricketers] are able to dive into their roles,\" said Desai. \"They are understanding when to play a lead role, when to play a side role, when to play attacking, and when to be defensive. It's heartening to see how well they are able to absorb the information and apply that over there [in the match]. So, we are in a learner's journey with the champions' attitude and we want to continue that,\" he added. \"It's a great start to the journey.\" Desai lauded the team for recovering well despite losing wickets in the early stage of the run-chase. \"The results show that the mentality and the understanding of how to build the dressing room is evident. We lost a couple of early wickets, but then again, the emphasis of understanding how the dressing room should operate the calmness in the dressing room againwas evident and automatically that energy we could see how it has been transforming to the performances in the centre out there in the partnerships that we achieved. For me it was heartening to see Kushal Malla and the pending partnership to stitch that big partnership and bring us back in the game. Desai called on the fans to support the team for the remaining matches. \"Come in large numbers to support us. This country loves this game. You all love this game. We need one more country to come up and compete with the best out there in the world.\" He also hinted at going with the same squad in the next match against Namibia on Saturday. \"I generally believe in stability. You need to keep on allowing the players to play that role again and again so that they can take the experience on board and keep on improving their games.\" Player of the match Dipendra Singh Airee said he played the role as demanded by the situation. \"It was not a tough one as I played my role. The situation demanded a partnership in the beginning and it was easy thereafter,\" he said. \"I enjoy finishing the game, whether I am playing in top order or down. Rather than thinking too much, I just took it as an one-ball battle as instructed by the coach,\" Airee added. \"We are treating each of the 12 matches as final and the team's environment at the moment is awesome.\"","pubDate":"2023-02-18 04:59:07","image_url":"https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2023/02/18/21649.jfif","source_id":"thehimalayantimes","category":["sports"],"country":["Nepal"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: Virat Kohli Calls Jadeja 'Pathaan', Stump Mic Catches Conversation","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/virat-kohli-calls-ravindra-jadeja-pathaan-stump-mic-catches-conversation-watch-3793146","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ravindra Jadeja has a new nickname which was given to him by his India teammates.","content":"Despite bowling out Australia for 263 on Day 1 of the second Test, Team India failed to stamp its authority as Usman Khawaja (81) and Peter Handscomb (72*) managed to rescue the visitors in Delhi.

Matt Renshaw was named as his concussion substitute, Cricket Australia confirmed ahead of the day's play on Saturday. Warner was hit by a bouncer from Mohammed Siraj while batting on Day 1 and he did not take the field during India's innings later in the day. Warner's bad form in Test cricket continued as he was dismissed for just 15. Earlier, Australia opener Usman Khawaja said that a mere three innings isn't a great sample size to question a beleaguered Warner, who became a bit “weary” after being knocked on the head by a Mohammed Siraj bouncer on day one of the second Test. Warner has scores of 1, 10 and 15 in the series so far with Mohammed Shami getting him twice with fuller length deliveries angling in. Inevitably, the question of Warner's technique has cropped up but Khawaja, fresh from his well-made 81, came to his opening partner's defence. “I have to kind of disagree with what you're saying. He hit two fours of Ashwin in the last game before he got out lbw so he was showing some aggression,” Khawaja said, when asked if Warner, whose stay looked painstaking during the 44 deliveries faced, needs to be pro-active. “It's never easy out there, especially starting out, even if you're opening starting out there is never easy so I was lucky today. I got a couple (of boundaries) to get me going. “Sometimes you don't get that and it can be very hard. So yeah, three innings is not enough for me. There's still a long way to go in this Test series. I'm looking forward to what may happen.” Khawaja is very confident of Warner's capabilities of bouncing back. “Davey has been such a terrific player for such a long time. Every time his back is against the wall he produces something so we'll see.” (With PTI inputs)","pubDate":"2023-02-18 03:59:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘T20 in whites’: Ruthless Bazball goes ‘computer game’ mode as ‘demoralising’ Test record smashed","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/countries/england/new-zealand-vs-england-cricket-scores-2023-updates-video-highlights-bazball-neil-wagner-figures-record-harry-brook/news-story/8d8f7fbc4c1de96671fa4e71fa860c87","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A helpless Neil Wagner has an unwanted Test record, with the star Kiwi bowler ruthlessly dismantled by a fearless England batting line-up as New Zealand copped a brutal ‘Bazball’ assault.","content":"A helpless Neil Wagner has an unwanted Test record, with the star Kiwi bowler ruthlessly dismantled by a fearless England batting line-up as New Zealand copped a brutal ‘Bazball’ assault. Under Kiwi coach Brendon McCullum, England’s middle order, led by Ollie Pope, Joe Root and Harry Brook, made a breathtaking statement during the opening session of the third day’s play against the Black Caps in the day-night Test at Mt Maunganui. Resuming their second innings on 2-79 with a lead of 98 runs, they smashed 104 runs from the first 15 overs of Saturday’s play. Watch Australia’s Tour of India.

Start your free trial now > England’s batters ultimately plundered 158 runs but lost four wickets in a breakneck session on Saturday that leaves the first Test still finely poised. The tourists raced to 6-237 in their second innings at tea, opening up a 256-run lead. The big hitting encapsulated England’s aggressive batting approach that has carried it to victory in nine of its past 10 Tests. Former New Zealand all-rounder Craig McMillan labelled England’s first session approach as “T20 in whites”, while English commentator Alison Mitchell declared it “Test cricket but not as we know it”. Fellow Spark Sport caller Scotty Stevenson labelled the England onslaught “ridiculous”. “It’s a style of cricket designed to deflate and demoralise. They’re applying a blowtorch to the mental fortitude of this home side,” Stevenson told Spark Sport. Blundell century keeps NZ alive | 01:22 “This is the new England – and it’s not victimless, as entertaining as it is.” Former Kiwi opener Mark Richardson added: “It’s just been staggering cricket. I’ve sat back and watched in disbelief.” England lost nightwatchman Stuart Broad for seven before Pope and Root caught fire. The English duo smashed 62 runs in just under eight overs, with Pope taking a particular liking to left-arm quick Wagner, whose previously-successful short-pitch bowling approach was exposed. Pope hooked Wagner for three sixes before smacking another two fours on his way to a stunning 46-ball knock of 49. Wagner eventually dismissed Pope caught behind, but the relief was short-lived as Brook came to the wicket and picked up from where Pope left off.

Picture: Phil Walter Source: Getty Images Brook, who’s been a revelation for England since being introduced into the Test team last year, hit five fours and two sixes off Wagner, who paid a heavy price for persisting with short-pitched bowling. His last over cost 18 runs as Brook opened his stance and used a baseball technique to swat the 36-year-old for four boundaries. Renowned for his ability to intimidate the world’s best batting line-ups — including Australia’s — Wagner, had the figures of 2-104 after 11 overs. It was the most runs any bowler has ever conceded from their first 11 overs in Test history, usurping Australian leg-spinner Bryce McGain’s first 11 overs (0-102) against South Africa in 2009. New Zealand legend and former captain Stephen Fleming said it was one of the first times he’d seen an opposition side take on Wagner, which he was thrown by. “A lot of players are struggling to find a method to play Wagner and keep the ball down. England, you talk about intent and positivity, this is intent,” Fleming told Spark Sport. Black Caps produce WORST drop ever? | 01:00 “Looking not even to bother keeping the ball down, they actually use the pace and just hit it 20 rows back if you can. That is intent, that is the McCullum effect. If you’re in, you’re 100 per cent in. “You can talk about tactics and attitude, in real time that’s what’s happening. Rather than trying to find a half-hearted way to play, ‘just get inside and hit it for six, mate’ – he (McCullum) would probably say – and take the aggressive option. “It’s one of the first times I’ve seen Wagner really struggling with two things: Take wickets but also control the run rate, which is a tactic New Zealand have used for many years. “For all the attributes and qualities that Wagner has, it’s getting dangerously out of control for NZ.” — with AFP","pubDate":"2023-02-18 03:59:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw allegedly attacked by fan with baseball bat","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/countries/india/indian-cricketer-prithvi-shaw-allegedly-attacked-by-fan-with-baseball-bat/news-story/cb74010aebb74faf8c216fc2efb6f43f","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw has been filmed in an altercation with a group of fans in Mumbai.","content":"Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw has been filmed in an altercation with a group of fans in Mumbai.

Warner was struck on the helmet by Indian quick Mohammed Siraj during his scratchy 15 in Australia's first innings of 263 at Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday. He waved off the team doctor after top edging an attempted pull shot into the left side of his helmet. Warner showed no immediate signs of discomfort and kept batting until he was dismissed. He did not field when India batted for nine overs on Friday evening and later failed a concussion test. Warner was also hit on the elbow from a Siraj delivery earlier in his 15-over stay at the crease, requiring immediate attention from medical staff. He has been replaced in Australia's XI by Matt Renshaw, who was dropped for the recalled Travis Head for the second Border-Gavaskar Test after twin failures with the bat in series-opener in Nagpur. It is the second time Australia have been forced to use a concussion sub mid-match after Steve Smith was replaced by Marnus Labuschagne during the 2019 Ashes after being hit on the head by a Jofra Archer bouncer. Labuschagne took his opportunity at Lord's and never looked back, and he is the world's No.1 ranked Test batter. Warner's position in the Test team was already under a cloud after being down on form for the majority of the last three years. The Australian camp have disputed various reports claiming Head is a contender to replace Warner at the top of the order, as soon as this series Warner entered the Boxing Day Test in December - his 100th match - under extreme pressure to retain his spot. But Warner scored a classic 200 to end a Test century drought dating to January 2020 to book his spot for a third red-ball tour of India. Warner's Test record in India is dismal, averaging 21.78. There have been warning signs the end is near for Warner, with the NSW star explaining he felt \"exhausted, tired\" ahead of this blockbuster tour. Warner has previously said he wanted to continue playing Tests until at least the end of this year's Ashes in England - a country where he has also had trouble making runs. Usman Khawaja backed Warner to find form before the end of the series, but also conceded his opener partner was feeling \"weary\". \"Three innings is not enough for me - I think there's still a long way to go in this Test series,\" Khawaja said after play on Friday. \"Dave has been such a terrific player for such a long time. \"Every time his back is against the wall he produces something so we'll see.\" Warner is averaging 45.47 from 103 Tests, hitting 25 centuries - the eighth most by an Australian.","pubDate":"2023-02-18 03:37:44","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-9795386/cafffb2a221a5db286578a058fb900e7dc881ad9-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs AUS LIVE: India eye solid start vs Australia on Day 2","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/australia-in-india/india-vs-australia-2nd-test-live-cricket-score-updates-from-delhi-day-2/liveblog/98032548.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Mohammed Siraj, despite going wicketless, deserves credit for softening up David Warner, who struggled during his 50-run stand with Khawaja.

Shami must be given credit for the way he bowled after Rohit Sharma pressed him from the other end in the first session. The pitch was a typical slow turner but had better carry than the Nagpur wicket and and it did help Khawaja, as he was able to hit through the line during his knock that had 12 fours and a six. The highlight on Friday was KL Rahul's brilliant catch at point off a powerful reverse sweep by Khawaja. That athletic effort not just broke the 59-run sixth-wicket partnership between Khawaja and Handscomb it also halted Australia's charge.

A week after they fell to Sydney in a qualifying final, hopes of back-to-back flags were extinguished, on a night the Lions even had to deal with the late withdrawal of key tall Joe Daniher . The Demons need Jake Lever to be a rebounding king across half-back - a skill opponents want to deny him of. Credit: Getty. “In finals, generally your vulnerabilities come out in games,” Goodwin, the 2021 premiership coach, said in the chilly bowels of the MCG. “And we’ve had some throughout the second half of the year, especially. When we’ve lost games of footy, teams have been able to impact in the second half of games and mow down leads, and it happened again tonight. “So we’ve got to be able to deal with those situations, the pressure in games, second half in games when things aren’t perfect for us. And we’ll dig into all of our program about what that looks like, but we’ve got some vulnerabilities that we need to fix up.” Loading Almost five months on, and with the new season all but upon us, the Demons have confidence those “vulnerabilities” have been addressed. Head of football Alan Richardson told The Age that the Demons had completed a comprehensive review, which also touched on many of the team’s “really good” traits in a season when they had 16 home-and-away wins and finished second on the ladder. “It was probably in the second half of the year, not just the two finals, that we became pretty vulnerable in the second half of games,” Richardson said. “So, what was that? Is it fitness? Is it mindset? Is it opposition? Or all of the above? Although [it was] not fitness. We are still running really hard. There were a few competition-wide markers that were strong proof that we were still a hard-running team. It was a bit more about attitude and opposition. Teams were taking things away from us.” Christian Petracca will again be a prime mover for the Demons in 2023. Credit: Getty Images While Richardson said fitness was not an issue, rival clubs speculated the loss of master fitness coach Darren Burgess - who left for the Crows after the 2021 premiership - had an impact on the Demons. Champion Data statistics show that the Demons were the best first-term team in the competition, winning 17 opening quarters. They were equal second for second and third quarters won, but slipped to sixth for fourth-quarter wins. That they were -31 for points differential in the final term, ranked 13th, highlighted their woes. They led at three-quarter-time in four of their eight defeats last season, and were tied at three-quarter-time with the Lions in their semi-final. But by that point in the semi, they had ceded a 28-point second-quarter lead, and ultimately lost by 13 points. Opponents increasingly worked out how to quell, even combat, defensive maestros Steven May and Jake Lever. May, who signed a two-year contract extension last week , had 23 disposals and held Lance Franklin goalless in the qualifying final, but he was forced to work up the ground more, robbing May of the “goalkeeping” role he relishes. Intercept king Lever was made more accountable by opponents, denying him his marking and rebounding skills. Lever has had ankle issues over summer but is now fine. That may be eased this season if skipper Max Gawn, as he has flagged , plays more of a defensive sweeper role in the mould that Geelong ruck Rhys Stanley was so successful at last season. “There is no doubt, the combination of, in terms of our talls, May, Lever and [Harrison] Petty, it’s a bit like [Tom] Stewart down at Geelong - you go in knowing if you let these sort of players get it on their terms, it’s going to be hard to score,” Richardson said. “Most clubs, particularly the clubs at the top, have a couple of defenders you want to try and tie up. Our blokes were no different. Yes, that was a bit of trend, that teams would do a little bit more work and, potentially, change up their forward structure to be able to do that. That’s something we will have to fight through.” The Demons hope former Magpies ruckman Brodie Grundy can provide more marking power inside 50 when sent there. There is much intrigue as to how the Grundy and Gawn partnership will work . Both are multiple All-Australians and best-and-fairest winners. Loading Grundy has never flourished as a forward, as his former coach Nathan Buckley has said, but Gawn has improved in this area. However, he has spoken of a desire to spend more time behind the ball, allowing Grundy to head into attacking 50. Former West Coast forward Karl Langdon has questioned whether both can co-exist in the same 22, but Richardson says both men can flourish, as Gawn and Luke Jackson, now with Fremantle, had. “We think that partnership is going to be really good for us, potentially. I reckon it’s going to take a bit of time for the boys to get the synergy in terms of when to play forward, and when to play ruck,” Richardson said. “That’s no different to the way Gawny and Luke Jackson worked together. We have sort of been through it in many ways with two genuine rucks, both different, as are these two.” Richardson said he didn’t expect either to be benched under the new substitute ruling, for each should be relatively fresh late in games - and as the season unfolds. Uncapped youngster Jacob van Rooyen - unlikely, said Richardson, to debut in round one - is another tall forward option alongside Ben Brown, the latter having completed most of the pre-season. Brown’s marking issues in both finals last year were put under the spotlight by media and supporters. Melbourne great Garry Lyon lamented at the time there had been a “malaise” about the Demons’ forward line for the entire season. They averaged 12.5 goals per game, the sixth highest, but had only 10 in the qualifying final defeat. Brown, Bayley Fritsch and Kysaiah Pickett each contributed more than 20 goals for the season. The Demons have made a change, with veteran coach Mark Williams replacing Greg Stafford as goalkicking coach. Fellow forward Tom McDonald has fully recovered from the Lisfranc injury that derailed most of last year, and young gun Pickett, off contract this year , will have more midfield time because of his “exceptional” skills. Loading Former Bulldog premiership winger Lachie Hunter adds more midfield class, while Kade Chandler, with 10 games across four seasons, has dazzled over summer. In stars Christian Petracca, Clayton Oliver and Jack Viney, the Demons have a hard-at-it midfield the envy of most teams. Oliver, having had off-season thumb surgery, and later a scare when the thumb was badly bruised, and Petracca, the latter impacted by a knee injury in the finals, are at the peak of their powers. Vice captain Viney may also have spells up forward if Pickett is given more time in the middle. The Demons also hope to benefit by again being the hunters, rather than hunted, this season. The noose that can be chasing back-to-back flags, particularly with the added desire to repeat before the blue-and-red faithful at the MCG, having won in Perth in the COVID-impacted campaign of ’21, may have mentally worn the team down. As Goodwin said after the loss to the Lions: “We knew that pressure around our footy club would be high and that’s why it’s challenging to be successful when you’ve come off what we’ve come off. And that’s why not many teams do it.” Firmly in the premiership window in terms of average age, games played and key on-field statistics , Richardson, the former St Kilda coach, said the Demons intended to “live in the moment, play in the moment” more this season. “We won 10 in a row [last season]. I wouldn’t say every week we focused on going back to back, far from it … the noise around the camp, around the footy club, was just taking it a week at a time, but it was just the way that we played at times in those second half of games,” he said. “We didn’t help ourselves at times. We almost played as if not to lose, as opposed to continuing to play to win. It’s hard to know. What you then need to do is you talk about it, you address it, it’s as much about us as a leadership group, a coaching group, to make sure that we continue to reinforce, stay positive and stay in the moment.” Keep up to date with the best AFL coverage in the country.

Mumbai Indians are the most successful IPL side with five trophies, followed by Chennai Super Kings, who have won four titles. \"The numbers tell you everything. See, MS Dhoni had the experience of captaining the Indian team and then he became the captain of the Chennai Super Kings. Rohit Sharma's first captaincy stint was with the Mumbai Indians, and from there, his journey to success began. \"So, that's why he deserves more credit. Much like Sourav Ganguly, who became the captain of the Indian team and tried new and different things. Under his leadership, India became the number one one-day team. That's why my pick is Rohit Sharma,\" Sehwag told Star Sports during a programme to celebrate 15 years of the IPL. However, former India spinner Harbhajan Singh voted Dhoni as the best skipper of the IPL. \"I will give my vote to Dhoni, because from the very first year, he has played for a single franchise. He has played a huge role in making the franchise successful. The way he has captained his team has been extraordinary. Other captains also have done well and have won the tournament. But I think, overall, my vote will definitely go to Dhoni,\" said Harbhajan. \"If you look at the trophies -- Rohit Sharma has won five trophies, while MS Dhoni has won four. I have played for both teams. My heart still keeps beating for Mumbai Indians since I have played there for 10 years but those two years at CSK taught me a lot.\"","pubDate":"2023-02-18 02:41:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Hosts Nepal hammer champions Scotland","link":"https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/hosts-nepal-hammer-champions-scotland","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KATHMANDU, FEBRUARY 17Nepal defeated Scotland by three wickets in the One Day International tri-series match under the ICC Cricket World Cup League-II here at the TU Stadium today....","content":"Nepal defeated Scotland by three wickets in the One Day International tri-series match under the ICC Cricket World Cup League-II here at the TU Stadium today. Invited to bat first, the visitors recovered from 111-6 to post 274-9 in their allotted 50 overs before the home side rode on scintillating innings from Kushal Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee to reach 275-7 with 18 balls to spare. Chasing a modest target, Nepal were reduced to 77-5 after top order faltered. But Malla and Airee shared a 100-run partnership for the sixth wicket to bring the home team back into the match. After the fall of Malla in the 28th over, Airee and Gulsan Jha added 43 runs for the seventh wicket, before Airee and Sompal Kami took the team home with a 55- run partnership for the unbroken eighth wicket. Player-of-the-match Airee remained unbeaten on 85 off 116 balls that included eight boundaries and a six, while Malla hit nine fours and four sixes in his 67-ball 81.

Chris Greaves (16) also scored in double figures for Scotland. Sandeep Lamichhane was the pick of the Nepali bowlers taking 3-27 from 10 overs, while Kushal Malla grabbed 2-49. Sompal Kami, Kushal Bhurtel and Dipendra Singh Airee claimed one each for the home team. The victory turned out to be a bitter one for Lamichhane and Nepali team after Scotland players refused to shake hands with the rape-accused legspinner, who is currently out on bail.

So, we are in a learner's journey with the champions' attitude and we want to continue that,\" he added. \"It's a great start to the journey.\" Desai lauded the team for recovering well despite losing wickets in the early stage of the run-chase. \"The results show that the mentality and the understanding of how to build the dressing room is evident. We lost a couple of early wickets, but then again, the emphasis of understanding how the dressing room should operate the calmness in the dressing room againwas evident and automatically that energy we could see how it has been transforming to the performances in the centre out there in the partnerships that we achieved. For me it was heartening to see Kushal Malla and the pending partnership to stitch that big partnership and bring us back in the game. Desai called on the fans to support the team for the remaining matches. \"Come in large numbers to support us. This country loves this game. You all love this game. We need one more country to come up and compete with the best out there in the world.\" He also hinted at going with the same squad in the next match against Namibia on Saturday. \"I generally believe in stability. You need to keep on allowing the players to play that role again and again so that they can take the experience on board and keep on improving their games.\" Player of the match Dipendra Singh Airee said he played the role as demanded by the situation. \"It was not a tough one as I played my role. The situation demanded a partnership in the beginning and it was easy thereafter,\" he said. \"I enjoy finishing the game, whether I am playing in top order or down.

Matt Renshaw was named as his concussion substitute, Cricket Australia confirmed ahead of the day's play on Saturday. Warner was hit by a bouncer from Mohammed Siraj while batting on Day 1 and he did not take the field during India's innings later in the day. Warner's bad form in Test cricket continued as he was dismissed for just 15. Earlier, Australia opener Usman Khawaja said that a mere three innings isn't a great sample size to question a beleaguered Warner, who became a bit “weary” after being knocked on the head by a Mohammed Siraj bouncer on day one of the second Test. Warner has scores of 1, 10 and 15 in the series so far with Mohammed Shami getting him twice with fuller length deliveries angling in. Inevitably, the question of Warner's technique has cropped up but Khawaja, fresh from his well-made 81, came to his opening partner's defence. “I have to kind of disagree with what you're saying. He hit two fours of Ashwin in the last game before he got out lbw so he was showing some aggression,” Khawaja said, when asked if Warner, whose stay looked painstaking during the 44 deliveries faced, needs to be pro-active. “It's never easy out there, especially starting out, even if you're opening starting out there is never easy so I was lucky today. I got a couple (of boundaries) to get me going. “Sometimes you don't get that and it can be very hard. So yeah, three innings is not enough for me. There's still a long way to go in this Test series. I'm looking forward to what may happen.” Khawaja is very confident of Warner's capabilities of bouncing back. “Davey has been such a terrific player for such a long time. Every time his back is against the wall he produces something so we'll see.” (With PTI inputs)","pubDate":"2023-02-18 03:59:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘T20 in whites’: Ruthless Bazball goes ‘computer game’ mode as ‘demoralising’ Test record smashed","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/countries/england/new-zealand-vs-england-cricket-scores-2023-updates-video-highlights-bazball-neil-wagner-figures-record-harry-brook/news-story/8d8f7fbc4c1de96671fa4e71fa860c87","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A helpless Neil Wagner has an unwanted Test record, with the star Kiwi bowler ruthlessly dismantled by a fearless England batting line-up as New Zealand copped a brutal ‘Bazball’ assault.","content":"A helpless Neil Wagner has an unwanted Test record, with the star Kiwi bowler ruthlessly dismantled by a fearless England batting line-up as New Zealand copped a brutal ‘Bazball’ assault.

The tourists raced to 6-237 in their second innings at tea, opening up a 256-run lead. The big hitting encapsulated England’s aggressive batting approach that has carried it to victory in nine of its past 10 Tests. Former New Zealand all-rounder Craig McMillan labelled England’s first session approach as “T20 in whites”, while English commentator Alison Mitchell declared it “Test cricket but not as we know it”. Fellow Spark Sport caller Scotty Stevenson labelled the England onslaught “ridiculous”. “It’s a style of cricket designed to deflate and demoralise. They’re applying a blowtorch to the mental fortitude of this home side,” Stevenson told Spark Sport. Blundell century keeps NZ alive | 01:22 “This is the new England – and it’s not victimless, as entertaining as it is.” Former Kiwi opener Mark Richardson added: “It’s just been staggering cricket. I’ve sat back and watched in disbelief.” England lost nightwatchman Stuart Broad for seven before Pope and Root caught fire. The English duo smashed 62 runs in just under eight overs, with Pope taking a particular liking to left-arm quick Wagner, whose previously-successful short-pitch bowling approach was exposed. Pope hooked Wagner for three sixes before smacking another two fours on his way to a stunning 46-ball knock of 49. Wagner eventually dismissed Pope caught behind, but the relief was short-lived as Brook came to the wicket and picked up from where Pope left off.

His last over cost 18 runs as Brook opened his stance and used a baseball technique to swat the 36-year-old for four boundaries. Renowned for his ability to intimidate the world’s best batting line-ups — including Australia’s — Wagner, had the figures of 2-104 after 11 overs. It was the most runs any bowler has ever conceded from their first 11 overs in Test history, usurping Australian leg-spinner Bryce McGain’s first 11 overs (0-102) against South Africa in 2009. New Zealand legend and former captain Stephen Fleming said it was one of the first times he’d seen an opposition side take on Wagner, which he was thrown by. “A lot of players are struggling to find a method to play Wagner and keep the ball down. England, you talk about intent and positivity, this is intent,” Fleming told Spark Sport.

That is intent, that is the McCullum effect. If you’re in, you’re 100 per cent in. “You can talk about tactics and attitude, in real time that’s what’s happening. Rather than trying to find a half-hearted way to play, ‘just get inside and hit it for six, mate’ – he (McCullum) would probably say – and take the aggressive option. “It’s one of the first times I’ve seen Wagner really struggling with two things: Take wickets but also control the run rate, which is a tactic New Zealand have used for many years. “For all the attributes and qualities that Wagner has, it’s getting dangerously out of control for NZ.” — with AFP","pubDate":"2023-02-18 03:59:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw allegedly attacked by fan with baseball bat","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/countries/india/indian-cricketer-prithvi-shaw-allegedly-attacked-by-fan-with-baseball-bat/news-story/cb74010aebb74faf8c216fc2efb6f43f","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw has been filmed in an altercation with a group of fans in Mumbai.","content":"Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw has been filmed in an altercation with a group of fans in Mumbai.

Warner was struck on the helmet by Indian quick Mohammed Siraj during his scratchy 15 in Australia's first innings of 263 at Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday. He waved off the team doctor after top edging an attempted pull shot into the left side of his helmet. Warner showed no immediate signs of discomfort and kept batting until he was dismissed. He did not field when India batted for nine overs on Friday evening and later failed a concussion test. Warner was also hit on the elbow from a Siraj delivery earlier in his 15-over stay at the crease, requiring immediate attention from medical staff. He has been replaced in Australia's XI by Matt Renshaw, who was dropped for the recalled Travis Head for the second Border-Gavaskar Test after twin failures with the bat in series-opener in Nagpur. It is the second time Australia have been forced to use a concussion sub mid-match after Steve Smith was replaced by Marnus Labuschagne during the 2019 Ashes after being hit on the head by a Jofra Archer bouncer. Labuschagne took his opportunity at Lord's and never looked back, and he is the world's No.1 ranked Test batter. Warner's position in the Test team was already under a cloud after being down on form for the majority of the last three years. The Australian camp have disputed various reports claiming Head is a contender to replace Warner at the top of the order, as soon as this series Warner entered the Boxing Day Test in December - his 100th match - under extreme pressure to retain his spot. But Warner scored a classic 200 to end a Test century drought dating to January 2020 to book his spot for a third red-ball tour of India. Warner's Test record in India is dismal, averaging 21.78. There have been warning signs the end is near for Warner, with the NSW star explaining he felt \"exhausted, tired\" ahead of this blockbuster tour. Warner has previously said he wanted to continue playing Tests until at least the end of this year's Ashes in England - a country where he has also had trouble making runs. Usman Khawaja backed Warner to find form before the end of the series, but also conceded his opener partner was feeling \"weary\". \"Three innings is not enough for me - I think there's still a long way to go in this Test series,\" Khawaja said after play on Friday. \"Dave has been such a terrific player for such a long time. \"Every time his back is against the wall he produces something so we'll see.\" Warner is averaging 45.47 from 103 Tests, hitting 25 centuries - the eighth most by an Australian.","pubDate":"2023-02-18 03:37:44","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-9795386/cafffb2a221a5db286578a058fb900e7dc881ad9-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs AUS LIVE: India eye solid start vs Australia on Day 2","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/australia-in-india/india-vs-australia-2nd-test-live-cricket-score-updates-from-delhi-day-2/liveblog/98032548.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Mohammed Siraj, despite going wicketless, deserves credit for softening up David Warner, who struggled during his 50-run stand with Khawaja.

The pitch was a typical slow turner but had better carry than the Nagpur wicket and and it did help Khawaja, as he was able to hit through the line during his knock that had 12 fours and a six. The highlight on Friday was KL Rahul's brilliant catch at point off a powerful reverse sweep by Khawaja. That athletic effort not just broke the 59-run sixth-wicket partnership between Khawaja and Handscomb it also halted Australia's charge. Shami's (14.4-4-60-4) repertoire of deliveries was on full display as he struck with the new, semi-new and old ball, while Ashwin (21-4-57-3) and Jadeja (21-2-68-3) came up with breakthroughs just when the opposition seemed to be gaining foothold as India took the opening day's honours. At stumps, India were 21 for no loss with Rohit Sharma (13 batting) and KL Rahul (4 batting) at the crease.

Head of football Alan Richardson told The Age that the Demons had completed a comprehensive review, which also touched on many of the team’s “really good” traits in a season when they had 16 home-and-away wins and finished second on the ladder. “It was probably in the second half of the year, not just the two finals, that we became pretty vulnerable in the second half of games,” Richardson said. “So, what was that? Is it fitness? Is it mindset? Is it opposition? Or all of the above? Although [it was] not fitness. We are still running really hard. There were a few competition-wide markers that were strong proof that we were still a hard-running team. It was a bit more about attitude and opposition. Teams were taking things away from us.” Christian Petracca will again be a prime mover for the Demons in 2023. Credit: Getty Images While Richardson said fitness was not an issue, rival clubs speculated the loss of master fitness coach Darren Burgess - who left for the Crows after the 2021 premiership - had an impact on the Demons. Champion Data statistics show that the Demons were the best first-term team in the competition, winning 17 opening quarters. They were equal second for second and third quarters won, but slipped to sixth for fourth-quarter wins. That they were -31 for points differential in the final term, ranked 13th, highlighted their woes. They led at three-quarter-time in four of their eight defeats last season, and were tied at three-quarter-time with the Lions in their semi-final. But by that point in the semi, they had ceded a 28-point second-quarter lead, and ultimately lost by 13 points. Opponents increasingly worked out how to quell, even combat, defensive maestros Steven May and Jake Lever. May, who signed a two-year contract extension last week , had 23 disposals and held Lance Franklin goalless in the qualifying final, but he was forced to work up the ground more, robbing May of the “goalkeeping” role he relishes. Intercept king Lever was made more accountable by opponents, denying him his marking and rebounding skills. Lever has had ankle issues over summer but is now fine. That may be eased this season if skipper Max Gawn, as he has flagged , plays more of a defensive sweeper role in the mould that Geelong ruck Rhys Stanley was so successful at last season. “There is no doubt, the combination of, in terms of our talls, May, Lever and [Harrison] Petty, it’s a bit like [Tom] Stewart down at Geelong - you go in knowing if you let these sort of players get it on their terms, it’s going to be hard to score,” Richardson said. “Most clubs, particularly the clubs at the top, have a couple of defenders you want to try and tie up. Our blokes were no different. Yes, that was a bit of trend, that teams would do a little bit more work and, potentially, change up their forward structure to be able to do that. That’s something we will have to fight through.” The Demons hope former Magpies ruckman Brodie Grundy can provide more marking power inside 50 when sent there. There is much intrigue as to how the Grundy and Gawn partnership will work . Both are multiple All-Australians and best-and-fairest winners. Loading Grundy has never flourished as a forward, as his former coach Nathan Buckley has said, but Gawn has improved in this area. However, he has spoken of a desire to spend more time behind the ball, allowing Grundy to head into attacking 50. Former West Coast forward Karl Langdon has questioned whether both can co-exist in the same 22, but Richardson says both men can flourish, as Gawn and Luke Jackson, now with Fremantle, had. “We think that partnership is going to be really good for us, potentially. I reckon it’s going to take a bit of time for the boys to get the synergy in terms of when to play forward, and when to play ruck,” Richardson said. “That’s no different to the way Gawny and Luke Jackson worked together. We have sort of been through it in many ways with two genuine rucks, both different, as are these two.” Richardson said he didn’t expect either to be benched under the new substitute ruling, for each should be relatively fresh late in games - and as the season unfolds. Uncapped youngster Jacob van Rooyen - unlikely, said Richardson, to debut in round one - is another tall forward option alongside Ben Brown, the latter having completed most of the pre-season. Brown’s marking issues in both finals last year were put under the spotlight by media and supporters. Melbourne great Garry Lyon lamented at the time there had been a “malaise” about the Demons’ forward line for the entire season. They averaged 12.5 goals per game, the sixth highest, but had only 10 in the qualifying final defeat. Brown, Bayley Fritsch and Kysaiah Pickett each contributed more than 20 goals for the season. The Demons have made a change, with veteran coach Mark Williams replacing Greg Stafford as goalkicking coach. Fellow forward Tom McDonald has fully recovered from the Lisfranc injury that derailed most of last year, and young gun Pickett, off contract this year , will have more midfield time because of his “exceptional” skills. Loading Former Bulldog premiership winger Lachie Hunter adds more midfield class, while Kade Chandler, with 10 games across four seasons, has dazzled over summer. In stars Christian Petracca, Clayton Oliver and Jack Viney, the Demons have a hard-at-it midfield the envy of most teams. Oliver, having had off-season thumb surgery, and later a scare when the thumb was badly bruised, and Petracca, the latter impacted by a knee injury in the finals, are at the peak of their powers. Vice captain Viney may also have spells up forward if Pickett is given more time in the middle. The Demons also hope to benefit by again being the hunters, rather than hunted, this season. The noose that can be chasing back-to-back flags, particularly with the added desire to repeat before the blue-and-red faithful at the MCG, having won in Perth in the COVID-impacted campaign of ’21, may have mentally worn the team down. As Goodwin said after the loss to the Lions: “We knew that pressure around our footy club would be high and that’s why it’s challenging to be successful when you’ve come off what we’ve come off. And that’s why not many teams do it.” Firmly in the premiership window in terms of average age, games played and key on-field statistics , Richardson, the former St Kilda coach, said the Demons intended to “live in the moment, play in the moment” more this season. “We won 10 in a row [last season]. I wouldn’t say every week we focused on going back to back, far from it … the noise around the camp, around the footy club, was just taking it a week at a time, but it was just the way that we played at times in those second half of games,” he said. “We didn’t help ourselves at times. We almost played as if not to lose, as opposed to continuing to play to win. It’s hard to know. What you then need to do is you talk about it, you address it, it’s as much about us as a leadership group, a coaching group, to make sure that we continue to reinforce, stay positive and stay in the moment.” Keep up to date with the best AFL coverage in the country.

Mumbai Indians are the most successful IPL side with five trophies, followed by Chennai Super Kings, who have won four titles. \"The numbers tell you everything. See, MS Dhoni had the experience of captaining the Indian team and then he became the captain of the Chennai Super Kings. Rohit Sharma's first captaincy stint was with the Mumbai Indians, and from there, his journey to success began. \"So, that's why he deserves more credit. Much like Sourav Ganguly, who became the captain of the Indian team and tried new and different things. Under his leadership, India became the number one one-day team. That's why my pick is Rohit Sharma,\" Sehwag told Star Sports during a programme to celebrate 15 years of the IPL. However, former India spinner Harbhajan Singh voted Dhoni as the best skipper of the IPL. \"I will give my vote to Dhoni, because from the very first year, he has played for a single franchise. He has played a huge role in making the franchise successful. The way he has captained his team has been extraordinary. Other captains also have done well and have won the tournament. But I think, overall, my vote will definitely go to Dhoni,\" said Harbhajan. \"If you look at the trophies -- Rohit Sharma has won five trophies, while MS Dhoni has won four.

Invited to bat first, the visitors recovered from 111-6 to post 274-9 in their allotted 50 overs before the home side rode on scintillating innings from Kushal Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee to reach 275-7 with 18 balls to spare. Chasing a modest target, Nepal were reduced to 77-5 after top order faltered. But Malla and Airee shared a 100-run partnership for the sixth wicket to bring the home team back into the match. After the fall of Malla in the 28th over, Airee and Gulsan Jha added 43 runs for the seventh wicket, before Airee and Sompal Kami took the team home with a 55- run partnership for the unbroken eighth wicket. Player-of-the-match Airee remained unbeaten on 85 off 116 balls that included eight boundaries and a six, while Malla hit nine fours and four sixes in his 67-ball 81.

Chris Greaves (16) also scored in double figures for Scotland. Sandeep Lamichhane was the pick of the Nepali bowlers taking 3-27 from 10 overs, while Kushal Malla grabbed 2-49. Sompal Kami, Kushal Bhurtel and Dipendra Singh Airee claimed one each for the home team. The victory turned out to be a bitter one for Lamichhane and Nepali team after Scotland players refused to shake hands with the rape-accused legspinner, who is currently out on bail. Scotland, who confirmed the championship with a 10-wicket victory over Namibia on Wednesday, are at the top of the seven-team table with 48 points, while Nepal remained unchanged at sixth on 22 despite their second straight victory.

We lost a couple of early wickets, but then again, the emphasis of understanding how the dressing room should operate the calmness in the dressing room againwas evident and automatically that energy we could see how it has been transforming to the performances in the centre out there in the partnerships that we achieved. For me it was heartening to see Kushal Malla and the pending partnership to stitch that big partnership and bring us back in the game.

We need one more country to come up and compete with the best out there in the world.\" He also hinted at going with the same squad in the next match against Namibia on Saturday. \"I generally believe in stability. You need to keep on allowing the players to play that role again and again so that they can take the experience on board and keep on improving their games.\" Player of the match Dipendra Singh Airee said he played the role as demanded by the situation. \"It was not a tough one as I played my role. The situation demanded a partnership in the beginning and it was easy thereafter,\" he said. \"I enjoy finishing the game, whether I am playing in top order or down.

Matt Renshaw was named as his concussion substitute, Cricket Australia confirmed ahead of the day's play on Saturday. Warner was hit by a bouncer from Mohammed Siraj while batting on Day 1 and he did not take the field during India's innings later in the day. Warner's bad form in Test cricket continued as he was dismissed for just 15. Earlier, Australia opener Usman Khawaja said that a mere three innings isn't a great sample size to question a beleaguered Warner, who became a bit “weary” after being knocked on the head by a Mohammed Siraj bouncer on day one of the second Test. Warner has scores of 1, 10 and 15 in the series so far with Mohammed Shami getting him twice with fuller length deliveries angling in. Inevitably, the question of Warner's technique has cropped up but Khawaja, fresh from his well-made 81, came to his opening partner's defence. “I have to kind of disagree with what you're saying. He hit two fours of Ashwin in the last game before he got out lbw so he was showing some aggression,” Khawaja said, when asked if Warner, whose stay looked painstaking during the 44 deliveries faced, needs to be pro-active. “It's never easy out there, especially starting out, even if you're opening starting out there is never easy so I was lucky today. I got a couple (of boundaries) to get me going. “Sometimes you don't get that and it can be very hard. So yeah, three innings is not enough for me. There's still a long way to go in this Test series. I'm looking forward to what may happen.” Khawaja is very confident of Warner's capabilities of bouncing back. “Davey has been such a terrific player for such a long time.

The tourists raced to 6-237 in their second innings at tea, opening up a 256-run lead. The big hitting encapsulated England’s aggressive batting approach that has carried it to victory in nine of its past 10 Tests. Former New Zealand all-rounder Craig McMillan labelled England’s first session approach as “T20 in whites”, while English commentator Alison Mitchell declared it “Test cricket but not as we know it”. Fellow Spark Sport caller Scotty Stevenson labelled the England onslaught “ridiculous”. “It’s a style of cricket designed to deflate and demoralise. They’re applying a blowtorch to the mental fortitude of this home side,” Stevenson told Spark Sport.

The English duo smashed 62 runs in just under eight overs, with Pope taking a particular liking to left-arm quick Wagner, whose previously-successful short-pitch bowling approach was exposed. Pope hooked Wagner for three sixes before smacking another two fours on his way to a stunning 46-ball knock of 49.

Renowned for his ability to intimidate the world’s best batting line-ups — including Australia’s — Wagner, had the figures of 2-104 after 11 overs. It was the most runs any bowler has ever conceded from their first 11 overs in Test history, usurping Australian leg-spinner Bryce McGain’s first 11 overs (0-102) against South Africa in 2009. New Zealand legend and former captain Stephen Fleming said it was one of the first times he’d seen an opposition side take on Wagner, which he was thrown by. “A lot of players are struggling to find a method to play Wagner and keep the ball down. England, you talk about intent and positivity, this is intent,” Fleming told Spark Sport.

Rather than trying to find a half-hearted way to play, ‘just get inside and hit it for six, mate’ – he (McCullum) would probably say – and take the aggressive option. “It’s one of the first times I’ve seen Wagner really struggling with two things: Take wickets but also control the run rate, which is a tactic New Zealand have used for many years. “For all the attributes and qualities that Wagner has, it’s getting dangerously out of control for NZ.” — with AFP","pubDate":"2023-02-18 03:59:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw allegedly attacked by fan with baseball bat","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/countries/india/indian-cricketer-prithvi-shaw-allegedly-attacked-by-fan-with-baseball-bat/news-story/cb74010aebb74faf8c216fc2efb6f43f","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw has been filmed in an altercation with a group of fans in Mumbai.","content":"Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw has been filmed in an altercation with a group of fans in Mumbai.

Warner was struck on the helmet by Indian quick Mohammed Siraj during his scratchy 15 in Australia's first innings of 263 at Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday. He waved off the team doctor after top edging an attempted pull shot into the left side of his helmet. Warner showed no immediate signs of discomfort and kept batting until he was dismissed. He did not field when India batted for nine overs on Friday evening and later failed a concussion test. Warner was also hit on the elbow from a Siraj delivery earlier in his 15-over stay at the crease, requiring immediate attention from medical staff. He has been replaced in Australia's XI by Matt Renshaw, who was dropped for the recalled Travis Head for the second Border-Gavaskar Test after twin failures with the bat in series-opener in Nagpur. It is the second time Australia have been forced to use a concussion sub mid-match after Steve Smith was replaced by Marnus Labuschagne during the 2019 Ashes after being hit on the head by a Jofra Archer bouncer. Labuschagne took his opportunity at Lord's and never looked back, and he is the world's No.1 ranked Test batter. Warner's position in the Test team was already under a cloud after being down on form for the majority of the last three years. The Australian camp have disputed various reports claiming Head is a contender to replace Warner at the top of the order, as soon as this series Warner entered the Boxing Day Test in December - his 100th match - under extreme pressure to retain his spot. But Warner scored a classic 200 to end a Test century drought dating to January 2020 to book his spot for a third red-ball tour of India. Warner's Test record in India is dismal, averaging 21.78. There have been warning signs the end is near for Warner, with the NSW star explaining he felt \"exhausted, tired\" ahead of this blockbuster tour. Warner has previously said he wanted to continue playing Tests until at least the end of this year's Ashes in England - a country where he has also had trouble making runs. Usman Khawaja backed Warner to find form before the end of the series, but also conceded his opener partner was feeling \"weary\". \"Three innings is not enough for me - I think there's still a long way to go in this Test series,\" Khawaja said after play on Friday. \"Dave has been such a terrific player for such a long time. \"Every time his back is against the wall he produces something so we'll see.\" Warner is averaging 45.47 from 103 Tests, hitting 25 centuries - the eighth most by an Australian.","pubDate":"2023-02-18 03:37:44","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-9795386/cafffb2a221a5db286578a058fb900e7dc881ad9-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs AUS LIVE: India eye solid start vs Australia on Day 2","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/australia-in-india/india-vs-australia-2nd-test-live-cricket-score-updates-from-delhi-day-2/liveblog/98032548.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Mohammed Siraj, despite going wicketless, deserves credit for softening up David Warner, who struggled during his 50-run stand with Khawaja. Two short balls -- one hitting the Australian opener on the elbow and the other flush on the helmet -- did unnerve the opener. Shami must be given credit for the way he bowled after Rohit Sharma pressed him from the other end in the first session. The pitch was a typical slow turner but had better carry than the Nagpur wicket and and it did help Khawaja, as he was able to hit through the line during his knock that had 12 fours and a six. The highlight on Friday was KL Rahul's brilliant catch at point off a powerful reverse sweep by Khawaja. That athletic effort not just broke the 59-run sixth-wicket partnership between Khawaja and Handscomb it also halted Australia's charge. Shami's (14.4-4-60-4) repertoire of deliveries was on full display as he struck with the new, semi-new and old ball, while Ashwin (21-4-57-3) and Jadeja (21-2-68-3) came up with breakthroughs just when the opposition seemed to be gaining foothold as India took the opening day's honours. At stumps, India were 21 for no loss with Rohit Sharma (13 batting) and KL Rahul (4 batting) at the crease. Opener Usman Khawaja (81, 125 balls) made amends for a horrendous first-Test outing at Nagpur with an attractive knock while Peter Handscomb (72 not out, 142 balls) played with determination at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday, but their efforts weren't enough as the visitors were all out in 78.4 overs. Mohammed Shami's clever variations with the semi-new and old ball were beautifully complemented by the spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin as India restricted Australia to 263 on the opening day of the second Test.

A week after they fell to Sydney in a qualifying final, hopes of back-to-back flags were extinguished, on a night the Lions even had to deal with the late withdrawal of key tall Joe Daniher . The Demons need Jake Lever to be a rebounding king across half-back - a skill opponents want to deny him of. Credit: Getty. “In finals, generally your vulnerabilities come out in games,” Goodwin, the 2021 premiership coach, said in the chilly bowels of the MCG. “And we’ve had some throughout the second half of the year, especially. When we’ve lost games of footy, teams have been able to impact in the second half of games and mow down leads, and it happened again tonight. “So we’ve got to be able to deal with those situations, the pressure in games, second half in games when things aren’t perfect for us. And we’ll dig into all of our program about what that looks like, but we’ve got some vulnerabilities that we need to fix up.” Loading Almost five months on, and with the new season all but upon us, the Demons have confidence those “vulnerabilities” have been addressed. Head of football Alan Richardson told The Age that the Demons had completed a comprehensive review, which also touched on many of the team’s “really good” traits in a season when they had 16 home-and-away wins and finished second on the ladder. “It was probably in the second half of the year, not just the two finals, that we became pretty vulnerable in the second half of games,” Richardson said. “So, what was that? Is it fitness? Is it mindset? Is it opposition? Or all of the above? Although [it was] not fitness. We are still running really hard. There were a few competition-wide markers that were strong proof that we were still a hard-running team. It was a bit more about attitude and opposition. Teams were taking things away from us.” Christian Petracca will again be a prime mover for the Demons in 2023. Credit: Getty Images While Richardson said fitness was not an issue, rival clubs speculated the loss of master fitness coach Darren Burgess - who left for the Crows after the 2021 premiership - had an impact on the Demons. Champion Data statistics show that the Demons were the best first-term team in the competition, winning 17 opening quarters. They were equal second for second and third quarters won, but slipped to sixth for fourth-quarter wins. That they were -31 for points differential in the final term, ranked 13th, highlighted their woes. They led at three-quarter-time in four of their eight defeats last season, and were tied at three-quarter-time with the Lions in their semi-final. But by that point in the semi, they had ceded a 28-point second-quarter lead, and ultimately lost by 13 points. Opponents increasingly worked out how to quell, even combat, defensive maestros Steven May and Jake Lever. May, who signed a two-year contract extension last week , had 23 disposals and held Lance Franklin goalless in the qualifying final, but he was forced to work up the ground more, robbing May of the “goalkeeping” role he relishes. Intercept king Lever was made more accountable by opponents, denying him his marking and rebounding skills. Lever has had ankle issues over summer but is now fine. That may be eased this season if skipper Max Gawn, as he has flagged , plays more of a defensive sweeper role in the mould that Geelong ruck Rhys Stanley was so successful at last season. “There is no doubt, the combination of, in terms of our talls, May, Lever and [Harrison] Petty, it’s a bit like [Tom] Stewart down at Geelong - you go in knowing if you let these sort of players get it on their terms, it’s going to be hard to score,” Richardson said. “Most clubs, particularly the clubs at the top, have a couple of defenders you want to try and tie up. Our blokes were no different. Yes, that was a bit of trend, that teams would do a little bit more work and, potentially, change up their forward structure to be able to do that. That’s something we will have to fight through.” The Demons hope former Magpies ruckman Brodie Grundy can provide more marking power inside 50 when sent there. There is much intrigue as to how the Grundy and Gawn partnership will work . Both are multiple All-Australians and best-and-fairest winners. Loading Grundy has never flourished as a forward, as his former coach Nathan Buckley has said, but Gawn has improved in this area. However, he has spoken of a desire to spend more time behind the ball, allowing Grundy to head into attacking 50. Former West Coast forward Karl Langdon has questioned whether both can co-exist in the same 22, but Richardson says both men can flourish, as Gawn and Luke Jackson, now with Fremantle, had. “We think that partnership is going to be really good for us, potentially. I reckon it’s going to take a bit of time for the boys to get the synergy in terms of when to play forward, and when to play ruck,” Richardson said. “That’s no different to the way Gawny and Luke Jackson worked together. We have sort of been through it in many ways with two genuine rucks, both different, as are these two.” Richardson said he didn’t expect either to be benched under the new substitute ruling, for each should be relatively fresh late in games - and as the season unfolds. Uncapped youngster Jacob van Rooyen - unlikely, said Richardson, to debut in round one - is another tall forward option alongside Ben Brown, the latter having completed most of the pre-season. Brown’s marking issues in both finals last year were put under the spotlight by media and supporters. Melbourne great Garry Lyon lamented at the time there had been a “malaise” about the Demons’ forward line for the entire season. They averaged 12.5 goals per game, the sixth highest, but had only 10 in the qualifying final defeat. Brown, Bayley Fritsch and Kysaiah Pickett each contributed more than 20 goals for the season. The Demons have made a change, with veteran coach Mark Williams replacing Greg Stafford as goalkicking coach. Fellow forward Tom McDonald has fully recovered from the Lisfranc injury that derailed most of last year, and young gun Pickett, off contract this year , will have more midfield time because of his “exceptional” skills. Loading Former Bulldog premiership winger Lachie Hunter adds more midfield class, while Kade Chandler, with 10 games across four seasons, has dazzled over summer. In stars Christian Petracca, Clayton Oliver and Jack Viney, the Demons have a hard-at-it midfield the envy of most teams. Oliver, having had off-season thumb surgery, and later a scare when the thumb was badly bruised, and Petracca, the latter impacted by a knee injury in the finals, are at the peak of their powers. Vice captain Viney may also have spells up forward if Pickett is given more time in the middle. The Demons also hope to benefit by again being the hunters, rather than hunted, this season. The noose that can be chasing back-to-back flags, particularly with the added desire to repeat before the blue-and-red faithful at the MCG, having won in Perth in the COVID-impacted campaign of ’21, may have mentally worn the team down. As Goodwin said after the loss to the Lions: “We knew that pressure around our footy club would be high and that’s why it’s challenging to be successful when you’ve come off what we’ve come off. And that’s why not many teams do it.” Firmly in the premiership window in terms of average age, games played and key on-field statistics , Richardson, the former St Kilda coach, said the Demons intended to “live in the moment, play in the moment” more this season. “We won 10 in a row [last season]. I wouldn’t say every week we focused on going back to back, far from it … the noise around the camp, around the footy club, was just taking it a week at a time, but it was just the way that we played at times in those second half of games,” he said. “We didn’t help ourselves at times. We almost played as if not to lose, as opposed to continuing to play to win. It’s hard to know. What you then need to do is you talk about it, you address it, it’s as much about us as a leadership group, a coaching group, to make sure that we continue to reinforce, stay positive and stay in the moment.” Keep up to date with the best AFL coverage in the country.

Mumbai Indians are the most successful IPL side with five trophies, followed by Chennai Super Kings, who have won four titles. \"The numbers tell you everything. See, MS Dhoni had the experience of captaining the Indian team and then he became the captain of the Chennai Super Kings. Rohit Sharma's first captaincy stint was with the Mumbai Indians, and from there, his journey to success began. \"So, that's why he deserves more credit. Much like Sourav Ganguly, who became the captain of the Indian team and tried new and different things. Under his leadership, India became the number one one-day team. That's why my pick is Rohit Sharma,\" Sehwag told Star Sports during a programme to celebrate 15 years of the IPL. However, former India spinner Harbhajan Singh voted Dhoni as the best skipper of the IPL. \"I will give my vote to Dhoni, because from the very first year, he has played for a single franchise. He has played a huge role in making the franchise successful. The way he has captained his team has been extraordinary. Other captains also have done well and have won the tournament. But I think, overall, my vote will definitely go to Dhoni,\" said Harbhajan. \"If you look at the trophies -- Rohit Sharma has won five trophies, while MS Dhoni has won four. I have played for both teams. My heart still keeps beating for Mumbai Indians since I have played there for 10 years but those two years at CSK taught me a lot.\"","pubDate":"2023-02-18 02:41:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"}]}
