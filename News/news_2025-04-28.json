Multan captain Mohammad Rizwan anchored the innings with an unbeaten 76 off 48 balls (six fours, three sixes), while Kamran Ghulam supported with an unbeaten 52 off 31 balls (two fours, four sixes). For Lahore, Tom Curran impressed with figures of 1/24 from four overs, while Shaheen Afridi finished with 0/25. Multan struck early with the ball, reducing Lahore to 45/2 in 6.1 overs. However, Abdullah Shafique (34 off 25) and Daryl Mitchell (64 off 37) steadied the chase. Even after Ubaid Shah (2/34) picked up two quick wickets to leave Lahore at 95/4, Sikandar Raza's unbeaten 40 off just 21 balls helped the hosts seal the win. Mitchell and Raza shared an 89-run partnership off just 44 deliveries.With this victory, Lahore Qalandars climbed to second place on the PSL 2025 points table, ahead of Karachi Kings on net run rate (+0.543 compared to KK's -0.217), despite both teams having six points.
