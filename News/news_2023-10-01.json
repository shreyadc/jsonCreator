Will Scotland continue their rout in the second 40, or will we see some fightback from Romania? HALF TIME Scotland have been excellent so far and got that all-important bonus point. They'll want to keep going and build as big a win as possible, but the first 40 couldn't have gone much better. Romania have struggled to cope with Darcy especially, who deserved his hattrick after a brilliant display. 40 ' DARCY GETS HIS HAT TRICK A sixth try for Scotland on the stroke of half time! Darcy has been a real handful this half and he now has his third try of a dominant Scotland half. Healy converts again for 42-0. 38 ' FIFTH TRY FOR THE BRAVEHEARTS Fagerson scores at Scotland march on! They're running riot now and a big score this evening could be vital in making the quarters if they do beat Ireland next week. Healy continues his perfect kicking record and makes it 35-0. 35 ' TRY NUMBER FOUR FOR SCOTLAND Scotland have their bonus point! Graham scores again against a Romania side that are now struggling and down to 13 men. The Scotland winger has been excellent tonight. Once again Healy converts to make it 28-0. 30 ' Yellow card for Irimescu The Romanian player is cautioned after his shoulder collided with a Scottish head It will be checked by the bunker and could yet be upgraded to a red. 21 ' SENSATIONAL TRY FROM GRAHAM What a run that is for Scotland's third! He picks the balls up with a lot to do but there's nothing Romania can do as he breaks the gain-line and eases his way forward for a 21st international try. Again Healy converts and Scotland are well on top now. 17 ' SCOTLAND SCORE AGAIN! Lovely play from Scotland and Price makes it 12-0! It's a classy set play from the backline that end with a simple pass into Price, who makes it over the line comfortably. Healy converts again. 10 ' SCOTLAND GET THE CONVERSION Healy kicks well from a less-than-straighforward angle and it's 7-0 now. Townsend will be thrilled with this start. 9 ' FIRST TRY FOR SCOTLAND! Watson scores the first points of the game for Scotland! Scotland have started really well here and now have something to show for it. Redpath does well to bursy through the initial tackle and passes to Watson as he is finally tackled. The former captain finsihes off the move nicely in the corner. 5 ' Brilliant from Graham Scotland's number 14 picks it up ina dagerous area but takes the ball forward brilliantly and almost sets up an opening try. They are denied the points after a sloppy drop, but that is a worrying sign for Romania at such an early stage. 3 ' Confident start for Scotland Townsend's men have made a control start and the Romanians are struggling to hold them back. Scotland's opening line-out is won comfortably and their opponents have hardly touched the ball. HERE WE GO! We're underway in Lille! The Romanian players give a stirring rendtition of their national anthem , and their opponents offer a typically heartfelt Flower of Scotland. The Bravehearts look very up for this as they eye a max points win. Townsend: We want an improved performance Speaking to ITV before the game, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend said: 'We have to focus on doing our jobs well regarldless of the oppositiion. 'We are expecting more from Romania, we've seen it from teams like Urgugary and Portufal. they improve with experience. 'We want an imporved performance tonight, improved form out performance angaisnt Tonga, which will set us up well for Ireland. 'The key thing is the performance tonight.' 18:40 20 minutes to go We're closing in on kick off in Lille. The stadium is filling up as the Scots look to build some momentum before next week's big game. If they do make the quarter finals, they will likely face hosts France and could come up against England in the semis. Scotland fans arrive in Lille It looks a pleasant evening at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy as Scotland fans begin to file in. They'll be hoping for a maximum points win today that will set up a huge game against Ireland. Must-win game for Scotland The changes made by Gregor Townsend suggest they will face tougher games, but a win today is still vital if they are to progress to th quarter finals. If they do win this afternoon, they will need a win against the impressive Ireland, who have won their last 16 games, to have any chance of beating South Africa to a knockout spot.

By Riath Al-Samarrai for MailOnline Published: 13:00 EDT, 30 September 2023 | Updated: 15:02 EDT, 30 September 2023 e-mail View comments In the end, if this is the end, it came down to a little shuffle and a little nudge and a little number. Ben Sanderson’s delivery hopped off the surface, the old boy clipped to the gloves behind him, and away he went. Plodded, you might say. He plodded across the damp outfield, under the grey sky, and he plodded past the small few who wanted to make a fuss. But he wouldn’t want a fuss, Alastair Cook . And this wasn’t a fussy way to go, six runs in a losing effort in a county game at Wantage Road, lined by the red brick terraced houses and some empty seats. Not many families in the Briggs and Forrester Family Stand on Thursday. Not many takers for Essex and Northants. Not much curiosity about what might well prove to be the final innings of a legend. And maybe, probably, that is how he would have wanted it. A few more runs might have been nice, but he has enough of those. A few more minutes at the crease, and goodness, he has served his time there. But noise? He wouldn’t like that. Enough of that when lambing season gets going. So away he goes and quietly does it, a batsman who showed us the way it was, but not so much of the way it is and the way it is going. Which is fine. Everything new becomes old eventually, and when everything is new, sometimes we should appreciate the old a little more. Alastair Cook played what could well be his final professional innings against Northants His career ended in understated fashion; dismissed for six in front of small crowd In the era of Bazball and wham and bam, we can take a few moments to love the slower things in life. The Cook things. The cuts and pulls and nurdles and a well-judged leave. The 836 minutes at the crease in a boring draw against Pakistan in 2015 — 263 runs off 528 balls, only 18 boundaries. The 773 minutes against India four years earlier — 294 from 545. There is nothing sexy about an anchor but how many of England’s innings and Tests and series would have drifted to nowhere without him? He was a record-breaker in a wax jacket. A sundial cut from marble in the digital age. A lefty who didn’t much play like Brian Lara; accumulation before annihilation. Do we call that plodding? Michael Atherton did once and Cook didn’t care for it. And you wouldn’t, would you? It’s a reducing word. A pejorative word. A stigmatised word. A word that makes you think of the slow and cumbersome. He was slow. But cumbersome would overstate it — he was self-aware and his self-awareness meant he introduced ugliness by design. Like Nick Faldo, he worked out precisely what works for him. Faldo could play all the shots, but he hit 18 straight pars to win the Open in 1987. Steve Davis won six world titles. That was plodding and plodding isn’t a bad thing. It’s a choice. It’s a method. It puts a premium on mental strength over physical flamboyance. It destroyed Australia in the Ashes of 2010-11. It was worth 12,472 runs in Tests for England. It puts him among the greats. Let’s call it the art of plodding and hang it in the Louvre. That it would seem to be over now is representative of Cook’s changing priorities as he approaches 39, and it also plays to that long-standing discussion about cricket’s shifting focus. Fast and frantic is effective, as Bazball has shown; Pakistan are copying the template. It works for the market, too. And few would contend that Cook was ever the peg for that hole. He was rarely flashy, but Alastair Cook produced some of England's greatest knocks against Pakistan (left) and India (right) Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes have moved on from cricketers like Cook, and his retirement is another step towards the end of the age of the plodder in cricket Mail Sport's Riath Al-Samarrai questions whether we will ever see another Alastair Cook Ben Stokes, his spiritual opposite in so many ways, said as much earlier this summer, when he was asked by Nasser Hussain if a young Cook, Jonathan Trott or Michael Atherton would fit the new England with their grinding style. ‘There are players who have played a certain way in their whole careers and that’s them,’ said Stokes. ‘That’s fine. I’m not saying that’s not the way to play. But in this day and age and while I’m captain and Baz is coach that is not something we’re looking for.’ The question, therefore, is what are young players looking to be and who are they looking at? Would they look at granite or will they look at diamonds when they pick their role models and choose their styles? At a time when shorter formats are king, and fire is in vogue over ice in the Test arena, how many of the next generation of batsmen will aspire to plodding? They might appreciate plodding and see its beauty, but would anyone actively choose to plod? And that adds a little extra poignancy to Cook’s departure, irrespective of whether it was marked with his slow, quiet walk off the pitch at Wantage Road, or arrives at some other point in the near future. Maybe he will plod on through another season, stubborn to the last, defending his ground a little longer. But given the quality and connections of the journalist who broke the story, Mail Sport’s Paul Newman, the inclination is to believe his last shot was the nudge to those gloves. If that is indeed the case, it will be the end of a career and another shuffling step towards the end of the age of the plodder in cricket. Both were great while they lasted. Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk have signed to fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship. Magnificent – that would be truly immense. And also falls squarely in the category of believe it when you see it. How long before Saudis offer to host Ryder Cup? Having spent the past week at the Ryder Cup, a couple of observations can be made with a growing certainty, even allowing for the strange things that happen in Sunday singles. One is that Zach Johnson has so far been a majorly disappointing captain of the US team — uninterested in some areas of selection, best shown in his attitude to eligible LIV players, his pairings have been devoid of logic, and he has been utterly uninspiring in his speeches and to those he brought with him. The most creativity he has demonstrated was in his excuse that his players had the sniffles during the day-one debacle. Home advantage has once again been a key factor in this year's Ryder Cup Zach Johnson has disappointed as USA captain and seems unable to inspire his players The other thought concerns the weight of home advantage. The closest of the previous four Cups was a five-point margin, the past two have been won by seven and 10. All in favour of the host. The Ryder Cup is a great event, but there comes a time when the numbers stack up in concerning ways and, when they do, solutions become alluring. In this era of golf, that might be a worry, because you can picture it. A path to equality might be discussed. A road to the close matches we all love. A think-tank will form, ideas will get batted around, a proposal will be made, a vague notion of neutral venues will be put forward, and that will be awkward. ‘Oh, don’t like that, tradition.’ And then a newcomer of considerable power in golf might raise an eyebrow. ‘I know a place,’ he will say. It’s a daft notion, of course. A fiction. Unlikely to the point of impossible. The stink would be huge. But show me a person who thinks Saudi Arabia would not clamber for a piece of the action and I’ll show you someone who hasn’t been paying attention.

The 28-year-old Kuldeep is being seen as India’s trump card in the World Cup at home, having taken 33 wickets in 17 ODIs at an average of 16.03 this year. Since coming back from a knee injury, Kuldeep has worked on his arm speed and angles, helping him get a bagful of wickets in the middle overs. Alam, who has been to India multiple times as a player and having also served as a manager of the Pakistan team in the past, feels it will be advantage India in the mother of all clashes in Ahmedabad on October 14. “The way India played in Asia Cup and played the final (decimating Sri Lanka). They look like the team to beat. Their spin attack stands out. Kuldeep is going to play a major role in the tournament. He will test the batters of all teams,” Alam told PTI on Saturday. “Jadeja and Kuldeep make a lethal combination. Kuldeep is a match winner. He is the best spinner in this World Cup in my opinion. Now you also have (Ravichandran) Ashwin back,” said the 81-year-old, who was born in Hoshiarpur in the pre-Independence India. Alam added that India’s batting, including greats like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, as well as the in-form Shubman Gill makes the hosts a strong contender to win the trophy. ‘Spin attack a concern for Pakistan’ Alam said Pakistan spinners, however, don’t inspire the same confidence. Pakistan could not defend 345 in the opening warm-up match against New Zealand here on Friday as their premier spinner Shadab Khan did not bowl while left-arm spinner Mohmmad Nawaz leaked runs. Leggie Usama Mir, though, made an impact with two wickets. “In the bowling department, Pakistan’s spin attack is weak in the middle overs. In Asia Cup we struggled. It is important for them to do well in this phase else teams will easily score 300 against them. Naseem Shah is young and quick and he too will be missed with the new ball,” said Alam referring to Shah’s injury. ‘Stick with Fakhar Zaman’ Fakhar Zaman has been battling an inconsistent run and pressure is building on him ahead of the team’s opening World Cup fixture against Netherlands, here on October 6. Abdullah Shafique can replace him at the top. “On these true wickets in India, most games will be high-scoring. With Fakhar you can expect anything, he will fire in one out of five games but you have to take that risk with him,” said Alam. ‘Since my first tour of India in 1961, Pakistan have been accorded warm welcome’ Barring two members, Pakistan players are visiting India for the first time including captain Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi. Upon their arrival here on Wednesday, the entire squad was overwhelmed with an unexpected welcome at the airport. For Alam, who has also coached the Punjab team in Ranji Trophy in the early 2000s, it doesn’t come as a surprise. “Whenever we go to India we get a memorable welcome. I have spent two years there (as Punjab coach). People to people contact should be encouraged in tense times like these,” he said. Alam said Pakistan cricketers will feel the pressure of playing on Indian soil. “There will be pressure, for sure. It depends on how team management treat the players to ensure they focus only on cricket. You get four years to prepare for an event like this. You have to do something special so people remember for you a long time. It is a great opportunity for Babar and Co,” added Alam.

Spurs are camped in the Liverpool half here. WOW! ALISSON! Son shoots after what is honestly some sloppy play and it's fired like a rocket but the Brazillian saves. 17:39 Second half underway We're back underway. Gakpo has gone off injured with Jota coming on. 17:32 All to play for It is indeed all to play for but I'm still really intrigued by this disallowed goal for Liverpool. I swear Diaz is onside. I'm still awaiting an explanation for why I'm wrong but I've not seen one yet. 17:26 An incredible game but all level at the break! Well I thought the red card may have ruined it but it absolutelty hasn't. It was a bit cautious early on but it sprung into life when Curtis Jones was given his marching orders for a high tackle of Yves Bissouma after a VAR review. Son Heung-min then continued his good scoring run to put Tottenham ahead, before Cody Gakpo - who is fine by the way - levelled things up. Luis Diaz then missed a sitter at the end of the half for good measure. What a game. 17:24 Diaz has to score! My word. Salah plays Diaz and he should score! It's a low cross and it's absolutely pinpoint. He just doesn't make the connection. Golden, golden chance. And that's half time. 17:21 Gakpo levels it up! Cody Gakpo has scored and injured himself doing so. Szoboszlai puts a cross in and Van Dijk headers it down. Gakpo's touch is poor but his shot isn't and he fires Liverpool level. The Reds have already come from behind to win with 10 men once this season... 17:20 GOAL! Tottenham 1-1 Liverpool WELL THAT CAME FROM NOWHERE! 17:19 Udogie goes into the book Gomez goes down on the right a nd wins Liverpool a free kick. Szoboszlai's cross is cleared. Six minutes added on. Yellow for Udogie after he trips Gakpo. 17:14 Tottenham hit the post! Richarlison hits the post! Think it wouldn't have stood though with Udogie running across Alisson. Spurs are well on top now. Liverpool need to hang in there. 17:11 Liverpool penalty check A brief check for a Liverpool penalty with Van de Ven on Gomez. But we carry on. Mac Allister goes into the book for stopping a counter attack. Allison then saves from Son. 17:07 Son puts Spurs ahead Great pass my Maddison, who is pulling the strings from deep. Richarlison is indown the left and he picks out his mate in the middle - Son Heung-min - who pokes in from close range to give his side the lead. It's a long way back for Liverpool now... 17:06 GOAL! Tottenham 1-0 Liverpool AND TOTTENHAM TAKE THE LEAD UP THE OTHER END! 17:05 Diaz goal ruled out for offside I won't lie, I thought Liverpool had just taken the lead. Playing on the counter now, Salah pokes Diaz through and he finishes superbly. The flag is up and there's a VAR check but he's off. I've not seen the lines but I'm sure Romero was keeping him on. I guess not, but that was strange. 17:04 Tottenham on top Tottenham dominating the territory now and Maddison gets the first shot away since the red, but it's same and Alisson saves easily. A good chance for Richarlison now as he's found by Kulusevski but it's over. 16:58 Liverpool have to re-build I'll be honest, I don't think anyone knows the rules anymore. I agree with Gary Neville on Sky commentary. He's tackled Bissouma and his foot has slipped off the ball. It wasn't intentional but it's still high. I'm honestly not sure. Anyway, Liverpool need a re-shuffle and this game has changed massively. 16:56 CURTIS JONES IS SENT OFF Yep. That's harsh but he's gone. He's gone over the ball and his foot slips but we know how it ends when referees go to the screen. Liverpool down to 10. 16:55 VAR check for a red card Effort from Salah with the outside of his foot but it's well over. Think it took a deflection but a goal kick is given. Gomez crosses now but no Liverpool player is in the box. Curtis Jones is booked for a high challenge on Bissouma. He is high and there's a VAR check. A touch on the ball and his foot slips off. Might be in trouble here... 16:51 Good recovery pace from Van de Ven Good ball down the line for Szoboszlai from Salah aand his cross makes its way to Jones, who shoots but his effort is blocked. Fantastic pace from Van de Ven who gets back to recover against Gakpo after a through ball from Jones. A knee issue is why Nunez isn't starting, I'm told. 16:48 Tottenham penalty appeal turned down Not sure what's happened but Klopp and Richarlison exchange words. Looked like the Brazillian was nodding sarcastically. A cross from Kulusevski hits Van Dijk in the hand but it's down. He's lucky it hit that had because if it was the other one that's a penalty. It might have been outside the box anyway. 16:44 BIG double save from Vicario WOW! A FANTASTIC PIECE OF GOALKEEPING! Szoboszlai goes long to Diaz and he plays in Robertson, who squares it to Gakpo. He can't get the ball out his feet and when he eventually goes Vicario saves. Roobertoson is following up but Vicario is there again! Best chance of the game. 16:41 Good play from Richarlison Gakpo loses out in the middle of the park. Richarlison gets the better of Gomez on the right and fires in an unexpected cross, low past Alisson. Kulusevski is chasing and can't quite get there. Chance. 16:39 Spurs come forward now First signs of nerves perhaps as Mac Allister passes out of play. Sarr then nearly nicks one as Alisson tries to play out! Spurs then come flying forward. Kulusevski with the shot and Van Dijk blocks. Cautious play, so far. 16:35 Liverpool have the first shot of the game A bright start from the home side with Son driving forward and a huge roar greeats him. Liverpool settle down now a bit with the ball. Robertson gets a ball in from high up on the left. Joe Gomez is playing centrally at the other end. The first shot as Salah tees up Diaz but he fires wide. Mac Allister shoots wide from the resulting corner. 16:30 Kick off! Some atmosphere inside the ground. And we are underway! 16:26 Here come the teams! The teams are on their ways out at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Kick off is moments away. 16:21 Players warming up The players are getting warm in north London. Kick-off is 10 minutes away. 16:10 Premier League full times Right then, it's full time in all the 3pms and we've had some cracking results. Bournemouth 0-4 Arsenal Everton 1-2 Luton Manchester United 0-1 Crystal Palace Newcastle 2-0 Burnley West Ham 2-0 Sheffield United Wolves 2-1 Manchester City Aston Villa beat Brighton 6-1 earlier on. 15:58 Reds arrivals Liverpool are in London. City have lost, too, so they would go top with a win tonight. 15:52 Son to stay through the middle Well I mentioned that Son would be back out on the left today, but Ange Postecoglou has told broadcasters that he'll be through the middle with Richarlison left. He's the third player to start out there in as many games. 15:46 Trent Alexander-Arnold back in the Liverpool squad Liverpool have changed just one from their 3-1 win over West Ham last weekend, with Gakpo coming in for Nunez. But the main headline is that Trent Alexander-Arnold is in after being absent through injury since the international break. Joe Gomez and Joel Matip remain on the right side of the Reds' defence. 15:41 Son and Maddison start for Tottenham There had been doubts over the fitness of the pair after they hobbled off in the derby last week but they're both fine to start. It looks like Son will be going back out wide despite his success through the middle recently, as Richarlison replaces the injured Brennan Johnson in the side's only change from last week. 15:35 Liverpool team to face Tottenham Alisson, Gomez, Matip, Van Dijk, Robertson, Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Jones, Salah, Gakpo, Diaz. Subs: Kelleher, Endo, Konate, Nunez, Elliott, Jota, Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Alexander-Arnold. 15:31 Tottenham team to face Liverpool Vicario, Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie, Sarr, Bissouma, Maddison, Kulusevski, Richarlison, Son. Subs: Forster, Royal, Davies, Phillips, Hojbjerg, Skipp, Solomon, Veliz, Donley. 15:24 Can anyone challenge City? So can anyone topple the sky blue giants? They're just gone level at Wolves. Last term they were forced to chase down Arsenal, eventually overtaking thh Gunners in the final weeks of the campaign, but this time they have flown out the blocks. Pep Guardiola's men have won their first six league games, scoring 16 goals and conceding just three times. They have set their stall out early for a sixth title in seven years. Can anyone stop Man City winning ANOTHER title? Last term City were forced to chase down Arsenal , eventually overtaking the Gunners in the final weeks of the campaign, but this time they have flown out the blocks. Mail Online 15:17 A breath of fresh air for Spurs And what a contrast it's been for Tottenham, eh? Ange Postecoglou, the best way I think to describe it, has been a breath of fresh air. Not just his off-field antics, but his play style. No fear. Focus on attack. No Harry Kane, but no problem. They are also undefeated. Today may be their toughest test - potentially bar last week - and we will see if they are up to it. They certianly won't hold back. 15:07 Liverpool's positive start Both of these sides are unbeaten so far and keen to bounce back from disappointing campaigns last term. Liverpool in particualr, perhaps. Jurgen Klopp's side went from Champions League finalists to finishing outsdie the top four in the Premier League last season but they've changed a lot from the team that won the division just three seasons ago. The midfield has changed. The style has changed. The attack has changed. They're second, and given City's current scoreline, they could go top today. 14:50 It's a beautiful day in north London And fans are beginning to trickle into the Tottenham Hotspur stadium with just over an hour and a half to go. 14:47 It's Liverpool 2.0! Manager Jurgen Klopp says he has 'new energy' as rebuilt Reds go for eight wins on the bounce at Spurs Jurgen Klopp has challenged his Liverpool 2.0 to create their own destiny as he explained how rebuilding the team has left him re-energised. Liverpool's flying start to the campaign - they have won their last seven fixtures in all competitions - will be put to the test over the next week, with trips to Tottenham and Brighton sandwiching a tricky Europa League fixture at home to Belgian side Union St Gilloise. Klopp will not allow himself to get caught up in the excitement that is growing within the red half of the city and warned repeatedly on Friday that for all the promising signs, the team is still 'not stable' and he is anxious about the way they are beginning matches.

Jurgen Klopp says he has 'new energy' for rebuilt Reds Jurgen Klopp has challenged his Liverpool 2.0 to create their own destiny as he explained how rebuilding the team has left him re-energised. Mail Online 14:44 Two teams, two stand-out new signings Whilst both Liverpool and Tottenham appear to have recruited extremely shrewdly over the summer - and in north London, that includes off the pitch - arguably the two standouts have had a transformative effect on their respective midfields: Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai and James Maddison for Spurs. Within weeks, Szoboszlai has been compared to no less a Reds icon that Steven Gerrard, and Maddison's budding partnership with Son Heung-min is going some way to banishing bittersweet memories of Harry Kane. But who comes out on top today? 14:33 Two free-scoring attacks, incredible powers of recovery and coaches only too happy to release the handbrake... Tottenham vs Liverpool could be a Premier League THRILLER April's seven-goal thriller between Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur went down as an instant Premier League classic.

Mail Online 14:30 Good afternoon! It's been a busy day of Premier League action, but we're going to switch focus to the day's final kick-off, as Liverpool travel to Tottenham with the hope to knocking the north London side off their perch.

Will Scotland continue their rout in the second 40, or will we see some fightback from Romania? HALF TIME Scotland have been excellent so far and got that all-important bonus point. They'll want to keep going and build as big a win as possible, but the first 40 couldn't have gone much better. Romania have struggled to cope with Darcy especially, who deserved his hattrick after a brilliant display. 40 ' DARCY GETS HIS HAT TRICK A sixth try for Scotland on the stroke of half time! Darcy has been a real handful this half and he now has his third try of a dominant Scotland half. Healy converts again for 42-0. 38 ' FIFTH TRY FOR THE BRAVEHEARTS Fagerson scores at Scotland march on! They're running riot now and a big score this evening could be vital in making the quarters if they do beat Ireland next week. Healy continues his perfect kicking record and makes it 35-0. 35 ' TRY NUMBER FOUR FOR SCOTLAND Scotland have their bonus point! Graham scores again against a Romania side that are now struggling and down to 13 men. The Scotland winger has been excellent tonight. Once again Healy converts to make it 28-0. 30 ' Yellow card for Irimescu The Romanian player is cautioned after his shoulder collided with a Scottish head It will be checked by the bunker and could yet be upgraded to a red. 21 ' SENSATIONAL TRY FROM GRAHAM What a run that is for Scotland's third! He picks the balls up with a lot to do but there's nothing Romania can do as he breaks the gain-line and eases his way forward for a 21st international try. Again Healy converts and Scotland are well on top now. 17 ' SCOTLAND SCORE AGAIN! Lovely play from Scotland and Price makes it 12-0! It's a classy set play from the backline that end with a simple pass into Price, who makes it over the line comfortably. Healy converts again. 10 ' SCOTLAND GET THE CONVERSION Healy kicks well from a less-than-straighforward angle and it's 7-0 now. Townsend will be thrilled with this start. 9 ' FIRST TRY FOR SCOTLAND! Watson scores the first points of the game for Scotland! Scotland have started really well here and now have something to show for it. Redpath does well to bursy through the initial tackle and passes to Watson as he is finally tackled. The former captain finsihes off the move nicely in the corner. 5 ' Brilliant from Graham Scotland's number 14 picks it up ina dagerous area but takes the ball forward brilliantly and almost sets up an opening try. They are denied the points after a sloppy drop, but that is a worrying sign for Romania at such an early stage. 3 ' Confident start for Scotland Townsend's men have made a control start and the Romanians are struggling to hold them back. Scotland's opening line-out is won comfortably and their opponents have hardly touched the ball. HERE WE GO! We're underway in Lille! The Romanian players give a stirring rendtition of their national anthem , and their opponents offer a typically heartfelt Flower of Scotland. The Bravehearts look very up for this as they eye a max points win. Townsend: We want an improved performance Speaking to ITV before the game, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend said: 'We have to focus on doing our jobs well regarldless of the oppositiion. 'We are expecting more from Romania, we've seen it from teams like Urgugary and Portufal. they improve with experience. 'We want an imporved performance tonight, improved form out performance angaisnt Tonga, which will set us up well for Ireland. 'The key thing is the performance tonight.' 18:40 20 minutes to go We're closing in on kick off in Lille. The stadium is filling up as the Scots look to build some momentum before next week's big game. If they do make the quarter finals, they will likely face hosts France and could come up against England in the semis. Scotland fans arrive in Lille It looks a pleasant evening at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy as Scotland fans begin to file in. They'll be hoping for a maximum points win today that will set up a huge game against Ireland. Must-win game for Scotland The changes made by Gregor Townsend suggest they will face tougher games, but a win today is still vital if they are to progress to th quarter finals. If they do win this afternoon, they will need a win against the impressive Ireland, who have won their last 16 games, to have any chance of beating South Africa to a knockout spot. Romania team news Scotland team news Scotland make 13 changes from the side that beat Tonga last weekend. They face a Romania side who have lsot both of their games so far. Good afternoon!

He plodded across the damp outfield, under the grey sky, and he plodded past the small few who wanted to make a fuss. But he wouldn’t want a fuss, Alastair Cook . And this wasn’t a fussy way to go, six runs in a losing effort in a county game at Wantage Road, lined by the red brick terraced houses and some empty seats. Not many families in the Briggs and Forrester Family Stand on Thursday. Not many takers for Essex and Northants. Not much curiosity about what might well prove to be the final innings of a legend. And maybe, probably, that is how he would have wanted it. A few more runs might have been nice, but he has enough of those. A few more minutes at the crease, and goodness, he has served his time there. But noise? He wouldn’t like that. Enough of that when lambing season gets going. So away he goes and quietly does it, a batsman who showed us the way it was, but not so much of the way it is and the way it is going. Which is fine. Everything new becomes old eventually, and when everything is new, sometimes we should appreciate the old a little more. Alastair Cook played what could well be his final professional innings against Northants His career ended in understated fashion; dismissed for six in front of small crowd In the era of Bazball and wham and bam, we can take a few moments to love the slower things in life. The Cook things. The cuts and pulls and nurdles and a well-judged leave. The 836 minutes at the crease in a boring draw against Pakistan in 2015 — 263 runs off 528 balls, only 18 boundaries. The 773 minutes against India four years earlier — 294 from 545. There is nothing sexy about an anchor but how many of England’s innings and Tests and series would have drifted to nowhere without him? He was a record-breaker in a wax jacket. A sundial cut from marble in the digital age. A lefty who didn’t much play like Brian Lara; accumulation before annihilation. Do we call that plodding? Michael Atherton did once and Cook didn’t care for it. And you wouldn’t, would you? It’s a reducing word. A pejorative word. A stigmatised word. A word that makes you think of the slow and cumbersome. He was slow. But cumbersome would overstate it — he was self-aware and his self-awareness meant he introduced ugliness by design. Like Nick Faldo, he worked out precisely what works for him. Faldo could play all the shots, but he hit 18 straight pars to win the Open in 1987. Steve Davis won six world titles. That was plodding and plodding isn’t a bad thing. It’s a choice. It’s a method. It puts a premium on mental strength over physical flamboyance. It destroyed Australia in the Ashes of 2010-11. It was worth 12,472 runs in Tests for England. It puts him among the greats. Let’s call it the art of plodding and hang it in the Louvre. That it would seem to be over now is representative of Cook’s changing priorities as he approaches 39, and it also plays to that long-standing discussion about cricket’s shifting focus. Fast and frantic is effective, as Bazball has shown; Pakistan are copying the template. It works for the market, too. And few would contend that Cook was ever the peg for that hole. He was rarely flashy, but Alastair Cook produced some of England's greatest knocks against Pakistan (left) and India (right) Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes have moved on from cricketers like Cook, and his retirement is another step towards the end of the age of the plodder in cricket Mail Sport's Riath Al-Samarrai questions whether we will ever see another Alastair Cook Ben Stokes, his spiritual opposite in so many ways, said as much earlier this summer, when he was asked by Nasser Hussain if a young Cook, Jonathan Trott or Michael Atherton would fit the new England with their grinding style. ‘There are players who have played a certain way in their whole careers and that’s them,’ said Stokes. ‘That’s fine. I’m not saying that’s not the way to play. But in this day and age and while I’m captain and Baz is coach that is not something we’re looking for.’ The question, therefore, is what are young players looking to be and who are they looking at? Would they look at granite or will they look at diamonds when they pick their role models and choose their styles? At a time when shorter formats are king, and fire is in vogue over ice in the Test arena, how many of the next generation of batsmen will aspire to plodding? They might appreciate plodding and see its beauty, but would anyone actively choose to plod? And that adds a little extra poignancy to Cook’s departure, irrespective of whether it was marked with his slow, quiet walk off the pitch at Wantage Road, or arrives at some other point in the near future. Maybe he will plod on through another season, stubborn to the last, defending his ground a little longer. But given the quality and connections of the journalist who broke the story, Mail Sport’s Paul Newman, the inclination is to believe his last shot was the nudge to those gloves. If that is indeed the case, it will be the end of a career and another shuffling step towards the end of the age of the plodder in cricket. Both were great while they lasted. Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk have signed to fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship. Magnificent – that would be truly immense. And also falls squarely in the category of believe it when you see it. How long before Saudis offer to host Ryder Cup? Having spent the past week at the Ryder Cup, a couple of observations can be made with a growing certainty, even allowing for the strange things that happen in Sunday singles. One is that Zach Johnson has so far been a majorly disappointing captain of the US team — uninterested in some areas of selection, best shown in his attitude to eligible LIV players, his pairings have been devoid of logic, and he has been utterly uninspiring in his speeches and to those he brought with him. The most creativity he has demonstrated was in his excuse that his players had the sniffles during the day-one debacle. Home advantage has once again been a key factor in this year's Ryder Cup Zach Johnson has disappointed as USA captain and seems unable to inspire his players The other thought concerns the weight of home advantage. The closest of the previous four Cups was a five-point margin, the past two have been won by seven and 10. All in favour of the host. The Ryder Cup is a great event, but there comes a time when the numbers stack up in concerning ways and, when they do, solutions become alluring. In this era of golf, that might be a worry, because you can picture it. A path to equality might be discussed. A road to the close matches we all love. A think-tank will form, ideas will get batted around, a proposal will be made, a vague notion of neutral venues will be put forward, and that will be awkward. ‘Oh, don’t like that, tradition.’ And then a newcomer of considerable power in golf might raise an eyebrow. ‘I know a place,’ he will say. It’s a daft notion, of course. A fiction. Unlikely to the point of impossible. The stink would be huge. But show me a person who thinks Saudi Arabia would not clamber for a piece of the action and I’ll show you someone who hasn’t been paying attention.

The 28-year-old Kuldeep is being seen as India’s trump card in the World Cup at home, having taken 33 wickets in 17 ODIs at an average of 16.03 this year. Since coming back from a knee injury, Kuldeep has worked on his arm speed and angles, helping him get a bagful of wickets in the middle overs. Alam, who has been to India multiple times as a player and having also served as a manager of the Pakistan team in the past, feels it will be advantage India in the mother of all clashes in Ahmedabad on October 14. “The way India played in Asia Cup and played the final (decimating Sri Lanka). They look like the team to beat. Their spin attack stands out. Kuldeep is going to play a major role in the tournament. He will test the batters of all teams,” Alam told PTI on Saturday. “Jadeja and Kuldeep make a lethal combination. Kuldeep is a match winner. He is the best spinner in this World Cup in my opinion. Now you also have (Ravichandran) Ashwin back,” said the 81-year-old, who was born in Hoshiarpur in the pre-Independence India. Alam added that India’s batting, including greats like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, as well as the in-form Shubman Gill makes the hosts a strong contender to win the trophy. ‘Spin attack a concern for Pakistan’ Alam said Pakistan spinners, however, don’t inspire the same confidence. Pakistan could not defend 345 in the opening warm-up match against New Zealand here on Friday as their premier spinner Shadab Khan did not bowl while left-arm spinner Mohmmad Nawaz leaked runs. Leggie Usama Mir, though, made an impact with two wickets. “In the bowling department, Pakistan’s spin attack is weak in the middle overs. In Asia Cup we struggled. It is important for them to do well in this phase else teams will easily score 300 against them. Naseem Shah is young and quick and he too will be missed with the new ball,” said Alam referring to Shah’s injury. ‘Stick with Fakhar Zaman’ Fakhar Zaman has been battling an inconsistent run and pressure is building on him ahead of the team’s opening World Cup fixture against Netherlands, here on October 6. Abdullah Shafique can replace him at the top. “On these true wickets in India, most games will be high-scoring. With Fakhar you can expect anything, he will fire in one out of five games but you have to take that risk with him,” said Alam. ‘Since my first tour of India in 1961, Pakistan have been accorded warm welcome’ Barring two members, Pakistan players are visiting India for the first time including captain Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi. Upon their arrival here on Wednesday, the entire squad was overwhelmed with an unexpected welcome at the airport. For Alam, who has also coached the Punjab team in Ranji Trophy in the early 2000s, it doesn’t come as a surprise. “Whenever we go to India we get a memorable welcome. I have spent two years there (as Punjab coach). People to people contact should be encouraged in tense times like these,” he said. Alam said Pakistan cricketers will feel the pressure of playing on Indian soil. “There will be pressure, for sure. It depends on how team management treat the players to ensure they focus only on cricket. You get four years to prepare for an event like this. You have to do something special so people remember for you a long time. It is a great opportunity for Babar and Co,” added Alam.

Spurs are camped in the Liverpool half here. WOW! ALISSON! Son shoots after what is honestly some sloppy play and it's fired like a rocket but the Brazillian saves. 17:39 Second half underway We're back underway. Gakpo has gone off injured with Jota coming on. 17:32 All to play for It is indeed all to play for but I'm still really intrigued by this disallowed goal for Liverpool. I swear Diaz is onside. I'm still awaiting an explanation for why I'm wrong but I've not seen one yet. 17:26 An incredible game but all level at the break! Well I thought the red card may have ruined it but it absolutelty hasn't. It was a bit cautious early on but it sprung into life when Curtis Jones was given his marching orders for a high tackle of Yves Bissouma after a VAR review. Son Heung-min then continued his good scoring run to put Tottenham ahead, before Cody Gakpo - who is fine by the way - levelled things up. Luis Diaz then missed a sitter at the end of the half for good measure. What a game. 17:24 Diaz has to score! My word. Salah plays Diaz and he should score! It's a low cross and it's absolutely pinpoint. He just doesn't make the connection. Golden, golden chance. And that's half time. 17:21 Gakpo levels it up! Cody Gakpo has scored and injured himself doing so. Szoboszlai puts a cross in and Van Dijk headers it down. Gakpo's touch is poor but his shot isn't and he fires Liverpool level. The Reds have already come from behind to win with 10 men once this season... 17:20 GOAL! Tottenham 1-1 Liverpool WELL THAT CAME FROM NOWHERE! 17:19 Udogie goes into the book Gomez goes down on the right a nd wins Liverpool a free kick. Szoboszlai's cross is cleared. Six minutes added on. Yellow for Udogie after he trips Gakpo. 17:14 Tottenham hit the post! Richarlison hits the post! Think it wouldn't have stood though with Udogie running across Alisson. Spurs are well on top now. Liverpool need to hang in there. 17:11 Liverpool penalty check A brief check for a Liverpool penalty with Van de Ven on Gomez. But we carry on. Mac Allister goes into the book for stopping a counter attack. Allison then saves from Son. 17:07 Son puts Spurs ahead Great pass my Maddison, who is pulling the strings from deep. Richarlison is indown the left and he picks out his mate in the middle - Son Heung-min - who pokes in from close range to give his side the lead. It's a long way back for Liverpool now... 17:06 GOAL! Tottenham 1-0 Liverpool AND TOTTENHAM TAKE THE LEAD UP THE OTHER END! 17:05 Diaz goal ruled out for offside I won't lie, I thought Liverpool had just taken the lead. Playing on the counter now, Salah pokes Diaz through and he finishes superbly. The flag is up and there's a VAR check but he's off. I've not seen the lines but I'm sure Romero was keeping him on. I guess not, but that was strange. 17:04 Tottenham on top Tottenham dominating the territory now and Maddison gets the first shot away since the red, but it's same and Alisson saves easily. A good chance for Richarlison now as he's found by Kulusevski but it's over. 16:58 Liverpool have to re-build I'll be honest, I don't think anyone knows the rules anymore. I agree with Gary Neville on Sky commentary. He's tackled Bissouma and his foot has slipped off the ball. It wasn't intentional but it's still high. I'm honestly not sure. Anyway, Liverpool need a re-shuffle and this game has changed massively. 16:56 CURTIS JONES IS SENT OFF Yep. That's harsh but he's gone. He's gone over the ball and his foot slips but we know how it ends when referees go to the screen. Liverpool down to 10. 16:55 VAR check for a red card Effort from Salah with the outside of his foot but it's well over. Think it took a deflection but a goal kick is given. Gomez crosses now but no Liverpool player is in the box. Curtis Jones is booked for a high challenge on Bissouma. He is high and there's a VAR check. A touch on the ball and his foot slips off. Might be in trouble here... 16:51 Good recovery pace from Van de Ven Good ball down the line for Szoboszlai from Salah aand his cross makes its way to Jones, who shoots but his effort is blocked. Fantastic pace from Van de Ven who gets back to recover against Gakpo after a through ball from Jones. A knee issue is why Nunez isn't starting, I'm told. 16:48 Tottenham penalty appeal turned down Not sure what's happened but Klopp and Richarlison exchange words. Looked like the Brazillian was nodding sarcastically. A cross from Kulusevski hits Van Dijk in the hand but it's down. He's lucky it hit that had because if it was the other one that's a penalty. It might have been outside the box anyway. 16:44 BIG double save from Vicario WOW! A FANTASTIC PIECE OF GOALKEEPING! Szoboszlai goes long to Diaz and he plays in Robertson, who squares it to Gakpo. He can't get the ball out his feet and when he eventually goes Vicario saves. Roobertoson is following up but Vicario is there again! Best chance of the game. 16:41 Good play from Richarlison Gakpo loses out in the middle of the park. Richarlison gets the better of Gomez on the right and fires in an unexpected cross, low past Alisson. Kulusevski is chasing and can't quite get there. Chance. 16:39 Spurs come forward now First signs of nerves perhaps as Mac Allister passes out of play. Sarr then nearly nicks one as Alisson tries to play out! Spurs then come flying forward. Kulusevski with the shot and Van Dijk blocks. Cautious play, so far. 16:35 Liverpool have the first shot of the game A bright start from the home side with Son driving forward and a huge roar greeats him. Liverpool settle down now a bit with the ball. Robertson gets a ball in from high up on the left. Joe Gomez is playing centrally at the other end. The first shot as Salah tees up Diaz but he fires wide. Mac Allister shoots wide from the resulting corner. 16:30 Kick off! Some atmosphere inside the ground. And we are underway! 16:26 Here come the teams! The teams are on their ways out at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Kick off is moments away. 16:21 Players warming up The players are getting warm in north London. Kick-off is 10 minutes away. 16:10 Premier League full times Right then, it's full time in all the 3pms and we've had some cracking results. Bournemouth 0-4 Arsenal Everton 1-2 Luton Manchester United 0-1 Crystal Palace Newcastle 2-0 Burnley West Ham 2-0 Sheffield United Wolves 2-1 Manchester City Aston Villa beat Brighton 6-1 earlier on. 15:58 Reds arrivals Liverpool are in London. City have lost, too, so they would go top with a win tonight. 15:52 Son to stay through the middle Well I mentioned that Son would be back out on the left today, but Ange Postecoglou has told broadcasters that he'll be through the middle with Richarlison left. He's the third player to start out there in as many games. 15:46 Trent Alexander-Arnold back in the Liverpool squad Liverpool have changed just one from their 3-1 win over West Ham last weekend, with Gakpo coming in for Nunez. But the main headline is that Trent Alexander-Arnold is in after being absent through injury since the international break. Joe Gomez and Joel Matip remain on the right side of the Reds' defence. 15:41 Son and Maddison start for Tottenham There had been doubts over the fitness of the pair after they hobbled off in the derby last week but they're both fine to start. It looks like Son will be going back out wide despite his success through the middle recently, as Richarlison replaces the injured Brennan Johnson in the side's only change from last week. 15:35 Liverpool team to face Tottenham Alisson, Gomez, Matip, Van Dijk, Robertson, Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Jones, Salah, Gakpo, Diaz. Subs: Kelleher, Endo, Konate, Nunez, Elliott, Jota, Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Alexander-Arnold. 15:31 Tottenham team to face Liverpool Vicario, Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie, Sarr, Bissouma, Maddison, Kulusevski, Richarlison, Son. Subs: Forster, Royal, Davies, Phillips, Hojbjerg, Skipp, Solomon, Veliz, Donley. 15:24 Can anyone challenge City? So can anyone topple the sky blue giants? They're just gone level at Wolves. Last term they were forced to chase down Arsenal, eventually overtaking thh Gunners in the final weeks of the campaign, but this time they have flown out the blocks. Pep Guardiola's men have won their first six league games, scoring 16 goals and conceding just three times. They have set their stall out early for a sixth title in seven years. Can anyone stop Man City winning ANOTHER title? Last term City were forced to chase down Arsenal , eventually overtaking the Gunners in the final weeks of the campaign, but this time they have flown out the blocks. Mail Online 15:17 A breath of fresh air for Spurs And what a contrast it's been for Tottenham, eh? Ange Postecoglou, the best way I think to describe it, has been a breath of fresh air. Not just his off-field antics, but his play style. No fear. Focus on attack. No Harry Kane, but no problem. They are also undefeated. Today may be their toughest test - potentially bar last week - and we will see if they are up to it. They certianly won't hold back. 15:07 Liverpool's positive start Both of these sides are unbeaten so far and keen to bounce back from disappointing campaigns last term. Liverpool in particualr, perhaps. Jurgen Klopp's side went from Champions League finalists to finishing outsdie the top four in the Premier League last season but they've changed a lot from the team that won the division just three seasons ago. The midfield has changed. The style has changed. The attack has changed. They're second, and given City's current scoreline, they could go top today. 14:50 It's a beautiful day in north London And fans are beginning to trickle into the Tottenham Hotspur stadium with just over an hour and a half to go. 14:47 It's Liverpool 2.0! Manager Jurgen Klopp says he has 'new energy' as rebuilt Reds go for eight wins on the bounce at Spurs Jurgen Klopp has challenged his Liverpool 2.0 to create their own destiny as he explained how rebuilding the team has left him re-energised. Liverpool's flying start to the campaign - they have won their last seven fixtures in all competitions - will be put to the test over the next week, with trips to Tottenham and Brighton sandwiching a tricky Europa League fixture at home to Belgian side Union St Gilloise. Klopp will not allow himself to get caught up in the excitement that is growing within the red half of the city and warned repeatedly on Friday that for all the promising signs, the team is still 'not stable' and he is anxious about the way they are beginning matches.

Jurgen Klopp says he has 'new energy' for rebuilt Reds Jurgen Klopp has challenged his Liverpool 2.0 to create their own destiny as he explained how rebuilding the team has left him re-energised. Mail Online 14:44 Two teams, two stand-out new signings Whilst both Liverpool and Tottenham appear to have recruited extremely shrewdly over the summer - and in north London, that includes off the pitch - arguably the two standouts have had a transformative effect on their respective midfields: Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai and James Maddison for Spurs. Within weeks, Szoboszlai has been compared to no less a Reds icon that Steven Gerrard, and Maddison's budding partnership with Son Heung-min is going some way to banishing bittersweet memories of Harry Kane. But who comes out on top today? 14:33 Two free-scoring attacks, incredible powers of recovery and coaches only too happy to release the handbrake... Tottenham vs Liverpool could be a Premier League THRILLER April's seven-goal thriller between Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur went down as an instant Premier League classic. Three goals down inside 15 minutes, Spurs fought back against all odds and thought they'd stolen a point thanks to Richarlison 's 93rd-minute equaliser. Wrong . There was still enough time for Diogo Jota to send Anfield into raptures with an even later winning goal... READ MORE BELOW. Tottenham vs Liverpool on Saturday could be a Premier League thriller Saturday's meeting in north London has great potential for goals and drama as two of the Premier League's most exciting teams at the moment go head-to-head.

Will Scotland continue their rout in the second 40, or will we see some fightback from Romania? HALF TIME Scotland have been excellent so far and got that all-important bonus point. They'll want to keep going and build as big a win as possible, but the first 40 couldn't have gone much better. Romania have struggled to cope with Darcy especially, who deserved his hattrick after a brilliant display. 40 ' DARCY GETS HIS HAT TRICK A sixth try for Scotland on the stroke of half time! Darcy has been a real handful this half and he now has his third try of a dominant Scotland half. Healy converts again for 42-0. 38 ' FIFTH TRY FOR THE BRAVEHEARTS Fagerson scores at Scotland march on! They're running riot now and a big score this evening could be vital in making the quarters if they do beat Ireland next week. Healy continues his perfect kicking record and makes it 35-0. 35 ' TRY NUMBER FOUR FOR SCOTLAND Scotland have their bonus point! Graham scores again against a Romania side that are now struggling and down to 13 men. The Scotland winger has been excellent tonight. Once again Healy converts to make it 28-0. 30 ' Yellow card for Irimescu The Romanian player is cautioned after his shoulder collided with a Scottish head It will be checked by the bunker and could yet be upgraded to a red. 21 ' SENSATIONAL TRY FROM GRAHAM What a run that is for Scotland's third! He picks the balls up with a lot to do but there's nothing Romania can do as he breaks the gain-line and eases his way forward for a 21st international try. Again Healy converts and Scotland are well on top now. 17 ' SCOTLAND SCORE AGAIN! Lovely play from Scotland and Price makes it 12-0! It's a classy set play from the backline that end with a simple pass into Price, who makes it over the line comfortably. Healy converts again. 10 ' SCOTLAND GET THE CONVERSION Healy kicks well from a less-than-straighforward angle and it's 7-0 now. Townsend will be thrilled with this start. 9 ' FIRST TRY FOR SCOTLAND! Watson scores the first points of the game for Scotland! Scotland have started really well here and now have something to show for it. Redpath does well to bursy through the initial tackle and passes to Watson as he is finally tackled. The former captain finsihes off the move nicely in the corner. 5 ' Brilliant from Graham Scotland's number 14 picks it up ina dagerous area but takes the ball forward brilliantly and almost sets up an opening try. They are denied the points after a sloppy drop, but that is a worrying sign for Romania at such an early stage. 3 ' Confident start for Scotland Townsend's men have made a control start and the Romanians are struggling to hold them back. Scotland's opening line-out is won comfortably and their opponents have hardly touched the ball. HERE WE GO! We're underway in Lille! The Romanian players give a stirring rendtition of their national anthem , and their opponents offer a typically heartfelt Flower of Scotland. The Bravehearts look very up for this as they eye a max points win. Townsend: We want an improved performance Speaking to ITV before the game, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend said: 'We have to focus on doing our jobs well regarldless of the oppositiion. 'We are expecting more from Romania, we've seen it from teams like Urgugary and Portufal. they improve with experience. 'We want an imporved performance tonight, improved form out performance angaisnt Tonga, which will set us up well for Ireland. 'The key thing is the performance tonight.' 18:40 20 minutes to go We're closing in on kick off in Lille.

By Riath Al-Samarrai for MailOnline Published: 13:00 EDT, 30 September 2023 | Updated: 15:02 EDT, 30 September 2023 e-mail View comments In the end, if this is the end, it came down to a little shuffle and a little nudge and a little number. Ben Sanderson’s delivery hopped off the surface, the old boy clipped to the gloves behind him, and away he went. Plodded, you might say. He plodded across the damp outfield, under the grey sky, and he plodded past the small few who wanted to make a fuss. But he wouldn’t want a fuss, Alastair Cook . And this wasn’t a fussy way to go, six runs in a losing effort in a county game at Wantage Road, lined by the red brick terraced houses and some empty seats. Not many families in the Briggs and Forrester Family Stand on Thursday. Not many takers for Essex and Northants. Not much curiosity about what might well prove to be the final innings of a legend. And maybe, probably, that is how he would have wanted it. A few more runs might have been nice, but he has enough of those. A few more minutes at the crease, and goodness, he has served his time there. But noise? He wouldn’t like that. Enough of that when lambing season gets going. So away he goes and quietly does it, a batsman who showed us the way it was, but not so much of the way it is and the way it is going. Which is fine. Everything new becomes old eventually, and when everything is new, sometimes we should appreciate the old a little more. Alastair Cook played what could well be his final professional innings against Northants His career ended in understated fashion; dismissed for six in front of small crowd In the era of Bazball and wham and bam, we can take a few moments to love the slower things in life. The Cook things. The cuts and pulls and nurdles and a well-judged leave. The 836 minutes at the crease in a boring draw against Pakistan in 2015 — 263 runs off 528 balls, only 18 boundaries. The 773 minutes against India four years earlier — 294 from 545. There is nothing sexy about an anchor but how many of England’s innings and Tests and series would have drifted to nowhere without him? He was a record-breaker in a wax jacket. A sundial cut from marble in the digital age. A lefty who didn’t much play like Brian Lara; accumulation before annihilation. Do we call that plodding? Michael Atherton did once and Cook didn’t care for it. And you wouldn’t, would you? It’s a reducing word. A pejorative word. A stigmatised word. A word that makes you think of the slow and cumbersome. He was slow. But cumbersome would overstate it — he was self-aware and his self-awareness meant he introduced ugliness by design. Like Nick Faldo, he worked out precisely what works for him. Faldo could play all the shots, but he hit 18 straight pars to win the Open in 1987. Steve Davis won six world titles. That was plodding and plodding isn’t a bad thing. It’s a choice. It’s a method. It puts a premium on mental strength over physical flamboyance. It destroyed Australia in the Ashes of 2010-11. It was worth 12,472 runs in Tests for England. It puts him among the greats. Let’s call it the art of plodding and hang it in the Louvre. That it would seem to be over now is representative of Cook’s changing priorities as he approaches 39, and it also plays to that long-standing discussion about cricket’s shifting focus. Fast and frantic is effective, as Bazball has shown; Pakistan are copying the template. It works for the market, too. And few would contend that Cook was ever the peg for that hole. He was rarely flashy, but Alastair Cook produced some of England's greatest knocks against Pakistan (left) and India (right) Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes have moved on from cricketers like Cook, and his retirement is another step towards the end of the age of the plodder in cricket Mail Sport's Riath Al-Samarrai questions whether we will ever see another Alastair Cook Ben Stokes, his spiritual opposite in so many ways, said as much earlier this summer, when he was asked by Nasser Hussain if a young Cook, Jonathan Trott or Michael Atherton would fit the new England with their grinding style. ‘There are players who have played a certain way in their whole careers and that’s them,’ said Stokes. ‘That’s fine. I’m not saying that’s not the way to play. But in this day and age and while I’m captain and Baz is coach that is not something we’re looking for.’ The question, therefore, is what are young players looking to be and who are they looking at? Would they look at granite or will they look at diamonds when they pick their role models and choose their styles? At a time when shorter formats are king, and fire is in vogue over ice in the Test arena, how many of the next generation of batsmen will aspire to plodding? They might appreciate plodding and see its beauty, but would anyone actively choose to plod? And that adds a little extra poignancy to Cook’s departure, irrespective of whether it was marked with his slow, quiet walk off the pitch at Wantage Road, or arrives at some other point in the near future. Maybe he will plod on through another season, stubborn to the last, defending his ground a little longer. But given the quality and connections of the journalist who broke the story, Mail Sport’s Paul Newman, the inclination is to believe his last shot was the nudge to those gloves. If that is indeed the case, it will be the end of a career and another shuffling step towards the end of the age of the plodder in cricket. Both were great while they lasted. Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk have signed to fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship. Magnificent – that would be truly immense. And also falls squarely in the category of believe it when you see it. How long before Saudis offer to host Ryder Cup? Having spent the past week at the Ryder Cup, a couple of observations can be made with a growing certainty, even allowing for the strange things that happen in Sunday singles. One is that Zach Johnson has so far been a majorly disappointing captain of the US team — uninterested in some areas of selection, best shown in his attitude to eligible LIV players, his pairings have been devoid of logic, and he has been utterly uninspiring in his speeches and to those he brought with him. The most creativity he has demonstrated was in his excuse that his players had the sniffles during the day-one debacle. Home advantage has once again been a key factor in this year's Ryder Cup Zach Johnson has disappointed as USA captain and seems unable to inspire his players The other thought concerns the weight of home advantage. The closest of the previous four Cups was a five-point margin, the past two have been won by seven and 10. All in favour of the host. The Ryder Cup is a great event, but there comes a time when the numbers stack up in concerning ways and, when they do, solutions become alluring. In this era of golf, that might be a worry, because you can picture it. A path to equality might be discussed. A road to the close matches we all love. A think-tank will form, ideas will get batted around, a proposal will be made, a vague notion of neutral venues will be put forward, and that will be awkward. ‘Oh, don’t like that, tradition.’ And then a newcomer of considerable power in golf might raise an eyebrow. ‘I know a place,’ he will say. It’s a daft notion, of course. A fiction. Unlikely to the point of impossible. The stink would be huge. But show me a person who thinks Saudi Arabia would not clamber for a piece of the action and I’ll show you someone who hasn’t been paying attention.

The 28-year-old Kuldeep is being seen as India’s trump card in the World Cup at home, having taken 33 wickets in 17 ODIs at an average of 16.03 this year. Since coming back from a knee injury, Kuldeep has worked on his arm speed and angles, helping him get a bagful of wickets in the middle overs. Alam, who has been to India multiple times as a player and having also served as a manager of the Pakistan team in the past, feels it will be advantage India in the mother of all clashes in Ahmedabad on October 14. “The way India played in Asia Cup and played the final (decimating Sri Lanka). They look like the team to beat. Their spin attack stands out. Kuldeep is going to play a major role in the tournament. He will test the batters of all teams,” Alam told PTI on Saturday. “Jadeja and Kuldeep make a lethal combination. Kuldeep is a match winner. He is the best spinner in this World Cup in my opinion. Now you also have (Ravichandran) Ashwin back,” said the 81-year-old, who was born in Hoshiarpur in the pre-Independence India. Alam added that India’s batting, including greats like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, as well as the in-form Shubman Gill makes the hosts a strong contender to win the trophy. ‘Spin attack a concern for Pakistan’ Alam said Pakistan spinners, however, don’t inspire the same confidence. Pakistan could not defend 345 in the opening warm-up match against New Zealand here on Friday as their premier spinner Shadab Khan did not bowl while left-arm spinner Mohmmad Nawaz leaked runs. Leggie Usama Mir, though, made an impact with two wickets. “In the bowling department, Pakistan’s spin attack is weak in the middle overs. In Asia Cup we struggled. It is important for them to do well in this phase else teams will easily score 300 against them. Naseem Shah is young and quick and he too will be missed with the new ball,” said Alam referring to Shah’s injury. ‘Stick with Fakhar Zaman’ Fakhar Zaman has been battling an inconsistent run and pressure is building on him ahead of the team’s opening World Cup fixture against Netherlands, here on October 6. Abdullah Shafique can replace him at the top. “On these true wickets in India, most games will be high-scoring. With Fakhar you can expect anything, he will fire in one out of five games but you have to take that risk with him,” said Alam. ‘Since my first tour of India in 1961, Pakistan have been accorded warm welcome’ Barring two members, Pakistan players are visiting India for the first time including captain Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi. Upon their arrival here on Wednesday, the entire squad was overwhelmed with an unexpected welcome at the airport. For Alam, who has also coached the Punjab team in Ranji Trophy in the early 2000s, it doesn’t come as a surprise. “Whenever we go to India we get a memorable welcome. I have spent two years there (as Punjab coach). People to people contact should be encouraged in tense times like these,” he said. Alam said Pakistan cricketers will feel the pressure of playing on Indian soil. “There will be pressure, for sure. It depends on how team management treat the players to ensure they focus only on cricket. You get four years to prepare for an event like this. You have to do something special so people remember for you a long time. It is a great opportunity for Babar and Co,” added Alam.

Be it cricket, football, hockey or any other sport. Now India’s Neeraj Chopra faces a similar predicament when he will go up against his rival from Pakistan, Arshad Nadeem, as the duo will compete for the prized gold medal at the Asian Games, held at Hangzhou, China. India at Asian Games: FULL COVERAGE | MEDAL TALLY | RESULTS | SCHEDULE Neeraj Chopra has been the favourite to win the medal if you look at his exploits as he is the reigning Olympic Champion and World Champion in javelin throw. Another interesting point to note is that he is also the defending Asian Games champion having won the gold in the previous edition of the Asian Games which was held in 2018, in Jakarta, Indonesia. READ MORE: Abhay Singh – From Almost Quitting Squash to Winning an Asian Games Gold Medal – News18 His rival however has come close at times and also poses a decent record as well. He managed to come second behind Neeraj Chopra in the World Championships. But he came first in the Commonwealth Games where he was competing against the likes of India’s DP Manu and Rohit Yadav. He also picked a bronze in the previous edition of the Asian Games as well. Neeraj Chopra however, remains aware of the highly talked about rivalry between India and Pakistan. He said,” I agree that there is a lot of talk about the India-Pakistan rivalry, especially in the Asian Games where there is no European competition, this will be in more focus. But like I have always said, the first fight is against yourself and focus on putting in a good performance.

Spurs are camped in the Liverpool half here. WOW! ALISSON! Son shoots after what is honestly some sloppy play and it's fired like a rocket but the Brazillian saves. 17:39 Second half underway We're back underway. Gakpo has gone off injured with Jota coming on. 17:32 All to play for It is indeed all to play for but I'm still really intrigued by this disallowed goal for Liverpool. I swear Diaz is onside. I'm still awaiting an explanation for why I'm wrong but I've not seen one yet. 17:26 An incredible game but all level at the break! Well I thought the red card may have ruined it but it absolutelty hasn't. It was a bit cautious early on but it sprung into life when Curtis Jones was given his marching orders for a high tackle of Yves Bissouma after a VAR review. Son Heung-min then continued his good scoring run to put Tottenham ahead, before Cody Gakpo - who is fine by the way - levelled things up. Luis Diaz then missed a sitter at the end of the half for good measure. What a game. 17:24 Diaz has to score! My word. Salah plays Diaz and he should score! It's a low cross and it's absolutely pinpoint. He just doesn't make the connection. Golden, golden chance. And that's half time. 17:21 Gakpo levels it up! Cody Gakpo has scored and injured himself doing so. Szoboszlai puts a cross in and Van Dijk headers it down. Gakpo's touch is poor but his shot isn't and he fires Liverpool level. The Reds have already come from behind to win with 10 men once this season... 17:20 GOAL! Tottenham 1-1 Liverpool WELL THAT CAME FROM NOWHERE! 17:19 Udogie goes into the book Gomez goes down on the right a nd wins Liverpool a free kick. Szoboszlai's cross is cleared. Six minutes added on. Yellow for Udogie after he trips Gakpo. 17:14 Tottenham hit the post! Richarlison hits the post! Think it wouldn't have stood though with Udogie running across Alisson. Spurs are well on top now. Liverpool need to hang in there. 17:11 Liverpool penalty check A brief check for a Liverpool penalty with Van de Ven on Gomez. But we carry on. Mac Allister goes into the book for stopping a counter attack. Allison then saves from Son. 17:07 Son puts Spurs ahead Great pass my Maddison, who is pulling the strings from deep. Richarlison is indown the left and he picks out his mate in the middle - Son Heung-min - who pokes in from close range to give his side the lead. It's a long way back for Liverpool now... 17:06 GOAL! Tottenham 1-0 Liverpool AND TOTTENHAM TAKE THE LEAD UP THE OTHER END! 17:05 Diaz goal ruled out for offside I won't lie, I thought Liverpool had just taken the lead. Playing on the counter now, Salah pokes Diaz through and he finishes superbly. The flag is up and there's a VAR check but he's off. I've not seen the lines but I'm sure Romero was keeping him on. I guess not, but that was strange. 17:04 Tottenham on top Tottenham dominating the territory now and Maddison gets the first shot away since the red, but it's same and Alisson saves easily. A good chance for Richarlison now as he's found by Kulusevski but it's over. 16:58 Liverpool have to re-build I'll be honest, I don't think anyone knows the rules anymore. I agree with Gary Neville on Sky commentary. He's tackled Bissouma and his foot has slipped off the ball. It wasn't intentional but it's still high. I'm honestly not sure. Anyway, Liverpool need a re-shuffle and this game has changed massively. 16:56 CURTIS JONES IS SENT OFF Yep. That's harsh but he's gone. He's gone over the ball and his foot slips but we know how it ends when referees go to the screen. Liverpool down to 10. 16:55 VAR check for a red card Effort from Salah with the outside of his foot but it's well over. Think it took a deflection but a goal kick is given. Gomez crosses now but no Liverpool player is in the box. Curtis Jones is booked for a high challenge on Bissouma. He is high and there's a VAR check. A touch on the ball and his foot slips off. Might be in trouble here... 16:51 Good recovery pace from Van de Ven Good ball down the line for Szoboszlai from Salah aand his cross makes its way to Jones, who shoots but his effort is blocked. Fantastic pace from Van de Ven who gets back to recover against Gakpo after a through ball from Jones. A knee issue is why Nunez isn't starting, I'm told. 16:48 Tottenham penalty appeal turned down Not sure what's happened but Klopp and Richarlison exchange words. Looked like the Brazillian was nodding sarcastically. A cross from Kulusevski hits Van Dijk in the hand but it's down. He's lucky it hit that had because if it was the other one that's a penalty. It might have been outside the box anyway. 16:44 BIG double save from Vicario WOW! A FANTASTIC PIECE OF GOALKEEPING! Szoboszlai goes long to Diaz and he plays in Robertson, who squares it to Gakpo. He can't get the ball out his feet and when he eventually goes Vicario saves. Roobertoson is following up but Vicario is there again! Best chance of the game. 16:41 Good play from Richarlison Gakpo loses out in the middle of the park. Richarlison gets the better of Gomez on the right and fires in an unexpected cross, low past Alisson. Kulusevski is chasing and can't quite get there. Chance. 16:39 Spurs come forward now First signs of nerves perhaps as Mac Allister passes out of play. Sarr then nearly nicks one as Alisson tries to play out! Spurs then come flying forward. Kulusevski with the shot and Van Dijk blocks. Cautious play, so far. 16:35 Liverpool have the first shot of the game A bright start from the home side with Son driving forward and a huge roar greeats him. Liverpool settle down now a bit with the ball. Robertson gets a ball in from high up on the left. Joe Gomez is playing centrally at the other end. The first shot as Salah tees up Diaz but he fires wide. Mac Allister shoots wide from the resulting corner. 16:30 Kick off! Some atmosphere inside the ground. And we are underway! 16:26 Here come the teams! The teams are on their ways out at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Kick off is moments away. 16:21 Players warming up The players are getting warm in north London. Kick-off is 10 minutes away. 16:10 Premier League full times Right then, it's full time in all the 3pms and we've had some cracking results. Bournemouth 0-4 Arsenal Everton 1-2 Luton Manchester United 0-1 Crystal Palace Newcastle 2-0 Burnley West Ham 2-0 Sheffield United Wolves 2-1 Manchester City Aston Villa beat Brighton 6-1 earlier on. 15:58 Reds arrivals Liverpool are in London. City have lost, too, so they would go top with a win tonight. 15:52 Son to stay through the middle Well I mentioned that Son would be back out on the left today, but Ange Postecoglou has told broadcasters that he'll be through the middle with Richarlison left. He's the third player to start out there in as many games. 15:46 Trent Alexander-Arnold back in the Liverpool squad Liverpool have changed just one from their 3-1 win over West Ham last weekend, with Gakpo coming in for Nunez. But the main headline is that Trent Alexander-Arnold is in after being absent through injury since the international break. Joe Gomez and Joel Matip remain on the right side of the Reds' defence. 15:41 Son and Maddison start for Tottenham There had been doubts over the fitness of the pair after they hobbled off in the derby last week but they're both fine to start. It looks like Son will be going back out wide despite his success through the middle recently, as Richarlison replaces the injured Brennan Johnson in the side's only change from last week. 15:35 Liverpool team to face Tottenham Alisson, Gomez, Matip, Van Dijk, Robertson, Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Jones, Salah, Gakpo, Diaz. Subs: Kelleher, Endo, Konate, Nunez, Elliott, Jota, Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Alexander-Arnold. 15:31 Tottenham team to face Liverpool Vicario, Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie, Sarr, Bissouma, Maddison, Kulusevski, Richarlison, Son. Subs: Forster, Royal, Davies, Phillips, Hojbjerg, Skipp, Solomon, Veliz, Donley. 15:24 Can anyone challenge City? So can anyone topple the sky blue giants? They're just gone level at Wolves. Last term they were forced to chase down Arsenal, eventually overtaking thh Gunners in the final weeks of the campaign, but this time they have flown out the blocks. Pep Guardiola's men have won their first six league games, scoring 16 goals and conceding just three times. They have set their stall out early for a sixth title in seven years. Can anyone stop Man City winning ANOTHER title? Last term City were forced to chase down Arsenal , eventually overtaking the Gunners in the final weeks of the campaign, but this time they have flown out the blocks. Mail Online 15:17 A breath of fresh air for Spurs And what a contrast it's been for Tottenham, eh? Ange Postecoglou, the best way I think to describe it, has been a breath of fresh air. Not just his off-field antics, but his play style. No fear. Focus on attack. No Harry Kane, but no problem. They are also undefeated. Today may be their toughest test - potentially bar last week - and we will see if they are up to it. They certianly won't hold back. 15:07 Liverpool's positive start Both of these sides are unbeaten so far and keen to bounce back from disappointing campaigns last term. Liverpool in particualr, perhaps. Jurgen Klopp's side went from Champions League finalists to finishing outsdie the top four in the Premier League last season but they've changed a lot from the team that won the division just three seasons ago. The midfield has changed. The style has changed. The attack has changed. They're second, and given City's current scoreline, they could go top today. 14:50 It's a beautiful day in north London And fans are beginning to trickle into the Tottenham Hotspur stadium with just over an hour and a half to go. 14:47 It's Liverpool 2.0! Manager Jurgen Klopp says he has 'new energy' as rebuilt Reds go for eight wins on the bounce at Spurs Jurgen Klopp has challenged his Liverpool 2.0 to create their own destiny as he explained how rebuilding the team has left him re-energised. Liverpool's flying start to the campaign - they have won their last seven fixtures in all competitions - will be put to the test over the next week, with trips to Tottenham and Brighton sandwiching a tricky Europa League fixture at home to Belgian side Union St Gilloise. Klopp will not allow himself to get caught up in the excitement that is growing within the red half of the city and warned repeatedly on Friday that for all the promising signs, the team is still 'not stable' and he is anxious about the way they are beginning matches.

Jurgen Klopp says he has 'new energy' for rebuilt Reds Jurgen Klopp has challenged his Liverpool 2.0 to create their own destiny as he explained how rebuilding the team has left him re-energised. Mail Online 14:44 Two teams, two stand-out new signings Whilst both Liverpool and Tottenham appear to have recruited extremely shrewdly over the summer - and in north London, that includes off the pitch - arguably the two standouts have had a transformative effect on their respective midfields: Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai and James Maddison for Spurs. Within weeks, Szoboszlai has been compared to no less a Reds icon that Steven Gerrard, and Maddison's budding partnership with Son Heung-min is going some way to banishing bittersweet memories of Harry Kane. But who comes out on top today? 14:33 Two free-scoring attacks, incredible powers of recovery and coaches only too happy to release the handbrake... Tottenham vs Liverpool could be a Premier League THRILLER April's seven-goal thriller between Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur went down as an instant Premier League classic. Three goals down inside 15 minutes, Spurs fought back against all odds and thought they'd stolen a point thanks to Richarlison 's 93rd-minute equaliser. Wrong .
