Target tersebut dinilai realistis karena tim kriket Indonesia mampu unjuk gigi dalam berbagai ajang internasional. Abhiram mengatakan saat ini untuk sektor putri, skuad Merah Putih menempati peringkat 20 dunia, sementara untuk putra ada di posisi 57. “Ini tentu merupakan kolaborasi bersama dari perjuangan kriket dalam beberapa tahun terakhir. Ke depannya, sesuai dengan amanat KONI Pusat dan Kemenpora, pada SEA Games 2023 kami menargetkan tiga medali emas,” kata Abhiram dalam pelantikan dan pengukuhan PP PCI periode 2023-2027 di Kantor KONI Pusat, Senayan, Jakarta, Selasa (15/2) malam kemarin. Tak hanya SEA Games Kamboja, Abhiram juga bertekad untuk bisa membawa kriket Indonesia lebih berprestasi di level lebih tinggi termasuk Asian Games XIX di Hangzhou, Tiongkok dan bisa tampil Piala Dunia Kriket. “Kami berharap bisa menembus Piala Dunia Senior Putri untuk tahun ini dan kualifikasi Piala Dunia U-19 Putra. Sehingga Indonesia bisa menjadi langganan tampil di Piala Dunia,” ujar Abhiram menambahkan. Sekadar informasi, penampilan terakhir tim kriket Indonesia pada SEA Games 2017 di Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Kala itu, skuad Merah Putih membawa pulang satu perak dan satu perunggu. Sedangkan Malaysia menjadi yang terbaik dengan satu emas, satu perak, dan satu perunggu. Dalam dua edisi SEA Games terakhir yakni di Filipina pada 2019 dan di Vietnam, cabang olahraga kriket tidak dipertandingkan. Dalam kesempatan yang sama, Ketua Umum KONI Pusat Marciano Norman mendukung penuh PP PCI untuk bisa terus membawa kriket Indonesia berprestasi di kancah internasional. “Saya berjanji untuk hadir bersama mereka (tim kriket Indonesia), sebagai rasa bangga dan kita mengingat apa yang diprediksi Ketum Pengurus Pusat Persatuan Cricket Indonesia benar-benar bisa mencapai target (di SEA Games Kamboja),” kata Marciano.","pubDate":"2023-02-15 00:05:16","image_url":"https://cdn-asset.jawapos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230214-WA0015_4-640x480.jpg","source_id":"jawapos","category":["sports"],"country":["indonesia"],"language":"indonesian"},{"title":"‘Series against Hong Kong to benefit our boys’","link":"https://www.muscatdaily.com/2023/02/15/oman-u19-boys/","keywords":["Sports","Hong kng","Hong Kong","Muscat Daily","Oman","Oman Cricket","Oman Cricket Academy"],"creator":["Sarath Pookkat"],"video_url":null,"description":"Muscat – Oman U19 cricket team coach Adeel Shafique is hopeful of his boys gaining lot of experience and match exposure when they tackle the visiting Hong Kong U19 team during the four-match 50-over-a-side series, beginning on Wednesday, at the Oman Cricket Academy ground in Al Amerat.

Ahead of the series, Shafique said: “Such series helps the boys to gain exposure and experience match situations that will do a world of good for these youngsters.” The first of the four-match series begins on Wednesday while the other three games will be played on Thursday, Sunday and Tuesday. Shafique added: “I think it is another great opportunity for our boys to showcase their talent. After a brilliant showing in the World Cup qualifiers that took place in October 2022 where we fell just short in the semi-final, I think it’s great that the boys can play some more cricket together as a group. “After the last tournament, there wasn’t much cricket planned or scheduled for the U19 boys. During the World Cup qualifiers, we had a close game against Hong Kong. There is a mutual respect between both sides and an appreciation that our boys are extremely competitive.” Shafique, who has spent eight months in Hong Kong before taking up the assignment in Oman, said: “Our close relationship with Hong Kong Cricket has made it possible to convince them to visit Oman for the series.” The Oman U19 coach said that “plans and talks are in place to have an annual bilateral series in Oman and Hong Kong for the youth team.” Aditya Gurumukhi has been named the skipper of Oman squad with Tanuj Sivakumar appointed his deputy for the series. Shafique said: “The boys have been active and have been playing in the league as our current season is going on since September 2022. They have also been playing for their respective schools. They have had a lot of game time which is excellent for preparation. Besides that we have been in camp since the end of November and had a mix of fitness sessions along with practice matches and skills sessions.” The coach added that ‘the boys have been in the middle of exams as most of them are in 12th class.’ He said: “We have been able to find a good balance for the boys to study which is important, and at the same time, practice and play so that they are in good touch. Our boys have performed well in the men’s premier division, with Mohammad Arafat Islam (AER) performing brilliantly in the Oman D10 league. Tanuj Sivakumar (Zawawi Powertech) also had some good performances and Lakshmi Narayana has done well in a few games. All three of them are playing in all formats for their respective Premier Division sides which is beneficial for their development as they are playing with and against current Oman national team players.” Shafique said: “I am looking forward to seeing some competitive cricket with both sides playing to win. We are going to see some excellent performances throughout the bilateral series. Some of our boys have been involved in the men’s national team practice sessions. The aim is to see some of these boys eventually break into the national team and rub shoulders with them. The series is a great opportunity for our boys to test themselves.”","pubDate":"2023-02-14 23:36:29","image_url":"https://www.muscatdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Oman-crick-770x578.jpg","source_id":"muscatdaily","category":["sports"],"country":["Oman"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How player fitness standards in South African women’s cricket have evolved","link":"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2023-02-15-how-player-fitness-standards-in-south-african-womens-cricket-have-evolved/","keywords":null,"creator":["Keanan Hemmonsbey"],"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa still has some way to go to match the likes of Australia and England in maximising player fitness, but the gap between the elites and SA has closed steadily over the past three years. The post How player fitness standards in South African women’s cricket have evolved appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"Dané van Niekerk was left out of South Africa’s World Cup squad for the T20 World Cup on home soil despite being the fittest she’s been in her career. Dané van Niekerk of the Adelaide Strikers bats during The Challenger Women’s Big Bash League Finals match in 2021 against the Melbourne Renegades at Adelaide Oval, Australia. (Photo: James Elsby / Getty Images) That’s how much the fitness standards and importance have changed over the past few years in SA women’s cricket — that a player of world-class ability and leadership can be omitted from a World Cup for not meeting one of the required running measurements. Fitness was never taken so seriously in South African women’s cricket before 2019. In fact, up to that point, there was no data measuring the players’ fitness levels. “The general professionalism of the group wasn’t at the standard that I was happy with, coming from the men’s game,” said Zane Webster, the Proteas Women’s strength and conditioning coach. “I felt that it lacked that extra 10%-15% professionalism. Proteas Women’s strength and conditioning coach Zane Webster. (Photo: Ashley Vlotman / Gallo Images) “It’s astounding what they’ve managed to achieve with regard to transforming their approach to fitness, but more importantly, their lifestyle.” The increased levels of professionalism have steadily been implemented in the team. There were some squabbles and disagreements at first, but everyone in the team has since taken enthusiastically to the added individualised training. There is no one player that stands head and shoulders above the rest with regard to their fitness and lifestyle transformation since 2019. But Webster uses opening batter Laura Wolvaardt and all-rounder Chloe Tryon as examples of hard work off the field paying off on the field. “Laura Wolvaardt’s fitness has never been an issue in terms of her conditioning and her aerobic capacity. She’s always been supremely fit,” said Webster. “But areas where we identified with her — where she’s got a lot better — she’s become a gym savage where previously she wasn’t really into lifting heavy weights. Now you’ll find her in the gym more than anyone else. “She’s had issues with her mobility, which could be a high risk for injury, and she’s come on in leaps and bounds.” The reason Wolvaardt is always consistent with bat in hand is that she never allows her strength and conditioning levels to drop, according to Webster. “Someone like Chloe [Tryon], the big thing for her was weight loss. The intervention that was put in place; I can’t even put into words the way she bought into the process and stuck to it. She completely transformed her lifestyle,” added Webster. Fitness standards and implementation have come into the spotlight recently because of South Africa’s desire to move one step ahead of the opposition. Locker rooms are filled with players and management from varying countries in tournaments around the world such as The Hundred, Women’s Big Bash League and the newly formed Women’s Premier League. Consequently, there aren’t many tactical secrets or advantages teams have over their opponents in modern-day cricket. The skill level between countries is also constantly narrowing. So, teams look for areas where they can find an advantage, and in recent times that has become fitness. “When you look at where the white-ball game is at the moment, you see how close games usually get. You have to ask, ‘Do you have the ability to run three hard twos at the end of the innings when you’ve been batting for the last 18 overs?’” asks Webster. “Cricket requires skill, but without fitness, your concentration can be negatively impacted.” There are several factors outside training that affect athletes’ fitness and performance, including the consumption of alcohol, a substance that feels as much a part of the culture of cricket as the bails and stumps. “It’s how you sleep, what you eat. It’s what you’re putting into your body from a liquid perspective,” said Webster. “Alcohol is something that I don’t know that we’ll ever get rid of in cricket. “I know in other sports they’re very strict on it, like you’re not allowed to have alcohol 24 hours after a game in football unless they’re winning a competition. “Alcohol is such a big part of the culture in cricket. Us as medical staff, we cringe because we know the negative impact that that has on recovery.” There is a direct correlation between a player’s fitness and their ability to succeed on the field, says Webster. “It’s no secret that the fitter you are, the more resilient you are as a player or athlete. “You will have greater longevity in the sport and you’ll have the necessary base to execute your skills at a high intensity for a long period of time. “There’s also the aspect of injury risk. The fitter and stronger you are, the less risk you are at of picking up injuries, particularly where the game currently is and where it’s moving to.” New cricket tournaments are popping up almost monthly across the world, which only serves to further congest the global calendar. This affects the fitness regimens of current cricketers compared with the ones from a bygone era of the game. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations “In the old days, international cricketers would have a period throughout the year where they would go through an off-season,” said Webster, “where they have eight to 12 weeks to recover from the previous season’s workloads, to sort out any niggles that they might have picked up through the season and finally to get themselves as fit and strong as physically possible to prepare themselves for the season ahead. “The modern-day international cricketer doesn’t have that luxury. There’s no more important time than now in international cricket for players to be as fit and as resilient as they can be. “If you put it into numbers, in 1,000 days cricketers will have maybe 200 rest days out of the 1,000. The rest of the days you’ll be training, in the gym, on the field and you’d be playing cricket. “If you look at the ratio, that’s not a lot of rest time. So, obviously being better conditioned, the chances of you going through all that without dropping your standard of on-field performance and staying injury-free increases significantly.” The fitness standards in women’s cricket have increased significantly in South Africa, but there is still room for improvement if the country is to reach the summit of the game.

The player acquisition on Monday, by the five teams involved in the historic tournament, made it that much more real for the pioneering players. The post India’s Mandhana the crown jewel in Australia-dominated inaugural Women’s Premier League auction appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"It was a watershed moment for many of the cricketers involved in the inaugural Women’s Premier League auction. Unusually, the auction took place while the majority of the affected players are deep within an ongoing T20 World Cup. A handful of female cricket players involved in the bidding by the five teams that make up the upcoming maiden edition of the women’s equivalent of the globally popular Indian Premier League ended Monday with the largest paychecks of their careers. India opener Smriti Mandhana, England all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt and Australia’s Ashleigh Gardner were the biggest winners of the bidding process. Mandhana, who has risen to global superstar status since making her T20 international debut for India as a 17-year-old back in 2013, fetched the highest fee at Monday’s auction. Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) splurged 34-million Indian rupees (R7.3-million) to secure the services of the left-handed batter. The amount was a huge chunk of RCB’s R26-million purse for the day’s proceedings. However, the Bangalore-based side still managed to rope in the services of experienced Australian and New Zealand duo Ellyse Perry (R3.7-million) and Sophie Devine (R1.1-million). A development that RCB’s director of cricket, Mike Hesson, was ecstatic about. “It’s a dream result for us to get Mandhana, Perry and Devine,” Hesson told journalists. “Smriti has got plenty of captaincy experience and is familiar with the Indian conditions. So, it’s highly likely (she’ll be captain).” Of the 400-plus players who went under the hammer (17 of whom were South African), England’s Sciver-Brunt and Australia’s Gardner were joint second on the bidding list. The two all-rounders will each receive just under R7-million for the work they will do for Mumbai Indians and Gujarat Giants, respectively, next month. “She probably won’t like all the attention [that will come with her price tag],” said England skipper Heather Knight of the dangerous Sciver-Brunt. “She’s very humble. She’s just very good at cricket.” Knight herself will be joining Mandhana and company at RCB after being picked up for R874,808 by the team that already has the pre-tournament tag of favourites. Knight’s Indian counterpart Harmanpreet Kaur also expressed her elation at the inception of the tournament, and the overall success of the inaugural auction. “It is a game-changer for all of us,” said Kaur after she was bought for R3.9-million and immediately made skipper by the Mumbai Indians. “This will entirely change women’s cricket, and not just in India. We all are looking forward to that.” Marizanne Kapp, left, and Shabnim Ismail from South Africa hug as teammates Ayabonga Khaka and Masabata Klaas arrive to celebrate after Kapp caught Natalie Sciver from England off the bowling of Ismail during the 2022 ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup semifinal match between South Africa and England at Hagley Oval on 31 March 2022 in Christchurch, New Zealand. (Photo: Peter Meecham / Getty Images) Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations From the South Africans who had put their names on the list, prolific all-rounder Marizanne Kapp was the most expensive acquisition from a local perspective. The highly rated Proteas star cost the Delhi Capitals R3.3-million, with electric seamer and Kapp’s partner in bowling destruction for South Africa, Shabnim Ismail, earning around R2.2-million for her move to the UP Warriorz. There was also room for the inclusion of Proteas skipper Dane van Niekerk, who was dropped by the national team selectors for the ongoing World Cup after not meeting the team’s fitness requirements. The all-rounder pocketed R659,856 as she was roped in to form part of the star-studded RCB side. Proteas vice-captain Chloe Tryon was recruited for the same amount by the Mumbai Indians. Despite putting up their names for the auction, retired Proteas stars Lizelle Lee and Mignon du Preez did not even get picked to be part of the bidding. Surprisingly, the likes of South African spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba, who is in blistering form at the ongoing World Cup, and Proteas star opener Laura Wolvaardt went unsold at the auction. As did their national teammates, Suné Luus, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk and Ayabonga Khaka. Meanwhile, reigning T20 world champions Australia occupied the most international spots, claiming 14 from the 30 that were available. “It’s as exciting for Australian cricket as it is for cricket all over the world. I think our girls are excited about it, but focused on the job at hand while we’re here in South Africa as well,” said Australia coach Shelley Nitschke.

The complainant told the court she “said ‘no’ dozens of times” and Kuggeleijn was booed when he played T20 cricket for New Zealand shortly afterwards. His possible appearance against England has caused further outrage on social media. One person Tweeted: \"Scott Kuggeleijn, should not be anywhere near cricket, yet he is picked?

There is a mutual respect between both sides and an appreciation that our boys are extremely competitive.” Shafique, who has spent eight months in Hong Kong before taking up the assignment in Oman, said: “Our close relationship with Hong Kong Cricket has made it possible to convince them to visit Oman for the series.” The Oman U19 coach said that “plans and talks are in place to have an annual bilateral series in Oman and Hong Kong for the youth team.” Aditya Gurumukhi has been named the skipper of Oman squad with Tanuj Sivakumar appointed his deputy for the series. Shafique said: “The boys have been active and have been playing in the league as our current season is going on since September 2022. They have also been playing for their respective schools. They have had a lot of game time which is excellent for preparation. Besides that we have been in camp since the end of November and had a mix of fitness sessions along with practice matches and skills sessions.” The coach added that ‘the boys have been in the middle of exams as most of them are in 12th class.’ He said: “We have been able to find a good balance for the boys to study which is important, and at the same time, practice and play so that they are in good touch. Our boys have performed well in the men’s premier division, with Mohammad Arafat Islam (AER) performing brilliantly in the Oman D10 league. Tanuj Sivakumar (Zawawi Powertech) also had some good performances and Lakshmi Narayana has done well in a few games. All three of them are playing in all formats for their respective Premier Division sides which is beneficial for their development as they are playing with and against current Oman national team players.” Shafique said: “I am looking forward to seeing some competitive cricket with both sides playing to win. We are going to see some excellent performances throughout the bilateral series. Some of our boys have been involved in the men’s national team practice sessions. The aim is to see some of these boys eventually break into the national team and rub shoulders with them. The series is a great opportunity for our boys to test themselves.”","pubDate":"2023-02-14 23:36:29","image_url":"https://www.muscatdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Oman-crick-770x578.jpg","source_id":"muscatdaily","category":["sports"],"country":["Oman"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How player fitness standards in South African women’s cricket have evolved","link":"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2023-02-15-how-player-fitness-standards-in-south-african-womens-cricket-have-evolved/","keywords":null,"creator":["Keanan Hemmonsbey"],"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa still has some way to go to match the likes of Australia and England in maximising player fitness, but the gap between the elites and SA has closed steadily over the past three years.

Dané van Niekerk of the Adelaide Strikers bats during The Challenger Women’s Big Bash League Finals match in 2021 against the Melbourne Renegades at Adelaide Oval, Australia. (Photo: James Elsby / Getty Images) That’s how much the fitness standards and importance have changed over the past few years in SA women’s cricket — that a player of world-class ability and leadership can be omitted from a World Cup for not meeting one of the required running measurements. Fitness was never taken so seriously in South African women’s cricket before 2019. In fact, up to that point, there was no data measuring the players’ fitness levels. “The general professionalism of the group wasn’t at the standard that I was happy with, coming from the men’s game,” said Zane Webster, the Proteas Women’s strength and conditioning coach. “I felt that it lacked that extra 10%-15% professionalism. Proteas Women’s strength and conditioning coach Zane Webster. (Photo: Ashley Vlotman / Gallo Images) “It’s astounding what they’ve managed to achieve with regard to transforming their approach to fitness, but more importantly, their lifestyle.” The increased levels of professionalism have steadily been implemented in the team. There were some squabbles and disagreements at first, but everyone in the team has since taken enthusiastically to the added individualised training. There is no one player that stands head and shoulders above the rest with regard to their fitness and lifestyle transformation since 2019. But Webster uses opening batter Laura Wolvaardt and all-rounder Chloe Tryon as examples of hard work off the field paying off on the field. “Laura Wolvaardt’s fitness has never been an issue in terms of her conditioning and her aerobic capacity. She’s always been supremely fit,” said Webster. “But areas where we identified with her — where she’s got a lot better — she’s become a gym savage where previously she wasn’t really into lifting heavy weights. Now you’ll find her in the gym more than anyone else. “She’s had issues with her mobility, which could be a high risk for injury, and she’s come on in leaps and bounds.” The reason Wolvaardt is always consistent with bat in hand is that she never allows her strength and conditioning levels to drop, according to Webster. “Someone like Chloe [Tryon], the big thing for her was weight loss. The intervention that was put in place; I can’t even put into words the way she bought into the process and stuck to it. She completely transformed her lifestyle,” added Webster. Fitness standards and implementation have come into the spotlight recently because of South Africa’s desire to move one step ahead of the opposition. Locker rooms are filled with players and management from varying countries in tournaments around the world such as The Hundred, Women’s Big Bash League and the newly formed Women’s Premier League. Consequently, there aren’t many tactical secrets or advantages teams have over their opponents in modern-day cricket. The skill level between countries is also constantly narrowing. So, teams look for areas where they can find an advantage, and in recent times that has become fitness. “When you look at where the white-ball game is at the moment, you see how close games usually get. You have to ask, ‘Do you have the ability to run three hard twos at the end of the innings when you’ve been batting for the last 18 overs?’” asks Webster. “Cricket requires skill, but without fitness, your concentration can be negatively impacted.” There are several factors outside training that affect athletes’ fitness and performance, including the consumption of alcohol, a substance that feels as much a part of the culture of cricket as the bails and stumps. “It’s how you sleep, what you eat. It’s what you’re putting into your body from a liquid perspective,” said Webster. “Alcohol is something that I don’t know that we’ll ever get rid of in cricket. “I know in other sports they’re very strict on it, like you’re not allowed to have alcohol 24 hours after a game in football unless they’re winning a competition. “Alcohol is such a big part of the culture in cricket. Us as medical staff, we cringe because we know the negative impact that that has on recovery.” There is a direct correlation between a player’s fitness and their ability to succeed on the field, says Webster. “It’s no secret that the fitter you are, the more resilient you are as a player or athlete. “You will have greater longevity in the sport and you’ll have the necessary base to execute your skills at a high intensity for a long period of time. “There’s also the aspect of injury risk. The fitter and stronger you are, the less risk you are at of picking up injuries, particularly where the game currently is and where it’s moving to.” New cricket tournaments are popping up almost monthly across the world, which only serves to further congest the global calendar. This affects the fitness regimens of current cricketers compared with the ones from a bygone era of the game. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations “In the old days, international cricketers would have a period throughout the year where they would go through an off-season,” said Webster, “where they have eight to 12 weeks to recover from the previous season’s workloads, to sort out any niggles that they might have picked up through the season and finally to get themselves as fit and strong as physically possible to prepare themselves for the season ahead. “The modern-day international cricketer doesn’t have that luxury. There’s no more important time than now in international cricket for players to be as fit and as resilient as they can be. “If you put it into numbers, in 1,000 days cricketers will have maybe 200 rest days out of the 1,000. The rest of the days you’ll be training, in the gym, on the field and you’d be playing cricket. “If you look at the ratio, that’s not a lot of rest time. So, obviously being better conditioned, the chances of you going through all that without dropping your standard of on-field performance and staying injury-free increases significantly.” The fitness standards in women’s cricket have increased significantly in South Africa, but there is still room for improvement if the country is to reach the summit of the game.

The player acquisition on Monday, by the five teams involved in the historic tournament, made it that much more real for the pioneering players. The post India’s Mandhana the crown jewel in Australia-dominated inaugural Women’s Premier League auction appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"It was a watershed moment for many of the cricketers involved in the inaugural Women’s Premier League auction. Unusually, the auction took place while the majority of the affected players are deep within an ongoing T20 World Cup. A handful of female cricket players involved in the bidding by the five teams that make up the upcoming maiden edition of the women’s equivalent of the globally popular Indian Premier League ended Monday with the largest paychecks of their careers. India opener Smriti Mandhana, England all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt and Australia’s Ashleigh Gardner were the biggest winners of the bidding process. Mandhana, who has risen to global superstar status since making her T20 international debut for India as a 17-year-old back in 2013, fetched the highest fee at Monday’s auction. Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) splurged 34-million Indian rupees (R7.3-million) to secure the services of the left-handed batter. The amount was a huge chunk of RCB’s R26-million purse for the day’s proceedings. However, the Bangalore-based side still managed to rope in the services of experienced Australian and New Zealand duo Ellyse Perry (R3.7-million) and Sophie Devine (R1.1-million). A development that RCB’s director of cricket, Mike Hesson, was ecstatic about. “It’s a dream result for us to get Mandhana, Perry and Devine,” Hesson told journalists. “Smriti has got plenty of captaincy experience and is familiar with the Indian conditions. So, it’s highly likely (she’ll be captain).” Of the 400-plus players who went under the hammer (17 of whom were South African), England’s Sciver-Brunt and Australia’s Gardner were joint second on the bidding list. The two all-rounders will each receive just under R7-million for the work they will do for Mumbai Indians and Gujarat Giants, respectively, next month. “She probably won’t like all the attention [that will come with her price tag],” said England skipper Heather Knight of the dangerous Sciver-Brunt. “She’s very humble. She’s just very good at cricket.” Knight herself will be joining Mandhana and company at RCB after being picked up for R874,808 by the team that already has the pre-tournament tag of favourites. Knight’s Indian counterpart Harmanpreet Kaur also expressed her elation at the inception of the tournament, and the overall success of the inaugural auction. “It is a game-changer for all of us,” said Kaur after she was bought for R3.9-million and immediately made skipper by the Mumbai Indians. “This will entirely change women’s cricket, and not just in India. We all are looking forward to that.” Marizanne Kapp, left, and Shabnim Ismail from South Africa hug as teammates Ayabonga Khaka and Masabata Klaas arrive to celebrate after Kapp caught Natalie Sciver from England off the bowling of Ismail during the 2022 ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup semifinal match between South Africa and England at Hagley Oval on 31 March 2022 in Christchurch, New Zealand. (Photo: Peter Meecham / Getty Images) Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations From the South Africans who had put their names on the list, prolific all-rounder Marizanne Kapp was the most expensive acquisition from a local perspective. The highly rated Proteas star cost the Delhi Capitals R3.3-million, with electric seamer and Kapp’s partner in bowling destruction for South Africa, Shabnim Ismail, earning around R2.2-million for her move to the UP Warriorz. There was also room for the inclusion of Proteas skipper Dane van Niekerk, who was dropped by the national team selectors for the ongoing World Cup after not meeting the team’s fitness requirements. The all-rounder pocketed R659,856 as she was roped in to form part of the star-studded RCB side. Proteas vice-captain Chloe Tryon was recruited for the same amount by the Mumbai Indians. Despite putting up their names for the auction, retired Proteas stars Lizelle Lee and Mignon du Preez did not even get picked to be part of the bidding. Surprisingly, the likes of South African spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba, who is in blistering form at the ongoing World Cup, and Proteas star opener Laura Wolvaardt went unsold at the auction. As did their national teammates, Suné Luus, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk and Ayabonga Khaka. Meanwhile, reigning T20 world champions Australia occupied the most international spots, claiming 14 from the 30 that were available. “It’s as exciting for Australian cricket as it is for cricket all over the world. I think our girls are excited about it, but focused on the job at hand while we’re here in South Africa as well,” said Australia coach Shelley Nitschke.

Target tersebut dinilai realistis karena tim kriket Indonesia mampu unjuk gigi dalam berbagai ajang internasional. Abhiram mengatakan saat ini untuk sektor putri, skuad Merah Putih menempati peringkat 20 dunia, sementara untuk putra ada di posisi 57. “Ini tentu merupakan kolaborasi bersama dari perjuangan kriket dalam beberapa tahun terakhir. Ke depannya, sesuai dengan amanat KONI Pusat dan Kemenpora, pada SEA Games 2023 kami menargetkan tiga medali emas,” kata Abhiram dalam pelantikan dan pengukuhan PP PCI periode 2023-2027 di Kantor KONI Pusat, Senayan, Jakarta, Selasa (15/2) malam kemarin. Tak hanya SEA Games Kamboja, Abhiram juga bertekad untuk bisa membawa kriket Indonesia lebih berprestasi di level lebih tinggi termasuk Asian Games XIX di Hangzhou, Tiongkok dan bisa tampil Piala Dunia Kriket. “Kami berharap bisa menembus Piala Dunia Senior Putri untuk tahun ini dan kualifikasi Piala Dunia U-19 Putra. Sehingga Indonesia bisa menjadi langganan tampil di Piala Dunia,” ujar Abhiram menambahkan. Sekadar informasi, penampilan terakhir tim kriket Indonesia pada SEA Games 2017 di Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Kala itu, skuad Merah Putih membawa pulang satu perak dan satu perunggu. Sedangkan Malaysia menjadi yang terbaik dengan satu emas, satu perak, dan satu perunggu. Dalam dua edisi SEA Games terakhir yakni di Filipina pada 2019 dan di Vietnam, cabang olahraga kriket tidak dipertandingkan. Dalam kesempatan yang sama, Ketua Umum KONI Pusat Marciano Norman mendukung penuh PP PCI untuk bisa terus membawa kriket Indonesia berprestasi di kancah internasional. “Saya berjanji untuk hadir bersama mereka (tim kriket Indonesia), sebagai rasa bangga dan kita mengingat apa yang diprediksi Ketum Pengurus Pusat Persatuan Cricket Indonesia benar-benar bisa mencapai target (di SEA Games Kamboja),” kata Marciano.","pubDate":"2023-02-15 00:05:16","image_url":"https://cdn-asset.jawapos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230214-WA0015_4-640x480.jpg","source_id":"jawapos","category":["sports"],"country":["indonesia"],"language":"indonesian"},{"title":"‘Series against Hong Kong to benefit our boys’","link":"https://www.muscatdaily.com/2023/02/15/oman-u19-boys/","keywords":["Sports","Hong kng","Hong Kong","Muscat Daily","Oman","Oman Cricket","Oman Cricket Academy"],"creator":["Sarath Pookkat"],"video_url":null,"description":"Muscat – Oman U19 cricket team coach Adeel Shafique is hopeful of his boys gaining lot of experience and match exposure when they tackle the visiting Hong Kong U19 team during the four-match 50-over-a-side series, beginning on Wednesday, at the Oman Cricket Academy ground in Al Amerat.

She’s always been supremely fit,” said Webster. “But areas where we identified with her — where she’s got a lot better — she’s become a gym savage where previously she wasn’t really into lifting heavy weights. Now you’ll find her in the gym more than anyone else. “She’s had issues with her mobility, which could be a high risk for injury, and she’s come on in leaps and bounds.” The reason Wolvaardt is always consistent with bat in hand is that she never allows her strength and conditioning levels to drop, according to Webster. “Someone like Chloe [Tryon], the big thing for her was weight loss. The intervention that was put in place; I can’t even put into words the way she bought into the process and stuck to it. She completely transformed her lifestyle,” added Webster. Fitness standards and implementation have come into the spotlight recently because of South Africa’s desire to move one step ahead of the opposition. Locker rooms are filled with players and management from varying countries in tournaments around the world such as The Hundred, Women’s Big Bash League and the newly formed Women’s Premier League. Consequently, there aren’t many tactical secrets or advantages teams have over their opponents in modern-day cricket. The skill level between countries is also constantly narrowing. So, teams look for areas where they can find an advantage, and in recent times that has become fitness. “When you look at where the white-ball game is at the moment, you see how close games usually get. You have to ask, ‘Do you have the ability to run three hard twos at the end of the innings when you’ve been batting for the last 18 overs?’” asks Webster. “Cricket requires skill, but without fitness, your concentration can be negatively impacted.” There are several factors outside training that affect athletes’ fitness and performance, including the consumption of alcohol, a substance that feels as much a part of the culture of cricket as the bails and stumps. “It’s how you sleep, what you eat. It’s what you’re putting into your body from a liquid perspective,” said Webster. “Alcohol is something that I don’t know that we’ll ever get rid of in cricket. “I know in other sports they’re very strict on it, like you’re not allowed to have alcohol 24 hours after a game in football unless they’re winning a competition. “Alcohol is such a big part of the culture in cricket. Us as medical staff, we cringe because we know the negative impact that that has on recovery.” There is a direct correlation between a player’s fitness and their ability to succeed on the field, says Webster. “It’s no secret that the fitter you are, the more resilient you are as a player or athlete. “You will have greater longevity in the sport and you’ll have the necessary base to execute your skills at a high intensity for a long period of time. “There’s also the aspect of injury risk. The fitter and stronger you are, the less risk you are at of picking up injuries, particularly where the game currently is and where it’s moving to.” New cricket tournaments are popping up almost monthly across the world, which only serves to further congest the global calendar. This affects the fitness regimens of current cricketers compared with the ones from a bygone era of the game.

There’s no more important time than now in international cricket for players to be as fit and as resilient as they can be. “If you put it into numbers, in 1,000 days cricketers will have maybe 200 rest days out of the 1,000. The rest of the days you’ll be training, in the gym, on the field and you’d be playing cricket. “If you look at the ratio, that’s not a lot of rest time. So, obviously being better conditioned, the chances of you going through all that without dropping your standard of on-field performance and staying injury-free increases significantly.” The fitness standards in women’s cricket have increased significantly in South Africa, but there is still room for improvement if the country is to reach the summit of the game.

The player acquisition on Monday, by the five teams involved in the historic tournament, made it that much more real for the pioneering players. The post India’s Mandhana the crown jewel in Australia-dominated inaugural Women’s Premier League auction appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"It was a watershed moment for many of the cricketers involved in the inaugural Women’s Premier League auction. Unusually, the auction took place while the majority of the affected players are deep within an ongoing T20 World Cup. A handful of female cricket players involved in the bidding by the five teams that make up the upcoming maiden edition of the women’s equivalent of the globally popular Indian Premier League ended Monday with the largest paychecks of their careers. India opener Smriti Mandhana, England all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt and Australia’s Ashleigh Gardner were the biggest winners of the bidding process. Mandhana, who has risen to global superstar status since making her T20 international debut for India as a 17-year-old back in 2013, fetched the highest fee at Monday’s auction. Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) splurged 34-million Indian rupees (R7.3-million) to secure the services of the left-handed batter. The amount was a huge chunk of RCB’s R26-million purse for the day’s proceedings. However, the Bangalore-based side still managed to rope in the services of experienced Australian and New Zealand duo Ellyse Perry (R3.7-million) and Sophie Devine (R1.1-million). A development that RCB’s director of cricket, Mike Hesson, was ecstatic about. “It’s a dream result for us to get Mandhana, Perry and Devine,” Hesson told journalists. “Smriti has got plenty of captaincy experience and is familiar with the Indian conditions. So, it’s highly likely (she’ll be captain).” Of the 400-plus players who went under the hammer (17 of whom were South African), England’s Sciver-Brunt and Australia’s Gardner were joint second on the bidding list. The two all-rounders will each receive just under R7-million for the work they will do for Mumbai Indians and Gujarat Giants, respectively, next month. “She probably won’t like all the attention [that will come with her price tag],” said England skipper Heather Knight of the dangerous Sciver-Brunt. “She’s very humble. She’s just very good at cricket.” Knight herself will be joining Mandhana and company at RCB after being picked up for R874,808 by the team that already has the pre-tournament tag of favourites. Knight’s Indian counterpart Harmanpreet Kaur also expressed her elation at the inception of the tournament, and the overall success of the inaugural auction. “It is a game-changer for all of us,” said Kaur after she was bought for R3.9-million and immediately made skipper by the Mumbai Indians. “This will entirely change women’s cricket, and not just in India. We all are looking forward to that.” Marizanne Kapp, left, and Shabnim Ismail from South Africa hug as teammates Ayabonga Khaka and Masabata Klaas arrive to celebrate after Kapp caught Natalie Sciver from England off the bowling of Ismail during the 2022 ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup semifinal match between South Africa and England at Hagley Oval on 31 March 2022 in Christchurch, New Zealand.

The highly rated Proteas star cost the Delhi Capitals R3.3-million, with electric seamer and Kapp’s partner in bowling destruction for South Africa, Shabnim Ismail, earning around R2.2-million for her move to the UP Warriorz. There was also room for the inclusion of Proteas skipper Dane van Niekerk, who was dropped by the national team selectors for the ongoing World Cup after not meeting the team’s fitness requirements. The all-rounder pocketed R659,856 as she was roped in to form part of the star-studded RCB side. Proteas vice-captain Chloe Tryon was recruited for the same amount by the Mumbai Indians. Despite putting up their names for the auction, retired Proteas stars Lizelle Lee and Mignon du Preez did not even get picked to be part of the bidding. Surprisingly, the likes of South African spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba, who is in blistering form at the ongoing World Cup, and Proteas star opener Laura Wolvaardt went unsold at the auction. As did their national teammates, Suné Luus, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk and Ayabonga Khaka. Meanwhile, reigning T20 world champions Australia occupied the most international spots, claiming 14 from the 30 that were available. “It’s as exciting for Australian cricket as it is for cricket all over the world. I think our girls are excited about it, but focused on the job at hand while we’re here in South Africa as well,” said Australia coach Shelley Nitschke.

Kuggeleijn could make his Test debut against England in Mount Maunganui as the Blackcaps suffer a bowling crisis. The 31-year-old was found not guilty at a retrial in 2017 after the jury was unable to reach a verdict at the first trial. The complainant told the court she “said ‘no’ dozens of times” and Kuggeleijn was booed when he played T20 cricket for New Zealand shortly afterwards. His possible appearance against England has caused further outrage on social media. One person Tweeted: \"Scott Kuggeleijn, should not be anywhere near cricket, yet he is picked? Sad.\" A second commented: \"Scott Kuggeleijn seriously bro?\" A third wrote: \"Impossible to support the Blackcaps when Scott Kuggeleijn in the team.\" But Stead insisted: “I get the players I can choose from and we have gone with a resilient character. “You look around for guys who can do a job for us internationally and he is one who can.” New Zealand are refusing to pick star left-arm paceman Trent Brent, who lives in Mount Maunganui but declined a central contract to prioritise his T20 franchise career. The Kiwis are without fast bowlers Kyle Jamieson (back injury) and Matt Henry (birth of first child). Along with Kuggeleijn, they have also added Jacob Duffy to the squad. The first test between the two sides is set to take place on February 16 at the Bay Oval.","pubDate":"2023-02-14 17:34:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Hardik Pandya Wedding: 7 फेरे नहीं, क्रिश्चियन रीति-रिवाज से हुई हार्दिक पंड्या और नताशा की शादी, इस अंदाज में दिखा बराती बेटा","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/cricket-news/hardik-pandya-natasa-stankovic-wedding-photos-udaipur-marriage/articleshow/97925673.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"भारतीय टीम के ऑलराउंडर हार्दिक पंड्या ने शादी कर ली गै। उदयपुर में हार्दिक ने नताशा स्तांकोविक से शादी की। क्रिकेटर और उनकी मॉडल-अभिनेत्री पत्नी का एक विशेष वेलेंटाइन डे समारोह था जिसे उन्होंने अपने करीबी दोस्तों और परिवार के साथ मनाया।","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-02-14 17:07:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"India versus Australia: KL Rahul deserves more chances as an opener before an in-form Shubman Gill takes his place","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-versus-australia-kl-rahul-deserves-more-chances-as-an-opener-before-shubman-gill-takes-his-place-8445293/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":["Sandip G"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2023-02-14 16:54:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"विराट कोहली झूठ बोल रहा था...
