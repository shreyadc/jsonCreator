The shock disclosure at Sunderland Magistrates' Court on Thursday afternoon, in which ex-Durham coach and scout Strange admitted abusing yet another young cricketer, followed months of sustained revelations by Mail Sport. And we can now reveal that an investigation will be opened. Though it is unclear why it has taken for a sixth survivor to emerge for the ECB to open a probe, with the paedophile permanently disqualified from all cricket in April 2006. Questions have also been raised over this review being internally-led, with the findings understood to not be released to the public. MPs are now calling on the organisation to ensure the investigation into Strange is independent so failures can be properly addressed for the protection of other children — and to see if there are any other survivors. The ECB are to finally open a probe into four-time convicted paedophile cricket coach Michael Strange after a sixth survivor emerged Michael Strange, a convicted paedophile, used to work as a coach and scout at Durham The paedophile was first convicted to a six-year sentence in 2012 for abusing young cricketers in the North East between 1990 and 2004. Six survivors in total later emerged over a 10-year period. Some played at Bill Quay cricket club in Gateshead, which is where the Strange was club captain and coach. He was then given three further prison terms — in 2016, 2020 and 2022 — increasing his punishment to 13-and-a-half years for the offences. Strange will now be sentenced for a fifth time on September 7. Mail Sport revealed last month that Strange was free to train children up to six months after allegations of child sex abuse were made against him. Mail Sport then disclosed in June that the ECB had contacted Northumbria Police to discuss opening an investigation into the paedophile following our approach. That followed our discovery that a report scrutinising child safeguarding measures just weeks after the Andy Woodward football abuse scandal in 2016 has still not been released seven years on. In response to the ECB's confirmation of a review, MPs have raised concerns about its independence. Labour MP Sarah Champion said: 'If the ECB are genuinely committed to safeguarding, it needs to open an independent investigation into how a prolific paedophile could abuse so many children on their watch. 'It is highly likely that many more children than the brave six felt able to report the crime were also abused. The ECB needs to rapidly investigate what went so very wrong with their duty to protect children in their care, so it never happens again. 'Every parent who trusted the ECB to safeguard their child while Strange was a coach will want to know the truth about how this abuse was allowed to occur. The ECB need to do the right thing.' Labour MP Tony Lloyd said: 'The cricket authorities have an absolute duty of care to young or vulnerable people playing cricket. They have got to demonstrate in a way that is transparent that they are taking this issue seriously, and that they act. MPs are now calling on the ECB to ensure the investigation into Strange is independent 'The public is right to demand action and accountability.' An ECB spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with all victims of Michael Strange and we applaud their bravery in coming forwards. 'While statutory partners do not believe a complex case practice review is warranted, the ECB is now scoping an internally-led review to establish further information about the environment in which Strange committed his offences within cricket, and how this informs ECB safeguarding strategy.' A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm we have spoken with the ECB and shared appropriate information. 'We would always encourage anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse to come forward no matter how long ago this happened. 'We want victims to know that, regardless of when they do come forward, we are here to support them and are committed to bringing offenders to justice.'

Tamil Nadu’s poor show in the Ranji Trophy is also a reason for the tournament being played in the four-day format for the first time. The tournament is now bigger in terms of the number of teams and the window. Usually played by 8 teams, the upcoming edition will be played from August 15-September 11 and will feature 12 teams. The tournament’s playing conditions will be similar to the Ranji Trophy’s. The decision to increase the number of teams followed requests from other state units. With monsoons prevailing in the north, nine of the 12 teams are from the region, with Kerala being the lone visiting side from the south, apart from the two teams that TNCA is fielding. With TNPL already out of the way, the TNCA has allotted a 28-day window – the longest ever for the tournament and is spending Rs 2.5 crore for the event. Winning team will get Rs three lakh and the runners up Rs two lakh. The 12 teams have been divided into four groups and the toppers will make the semifinals. “I am happy TNCA is reviving Buchi Babu. It is the stepping stone into big league cricket. The revival of Buchi Babu is important for the revival of First Class cricket. Parents want their kids to only play in the IPL. So I am happy that TNCA is reviving it as a four-day format,” former India captain Kris Srikkanth said at the launch event. After the 2016-17 season, with the arrival of the Tamil Nadu Premier League, the tournament failed to get a window for six years. TNCA secretary RI Palani said that there was plenty of interest from state units and even had to turn down a request from MS Dhoni to include Jharkhand in the draw. “MS Dhoni wanted us to include Jharkhand, but it was too tight. We already have 12 teams, hence we couldn’t accommodate them. Even Chhattisgarh and Services wanted to take part. Since teams use the event to prepare for the pre-season, we have chosen to host the tournament in Coimbatore, Salem, Dindigul and Tirunelveli on green-tops as it will give players a good preparation” Palani said. Advertisement Named after the man who is considered the Father of Madras cricket, the start of Buchi Babu signalled the start of the domestic season in India. The Buchi Babu tournament is older than the Ranji Trophy. More than a century old, it was first held in the 1909-10 season a year after Mothavarapu Venkata Mahipathi Naidu, commonly known as Buchi Babu, passed away in 1908. A tournament, held in the memory of their father was conducted by his three sons M Balaiah Naidu, C Ramaswami – former India players – and Venkataramanujulu, featured only local teams for nearly 50 years. In the 1960s it turned into an all-India invitational. And from there the tournament’s profile only increased. It was through the Buchi Babu tournament that fans in Chennai , then Madras, first saw Sunil Gavaskar playing in 1971. Gavaskar turned out for Associated Cement Company, just a few months after he announced his arrival in the Caribbean. Advertisement As Gavaskar mentions in his book Sunny Days, he arrived at the railway station with around 8,000-9000 people waiting for him. And when he strode out to bat, police had to escort him to the crease to fend off invading fans. “I had never seen so many people at a college ground – at Chepauk maybe, but never at a college. I had to be escorted by the police to the wicket, which I don’t think has happened anywhere before. Still, the people would surge onto the field during the drinks interval. I will never, never forget that day and that crowd,” Gavaskar wrote. The tale doesn’t end there. Early in the innings, he survived a close LBW shout that was so plumb that Gavaskar even asked the umpire why he didn’t rule him out. “I asked the umpire, ‘What was wrong with that? It was going on to hit the stumps’, to which the umpire replied, ‘If I had given him out, I won’t be allowed to go home’.” Gavaskar who made 75 wrote. Srikkanth said that was the first time he watched the legendary opener, who he got to open with later on for India. “I was a seventh standard boy and watched him play,” Srikkanth said. In the late 70s the Buchi Babu was sandwiched between the Safi Darashah and Moin-ud-Dowlah tournaments making the three events the curtain raiser. If Gavaskar played in the tournament after his famous 1971 tour, a decade later, fast bowler Karsan Ghavri would feature in the tournament after his stupendous show Down Under, where he was part of the side that won the Melbourne Test.

It was the biggest non-first class tournament in India. And each year the Bombay boys would come and win the tournament and go,” Srikkanth added.","pubDate":"2023-08-10 19:05:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Questions Arise On Eden Gardens' Safety After Fire Scare Ahead of ICC World Cup 2023","link":"https://www.latestly.com/sports/cricket/questions-arise-on-eden-gardens-safety-after-fire-scare-ahead-of-icc-world-cup-2023-5332111.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The fire raised eyebrows in certain circles as the incident hints at the possibility of safety issues at the stadium, which is one of the venues for the upcoming World Cup in October-November.","content":"Kolkata, Aug 10: A fire broke out in the dressing room of the Eden Gardens here and was brought under control quickly without causing much damage, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB).

It isn't a landmark, in fact other than a century (which is rare), there are no landmarks in T20 cricket. We are far too obsessed with individual achievement within a team sport.

Finally someone says it! ऐसे में हर्षा की बात अतिश्योक्ति ही ज्यादा नजर आती है! वैसे बात रिकॉर्डों से अलग भावनाओं की भी है. खिलाड़ी की भी और उससे जुड़े लोगों की भी. अगर कोई युवा बल्लेबाज इस स्थिति में है, तो जाहिर है कि अर्द्धशतक उसके लिए बहुत ही मायने रखता है. और अगर हार्दिक इस मामले में तिलक वर्मा की मदद करते, तो निश्चित ही यह उनके यश, उनके प्रति सभी के नजरिए को और बेहतर ही बनाता. बहरहाल, हर्षा कह रहे हैं, तो हम यही कहेंगे कि भाई देखने की अपनी-अपनी नजर है! भोगले से सहमत न होने वाले बहुत हैं You're now saying a personal 50 milestone landmark shouldn't be a talk and will go on to celebrate the same personal 50 milestone on air if it leads to India's victory just like how you applauded King's 50 at Eden gardens against Pak in 2016 t20 wc. फैंस भोगले को कुछ ऐसे जवाब दे रहे हैं Scoring 50 might not be a significant T20 milestone, but it surely boosts a youngster's confidence. Allowing the young player his moment wouldn't have hurt, considering the match's situation. In the past, Dhoni allowed Kohli to secure the winning runs in a T20 world coup match.… A half century for a young man in only his second international outing would have done wonders for his confidence, what Hardik did was unethical, he was selfish, being the senior most player in the team and the captain , he should have let him finish the game. don't defend… * पढ़ें ,राजनीति,खेल समाचार, और की ताजा समाचार अब हिंदी में ( ) लाइव खबर देखें: फॉलो करे:","pubDate":"2023-08-10 18:14:53","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-08/tvq8q1jg_tilak-varma_625x300_07_August_23.jpg","source_id":"ndtv_in","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Shikhar Dhawan backs Suryakumar to succeed as India's No.4 in World Cup 2023","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/shikhar-dhawan-backs-suryakumar-to-succeed-as-indias-no4-in-world-cup-2023-2419324-2023-08-10?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shikhar Dhawan backs Suryakumar to succeed as India's No.4 in World Cup 2023","content":"Listen to Story Veteran India opener Shikhar Dhawan believes Suryakumar Yadav should be chosen for India's No.4 spot at the ICC World Cup, citing his experience and performance in international cricket.

With Shreyas Iyer's fitness in doubt, the number four spot in the Indian ODI squad is up for grabs ahead of the World Cup.

Another batter to watch out for will be Rohit Sharma as he did exceptionally well in the last World Cup,\" he said, referring to Rohit's five hundred in the 2019 edition.

The shock disclosure at Sunderland Magistrates' Court on Thursday afternoon, in which ex-Durham coach and scout Strange admitted abusing yet another young cricketer, followed months of sustained revelations by Mail Sport. And we can now reveal that an investigation will be opened. Though it is unclear why it has taken for a sixth survivor to emerge for the ECB to open a probe, with the paedophile permanently disqualified from all cricket in April 2006. Questions have also been raised over this review being internally-led, with the findings understood to not be released to the public. MPs are now calling on the organisation to ensure the investigation into Strange is independent so failures can be properly addressed for the protection of other children — and to see if there are any other survivors. The ECB are to finally open a probe into four-time convicted paedophile cricket coach Michael Strange after a sixth survivor emerged Michael Strange, a convicted paedophile, used to work as a coach and scout at Durham The paedophile was first convicted to a six-year sentence in 2012 for abusing young cricketers in the North East between 1990 and 2004. Six survivors in total later emerged over a 10-year period. Some played at Bill Quay cricket club in Gateshead, which is where the Strange was club captain and coach. He was then given three further prison terms — in 2016, 2020 and 2022 — increasing his punishment to 13-and-a-half years for the offences. Strange will now be sentenced for a fifth time on September 7. Mail Sport revealed last month that Strange was free to train children up to six months after allegations of child sex abuse were made against him. Mail Sport then disclosed in June that the ECB had contacted Northumbria Police to discuss opening an investigation into the paedophile following our approach. That followed our discovery that a report scrutinising child safeguarding measures just weeks after the Andy Woodward football abuse scandal in 2016 has still not been released seven years on. In response to the ECB's confirmation of a review, MPs have raised concerns about its independence. Labour MP Sarah Champion said: 'If the ECB are genuinely committed to safeguarding, it needs to open an independent investigation into how a prolific paedophile could abuse so many children on their watch. 'It is highly likely that many more children than the brave six felt able to report the crime were also abused. The ECB needs to rapidly investigate what went so very wrong with their duty to protect children in their care, so it never happens again. 'Every parent who trusted the ECB to safeguard their child while Strange was a coach will want to know the truth about how this abuse was allowed to occur. The ECB need to do the right thing.' Labour MP Tony Lloyd said: 'The cricket authorities have an absolute duty of care to young or vulnerable people playing cricket. They have got to demonstrate in a way that is transparent that they are taking this issue seriously, and that they act. MPs are now calling on the ECB to ensure the investigation into Strange is independent 'The public is right to demand action and accountability.' An ECB spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with all victims of Michael Strange and we applaud their bravery in coming forwards. 'While statutory partners do not believe a complex case practice review is warranted, the ECB is now scoping an internally-led review to establish further information about the environment in which Strange committed his offences within cricket, and how this informs ECB safeguarding strategy.' A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm we have spoken with the ECB and shared appropriate information. 'We would always encourage anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse to come forward no matter how long ago this happened. 'We want victims to know that, regardless of when they do come forward, we are here to support them and are committed to bringing offenders to justice.'

Tamil Nadu’s poor show in the Ranji Trophy is also a reason for the tournament being played in the four-day format for the first time. The tournament is now bigger in terms of the number of teams and the window. Usually played by 8 teams, the upcoming edition will be played from August 15-September 11 and will feature 12 teams. The tournament’s playing conditions will be similar to the Ranji Trophy’s. The decision to increase the number of teams followed requests from other state units. With monsoons prevailing in the north, nine of the 12 teams are from the region, with Kerala being the lone visiting side from the south, apart from the two teams that TNCA is fielding. With TNPL already out of the way, the TNCA has allotted a 28-day window – the longest ever for the tournament and is spending Rs 2.5 crore for the event. Winning team will get Rs three lakh and the runners up Rs two lakh. The 12 teams have been divided into four groups and the toppers will make the semifinals. “I am happy TNCA is reviving Buchi Babu. It is the stepping stone into big league cricket. The revival of Buchi Babu is important for the revival of First Class cricket. Parents want their kids to only play in the IPL. So I am happy that TNCA is reviving it as a four-day format,” former India captain Kris Srikkanth said at the launch event. After the 2016-17 season, with the arrival of the Tamil Nadu Premier League, the tournament failed to get a window for six years. TNCA secretary RI Palani said that there was plenty of interest from state units and even had to turn down a request from MS Dhoni to include Jharkhand in the draw. “MS Dhoni wanted us to include Jharkhand, but it was too tight. We already have 12 teams, hence we couldn’t accommodate them. Even Chhattisgarh and Services wanted to take part. Since teams use the event to prepare for the pre-season, we have chosen to host the tournament in Coimbatore, Salem, Dindigul and Tirunelveli on green-tops as it will give players a good preparation” Palani said. Advertisement Named after the man who is considered the Father of Madras cricket, the start of Buchi Babu signalled the start of the domestic season in India. The Buchi Babu tournament is older than the Ranji Trophy. More than a century old, it was first held in the 1909-10 season a year after Mothavarapu Venkata Mahipathi Naidu, commonly known as Buchi Babu, passed away in 1908. A tournament, held in the memory of their father was conducted by his three sons M Balaiah Naidu, C Ramaswami – former India players – and Venkataramanujulu, featured only local teams for nearly 50 years. In the 1960s it turned into an all-India invitational. And from there the tournament’s profile only increased. It was through the Buchi Babu tournament that fans in Chennai , then Madras, first saw Sunil Gavaskar playing in 1971. Gavaskar turned out for Associated Cement Company, just a few months after he announced his arrival in the Caribbean. Advertisement As Gavaskar mentions in his book Sunny Days, he arrived at the railway station with around 8,000-9000 people waiting for him. And when he strode out to bat, police had to escort him to the crease to fend off invading fans. “I had never seen so many people at a college ground – at Chepauk maybe, but never at a college. I had to be escorted by the police to the wicket, which I don’t think has happened anywhere before. Still, the people would surge onto the field during the drinks interval. I will never, never forget that day and that crowd,” Gavaskar wrote. The tale doesn’t end there. Early in the innings, he survived a close LBW shout that was so plumb that Gavaskar even asked the umpire why he didn’t rule him out. “I asked the umpire, ‘What was wrong with that? It was going on to hit the stumps’, to which the umpire replied, ‘If I had given him out, I won’t be allowed to go home’.” Gavaskar who made 75 wrote. Srikkanth said that was the first time he watched the legendary opener, who he got to open with later on for India. “I was a seventh standard boy and watched him play,” Srikkanth said. In the late 70s the Buchi Babu was sandwiched between the Safi Darashah and Moin-ud-Dowlah tournaments making the three events the curtain raiser. If Gavaskar played in the tournament after his famous 1971 tour, a decade later, fast bowler Karsan Ghavri would feature in the tournament after his stupendous show Down Under, where he was part of the side that won the Melbourne Test.

It was the biggest non-first class tournament in India. And each year the Bombay boys would come and win the tournament and go,” Srikkanth added.","pubDate":"2023-08-10 19:05:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Questions Arise On Eden Gardens' Safety After Fire Scare Ahead of ICC World Cup 2023","link":"https://www.latestly.com/sports/cricket/questions-arise-on-eden-gardens-safety-after-fire-scare-ahead-of-icc-world-cup-2023-5332111.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The fire raised eyebrows in certain circles as the incident hints at the possibility of safety issues at the stadium, which is one of the venues for the upcoming World Cup in October-November.","content":"Kolkata, Aug 10: A fire broke out in the dressing room of the Eden Gardens here and was brought under control quickly without causing much damage, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB).

People working saw smoke and then the fire. Immediately two fire tenders were pressed into action and flames doused in no time.\" \"There was no damage to the dressing room as such. Only some burnt cables. The cause of the fire was from the heating of the sauna heater from which sparks ignited the stacks of towels close by,\" Ganguly was quoted as saying by CAB in an Instagram post. Snehasish Ganguly claimed that the fire was brought under control quickly. \"CESC people came and saw the damages to the cables and have advised that we should complete changing the cables, as recommended, in a couple of days. Besides this, it is work as usual. Our deadlines are not affected. Our plans are not affected. And certainly, there is no sabotage angle as a certain section of the media is trying to spin,\" he said. However, there were reports claiming that the belongings of several players were damaged.

It isn't a landmark, in fact other than a century (which is rare), there are no landmarks in T20 cricket. We are far too obsessed with individual achievement within a team sport. I don't believe 50s should be… इस पर दक्षिण अफ्रीका के बल्लेबाज एबीडि विलियर्स ने जवाब देते हुए कहा, \"आपका धन्यवाद..आपका धन्यवाद, आखिर में किसी ने तो यह कहा!\" बहरहाल, हर्षा की इस बात का गले उतरना न केवल फैंस ही नहीं, बल्कि एक बड़े वर्ग के गले उतरना खासा मुश्किल है. अब जहां रिकॉर्डविद टेस्ट और वनडे में भी अर्द्धशतक को खास श्रेणी में शामिल करते हैं, तो भला टी20 से अर्द्धशतक को कैसे अलग रखा जा सकता है. Thank you thank you thank you. Finally someone says it! ऐसे में हर्षा की बात अतिश्योक्ति ही ज्यादा नजर आती है! वैसे बात रिकॉर्डों से अलग भावनाओं की भी है. खिलाड़ी की भी और उससे जुड़े लोगों की भी. अगर कोई युवा बल्लेबाज इस स्थिति में है, तो जाहिर है कि अर्द्धशतक उसके लिए बहुत ही मायने रखता है. और अगर हार्दिक इस मामले में तिलक वर्मा की मदद करते, तो निश्चित ही यह उनके यश, उनके प्रति सभी के नजरिए को और बेहतर ही बनाता. बहरहाल, हर्षा कह रहे हैं, तो हम यही कहेंगे कि भाई देखने की अपनी-अपनी नजर है! भोगले से सहमत न होने वाले बहुत हैं You're now saying a personal 50 milestone landmark shouldn't be a talk and will go on to celebrate the same personal 50 milestone on air if it leads to India's victory just like how you applauded King's 50 at Eden gardens against Pak in 2016 t20 wc. फैंस भोगले को कुछ ऐसे जवाब दे रहे हैं Scoring 50 might not be a significant T20 milestone, but it surely boosts a youngster's confidence. Allowing the young player his moment wouldn't have hurt, considering the match's situation. In the past, Dhoni allowed Kohli to secure the winning runs in a T20 world coup match.… A half century for a young man in only his second international outing would have done wonders for his confidence, what Hardik did was unethical, he was selfish, being the senior most player in the team and the captain , he should have let him finish the game. don't defend… * पढ़ें ,राजनीति,खेल समाचार, और की ताजा समाचार अब हिंदी में ( ) लाइव खबर देखें: फॉलो करे:","pubDate":"2023-08-10 18:14:53","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-08/tvq8q1jg_tilak-varma_625x300_07_August_23.jpg","source_id":"ndtv_in","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Shikhar Dhawan backs Suryakumar to succeed as India's No.4 in World Cup 2023","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/shikhar-dhawan-backs-suryakumar-to-succeed-as-indias-no4-in-world-cup-2023-2419324-2023-08-10?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shikhar Dhawan backs Suryakumar to succeed as India's No.4 in World Cup 2023","content":"Listen to Story Veteran India opener Shikhar Dhawan believes Suryakumar Yadav should be chosen for India's No.4 spot at the ICC World Cup, citing his experience and performance in international cricket.

With Shreyas Iyer's fitness in doubt, the number four spot in the Indian ODI squad is up for grabs ahead of the World Cup. Suryakumar Yadav and Sanju Samson are the frontrunners, while R Ashwin believes Tilak Varma, a rookie batter, could be a good choice for that position. \"I would go with Surya at four as he is an experienced player and has been playing international cricket for a while,\" Shikhar Dhawan told PTI. \"Also, really looking forward to seeing how Shubman Gill does in the World Cup. Another batter to watch out for will be Rohit Sharma as he did exceptionally well in the last World Cup,\" he said, referring to Rohit's five hundred in the 2019 edition.

The shock disclosure at Sunderland Magistrates' Court on Thursday afternoon, in which ex-Durham coach and scout Strange admitted abusing yet another young cricketer, followed months of sustained revelations by Mail Sport. And we can now reveal that an investigation will be opened. Though it is unclear why it has taken for a sixth survivor to emerge for the ECB to open a probe, with the paedophile permanently disqualified from all cricket in April 2006. Questions have also been raised over this review being internally-led, with the findings understood to not be released to the public. MPs are now calling on the organisation to ensure the investigation into Strange is independent so failures can be properly addressed for the protection of other children — and to see if there are any other survivors. The ECB are to finally open a probe into four-time convicted paedophile cricket coach Michael Strange after a sixth survivor emerged Michael Strange, a convicted paedophile, used to work as a coach and scout at Durham The paedophile was first convicted to a six-year sentence in 2012 for abusing young cricketers in the North East between 1990 and 2004. Six survivors in total later emerged over a 10-year period. Some played at Bill Quay cricket club in Gateshead, which is where the Strange was club captain and coach. He was then given three further prison terms — in 2016, 2020 and 2022 — increasing his punishment to 13-and-a-half years for the offences. Strange will now be sentenced for a fifth time on September 7. Mail Sport revealed last month that Strange was free to train children up to six months after allegations of child sex abuse were made against him. Mail Sport then disclosed in June that the ECB had contacted Northumbria Police to discuss opening an investigation into the paedophile following our approach. That followed our discovery that a report scrutinising child safeguarding measures just weeks after the Andy Woodward football abuse scandal in 2016 has still not been released seven years on. In response to the ECB's confirmation of a review, MPs have raised concerns about its independence. Labour MP Sarah Champion said: 'If the ECB are genuinely committed to safeguarding, it needs to open an independent investigation into how a prolific paedophile could abuse so many children on their watch. 'It is highly likely that many more children than the brave six felt able to report the crime were also abused. The ECB needs to rapidly investigate what went so very wrong with their duty to protect children in their care, so it never happens again. 'Every parent who trusted the ECB to safeguard their child while Strange was a coach will want to know the truth about how this abuse was allowed to occur. The ECB need to do the right thing.' Labour MP Tony Lloyd said: 'The cricket authorities have an absolute duty of care to young or vulnerable people playing cricket. They have got to demonstrate in a way that is transparent that they are taking this issue seriously, and that they act. MPs are now calling on the ECB to ensure the investigation into Strange is independent 'The public is right to demand action and accountability.' An ECB spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with all victims of Michael Strange and we applaud their bravery in coming forwards. 'While statutory partners do not believe a complex case practice review is warranted, the ECB is now scoping an internally-led review to establish further information about the environment in which Strange committed his offences within cricket, and how this informs ECB safeguarding strategy.' A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm we have spoken with the ECB and shared appropriate information. 'We would always encourage anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse to come forward no matter how long ago this happened. 'We want victims to know that, regardless of when they do come forward, we are here to support them and are committed to bringing offenders to justice.'

Tamil Nadu’s poor show in the Ranji Trophy is also a reason for the tournament being played in the four-day format for the first time. The tournament is now bigger in terms of the number of teams and the window. Usually played by 8 teams, the upcoming edition will be played from August 15-September 11 and will feature 12 teams. The tournament’s playing conditions will be similar to the Ranji Trophy’s. The decision to increase the number of teams followed requests from other state units. With monsoons prevailing in the north, nine of the 12 teams are from the region, with Kerala being the lone visiting side from the south, apart from the two teams that TNCA is fielding. With TNPL already out of the way, the TNCA has allotted a 28-day window – the longest ever for the tournament and is spending Rs 2.5 crore for the event. Winning team will get Rs three lakh and the runners up Rs two lakh. The 12 teams have been divided into four groups and the toppers will make the semifinals. “I am happy TNCA is reviving Buchi Babu. It is the stepping stone into big league cricket. The revival of Buchi Babu is important for the revival of First Class cricket. Parents want their kids to only play in the IPL. So I am happy that TNCA is reviving it as a four-day format,” former India captain Kris Srikkanth said at the launch event. After the 2016-17 season, with the arrival of the Tamil Nadu Premier League, the tournament failed to get a window for six years. TNCA secretary RI Palani said that there was plenty of interest from state units and even had to turn down a request from MS Dhoni to include Jharkhand in the draw. “MS Dhoni wanted us to include Jharkhand, but it was too tight. We already have 12 teams, hence we couldn’t accommodate them. Even Chhattisgarh and Services wanted to take part. Since teams use the event to prepare for the pre-season, we have chosen to host the tournament in Coimbatore, Salem, Dindigul and Tirunelveli on green-tops as it will give players a good preparation” Palani said. Advertisement Named after the man who is considered the Father of Madras cricket, the start of Buchi Babu signalled the start of the domestic season in India. The Buchi Babu tournament is older than the Ranji Trophy. More than a century old, it was first held in the 1909-10 season a year after Mothavarapu Venkata Mahipathi Naidu, commonly known as Buchi Babu, passed away in 1908. A tournament, held in the memory of their father was conducted by his three sons M Balaiah Naidu, C Ramaswami – former India players – and Venkataramanujulu, featured only local teams for nearly 50 years. In the 1960s it turned into an all-India invitational. And from there the tournament’s profile only increased. It was through the Buchi Babu tournament that fans in Chennai , then Madras, first saw Sunil Gavaskar playing in 1971. Gavaskar turned out for Associated Cement Company, just a few months after he announced his arrival in the Caribbean. Advertisement As Gavaskar mentions in his book Sunny Days, he arrived at the railway station with around 8,000-9000 people waiting for him. And when he strode out to bat, police had to escort him to the crease to fend off invading fans. “I had never seen so many people at a college ground – at Chepauk maybe, but never at a college. I had to be escorted by the police to the wicket, which I don’t think has happened anywhere before. Still, the people would surge onto the field during the drinks interval. I will never, never forget that day and that crowd,” Gavaskar wrote. The tale doesn’t end there. Early in the innings, he survived a close LBW shout that was so plumb that Gavaskar even asked the umpire why he didn’t rule him out. “I asked the umpire, ‘What was wrong with that? It was going on to hit the stumps’, to which the umpire replied, ‘If I had given him out, I won’t be allowed to go home’.” Gavaskar who made 75 wrote. Srikkanth said that was the first time he watched the legendary opener, who he got to open with later on for India. “I was a seventh standard boy and watched him play,” Srikkanth said. In the late 70s the Buchi Babu was sandwiched between the Safi Darashah and Moin-ud-Dowlah tournaments making the three events the curtain raiser. If Gavaskar played in the tournament after his famous 1971 tour, a decade later, fast bowler Karsan Ghavri would feature in the tournament after his stupendous show Down Under, where he was part of the side that won the Melbourne Test.

People working saw smoke and then the fire. Immediately two fire tenders were pressed into action and flames doused in no time.\" \"There was no damage to the dressing room as such. Only some burnt cables. The cause of the fire was from the heating of the sauna heater from which sparks ignited the stacks of towels close by,\" Ganguly was quoted as saying by CAB in an Instagram post. Snehasish Ganguly claimed that the fire was brought under control quickly. \"CESC people came and saw the damages to the cables and have advised that we should complete changing the cables, as recommended, in a couple of days. Besides this, it is work as usual. Our deadlines are not affected. Our plans are not affected. And certainly, there is no sabotage angle as a certain section of the media is trying to spin,\" he said. However, there were reports claiming that the belongings of several players were damaged.

It isn't a landmark, in fact other than a century (which is rare), there are no landmarks in T20 cricket. We are far too obsessed with individual achievement within a team sport. I don't believe 50s should be… इस पर दक्षिण अफ्रीका के बल्लेबाज एबीडि विलियर्स ने जवाब देते हुए कहा, \"आपका धन्यवाद..आपका धन्यवाद, आखिर में किसी ने तो यह कहा!\" बहरहाल, हर्षा की इस बात का गले उतरना न केवल फैंस ही नहीं, बल्कि एक बड़े वर्ग के गले उतरना खासा मुश्किल है. अब जहां रिकॉर्डविद टेस्ट और वनडे में भी अर्द्धशतक को खास श्रेणी में शामिल करते हैं, तो भला टी20 से अर्द्धशतक को कैसे अलग रखा जा सकता है. Thank you thank you thank you. Finally someone says it! ऐसे में हर्षा की बात अतिश्योक्ति ही ज्यादा नजर आती है! वैसे बात रिकॉर्डों से अलग भावनाओं की भी है. खिलाड़ी की भी और उससे जुड़े लोगों की भी. अगर कोई युवा बल्लेबाज इस स्थिति में है, तो जाहिर है कि अर्द्धशतक उसके लिए बहुत ही मायने रखता है. और अगर हार्दिक इस मामले में तिलक वर्मा की मदद करते, तो निश्चित ही यह उनके यश, उनके प्रति सभी के नजरिए को और बेहतर ही बनाता. बहरहाल, हर्षा कह रहे हैं, तो हम यही कहेंगे कि भाई देखने की अपनी-अपनी नजर है! भोगले से सहमत न होने वाले बहुत हैं You're now saying a personal 50 milestone landmark shouldn't be a talk and will go on to celebrate the same personal 50 milestone on air if it leads to India's victory just like how you applauded King's 50 at Eden gardens against Pak in 2016 t20 wc. फैंस भोगले को कुछ ऐसे जवाब दे रहे हैं Scoring 50 might not be a significant T20 milestone, but it surely boosts a youngster's confidence. Allowing the young player his moment wouldn't have hurt, considering the match's situation. In the past, Dhoni allowed Kohli to secure the winning runs in a T20 world coup match.… A half century for a young man in only his second international outing would have done wonders for his confidence, what Hardik did was unethical, he was selfish, being the senior most player in the team and the captain , he should have let him finish the game. don't defend… * पढ़ें ,राजनीति,खेल समाचार, और की ताजा समाचार अब हिंदी में ( ) लाइव खबर देखें: फॉलो करे:","pubDate":"2023-08-10 18:14:53","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-08/tvq8q1jg_tilak-varma_625x300_07_August_23.jpg","source_id":"ndtv_in","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Shikhar Dhawan backs Suryakumar to succeed as India's No.4 in World Cup 2023","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/shikhar-dhawan-backs-suryakumar-to-succeed-as-indias-no4-in-world-cup-2023-2419324-2023-08-10?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shikhar Dhawan backs Suryakumar to succeed as India's No.4 in World Cup 2023","content":"Listen to Story Veteran India opener Shikhar Dhawan believes Suryakumar Yadav should be chosen for India's No.4 spot at the ICC World Cup, citing his experience and performance in international cricket.

With Shreyas Iyer's fitness in doubt, the number four spot in the Indian ODI squad is up for grabs ahead of the World Cup. Suryakumar Yadav and Sanju Samson are the frontrunners, while R Ashwin believes Tilak Varma, a rookie batter, could be a good choice for that position. \"I would go with Surya at four as he is an experienced player and has been playing international cricket for a while,\" Shikhar Dhawan told PTI. \"Also, really looking forward to seeing how Shubman Gill does in the World Cup. Another batter to watch out for will be Rohit Sharma as he did exceptionally well in the last World Cup,\" he said, referring to Rohit's five hundred in the 2019 edition. On India's chances in the World Cup, he added, \"We have got a very good side which has the right blend of experience and youth. We will have the home advantage. We know the grounds and pitches and that is going to come in very handy.\" Dhawan now has a lot more time on his hands as he is not part of the Indian team for the current series. Aside from working on his game and fitness, he devotes a significant amount of time to his various commercial ventures, which fall under the Da One Group umbrella. \"It is important to be productive.
