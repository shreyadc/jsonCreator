Root may be just over 1,000 runs and three centuries adrift but the Yorkshireman remains in awe of Cook, who started and ended his international career with unforgettable Test hundreds against India. Joe Root hailed Sir Alastair Cook as the “greatest ever” after England’s record Test run-scorer announced his retirement from professional cricket following a 20-year career — PA Sport (@pasport) Root, currently in Delhi for England’s World Cup campaign, told the PA news agency: “It’s been a hell of a career. Clearly, what you did for England, we all know how special that was – a memorable finish and a memorable start. “Everything in between, you were the greatest ever. What you’ve achieved has been incredible. “To have had the opportunity to play so many Test matches alongside you, under your captaincy and even getting to boss you round a little bit at the end, was really great fun.” Cook continued playing for Essex after retiring from England duty in 2018 but his contract expired at the end of the domestic season and last month the 38-year-old elected against seeking a renewal. “It is not easy to say goodbye,” he said in a statement. “For more than two decades, cricket has been so much more than my job. 👑 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝗿𝗮. Alastair Cook has today retired from all forms of professional cricket. — Essex Cricket (@EssexCricket) “It has allowed me to experience places I never dreamed I would go, be part of teams that have achieved things I would never have thought possible and, most importantly, created deep friendships that will last a lifetime. “From the eight-year-old boy who first played for Wickham Bishops Under-11s to now, I end with a strange feeling of sadness mixed with pride. Although above all, I am incredibly happy. “It is the right time for this part of my life to come to an end. I have always given absolutely everything I possibly have to be the best player I could be, but now I want to make way for the new generation to take over.” Essex head coach Anthony McGrath had hoped “we’ll see him for a bit longer” as speculation swirled about Cook’s future after the Chelmsford club finished runners-up to Surrey in the championship. But Cook’s decision to retire ends a remarkable career which began in 2003, impressing enough for Essex to be drafted into the England set-up for the first of 161 Test appearances, making a century in the second innings against India at Nagpur in 2006. He went on to amass another 32 Test tons – an England record – and was part of Ashes series wins in 2009, 2010/11, 2013 and 2015, captaining them in the latter two. His 766 runs in the 2010/11 series saw him crowned player of the series and helped England seal a first triumph Down Under since 1986/87. Cook won 24 of his 59 Tests as England captain between 2010 and 2016 and skippered the ODI side between 2010 and 2014 before being unceremoniously axed just months before the World Cup the following year. He bowed out of England duty with a hundred against India at the Kia Oval in September 2018 and was given a knighthood for services to cricket a few months later in the New Year Honours List. “You knew if he got past 20 balls, you could wedge in and read the paper, do whatever you wanted to do and not worry about padding up,” Root said. “We never had much formula out in the middle in terms of any good chat or anything but he was always great to bat with and to learn from. “As a young lad coming into that team, to have his experience to learn from… you can’t buy that. They are things that aid you as a young player and speed up your development. “I’m very grateful for what he gave me and other young lads in my position. He’s been incredible for the game. It’s nice know you’ve made a friend for life.” After the end of a distinguished international career, Cook showed he still had plenty of appetite and was Essex’s leading run-scorer in their 2019 championship triumph, while he topped the charts in the Covid-shortened summer of 2020 to help his side go all the way in the Bob Willis Trophy. The last of his 352 first-class appearances – in which he registered 26,643 runs and 74 hundreds at an average of 46.41, fractionally above his Test mark of 45.35 – came against Northamptonshire a fortnight ago. In sharp contrast to his fairytale England exit, Cook made two single-figure scores. Cook – who thanked his family and the staff at Essex as well as mentor Graham Gooch in his farewell statement – added: “When I ended my international career, I had no idea that I would have five more bonus years playing for Essex. I cannot put into words just how much fun we have had during that time. “Playing a full part in the season when Essex won the County Championship in 2019 is one of my favourite achievements in the game. “I look forward to watching Essex continue to punch above their weight, hopefully winning many more trophies in the coming years. “Now, I hope the Bedfordshire Farmers will find space for a has-been ‘all-rounder’ somewhere in their lower order.”","pubDate":"2023-10-13 20:11:21","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17331061/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e10912a99ad25cef137d565464e526a4","title":"Cheruiyot’s date with Delhi, 13 years later","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/cheruiyots-date-with-delhi-13-years-later-101697221746100.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Kenyan 5,000m champion at the Rio Olympics is returning to road racing after the birth of her second child","content":"Vivian Cheruiyot raised her hand to shield her eyes from the setting sun. The Kenyan distance runner looked around the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium with a smile on her face. Vivian Cheruiyot (Kenya) during a press conference.(Hindustan Times) The 40-year-old is familiar with the national capital. It was at the venue 13 years ago that Cheruiyot led a Kenyan 5,000m sweep in the 2010 Commonwealth Games. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. It was that win which catapulted her into the top echelons of global distance running. Cheruiyot went on to win four Olympic medals, including a 5,000m gold in Rio 2016, and four World Championships gold medals (two each in 5,000m and 10,000m). “I remember the first time I came to Delhi. I really loved my time here. It is a privilege to return. I love the country, the people, the culture. I missed coming here, so I am really happy to be back,” said Cheruiyot, who won three successive 5,000m Diamond League crowns from 2011 to 2013. This time though, the four-time Olympian is here to take part in the Vedanta Delhi Half Marathon. Sunday though will throw up a different challenge. She is making a comeback after a break of two-and-a-half years following the birth of her second child in October 2021. “My last international competition was the 2020 London Marathon. But I have been training hard and getting ready and better. I have been planning this comeback for some time now so I am prepared to run. My girl turned two yesterday, so if I do well it will be a gift for my child.” Cheruiyot’s pet events may be 5,000m and 10,000m but she is no newcomer to distance running, having won the 2018 London Marathon and finished second in the 2018 New York and 2019 London Marathons. Asked if Delhi's October heat will be an issue, she responded: “It is warm, even in the mornings, but the conditions are the same for everyone.” The Kenyan, a senior figure in the field, will likely be challenged by the 10,000m Rio Olympics champion Almaz Ayana, who won the Delhi half marathon in 2017, and 2015 marathon world champion Mare Dibaba – both from Ethiopia. In the men’s competition, the field will be led by defending champion Chala Regasa of Ethiopia and Kenyans Daniel Ebenyo, who won 10,000m silver at the Budapest World Championships, and Leonard Barsoton. A total of 35,000 people are expected to line up on Sunday morning on one of the world’s fastest half-marathon courses. The total prize purse is $268,000 with the international elite winners taking home $27,000 each. \"Exciting news!

The are bleak chances of rain during the fixture.","content":"The cricketing world's attention is firmly fixed on the grand stage of Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium, as India prepares to face Pakistan in a critical league-stage encounter of the 2023 World Cup. This match promises to be a spectacle of monumental proportions, poised to capture the imagination of cricket enthusiasts worldwide. Despite recent meetings in the Asia Cup, the anticipation surrounding this face-off is unparalleled, given that it unfolds in India's iconic cricketing fortress, the world's largest cricket stadium. However, amidst the fervor and excitement, there looms a cause for concern - the weather forecast. Evidently, there's a shadow of uncertainty cast by the potential for rain, which could potentially disrupt this highly- anticipated clash. The India Meteorological Department has issued a prediction of light showers on the day of the India-Pakistan World Cup match, albeit against a backdrop of dry weather in Gujarat for the upcoming days. Isolated areas in Ahmedabad district, including the city itself, may experience these light showers on October 14, with cloudy conditions expected to persist. The subsequent day could witness similar conditions, with light rain in Ahmedabad and other northern districts, such as Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, and Arvalli, as reported by Manorama Mohanty, director of the Meteorological Centre in Ahmedabad. As we witnessed during India's warm-up matches, predicting India's weather is a challenging endeavor, and rain showers can be uninvited guests at any time. So, what happens if rain plays the spoilsport in the India-Pakistan World Cup match? In the unfortunate event of rain disrupting this much-awaited encounter, both India and Pakistan will be awarded one point each. This outcome would thwart the aspirations of both teams to ascend to the top of the standings. The victor of this Saturday's game was slated to challenge New Zealand for the coveted top position. However, if the match is washed out due to rain, India will remain in the third position, while Pakistan will continue to occupy the fourth spot. Naturally, players and fans alike fervently hope that rain doesn't intervene and that they can enjoy a complete 100-over spectacle.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 18:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"dnaindia","source_priority":18388,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d7c406b052ae4911f2ddd1b6c96079fa","title":"Cricket World Cup 2023, India vs Pakistan: 'Rohit Sharma vs Shaheen Afridi Is Going To Be A Battle To Watch,' Says Sanjay Bangar","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/cricket-world-cup-2023-india-vs-pakistan-rohit-sharma-vs-shaheen-afridi-is-going-to-be-a-battle-to-watch-says-sanjay-bangar-2674952.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India will take on Pakistan at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-10-13 18:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","source_priority":5319,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"27e2c32cf7ca7a3405752f70e8225a76","title":"Shubman Gill could return to top of India order against Pakistan","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23855129.shubman-gill-return-top-india-order-pakistan/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Gill sat out India’s wins over Australia and Afghanistan after being laid low by a bout of dengue fever.","content":"India could welcome back Shubman Gill as they bid to continue their World Cup stranglehold over Pakistan in front of more than 100,000 fans and an audience of up to one billion viewers worldwide.

The controversy began when Hafeez voiced his concerns about the changing nature of pitches being used in the World Cup, a topic he discussed during a PTV Sports show. Hafeez's comments hinted at the possibility that pitch conditions could influence the outcome of the tournament, and he even suggested that the World Cup's organization could be questioned, depending on the pitch variations. Hafeez explained, \"There are three venues - Hyderabad, Delhi, and Dharamsala - where two matches have been played, and the pitch conditions have shown remarkable similarity in both games. If the pitch in Chennai, which was used for the India vs. Australia match, remains the same, it's understandable. But if there are even slight changes, it raises questions about who is running the tournament.\" He further emphasized that the International Cricket Council (ICC) should retain control over the pitches, free from any influence from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), considering it's an ICC event. Hafeez expressed concern over any deviations in pitch behavior and suggested that this could potentially mar the integrity of the competition. Aakash Chopra, in response to Hafeez's remarks, offered a compelling explanation. He pointed out that many cricket grounds in India now feature pitches made with varying soil compositions, including a mix of red and black soil. These different soil components, Chopra noted, contribute to variations in how the pitches play. Therefore, he argued that it should not be surprising if the same venue exhibits radically different pitch behavior throughout the World Cup. As the cricketing world eagerly awaits the India vs. Pakistan match, it's clear that not only the players but also experts like Aakash Chopra and Mohammad Hafeez are contributing to the excitement and anticipation surrounding the 2023 World Cup. Both India and Pakistan have commenced their campaigns with victorious starts, setting the stage for a thrilling encounter in the tournament.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 17:03:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"dnaindia","source_priority":18388,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a77344eddc7368829897870e38d905e0","title":"Papers: Man Utd boss Ten Hag at risk of losing right-hand man to Ajax","link":"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/20876/12984199/manchester-united-boss-erik-ten-hag-at-risk-of-losing-right-hand-man-to-ajax-paper-talk","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Saturday's newspapers...","content":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Saturday's newspapers...

Root may be just over 1,000 runs and three centuries adrift but the Yorkshireman remains in awe of Cook, who started and ended his international career with unforgettable Test hundreds against India. Joe Root hailed Sir Alastair Cook as the “greatest ever” after England’s record Test run-scorer announced his retirement from professional cricket following a 20-year career — PA Sport (@pasport) Root, currently in Delhi for England’s World Cup campaign, told the PA news agency: “It’s been a hell of a career. Clearly, what you did for England, we all know how special that was – a memorable finish and a memorable start. “Everything in between, you were the greatest ever. What you’ve achieved has been incredible. “To have had the opportunity to play so many Test matches alongside you, under your captaincy and even getting to boss you round a little bit at the end, was really great fun.” Cook continued playing for Essex after retiring from England duty in 2018 but his contract expired at the end of the domestic season and last month the 38-year-old elected against seeking a renewal. “It is not easy to say goodbye,” he said in a statement. “For more than two decades, cricket has been so much more than my job. 👑 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝗿𝗮. Alastair Cook has today retired from all forms of professional cricket. — Essex Cricket (@EssexCricket) “It has allowed me to experience places I never dreamed I would go, be part of teams that have achieved things I would never have thought possible and, most importantly, created deep friendships that will last a lifetime. “From the eight-year-old boy who first played for Wickham Bishops Under-11s to now, I end with a strange feeling of sadness mixed with pride. Although above all, I am incredibly happy. “It is the right time for this part of my life to come to an end. I have always given absolutely everything I possibly have to be the best player I could be, but now I want to make way for the new generation to take over.” Essex head coach Anthony McGrath had hoped “we’ll see him for a bit longer” as speculation swirled about Cook’s future after the Chelmsford club finished runners-up to Surrey in the championship. But Cook’s decision to retire ends a remarkable career which began in 2003, impressing enough for Essex to be drafted into the England set-up for the first of 161 Test appearances, making a century in the second innings against India at Nagpur in 2006. He went on to amass another 32 Test tons – an England record – and was part of Ashes series wins in 2009, 2010/11, 2013 and 2015, captaining them in the latter two. His 766 runs in the 2010/11 series saw him crowned player of the series and helped England seal a first triumph Down Under since 1986/87. Cook won 24 of his 59 Tests as England captain between 2010 and 2016 and skippered the ODI side between 2010 and 2014 before being unceremoniously axed just months before the World Cup the following year. He bowed out of England duty with a hundred against India at the Kia Oval in September 2018 and was given a knighthood for services to cricket a few months later in the New Year Honours List. “You knew if he got past 20 balls, you could wedge in and read the paper, do whatever you wanted to do and not worry about padding up,” Root said. “We never had much formula out in the middle in terms of any good chat or anything but he was always great to bat with and to learn from. “As a young lad coming into that team, to have his experience to learn from… you can’t buy that. They are things that aid you as a young player and speed up your development. “I’m very grateful for what he gave me and other young lads in my position. He’s been incredible for the game. It’s nice know you’ve made a friend for life.” After the end of a distinguished international career, Cook showed he still had plenty of appetite and was Essex’s leading run-scorer in their 2019 championship triumph, while he topped the charts in the Covid-shortened summer of 2020 to help his side go all the way in the Bob Willis Trophy. The last of his 352 first-class appearances – in which he registered 26,643 runs and 74 hundreds at an average of 46.41, fractionally above his Test mark of 45.35 – came against Northamptonshire a fortnight ago. In sharp contrast to his fairytale England exit, Cook made two single-figure scores. Cook – who thanked his family and the staff at Essex as well as mentor Graham Gooch in his farewell statement – added: “When I ended my international career, I had no idea that I would have five more bonus years playing for Essex. I cannot put into words just how much fun we have had during that time. “Playing a full part in the season when Essex won the County Championship in 2019 is one of my favourite achievements in the game. “I look forward to watching Essex continue to punch above their weight, hopefully winning many more trophies in the coming years. “Now, I hope the Bedfordshire Farmers will find space for a has-been ‘all-rounder’ somewhere in their lower order.”","pubDate":"2023-10-13 20:11:21","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17331061/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e10912a99ad25cef137d565464e526a4","title":"Cheruiyot’s date with Delhi, 13 years later","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/cheruiyots-date-with-delhi-13-years-later-101697221746100.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Kenyan 5,000m champion at the Rio Olympics is returning to road racing after the birth of her second child","content":"Vivian Cheruiyot raised her hand to shield her eyes from the setting sun.

Asked if Delhi's October heat will be an issue, she responded: “It is warm, even in the mornings, but the conditions are the same for everyone.” The Kenyan, a senior figure in the field, will likely be challenged by the 10,000m Rio Olympics champion Almaz Ayana, who won the Delhi half marathon in 2017, and 2015 marathon world champion Mare Dibaba – both from Ethiopia. In the men’s competition, the field will be led by defending champion Chala Regasa of Ethiopia and Kenyans Daniel Ebenyo, who won 10,000m silver at the Budapest World Championships, and Leonard Barsoton. A total of 35,000 people are expected to line up on Sunday morning on one of the world’s fastest half-marathon courses.

The are bleak chances of rain during the fixture.","content":"The cricketing world's attention is firmly fixed on the grand stage of Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium, as India prepares to face Pakistan in a critical league-stage encounter of the 2023 World Cup. This match promises to be a spectacle of monumental proportions, poised to capture the imagination of cricket enthusiasts worldwide. Despite recent meetings in the Asia Cup, the anticipation surrounding this face-off is unparalleled, given that it unfolds in India's iconic cricketing fortress, the world's largest cricket stadium. However, amidst the fervor and excitement, there looms a cause for concern - the weather forecast. Evidently, there's a shadow of uncertainty cast by the potential for rain, which could potentially disrupt this highly- anticipated clash. The India Meteorological Department has issued a prediction of light showers on the day of the India-Pakistan World Cup match, albeit against a backdrop of dry weather in Gujarat for the upcoming days. Isolated areas in Ahmedabad district, including the city itself, may experience these light showers on October 14, with cloudy conditions expected to persist. The subsequent day could witness similar conditions, with light rain in Ahmedabad and other northern districts, such as Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, and Arvalli, as reported by Manorama Mohanty, director of the Meteorological Centre in Ahmedabad. As we witnessed during India's warm-up matches, predicting India's weather is a challenging endeavor, and rain showers can be uninvited guests at any time. So, what happens if rain plays the spoilsport in the India-Pakistan World Cup match? In the unfortunate event of rain disrupting this much-awaited encounter, both India and Pakistan will be awarded one point each. This outcome would thwart the aspirations of both teams to ascend to the top of the standings. The victor of this Saturday's game was slated to challenge New Zealand for the coveted top position. However, if the match is washed out due to rain, India will remain in the third position, while Pakistan will continue to occupy the fourth spot. Naturally, players and fans alike fervently hope that rain doesn't intervene and that they can enjoy a complete 100-over spectacle.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 18:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"dnaindia","source_priority":18388,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d7c406b052ae4911f2ddd1b6c96079fa","title":"Cricket World Cup 2023, India vs Pakistan: 'Rohit Sharma vs Shaheen Afridi Is Going To Be A Battle To Watch,' Says Sanjay Bangar","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/cricket-world-cup-2023-india-vs-pakistan-rohit-sharma-vs-shaheen-afridi-is-going-to-be-a-battle-to-watch-says-sanjay-bangar-2674952.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India will take on Pakistan at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-10-13 18:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","source_priority":5319,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"27e2c32cf7ca7a3405752f70e8225a76","title":"Shubman Gill could return to top of India order against Pakistan","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23855129.shubman-gill-return-top-india-order-pakistan/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Gill sat out India’s wins over Australia and Afghanistan after being laid low by a bout of dengue fever.","content":"India could welcome back Shubman Gill as they bid to continue their World Cup stranglehold over Pakistan in front of more than 100,000 fans and an audience of up to one billion viewers worldwide.

The controversy began when Hafeez voiced his concerns about the changing nature of pitches being used in the World Cup, a topic he discussed during a PTV Sports show. Hafeez's comments hinted at the possibility that pitch conditions could influence the outcome of the tournament, and he even suggested that the World Cup's organization could be questioned, depending on the pitch variations. Hafeez explained, \"There are three venues - Hyderabad, Delhi, and Dharamsala - where two matches have been played, and the pitch conditions have shown remarkable similarity in both games. If the pitch in Chennai, which was used for the India vs. Australia match, remains the same, it's understandable. But if there are even slight changes, it raises questions about who is running the tournament.\" He further emphasized that the International Cricket Council (ICC) should retain control over the pitches, free from any influence from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), considering it's an ICC event. Hafeez expressed concern over any deviations in pitch behavior and suggested that this could potentially mar the integrity of the competition. Aakash Chopra, in response to Hafeez's remarks, offered a compelling explanation. He pointed out that many cricket grounds in India now feature pitches made with varying soil compositions, including a mix of red and black soil. These different soil components, Chopra noted, contribute to variations in how the pitches play. Therefore, he argued that it should not be surprising if the same venue exhibits radically different pitch behavior throughout the World Cup. As the cricketing world eagerly awaits the India vs. Pakistan match, it's clear that not only the players but also experts like Aakash Chopra and Mohammad Hafeez are contributing to the excitement and anticipation surrounding the 2023 World Cup. Both India and Pakistan have commenced their campaigns with victorious starts, setting the stage for a thrilling encounter in the tournament.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 17:03:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"dnaindia","source_priority":18388,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a77344eddc7368829897870e38d905e0","title":"Papers: Man Utd boss Ten Hag at risk of losing right-hand man to Ajax","link":"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/20876/12984199/manchester-united-boss-erik-ten-hag-at-risk-of-losing-right-hand-man-to-ajax-paper-talk","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Saturday's newspapers...","content":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Saturday's newspapers...

Root may be just over 1,000 runs and three centuries adrift but the Yorkshireman remains in awe of Cook, who started and ended his international career with unforgettable Test hundreds against India. Joe Root hailed Sir Alastair Cook as the “greatest ever” after England’s record Test run-scorer announced his retirement from professional cricket following a 20-year career — PA Sport (@pasport) Root, currently in Delhi for England’s World Cup campaign, told the PA news agency: “It’s been a hell of a career. Clearly, what you did for England, we all know how special that was – a memorable finish and a memorable start. “Everything in between, you were the greatest ever. What you’ve achieved has been incredible. “To have had the opportunity to play so many Test matches alongside you, under your captaincy and even getting to boss you round a little bit at the end, was really great fun.” Cook continued playing for Essex after retiring from England duty in 2018 but his contract expired at the end of the domestic season and last month the 38-year-old elected against seeking a renewal. “It is not easy to say goodbye,” he said in a statement. “For more than two decades, cricket has been so much more than my job. 👑 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝗿𝗮. Alastair Cook has today retired from all forms of professional cricket. — Essex Cricket (@EssexCricket) “It has allowed me to experience places I never dreamed I would go, be part of teams that have achieved things I would never have thought possible and, most importantly, created deep friendships that will last a lifetime. “From the eight-year-old boy who first played for Wickham Bishops Under-11s to now, I end with a strange feeling of sadness mixed with pride. Although above all, I am incredibly happy. “It is the right time for this part of my life to come to an end. I have always given absolutely everything I possibly have to be the best player I could be, but now I want to make way for the new generation to take over.” Essex head coach Anthony McGrath had hoped “we’ll see him for a bit longer” as speculation swirled about Cook’s future after the Chelmsford club finished runners-up to Surrey in the championship. But Cook’s decision to retire ends a remarkable career which began in 2003, impressing enough for Essex to be drafted into the England set-up for the first of 161 Test appearances, making a century in the second innings against India at Nagpur in 2006. He went on to amass another 32 Test tons – an England record – and was part of Ashes series wins in 2009, 2010/11, 2013 and 2015, captaining them in the latter two. His 766 runs in the 2010/11 series saw him crowned player of the series and helped England seal a first triumph Down Under since 1986/87. Cook won 24 of his 59 Tests as England captain between 2010 and 2016 and skippered the ODI side between 2010 and 2014 before being unceremoniously axed just months before the World Cup the following year. He bowed out of England duty with a hundred against India at the Kia Oval in September 2018 and was given a knighthood for services to cricket a few months later in the New Year Honours List. “You knew if he got past 20 balls, you could wedge in and read the paper, do whatever you wanted to do and not worry about padding up,” Root said. “We never had much formula out in the middle in terms of any good chat or anything but he was always great to bat with and to learn from. “As a young lad coming into that team, to have his experience to learn from… you can’t buy that. They are things that aid you as a young player and speed up your development. “I’m very grateful for what he gave me and other young lads in my position. He’s been incredible for the game. It’s nice know you’ve made a friend for life.” After the end of a distinguished international career, Cook showed he still had plenty of appetite and was Essex’s leading run-scorer in their 2019 championship triumph, while he topped the charts in the Covid-shortened summer of 2020 to help his side go all the way in the Bob Willis Trophy. The last of his 352 first-class appearances – in which he registered 26,643 runs and 74 hundreds at an average of 46.41, fractionally above his Test mark of 45.35 – came against Northamptonshire a fortnight ago. In sharp contrast to his fairytale England exit, Cook made two single-figure scores. Cook – who thanked his family and the staff at Essex as well as mentor Graham Gooch in his farewell statement – added: “When I ended my international career, I had no idea that I would have five more bonus years playing for Essex. I cannot put into words just how much fun we have had during that time. “Playing a full part in the season when Essex won the County Championship in 2019 is one of my favourite achievements in the game. “I look forward to watching Essex continue to punch above their weight, hopefully winning many more trophies in the coming years. “Now, I hope the Bedfordshire Farmers will find space for a has-been ‘all-rounder’ somewhere in their lower order.”","pubDate":"2023-10-13 20:11:21","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17331061/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e10912a99ad25cef137d565464e526a4","title":"Cheruiyot’s date with Delhi, 13 years later","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/cheruiyots-date-with-delhi-13-years-later-101697221746100.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Kenyan 5,000m champion at the Rio Olympics is returning to road racing after the birth of her second child","content":"Vivian Cheruiyot raised her hand to shield her eyes from the setting sun.

The are bleak chances of rain during the fixture.","content":"The cricketing world's attention is firmly fixed on the grand stage of Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium, as India prepares to face Pakistan in a critical league-stage encounter of the 2023 World Cup. This match promises to be a spectacle of monumental proportions, poised to capture the imagination of cricket enthusiasts worldwide. Despite recent meetings in the Asia Cup, the anticipation surrounding this face-off is unparalleled, given that it unfolds in India's iconic cricketing fortress, the world's largest cricket stadium. However, amidst the fervor and excitement, there looms a cause for concern - the weather forecast. Evidently, there's a shadow of uncertainty cast by the potential for rain, which could potentially disrupt this highly- anticipated clash. The India Meteorological Department has issued a prediction of light showers on the day of the India-Pakistan World Cup match, albeit against a backdrop of dry weather in Gujarat for the upcoming days. Isolated areas in Ahmedabad district, including the city itself, may experience these light showers on October 14, with cloudy conditions expected to persist. The subsequent day could witness similar conditions, with light rain in Ahmedabad and other northern districts, such as Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, and Arvalli, as reported by Manorama Mohanty, director of the Meteorological Centre in Ahmedabad. As we witnessed during India's warm-up matches, predicting India's weather is a challenging endeavor, and rain showers can be uninvited guests at any time. So, what happens if rain plays the spoilsport in the India-Pakistan World Cup match? In the unfortunate event of rain disrupting this much-awaited encounter, both India and Pakistan will be awarded one point each. This outcome would thwart the aspirations of both teams to ascend to the top of the standings. The victor of this Saturday's game was slated to challenge New Zealand for the coveted top position. However, if the match is washed out due to rain, India will remain in the third position, while Pakistan will continue to occupy the fourth spot. Naturally, players and fans alike fervently hope that rain doesn't intervene and that they can enjoy a complete 100-over spectacle.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 18:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"dnaindia","source_priority":18388,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d7c406b052ae4911f2ddd1b6c96079fa","title":"Cricket World Cup 2023, India vs Pakistan: 'Rohit Sharma vs Shaheen Afridi Is Going To Be A Battle To Watch,' Says Sanjay Bangar","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/cricket-world-cup-2023-india-vs-pakistan-rohit-sharma-vs-shaheen-afridi-is-going-to-be-a-battle-to-watch-says-sanjay-bangar-2674952.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India will take on Pakistan at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-10-13 18:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","source_priority":5319,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"27e2c32cf7ca7a3405752f70e8225a76","title":"Shubman Gill could return to top of India order against Pakistan","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23855129.shubman-gill-return-top-india-order-pakistan/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Gill sat out India’s wins over Australia and Afghanistan after being laid low by a bout of dengue fever.","content":"India could welcome back Shubman Gill as they bid to continue their World Cup stranglehold over Pakistan in front of more than 100,000 fans and an audience of up to one billion viewers worldwide.

The controversy began when Hafeez voiced his concerns about the changing nature of pitches being used in the World Cup, a topic he discussed during a PTV Sports show. Hafeez's comments hinted at the possibility that pitch conditions could influence the outcome of the tournament, and he even suggested that the World Cup's organization could be questioned, depending on the pitch variations. Hafeez explained, \"There are three venues - Hyderabad, Delhi, and Dharamsala - where two matches have been played, and the pitch conditions have shown remarkable similarity in both games. If the pitch in Chennai, which was used for the India vs. Australia match, remains the same, it's understandable. But if there are even slight changes, it raises questions about who is running the tournament.\" He further emphasized that the International Cricket Council (ICC) should retain control over the pitches, free from any influence from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), considering it's an ICC event. Hafeez expressed concern over any deviations in pitch behavior and suggested that this could potentially mar the integrity of the competition. Aakash Chopra, in response to Hafeez's remarks, offered a compelling explanation. He pointed out that many cricket grounds in India now feature pitches made with varying soil compositions, including a mix of red and black soil. These different soil components, Chopra noted, contribute to variations in how the pitches play. Therefore, he argued that it should not be surprising if the same venue exhibits radically different pitch behavior throughout the World Cup. As the cricketing world eagerly awaits the India vs. Pakistan match, it's clear that not only the players but also experts like Aakash Chopra and Mohammad Hafeez are contributing to the excitement and anticipation surrounding the 2023 World Cup. Both India and Pakistan have commenced their campaigns with victorious starts, setting the stage for a thrilling encounter in the tournament.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 17:03:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"dnaindia","source_priority":18388,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
