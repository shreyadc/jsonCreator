The all-rounder — who has played two Test matches for Australia — admits constant uncertainty around the situation has taken a toll on his mental health as the virus decimates his BBL team the Melbourne Stars. Watch every game of the KFC Big Bash League Live & On-Demand on Kayo or catch up for FREE with minis on Kayo Freebies. Join Kayo Now > Twelve Stars players have tested positive, which left the franchise scrambling to even field a team for its past two games as grade players were promoted at short notice and players from around the country flown interstate to make up a starting XI. Multiple players at other teams have also tested positive and there remains uncertainty about how long the domestic T20 competition will be able to continue. Speaking after the Stars’ loss to cross-town rivals the Renegades on Monday night, Cartwright reflected on the difficulties he’s had getting his mind right to focus on cricket with so much Covid-related chaos going on around him. “I’ve never felt more vulnerable to a virus in my entire life and I never realised how much it was going to affect my mental state,” Cartwright said. “I’ve had form slumps and this ranks right up there with how I actually feel about going about my business day-to-day. “Myself and my wife have basically been locked up in our room, not sure if we’re capable of catching the lift in case someone in there might have caught (COVID-19). “Constantly, it’s on your mind and then you’ve got to walk out there and perform in one of the biggest pressure stages in the world. “My mental state wasn’t in a great place about coming to your workplace and Covid is basically running rampant. “I was really battling that throughout the day but once it got to about 4pm, all I was doing was trying to focus on the game.” Cartwright said if the BBL outbreak gets any worse, it’ll be tough for the competition to carry on. “We’ve got through these two games … I honestly can’t see it getting worse without the competition literally being put on hold,” he said. Renegades fast bowler Kane Richardson empathised with the Stars, saying: “If we were in that position with 12 guys out, I don’t know how we would put a team out on the park. “So hats off to them, but it doesn’t quite feel right. “As players, we’re all a bit unsure at the moment, and we’re trying our best not to get the virus, but if we do, we don’t know what the go is.” There has been talk Cricket Australia may consider putting all BBL teams in a Melbourne hub to ensure the season can continue. Captain Pat Cummins has revealed why a potential debutant was snubbed and who will replace Travis Head for the next Ashes Test. An England cricket great has ripped into Cricket Australia’s slow response to the Covid chaos wreaking havoc on the Aussie cricket summer. Brisbane Heat batter Sam Heazlett is wary of veteran Sixer Steve O’Keefe, who looks set to return from a calf injury for Tuesday night’s game.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"India vs South Africa: Virat Kohli participation in ODI series under doubt after back problem of 2018 resurfaces","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/india-vs-south-africa-virat-kohli-participation-in-odi-series-under-doubt-after-back-problem-of-2018-resurfaces-2425140.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli having troubles with his back isn’t a new thing.

Khawaja's return for his first test since 2019 was expected after Head was ruled out by a positive COVID-19 test but the retention of pace bowler Scott Boland was something of a surprise. Boland was considered a Melbourne specialist when he was handed his debut in the third test but the 32-year-old seized his opportunity with both hands. His six for seven in the second innings helped Australia to a thumping innings and 14-run victory and earned him the chance to keep his spot in favour of Josh Hazlewood, who is still suffering from a side strain sustained in the first test. \"It's no secret, if Joshy Hazlewood was available, he was going to play, he's been a brilliant bowler for us for a long time,\" Cummins told reporters at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the match starts on Wednesday. \"It would have been a real shame to see Scotty not play this week after his efforts last week. It's unfortunate for Joshy but I'm really glad (Scott) gets another crack out here.\" Cummins said Hazlewood would probably be fit to play in the fifth test in Hobart from Jan. 14-18. There had been suggestions in local media that leg spinner Mitchell Swepson might be awarded his first test cap in a twin slow-bowling attack with Nathan Lyon. Cummins, however, said he did not expect the SCG wicket to deteriorate sufficiently to make that a viable strategy. \"I don't think anywhere in Australia that I've played in the last two years has dictated a two-spinner,\" he added. \"He's a class bowler and we're itching to get him into the side one day. We think he will debut at some stage, most likely overseas.\" Australia lead the series 3-0 after wins in Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne. Team: David Warner, Marcus Harris, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Usman Khawaja, Cameron Green, Alex Carey (wicketkeeper), Pat Cummins (captain), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland.

India won the toss and chose to bat, seeking to set an imposing score on a wicket that was expected to be conducive to run scoring before deteriorating later on. \"First innings totals in South Africa are tricky,\" Ashwin told a virtual news conference. \"It's always a good thing to win the toss and bat first and you want to post a good score, in excess of maybe 260 or 270 which is around about what South Africa do when they bat first. They usually put on in excess of 250 and then dominated past test matches, so maybe we are a bit short. \"But with our entire bowling arsenal available tomorrow -- fingers crossed -- I think we can definitely make something out of the score.\" Ashwin was referring to concerns over Mohammed Siraj, who went off late in the day after pulling up in his delivery stride with a suspected hamstring injury. \"He’s had ice on hit but we have to wait and see. I’m hoping that Siraj can come out and give of his best,\" he added. Ashwin, who came in to bat at seven, was the second highest scorer in the Indian innings, hitting 46 runs off 50 balls in an attacking display. \"I didn’t have any intention of such a strike rate. When I went in, I hit a straight ball that I hit down the ground and then one I hit down the leg side. The balls all presented themselves and I responded,\" he laughed. \"There has no attempt to go there and play at that strike rate but sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn’t.

As part of the latest development regarding the much anticipated 15th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the Ahmedabad-based franchise have reportedly roped-in former Indian pacer Ashish Nehra as their head coach for IPL 2022. Ahmedabad will, alongside Lucknow join the eight existing IPL franchises to partake in this year’s IPL. The Lucknow IPL team has already announced former Zimbabwean skipper Andy Flower as their head coach followed by Vijay Dahiya and Gautam Gambhir as their assistant coach and mentor respectively for the upcoming season. Lucknow IPL Team appointed Andy Flower as head coach. Here are the words from him about new beginnings : “I am incredibly excited to be joining the new Lucknow franchise and I am very grateful for the opportunity. Since my very first tour to India in 1993, I have always love — Official Lucknow IPL Team (@TeamLucknowIPL_) January 3, 2022 The CVC Capitals- the ownership firm of the Ahmedabad franchise had landed itself in a bit of some controversy, after its alleged link with betting firms abroad surfaced post its successful bidding. It is worth of a mention that bidding/betting, unlike some countries, is not legal in India. The IPL Governing council, as a result had formed a committee to address the matter on December 4, with the aim hand a go-ahead to the franchise with the ‘Letter of Intent’. While the issue seems to be finally settled and the matter pertaining the franchises’ participation resolved, they have gone ahead with finalizing the names of their coaching and support staff for their debut season this year. Ahmedabad IPL team coaching staff 2022: Nehra head coach; Gary Kirsten likely to be mentor With Nehra’s appointment as head coach nearly confirmed, the reports also state that World Cup-winning former India coach Gary Kirsten will be the ‘Mentor’ of the franchise. Also, former England opening batter Vikram Solanki, is in line to become the team’s ‘Director of Cricket’. Nehra has earlier coached the Virat Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore where Kirsten was also involved for a couple of seasons. “As far as I have heard, they have signed Ashish as their head coach and someone who would be in overall charge of the franchise. Solanki will be the ‘Director of Cricket’ and also expected to double up as batting coach and Kirsten will be in a mentorship role,” a senior IPL source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. “The Ahmedabad franchise can’t announce it formally as it is a BCCI diktat and they can only make a formal announcement after they get the LOI. The head honchos of Ahmedabad franchise has already interviewed the trio and short-listed them for the season,” the source said.

Both the to-be debutant franchises were expected to announce their 3-draft in players by December 25 last year-the then deadline for submitting the names. But, the contentious aforementioned issue, which raised question marks on Ahmedabad’s participation in the league, meant that the date had to be postponed. Both the teams however, have reportedly named their 3 respective players who have been negotiated with before the mega auction which is likely to take place by the end of January.       The post Ahmedabad IPL team coaching staff 2022: Will Ashish Nehra be the head coach of Ahmedabad team in IPL 2022? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-03 18:39:22","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"\"Crucial, Crucial Cricket\": Irfan Pathan Lauds R Ashwin's 46-Run Knock","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/india-vs-south-africa-2nd-test-day-1-irfan-pathan-lauds-ravichandran-ashwins-46-run-knock-calls-it-crucial-crucial-cricket-2687103","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"SA vs IND, 2nd Test: Ravichandran Ashwin played a knock of 46 runs for India on Day 1 and was hailed by Irfan Pathan for his effort.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-03 18:07:35","full_description":"With the absence of Virat Kohli in the ongoing second Test match, India faced a major batting collapse against South Africa on Day 1 in Johannesburg. With the likes of Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara losing their wickets cheaply, Ravichandran Ashwin played a crucial knock that reignited hope for the visiting camp. The spinner registered 46 runs off 50 balls and also hit six fours during his knock. Speaking on Star Sports, former cricketer Irfan Pathan lauded the veteran's contribution and said that it was \"Crucial, crucial cricket for the Indian team.\" \"In between I thought his average could have been much more higher than 30 because he has the ability to bat. But he needed to show his method as far as batting is concerned and scoring some runs. And his 46 is very very crucial runs\", the former all-rounder said. Coming in at no. 7, the batter had to carry India from a precarious position with wickets falling quickly. \"It came at a time when India were in trouble and someone needed to use their experience. Ashwin used his experience very nicely. He just kept playing the shots because he knew even one ball will take his wicket and that's why he needed to play those shots which can get him runs\", said Pathan. \"46 is very crucial runs.\" Ashwin was eventually dismissed by Marco Jansen in the 61st over. Receiving a short ball, Ashwin top-edged it towards gully for a catch, which was completed by Keegan Petersen. After his departure, India lost its tailenders quickly and were bowled out for 202 in 63.1 overs. The hosts had a poor batting display with Rahane losing his wicket for a golden duck and Pujara could only register three runs. Other than Ashwin, opener KL Rahul played a noteworthy knock, registering a half-century. Jansen was in amazing form for the Proteas and took four wickets. Meanwhile, Kagiso Rabada and Duanne Olivier bagged three wickets each. In response to 202, South Africa ended the day at 35 for one in 18 overs at Stumps. The hosts lost the wicket of Aiden Markram in the final session with Mohammed Shami sending him back to the pavilion. Promoted South Africa currently trail by 167 runs. On Day 2, the visitors will be aiming to add more pressure on the batters and try to restrict them to a below-par total.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-01/gn1f1pr_ashwin-afp_625x300_03_January_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"England head to ‘special’ SCG Test in search of Ashes inspiration","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/england-head-to-special-scg-test-in-search-of-ashes-inspiration","keywords":["Ashes 2021-22","The Ashes","Australia cricket team","Australia sport","Cricket","England cricket team","Sport"],"creator":["Ali Martin in Sydney"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Ashes may be lost but there is still plenty to gain in the last two Tests, starting at a location which has witnessed plenty of England heroicsThe Sydney Football Stadium in Moore Park serves a decent reminder Australia is a country that rarely stands still.

Originally built in 1988, what appeared to be a serviceable venue has been bulldozed since the last Ashes tour four years ago and in its place an eye-catching new AU$828m replacement is approaching completion. Barely a stone’s throw from the latest sporting UFO to land on Australian soil sits the wonderful Sydney Cricket Ground, which despite being upgraded and swollen by way of capacity over the years still retains a sense of history. Its green-roofed 19th century ladies’ and members’ pavilions are untouched through their heritage listing. So, too, the old clock tower and an array of statues that denote past greats of the game. It remains a truly evocative place to watch Test cricket. Inspiration has been in short supply for England’s cricketers since they arrived for this pandemic-era Ashes tour in November and their issues have been myriad en route to 68 all out and 3-0 down with two Tests to play. But as they step out onto the cambered baize outfield, Joe Root hopes his men take in the surroundings, think of the charity angle to proceedings, remember past English success stories and realise how fortunate they all are to be representing their country during admittedly tough times. “It’s obviously a special Test match,” said Root, before training on Monday. “You’ve got the McGrath Foundation [raising funds for breast cancer support] and you look at some of the performances on previous tours, like the 2010-11 team winning here, how special that was and how it will live long in the memory of fans and players. “It was here [Darren] Gough got his hat-trick in 1999, too. It’s a venue where a number of special things have happened for England players and it’s an opportunity to do just that. For me personally, I’d love more than anything to walk away with a win. Personal achievements make you proud and it means you are pulling your weight. But nothing compares to winning a Test match and I’m desperate to do that.” If there is a positive to be found beyond the red lines on various lateral flow tests during a disrupted buildup, it’s that the tourists appear to have just about held together off the field while disintegrating on it. There has been grumbling about the Covid lifestyle and Stuart Broad has gone public with his annoyance at missing out on green surfaces in Brisbane and Melbourne. But any serious angst is yet to bleed out of the dressing room while Australia have been tearing them up with barely a sledge to be heard. Perhaps this should be a concern; a sign that a team which has been forced to plough through 21 Test matches since the start of the pandemic, compared to seven for their hosts, has now entered a dazed fug of mere fixture fulfilment. Australia are on a heady roll, their series win one of contributions throughout the team, and will be hard to stop now. Either way, performances in this fourth Test, followed by a fifth still slated for Hobart, may provide an answer as to the state of various minds among Root’s troupe. They may also serve to inform how much substance there is to all the private and public support for Root’s continuation as captain as he passes Alastair Cook’s record of 59 Tests in charge. The 31-year-old once again insisted it was a topic to be discussed at the end of the tour, but stressed his pride at being given the opportunity to lead “has not wavered from day one”, adding: “I’ll keep throwing everything I can into trying to give England the best chances of winning and give the best account of ourselves.” In the past week this has involved Root literally throwing everything he can at teammates in the nets due to the Covid-enforced absences of the head coach, Chris Silverwood, and three members of his staff. England’s opponents, though forced to bring in Usman Khawaja at No 5 after Travis Head tested positive for the virus , have had far fewer issues with which to contend, even if they have been ticked off for not drinking the official beer sponsor of Cricket Australia during the celebrations in Melbourne. Two days out from the toss neither side was giving much away selection-wise, other than the peripheral roles of Rory Burns and Ollie Pope at training pointing to more 12th man-duties and an unchanged England top seven. Unlike Haseeb Hameed, the opener sporting a new-look haircut in the nets as he readied himself for the latest encounter with Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc, the pitch was yet to receive a proper trim, and so the final spots among the two bowling attacks were still to be named. Gone are the days of Sydney being the ground where spinners lick their lips, however, with Nathan Lyon, one of a number on the books of New South Wales, averaging 40 with the ball here in Test cricket. As such, and with some rain forecast over the coming days, recent talk of the Queensland leg-spinner Mitch Swepson coming in to join him as a pairing in preparation for the upcoming tour of Pakistan seems optimistic. Instead, beyond a return for the experienced Khawaja, and with little reason to press Josh Hazlewood into service too soon after the side strain picked up during the first Test, Australia’s final decision appeared between whether to retain Scott Boland after his remarkable six for seven in Melbourne or return to the established pecking order by recalling the fit-again Jhye Richardson. With the latter’s last outing in Adelaide delivering a maiden five-wicket haul, it’s a good dilemma to have. England, meanwhile, were pondering a return for Broad in place of Ollie Robinson, who for all his obvious skill has looked heavy-legged at times. But ultimately the question will be whether their batting lineup can finally stand up to an attack that has been relentless from ball one of this uncompetitive series or find itself once again unsentimentally razed to the ground like the old football stadium next door.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e8ed900950d193e1282e2efda6e994b284d9a2e/83_484_5403_3242/master/5403.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab49b9135163610dbf8b513bc39ae96f","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Cricket-Olivier admits struggling on test return but still snags three wickets","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/01/04/cricket-olivier-admits-struggling-on-test-return-but-still-snags-three-wickets","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Fast bowler Duanne Olivier returned to the test arena with an impressive three-wicket haul on Monday as he helped South Africa to bowl out India for 202 but admitted he initially struggled to find his rhythm.

Olivier took 3-64 to help restrict India after they had won the toss and chosen to bat on the opening day of the second test at the Wanderers. Olivier took two wickets in two balls before lunch to provide South Africa with a sudden breakthrough and then added another wicket after tea as he played his first test in almost three years. It took him past the 50-test wicket mark in a reminder of the explosive qualities he briefly displayed in South African colours between 2017 and 2019. “To be honest, it felt like a debut and I was very nervous today,” he told a virtual news conference after the close of play on Monday. “For me it's just trying to have good energies on the ball and to put the team in the best position.” But he said he had battled to find his line and length as well as pace, with much expected of a player known to his team mates an ‘the enforcer’. The 29-year-old last played for South Africa almost three years ago before suddenly curtailing his test career by taking up a contract at Yorkshire as a Kolpak signee. Kolpak rules stated that the players belonging to the countries that had deals with the EU could participate in any cricket tournament in an EU country without being considered an overseas player. However, those who had signed Kolpak deals were no longer eligible to represent their own country in the international circuit. Olivier, who had exploded onto the test scene with 48 wickets in 10 tests at an average below 20, had framed his test cap following his move to Yorkshire -- thinking his days as an international were over. But when the England and Wales Cricket Board cancelled all Kolpak deals from last January due to Brexit, Olivier returned home to win back his place in the test side. He was handed a fresh cap on Monday as he was picked for the second test in place of Wiaan Mulder, and did not take long to again make an impression, even if he was not entirely satisfied with the day’s work. “I had certain patches that were good and certain that weren’t that good but there is the second innings still to come and it is there that I will look to do things better,” Olivier said.

South Africa have ended Day 1 of the ongoing second Test match against India at The Wanderers, Johannesburg on a high. In what came as a major blow to the Indian camp, their Test skipper Virat Kohli, was forced to miss the Test due to a lower back injury, which meant that KL Rahul had to take up the leadership duty. Having opted to bat, KL Rahul notched up a gritty half-century in his very first match as team India skipper, and his 12th overall in the longest format. Runs were hard to come by, courtesy a disciplined bowling performance by the Proteas pacers led by Marco Jansen who returned with figures of 17-5-31-4, including the wickets of both the Indian opening batters. The 21-year-old, along with the able assistance of Duanne Olivier (17-1-64-3) and Kagiso Rabada (17.1-2-64-3) bundled up the renowned Indian batting order sans Kohli for 202 in 63.1 Overs. Continuing with his decent run of form, Rahul was India’s top-scorer with a gritty knock of 50 (133), with the middle-order yet again failing to impress. Ravichandran Ashwin (46 off 50), coming in at no.7 made sure India did put on some fight to reach a respectable score.

As per Accuweather, the clouds will try to cast a dreadful shadow, but the overwhelming presence of the sun will make for an exciting day’s play at The Wanderers on Tuesday. The sunlight will evenly spread the stadium for most parts of the day, with clouds only dominating post 2 pm (local time). As far as the rain is concerned, it is unlikely to bring a halt to the day’s play with thunderstorms only predicted at around 6 pm local time. Another spell of rain is expected at around 10 pm. All in all, the second day’s play is highly unlikely to be interrupted by rain.   The post Johannesburg weather tomorrow: What is the weather forecast for IND vs SA Day 2 of 2nd Test match at The Wanderers? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-03 17:17:40","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"India vs South Africa, 2nd Test, Day 1: Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara Flop Show Continues As Ind.. - NDTVSports.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtdnMtaW5kaWEtMjAyMS0yMi8ybmQtdGVzdC1hamlua3lhLXJhaGFuZS1jaGV0ZXNod2FyLXB1amFyYS1mbG9wLXNob3ctY29udGludWVzLWFzLWluZGlhbi1taWRkbGUtb3JkZXItZGlzYXBwb2ludHMtYWdhaW4tMjY4NjgyMtIBqgFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtdnMtaW5kaWEtMjAyMS0yMi8ybmQtdGVzdC1hamlua3lhLXJhaGFuZS1jaGV0ZXNod2FyLXB1amFyYS1mbG9wLXNob3ctY29udGludWVzLWFzLWluZGlhbi1taWRkbGUtb3JkZXItZGlzYXBwb2ludHMtYWdhaW4tMjY4NjgyMi9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs South Africa, 2nd Test, Day 1: Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara Flop Show Continues As Ind..  NDTVSports.comIND vs SA: Twitter Bemoans As Cheteshwar Pujara And Ajinkya Rahane's Poor Form Continues  Cricket Addictor'They have one more innings to save their Test careers': Gavaskar gives his verdict on struggling Pujara, Rahane  Hindustan TimesIndia vs South Africa 2nd Test: Sunil Gavaskar Makes Big Statement After Another Cheteshwar Pujara-A..  NDTV Sports'Tumse na ho payega': Netizens slam Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane for repeated failures with bat  DNA IndiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-03 17:03:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Nehra all set to become head coach of Ahmedabad IPL team, Vikram Solanki to be ‘Director of Cricket’","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/nehra-all-set-to-become-head-coach-of-ahmedabad-ipl-team-vikram-solanki-to-be-director-of-cricket-7704623/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-03 16:39:31","full_description":"Former India fast bowler Ashish Nehra will be Ahmedabad IPL franchise’s head coach during the 2022 Indian Premier League season while England opener of yesteryears Vikram Solanki is in line to become ‘Director of Cricket’.

Cricket Australia said it supported ex-Australian U19 Jamie Mitchell, whose claims that he was raped on the tour by a team official were first reported by national broadcaster ABC on Sunday. “We acknowledge and applaud the courage of Jamie Mitchell in speaking out about his experience,” the governing body said in a statement, adding that it was “fully assisting” a police probe. “We have no tolerance for any form of abuse,” said Cricket Australia chief Nick Hockley. Mitchell told ABC he was sexually assaulted in Colombo on the last night of the tour in 1985. A team official named in the ABC report denied wrongdoing and no charges have been made. “Instead of being a highlight of my cricketing life, that tour has caused me trauma and distress over many years,” Mitchell said in a statement released by his lawyers to Australian media. “Cricket Australia has a chance to distinguish itself by facing up to this issue and doing the right thing. “And that means transparency, starting with proper answers to many questions. I’m going to send a list of them to Cricket Australia.” Former Australian captain Greg Chappell, who was a national selector at the time of the alleged attack, told Nine Entertainment newspapers that he was appalled by the allegations. Get closer to the stories that matter with exclusive analysis, insight and debate in The42 Membership. “I would hope that CA will respond in a human way and deal empathetically with the individuals rather than try to defend the organisation,” he said. “It was a shocking revelation. I would have hoped nothing like that had happened, but realism tells you that other areas of life have seen that sort of thing go on.” A spokesman for the Australian Federal Police said they do not comment on “specific investigations”. © AFP 2022","image_url":"https://c1.thejournal.ie/media/2022/01/das-logo-der-marke-cricket-australia-sydney-australia-630x939.jpg","source_id":"the42"},{"title":"Highlights, India vs South Africa, 2nd Test, Full cr..roteas post 35/1 at stumps on Day 1, trail by 167 runs - Firstpost","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiswFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maXJzdHBvc3QuY29tL2ZpcnN0Y3JpY2tldC9zcG9ydHMtbmV3cy9oaWdobGlnaHRzLWluZGlhLXZzLXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYS0ybmQtdGVzdC1mdWxsLWNyaWNrZXQtc2NvcmUtcHJvdGVhcy1wb3N0LTM1MS1hdC1zdHVtcHMtb24tZGF5LTEtdHJhaWwtYnktMTY3LXJ1bnMtMTAyNTIwMTEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Highlights, India vs South Africa, 2nd Test, Full cr..roteas post 35/1 at stumps on Day 1, trail by 167 runs  FirstpostRevealed: Here's Why Virat Kohli Isn't Included In The Indian Playing XI For The 2nd Test vs South Africa  Cricket AddictorRecent Match Report - India vs South Africa 2nd Test 2021/22  ESPNcricinfoIndia vs SA, 2nd Test, Day 1: Hosts trail IND by 167 runs  NEWS9 liveIndia vs South Africa 2nd Test Score Updates, Day 1 Highlights: South Africa 35/1 at stumps, trail India by 167 runs  Times of IndiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-03 15:44:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Saqlain Mushtaq conveys to PCB that he can't take up head coach job full-time","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/saqlain-mushtaq-conveys-to-pcb-that-he-can-t-take-up-head-coach-job-full-time-752567","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan interim coach Saqlain Mushtaq has informed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that he doesn't wish to take up the head coach job with the Pakistan team on a full-time basis over his personal commitments.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-03 15:11:42","full_description":"Pakistan interim coach Saqlain Mushtaq has informed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that he doesn't wish to take up the head coach job with the Pakistan team on a full-time basis over his personal commitments. According to a well-informed source in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Saqlain, who has worked as interim head coach with the Pakistan team since September, has informed PCB chief Ramiz Raja of his inability to take up the role full-time. “Saqlain told the chairman that while he was happy to have contributed as interim head coach he wouldn’t be able to accept a long term and permanent assignment as head coach as he had prior business and personal commitments.” “Saqlain conveyed that already his business has been affected due to his absence with the Pakistan team as interim head coach,” the source said. The 45-year-old former spinner was appointed in the interim role with the national team while working as a coach at the High-Performance Centre in Lahore after Misbah-ul-Haq and Waqar Younis suddenly announced their resignations as the head coach and bowling coach soon after returning from the West Indies tour. The source said that Saqlain had told Ramiz that he would continue to work as a coach at the High-Performance Centre as he wanted to remain based in Lahore but would be available for a short tour or series assignments. Both Babar and Saqlain had recommended having foreign coaches with the national team in the same meeting with Ramiz. The PCB has already given advertisements for five coaching positions including a power-hitting batting coach and head coach for the High-Performance Centre.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"India vs South Africa: Back problem resurfaces for captain Kohli after three years","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa-back-problem-resurfaces-for-captain-kohli-after-three-years-752566","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The upper back spasm that ruled Virat Kohli out of the ongoing second Test against South Africa in Johannesburg is speculated to be a slip disc problem.

The Indian player had earlier suffered a similar issue in 2018 that had stopped him from playing English County cricket. The Indian skipper missed out on what would have been his 99th Test match for the country on the morning of the second game against South Africa here, adding to the intriguing drama that is unfolding around him on an almost daily basis now. This was after the skipper had a good net session at the Wanderers on Sunday afternoon and coach Rahul Dravid, as is his wont is, didn't drop the slightest hint that the skipper has niggling back issues which have resurfaced after nearly three and half years. Kohli, in fact, had posted some snap-shots of his training session where he was seen lunging forward and playing the on-drive. It was obvious that he felt fine as he went through an intense net session only to develop discomfort on the morning of the Test match. Interestingly, his team Royal Challengers Bangalore had tweeted a picture of with a tweet \"The focus shifts to the Wanderers as #TeamIndia have a chance to seal the series.\" Nothing wrong with the tweet save the fact that it was posted 12 noon IST, at least one hour before Kohli's injury status was revealed at the toss by Rahul, who is not a part of the RCB set-up. Although to be fair to them, it didn't mention Rahul as India captain. Kohli having troubles with his back isn't a new thing. In 2018, he was suffering from a condition called 'herniated disc' (slipped disc) and was advised by the doctor to not play county cricket for Surrey if he wanted to be part of the Test series after that. The condition didn't warrant a surgery which could have ruled him out for good three to four months. A back spasm is a sudden tightness and pain in the back muscles. It may happen from overuse of a muscle or an injury. In case of Kohli, someone who is a fitness freak and pushes his body to the limits, the chances of back injury are always high and as one reaches mid 30s, the recovery takes more time. If Kohli recovers within a week to play the third and final Test in Cape Town it would then mean that it wasn't very serious, just like 's hamstring niggle that ruled him out of the Wankhede Test, a day after he had a full session at the BKC Indoor Centre. With India 1-0 up, Kohli must have wanted to play this game and get back to form which has deserted him for almost two years now. He was seen sombrely ambling around the Bull Ring before the start of the game and looked visibly disappointed on having to miss a game. If runs have dried up on the field, his off-the-field relationship with the BCCI hasn't exactly made matters easy for him as the establishment's poster boy isn't now on very good terms with the big wigs of the board. So much so that someone like Dravid, who always likes a healthy distance from controversies, acknowledged that Kohli is being \"phenomenal\" around the group inspite of all the \"noise\" around him. It was an admission that the feisty Indian Test captain is under pressure and perhaps a series win and at least one three-figure score or something close to it will remove a huge load off his chest. Kohli would have surely addressed the media before the Cape Town Test starting January 11 had it been his landmark 100th game in the traditional format. That's what Dravid had promised on the eve of the second Test. Once \"back spasm\" ruled him out of contention from the second Test, it does not exactly seem to be the best of times for the megastar, who is battling on-field issues as batter and off-field differences with the establishment. Now it can't be said with any degree of certainty that whether he would be in a mood to take questions from media ahead of his 99th Test. In any case, the degree of relevance between 99 and 100 is so vast, one can only wonder as to what exactly are the odds that he might not come. But then Kohli is a non-conformist and could do exactly what nobody is apprehending him to do. If India wins the series in South Africa, what's left to achieve for the maverick superstar. There could be some more surprises in store for cricket lovers and no one can quite guess at this point, what it could all lead to in the coming few months.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"Ranji Trophy to proceed as per schedule, confirms Sourav Ganguly","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-to-proceed-as-per-schedule-confirms-sourav-ganguly/articleshow/88671587.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sourav Ganguly on Monday confirmed that the upcoming edition of the Ranji Trophy will be staged as planned.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-03 15:09:19","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"toi"},{"title":"Marco Jansen height: How tall is Marco Jansen?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-marco-jansen-height-how-tall-is-marco-jansen/","keywords":["Cricket","India tour of South Africa 2021-22","india vs south africa","Marco Jansen"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Marco Jansen height: The stark difference between Jansen’s height and some South African players has become a talking point in the series.

During the second Test match between India and South Africa at The Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg, team India have been bundled up for 202 on Day 1 after KL Rahul opted to bat first post winning the Toss. The South African bowlers were right on the money in terms of their disciplined line and length and made sure the Indian batters had to break some sweat to get their innings going. Continuing with his decent run of form, Rahul was India’s top-scorer with a gritty knock of 50 (133), while the middle-order yet again failing to impress. Ravichandran Ashwin (46 off 50), coming in at no.7 made sure India did put on some fight to reach a respectable score. Playing only his second Test match for the Proteas, the tall left-arm pacer Marco Jansen was the pick of the bowlers, returning with figures of 17-5-31-4, including the wickets of the Karnataka duo and India opening batting pair of Mayank Agarwal (26) and KL Rahul. Jansen’s fellow pacers Duanne Olivier and Kagiso Rabada too chipped in with three wickets apiece to complete a dominant South African performance with the ball. Marco Jansen height Ever since he has made his debut at the Boxing Day Test in Centurion, Marco Jansen has become a talking point amongst the Cricketing fraternity for his tall height. While the game has witnessed aplenty tall, well-built fast bowlers over the years, the stark difference between his and the heights of his fellow team mates like Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma is worth a sight. It all perhaps started when Jansen went out to bat alongside Bavuma during the first Test at Centurion, and the fans couldn’t help but note the difference between the two in terms of their height. Jansen stands at 2.03 metres or 203 centimeters or 6’8 feet above the ground. It is worth mentioning that Jansen (2.03m) and Temba Bavuma (1.62m) is the tallest and the shortest duo respectively to bat together in South African Cricket history. Marco Jansen: 21, 6ft 8in, a left-armer, good pace and already being picked as no 7 in Test cricket. Has the making of an immense cricketer for South Africa — Tim Wigmore (@timwig) January 3, 2022 Some of the other tall-heighted bowlers in history over the years are Mohammad Irfan (2.16m), Boyd Rankin (2.04 m), Kyle Jamieson (2.03 m), Joel Garner (2.03 m), Morne Morkel (1.96 m) to name a few.     The post Marco Jansen height: How tall is Marco Jansen? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-03 14:59:50","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Watch: Mohammed Shami Traps Aiden Markram In Front Of The Wicket On Day 1 Of India vs South Africa 2.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtdnMtaW5kaWEtMjAyMS0yMi9pbmRpYS12cy1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtbW9oYW1tZWQtc2hhbWktdHJhcHMtYWlkZW4tbWFya3JhbS1pbi1mcm9udC1vZi10aGUtd2lja2V0LXdhdGNoLTI2ODY2OTfSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Watch: Mohammed Shami Traps Aiden Markram In Front Of The Wicket On Day 1 Of India vs South Africa 2..  NDTV SportsIndia vs SA, 1st Test, Day 5: Virat Kohli and Co. eye big win  NEWS9 liveICC World Test Championship 2021-23 Updated Points Table  Cricket AddictorTough-talking Elgar tells batters to put on their ‘big-boy pants’  The CitizenTwitter Reactions: KL Rahul’s gritty half century turns as a ray of hope in India’s dismal batting show on opening day  CricTrackerView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-03 14:56:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Duanne Olivier Completes 50 Test Wickets, Joins Elite List Of SA Bowlers","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/duanne-olivier-joins-elite-list-of-south-african-bowlers-after-completing-50-wickets-in-johannesburg-test-vs-india-2686606","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs South Africa: Duanne Olivier completed 50 wickets in Test cricket when he sent the struggling Rahane back for a duck off the very first ball.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-03 14:19:44","full_description":"South Africa has made a strong start to the second Test match against India in Johannesburg, riding on some good and disciplined bowling by its fast bowlers. Marco Jansen (4/31), Kagiso Rabada (3/64) and , Duanne Olivier (3/64) were outstanding as they picked up wickets at regular intervals to not allow the tourists to get into any rhythm. India's stand-in captain KL Rahul top scored with a knock of 50, but it was Ravichandran Ashwin's attacking 46 that helped India to 202, before being bowled out. While it was Jansen who picked up the crucial wickets, Olivier struck important blows for the hosts after stand-in captain KL Rahul and Mayank Agarwal gave the tourists a steady start. After the opening partnership was broken by Jansen, when he dismissed Mayank for 26, it was Olivier's twin strikes in two deliveries to send back Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajuinkya Rahane, that broke the back of India's batting. Olivier completed 50 wickets in Test cricket when he sent the struggling Rahane back for a duck off the very first ball. He would return to pick up the wicket of Shardul Thakur, who too was dismissed without scoring. Olivier thus joined Bert Vogler, Hugh Tayfield and the legendary Allan Donald in the third place among South African bowlers who have been the fastest to the landmark of 50 Test wickets, completing the feat in his 11th Test. The record belongs to Vernon Philander, who took just 7 Tests to claim 50 scalps. Shaun Pollock is second in the list as he took 9 Tests to reach the feat. Promoted The overall record belongs to Australia's Charlie Turner, who completed the feat in just 6 Tests.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-01/6mieit8_duanne-olivier-test-afp_625x300_03_January_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"}]}
