Cricket is about how you bat, bowl and field and I think that the way we batted, bowled and fielded all game is like the benchmark of the standards which we set. The energy throughout the whole week didn’t drop.” Stokes, who won the player of the match award, backed up his century with a Herculean bowling spell of 14 overs either side of tea. He dismissed the adhesive Keegan Petersen and Rassie van der Dussen in successive overs just after the break – after they had kept England waiting for 43 overs in a stubborn stand of 87 that gave nothing away. Rob Key: wrapped up in cricket’s cosy world but still England’s figure of hope | Barney Ronay Read more “When you are bowling with the older ball, when nothing is really happening, you have to create your own energies and your own theatre around that,” said Stokes. “It’s something I’ve done over my career with the older ball, just to try and run in and hit the wicket as hard as I can and try and make something out of nothing. Then let the new-ball bowlers take the rewards at the end.’ Once Stokes had seen off the middle-order resistance, the end when it came was rapid, with South Africa losing five wickets for seven runs in 30 balls. Jimmy Anderson and Ollie Robinson mopped up with the new ball to the glee of a raucous Old Trafford. Stokes had particular praise for Ollie Robinson, who was noticeably a stronger and fitter bowler than in his previous England incarnation seven months ago. “Robbo came into this game and showed his class. He’s also taken the criticism that he received, and flipped that around. We know what a good bowler he is but the question marks around his fitness and being able to maintain his energy and pace, he’s completely thrown that away now. “In private we had some conversations. He’s gone away, worked incredibly hard to get himself back here and I almost see that as a new start for Ollie Robinson. He’s a phenomenally skilful bowler but this game he showed we can throw the ball to him and get exactly the same in his third and fourth spell as we get in his first spell.” Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was praise, too, for Anderson, Zak Crawley, Ben Foakes and Stuart Broad – who took on the chin the decision to prise him away from the new-ball partnership with Anderson. “It is something I spoke to Broady about on the way back from golf, potentially giving Robbo the new ball because of the feedback we got from the Lions game. “For years Jimmy and Broady have taken the new ball and for Broady to understand the bigger picture about why I wanted that to be the option was an absolute credit to him.”","pubDate":"2022-08-27 20:12:11","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d885a82334f16448b58eb591d705f0f3eaf6ec0c/0_51_4482_2688/master/4482.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=652b4493b5c46c96525fe80558b0a4bc","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Private-school barrier?

Elite school cricket was and still is a major part of the Establishment. The longest continually contested game in any sport is the annual Eton v Harrow cricket match, which began in 1805 and had a slot at Lord’s every year until 2022. There is a record of Westminster playing Charterhouse in 1794, and Winchester has played Eton and Harrow since 1825. These games have always been more than sport. The historian J.A. Mangan has documented the relationship between games such as cricket, the Victorian public school and its role in imperialism. “Cricket was the pre-eminent instrument of moral training,” he wrote. Naturally, when Australians look at English teams, they notice the significant representation of the privately educated, from Harris and Jardine to Peter May (Charterhouse) and Ted Dexter (Radley) or Colin Cowdrey (Tonbridge) and Mike Brearley (City of London School) to Andrew Strauss (Radley) and Alastair Cook (Bedford School). Battle for cricket’s future has already been won but Tests can still retain their shine | Jonathan Liew Read more We identified the schools that 228 out of 255 (89%) England Ashes players attended in the post-war period. We classed those who started their secondary education at state schools before switching to a private school (like Joe Root, who moved to Worksop College aged 15) as state-educated, and those who spent the duration of their secondary school careers at independent schools as privately educated. Using this criteria, we classed 33% of England’s Ashes players as independently educated. The over-representation of private schools is striking – on average in the post-war era they have accounted for only about 7–8% of secondary school-age children. For children educated in the UK, the probability of playing in an Ashes Test for England was about six times larger if you went to private school. At times, more than half of England players were private school alumni – in 1950, twice in 1956, and once in 1961. It was not uncommon in the early post-war years for eight or nine of England’s team to have been educated at either private or grammar schools, typically with a fairly even split between the two. This all changed in the 1960s with the end of selective schooling in the state sector. By the 1980s – the era of Ian Botham and David Gower – most members of the team who had been educated in Britain were from state schools, generally comprehensive. A number of players educated overseas began to appear as well. The team for Botham’s Ashes in 1981 contained only two privately educated players – Mike Brearley and Gower. By the 1990s, England regularly put out teams that included more players educated abroad than educated at private school. The England team of 2005, who so memorably regained the Ashes, were largely a product of the comprehensive system, with a little help from overseas. The only privately educated players in that England side were Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell. Then, beginning with the addition of Alastair Cook, Matt Prior and Stuart Broad, private schools became more important. Throughout the 2010s there were either four or five private school graduates in every Ashes team; the last time there were fewer than four was in 2007. In 2013, an ABC article highlighted the “extraordinary” advantage enjoyed by English cricketers who went to elite schools. Journalist Steve Cannane’s piece contrasts the dominance of privately educated players in the England side with “the cricket curse facing private schoolboys” in Australia and asks “what private schools are doing wrong?” The ABC article spoke of a common perception in Australian cricket: if there is discrimination against children educated at a certain type of school, it is against those from private schools who, it is claimed, are widely derided as too soft. Ed Cowan is caught by Jonathan Trott at slip off the bowling of Joe Root during an Ashes Test in 2013. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Ed Cowan, who played 18 Tests for Australia from 2011 to 2013 as a top-order batter, is an old boy from Cranbrook School in Sydney (fees of $38,862 [£21,300] for senior day pupils in 2021). A prolific player in junior cricket, Cowan said that the Australian stereotype of players from elite schools lacking toughness counted against him. “Perception is often reality when it comes to selection,” Cowan wrote. “Throughout my career, even as a junior, I have battled against a perception that a kid who went to a good school and had a degree must be soft as butter … My upbringing and education in any other walk of life would make me an insider … In Australian cricket, it leaves me an outsider.” “In cricketing terms Ed Cowan comes from a disadvantaged background,” writes Cannane. “Despite having access to the best facilities and good coaches, cricketers from elite private schools across Sydney are up against it when it comes to making it into the Test arena.” When Cowan made his Test debut in 2011, The Australian’s headline read: “Ed Cowan smashes through the private-school barrier”. The article said, “There have been any number of conspicuous exceptions to the rule – Lindsay Hassett, Ian and Greg Chappell and David Boon springing quickly to mind – but broadly speaking the bluebloods of Australian cricket have tended to graduate from the blue-collar ranks.” Just how many exceptions to the rule have there been? We assembled the schooling data for Australian Ashes cricketers since 1945. We were surprised by the results. Australia has expensive private schools that charge handsome fees, just like England. Many of them have been around a long time: The King’s School, Sydney (1831), Launceston Church Grammar School, Tasmania (1846) and Hale School, Perth (1858). The majority of schools are state funded and non-selective. But there is a third category – Catholic schools. Apart from the religious element, these schools may look similar to the elite high-fee schools, but many charge relatively modest fees and are administered by the Catholic Education Office. Even so, they are certainly a form of private education. Perhaps surprisingly, about 35% of Australian children attend private schools, more than half of which are Catholic schools. One reason for this is the substantial government funding of schools outside the state system, which has expanded significantly since the 1970s. Accordingly, the share of privately educated students has risen significantly in the past 50 years – from around 25% to the current 35%. The percentage of privately educated children has been consistently higher than in England, where it has fluctuated fairly narrowly around the 7.5% level. A striking number of recent Australian players attended private schools. The list includes Pat Cummins, long ranked as the No 1 Test bowler in the world (St Paul’s Grammar School in Sydney, which charges $17,784 a year); James Pattinson (Haileybury City, Melbourne, $33,560 a year); Cameron Bancroft (Aquinas College, Perth – the same school as Australia’s coach Justin Langer, $17,991 for day pupils and $24,282 for boarders); the Marsh brothers, Mitchell and Shaun (Wesley College, Western Australia, $25,541); and new star Cameron Green (Scotch College, Western Australia, $28,600 for day pupils and $54,600 for boarders).

Ben Stokes: ‘It’s like you’re a glass bottle, holding everything in. Eventually, it smashes’ Read more To this list can be added Joe Burns, Chris Lynn and Mitchell Swepson (who all attended St Joseph’s Nudgee College in Brisbane within four years of each other, $16,300 for day pupils and $38,470 for boarders); Marcus Stoinis (Hale School, $26,910 for day pupils and $51,660 for boarders); Matt Renshaw (Brisbane Grammar School, $28,230) and Ashton Agar (De La Salle College in Victoria, $12,689). A few players attended religious schools with more affordable fees – Jhye Richardson went to Emmanuel Catholic College in Western Australia, which charges $7,073 a year; Travis Head went to Trinity College in South Australia, $6,930. But among players from private schools, more expensive and exclusive schools dominate. Since 1945, 31.4% of Australian Ashes players have attended private schools, barely different from England’s 32.9%. Indeed, there are actually more Tests where the Australian private-school graduates were in a majority – 13 times, compared to England’s four. In 77 post-war Ashes games (40%), the Australian team had more privately educated players than the English; in another 11%, the proportions were the same. Photograph: Bloomsbury From 2010 to the end of the 2019 Ashes, 45% of England’s Ashes players educated in the country were privately educated, compared to 44% of Australian Ashes players. So much for the Australian ‘private-school barrier’: Australian private schools are now comfortably producing a disproportionate share of international players. The Australian Test team is scarcely more blue collar than the English one. In both countries private schools are major nurseries of Ashes cricketers. An Ashes series limited to privately educated children would not look as different to the real Ashes as Australians might like to think.

Stokes’ life is so fast-moving that the documentary film about his life – released on Friday – could already do with an epilogue. At least time, Stokes appeared in less pain from his left knee than he did during another full-on spell at Lord’s. He said: “This was an amazing team performance, no-one has taken a backward step. “The way we bounced back from the disappointment of Lord’s was very pleasing. Cricket is about how you bat, bowl and field and the way we did that here was almost the benchmark for the standards we set. “Throughout my career, I’ve tried to hit the wicket hard and make things happen with the ball. I didn’t want to turn to Jimmy or Ollie with the new ball round the corner. I felt in good rhythm, that’s why I continued to bowl. “The style I play means I’m hopefully going to influence the game in a positive way. I know that when I bat or bowl well, it will go a long way towards the team winning. I like to create my own theatre.” Van der Dussen and Petersen batted throughout the afternoon session with plenty of skill and determination. Van der Dussen’s effort was particularly brave because he has a fractured left index finger and, such was the pain, he regularly removed his hand from his bat handle as he made contact with the ball. South Africa’s No.5 had was actually caught behind for 41 off Stokes before tea but nobody appealed. Replays showed a faint edge. But, in the first over after the interval, he edged Stokes again and this time there was no doubt. In his next over, Stokes got a ball to bounce alarmingly to the diminutive Petersen and Foakes snaffled the edge. The breach had been made and England went crashing through. Stokes finally excused himself from the attack after a spell of 14-3-30-2, with six of the overs before tea and eight after. The second new ball was due and James Anderson and Ollie Robinson did the rest. Anderson finished with three wickets and became the first quick bowler in history to take 950 wickets in international cricket (664 of them have come in Test matches). Robinson again looked the part as an England bowler and collected 4-43 with his repertoire of bounce, accuracy, probing lengths and movement. At the start of the day, Elgar, the batsman best-equipped to bat all day, was nailed by some Anderson brilliance – bowled by a ball slanted in after the previous two left him. Sarel Erwee was caught behind attempting to leave the ball and Aiden Markram aimed an ambitious drive at Stuart Broad and edged into the slips. Nobody was more relieved than Broad, who had bowled Markram in his previous over, only for the wicket to be ruled out because Broad narrowly overstepped for a no-ball. Once Van der Dussen and Petersen were dispatched by Stokes, the Proteas crumbled.

The build-up to the likely high-octane clash has been full of sweet gestures, as pictures and videos of the both the team players praising each other or being involved in friendly banters flooded the various social media sites. As for the Indian camp, the focus will yet again be on their former skipper Virat Kohli , who is set to play his 100th T20I today, while returning back to cricketing action after a month gap. Skipper Rohit Sharma was pretty much happy with Kohli’s preparation and the intensity during the training session ahead of the match eve. As for the Pakistan side, Babar Azam’s men had been handed a huge blow after their star left-arm pacer Shaheen Afridi was ruled out of the Asia Cup due to a right knee injury. While his shoes are too big to fill, the players are undoubtedly confident on the rest of the pace attack to deliver today. Speaking along similar lines today was skipper Babar Azam, who while admitting that Afridi’s absence might have left a noticeable void, but not deep enough to not stand a chance in front of the Indian batting line-up. Post the training session on Saturday, Babar motivated his fast bowlers to bowl in a manner similar to Afridi’s intensity and aggressiveness, and make sure that his absence is not felt at all. Earlier, while speaking to the entire unit, he also stated that nothing matters if the hard work put in during the practice sessions do not translate into similar performance on the field of play. “I know that our main fast bowler (Shaheen) is not with us, but don’t let his absence be felt on the field tomorrow, fast bowlers especially. Keep the belief just like he (Shaheen) does whenever he has played for Pakistan all these years. Wish you all the best,” exclaimed Babar as he concluded the brief meeting. ” “ Listen to the encouraging words from our captain #AsiaCup2022 | #BackTheBoysInGreen pic.twitter.com/odSavfgKO6 — Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) August 27, 2022 For more Cricket-related news, click here .","pubDate":"2022-08-27 18:30:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SL vs AFG, Asia Cup 2022: From Fazalhaq Farooqi’s opening burst to umpiring controversy - top talking points","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-asia-cup-2022-match-1-talking-points-fazalhaq-farooqi-nissanka-umpire-controversy/article65819791.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Team Sportstar  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan, Asia Cup: Here are the top highlights from Afghanistan’s resounding eight-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the opener at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai on Saturday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-27 18:07:42","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs PAK head to head in T20: India vs Pakistan head to head in Asia Cup records","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ind-vs-pak-head-to-head-in-t20-india-vs-pakistan-head-to-head-in-asia-cup-records/","keywords":["Cricket","asia cup","India","Pakistan"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs PAK head to head in T20: The SportsRush presents for you the Head to Head statistics for IND vs PAK Asia Cup 2022 match.

The second match of Asia Cup 2022 will be played between India and Pakistan in Dubai tomorrow. Needless to say, a high-profile contest will have attention from across the globe primarily due to the limited number of matches between these two arch-rivals nowadays. First Group A match in this 15th edition of Asia Cup will be played just over eight months after the last India-Pakistan clash. In what was an ICC T20 World Cup 2021 group match at the same venue, Pakistan had defeated India by 10 wickets to register a thumping victory. Overall, India have a superior Head to Head record against Pakistan in the shortest format. India’s domination over Pakistan is also visible from their Asia Cup results where India have won eight as compared to five Pakistani victories in 14 matches. Having said that, it is noteworthy that these two have faced each other in an Asia Cup T20I only once (India won by 5 wickets) six years ago. ALSO READ: India vs Pakistan All Match Result List With both these teams affected due to the absence of their pace spearheads, expect the batters to be wanting to leave a mark due to the same on Sunday.

While Bollywood tells make-believe stories, sport is very real; therefore, India-Pakistan cricket has long been portrayed as war minus the shooting. PTI Indian players arrive for practice There’s a rare condition called sleep inversion that affects certain individuals in which their waking patterns invert. They become temporarily nocturnal and sleep during the day. A similar pattern plays out when India play Pakistan at cricket . With no bilateral ties, the neighbours only face each other in multi-team events such as the World Cup, the Champions Trophy and the Asia Cup . For the rest of the year, when India is playing endlessly, there is discussion, debate, and no end of cricket analysis. Who should bat where, who should be dropped, what the bowling combination should be and everything in-between. When it’s time for India-Pakistan, the actual cricket takes a back seat in the lead-up to matches. In India, cricket and Bollywood are everyday metaphors for bigger things. While Bollywood tells make-believe stories, sport is very real; therefore, India-Pakistan cricket has long been portrayed as war minus the shooting. While this makes for a narrative that fits, the reality on the ground can sometimes be very different. In the neutral territory of the United Arab Emirates, where the Asia Cup is being played, India and Pakistan are in the same group and will play each other once, to begin with, and unless Hong Kong upsets either of these cricketing giants, they will meet again in the second round. There is the delicious possibility of the two teams meeting again in the final of the tournament. The running joke is that the Asia Cup is actually a way for India and Pakistan to play a three-match series, while the other teams fight it out in the rest of the competition. This is a touch disrespectful to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, who are not there just to make up the numbers, but it is clear what events are the cynosure of all eyes. On the eve of the match, Rohit Sharma, the captain, tried to turn down the rhetoric dial. “You guys can do all the hyping you want,” he told the media. “Our job as players is to go out there and try to win the game. This is the same for players from both teams.” A day earlier, KL Rahul, the vice-captain, took a slightly more realistic approach. “We can’t run away from the rivalry and emotion that comes through as a player. As youngsters, we’ve always looked forward to being in such clashes. When you get an opportunity to be in a clash like India-Pakistan, it becomes a game of bat and ball,” the Indian vice-captain said. “You see the opposition as opposition and try to be at your best, focus on yourself more than the opposition. You’re not going to worry about outside talk, vibe and emotions. Yes, you tend to give 10% more effort, but we still remain players, we all love this game, all of us have had similar struggles. After the game or before, everything goes away. You become normal people, learn from each other, share experiences. It’s always been friendly.” The game is a big one, obviously, especially given the stinging defeat Pakistan inflicted on India when the teams last met, also in Dubai, at the Twenty20 World Cup in October 2021. India had never lost to Pakistan in a World Cup before, and the manner of the loss was especially difficult for fans to take. Shaheen Shah Afridi chopped out the heart of the batting in an early spell, and India had no way back into the match. But, while the focus is on the first encounter against Pakistan, the tournament as a whole is a critical one for India. In the lead-up to the T20 World Cup in Australia, India are fine-tuning their combinations. Rahul recently returned from a two-month injury loss, Virat Kohli continues his search to find form and different options have been tried at different spots. How do India find a place for Rishab Pant, the only left-hand batsman in the top six? How do India squeeze in Dinesh Karthik, brought back to international cricket as a successful T20 finisher? Can Deepak Hooda get a look in after strong recent batting performances, especially as he brings handy off spin bowling to the party? The Indian cricket loving fraternity may be looking for revenge against Pakistan after the last loss, but, for the team management, the focus is looking forward, not just to this tournament, but the World Cup. “We’ve tried out different things because only when you do that do you get answers to the questions in front of you,” Rohit explained. While he would not publicly say whether these questions had been answered already, much will reveal itself when the team list for India’s first match is announced.

Sunday's clash in Dubai will see the resumption of the 'greatest rivalry' in the world of cricket when India and Pakistan open their Asia Cup Group A campaign. This will also be the first meeting between these two teams after facing off in the Men's T20 World Cup last year in the UAE, where Pakistan secured a resounding 10-wicket win over India, their first such victory in Men's World Cups. \"We can't say about tomorrow's match, that how the pitch will behave. It is for fast bowlers or spinners. Both teams are going to miss their quality bowlers. But I am hoping that whoever will fill the space of Bumrah will do his best.\" \"Every match and tournament is a fresh start, we don't borrow the burden from the past. We will focus on the match to win not on the opposition. Everyone in the team is quite excited. We will make the decision on basis of pitch behavior of today's match (between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan),\" said Rohit in the pre-match press conference. \"We will decide our course of action as per the situation on the ground. A new match is a new challenge. No point to think about the last loss, yes, we think about it and learn from our mistakes. This non-covid compliance scenario is going to help us and it is good for our mental health,\" added Rohit. On meeting the Pakistani fans during practice sessions, Rohit said it may be an unusual for the media, but for us, it is a normal thing. \"Yesterday, they were close to me, so I say high, as for us they all are cricket fans. Same as match hype or match tension, media makes the hype, but we play the game only.\" On India's opening pair, Rohit said, \"we tried many new things, new combinations. If we will not try how we can know our strengths and weakness.\" Sunday's match will see Virat Kohli playing his 100th T20I match, after the last playing in England in July. \"Virat is back after a break. Yesterday in nets he did amazing shots, it was really good for us as a team.\" On the question of bilateral series between two teams, Rohit said, \"It is in the hands of the Boards.

While the Indian players have played enough matches at this venue during the previous two IPL seasons, Dubai has been Pakistan’s second home, until international Cricket resumed in their country in 2019. Before the ongoing tournament opener between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka at this venue, the average score across the 75 T20Is here since 2009 stood at mere 144.6. Former Indian batter-turned-commentator Askash Chopra had, before the ongoing aforementioned clash at the Dubai International Stadium, mentioned that the pitch is likely to favour the pacers, while the spinners are likely to determine the match result. ALSO READ : Live telecast details of India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2022 match on Sunday His prediction was bang on, as the three Afghanistan spinners not only picked up four wickets amongst them, but also bowled at an economy rate of under six runs per Over. As for the pacers, the pair of Fazalhaq Farooqi and Naveen-ul-Haq struck three wickets with the new ball, to place Sri Lanka on the back foot early on. Thus, come tomorrow, expect the spinners to dominate proceedings yet again. But the likely absence of dew at the venue, will make way for an even contest with both bat and the ball.","pubDate":"2022-08-27 16:58:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SL vs AFG T20I Asia Cup 2022 Highlights: Afghanistan Thrash Sri Lanka, Win With 59 Balls to Spare - News18","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiyQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2NyaWNrZXRuZXh0L25ld3MvbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3JlLXNsLXZzLWFmZy1hc2lhLWN1cC0yMDIyLXQyMGktbGF0ZXN0LXVwZGF0ZXMtc3JpLWxhbmthLXZzLWFmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLXN0cmVhbWluZy1saXZlLWNvdmVyYWdlLXRvZGF5LW1hdGNoLXNjb3JlY2FyZC1kdWJhaS1saXZlbmV3cy01ODM1MjY1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"SL vs AFG T20I Asia Cup 2022 Highlights: Afghanistan Thrash Sri Lanka, Win With 59 Balls to Spare  News18Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan T20 Live Score And Updates, Asia Cup 2022 Live Telecast In India, Live Streaming In India, Asia Cup 2022 Live Score And Updates, SL vs AFG Live Score And Updates, Asia Cup 2022, Match 01, Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan  Cricket AddictorShould Afghanistan batters look to take on the Sri Lanka spinners?  ESPNcricinfo'Hosts' Sri Lanka welcome seasoned visitors in curtain raiser | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzSri Lanka vs Afghanistan, Asia Cup 2022 Live Score Updates: Afghanistan openers steal the show in run-chase  The Indian ExpressView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-27 16:56:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"James Anderson picks 950th wicket, records most international wickets by a fast bowler","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/james-anderson-950-international-wickets-mcgrath-most-fast-bowler-england-vs-south-africa/article65817409.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Team Sportstar  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"ENG vs SA: James Anderson broke Glenn McGrath’s record for most wickets by a fast bowler in international cricket with his 950th wicket at Old Trafford on Saturday.","content":"England’s James Anderson picked his 950th international wicket during the second Test against South Africa at his home ground in Old Trafford, Manchester on Saturday.

The much-anticipated Asia Cup 2022 has commenced, with Sri Lanka taking on the Afghanistan challenge in the first match of ‘Group B’, at the Dubai International Stadium . On a pitch which has generally assisted the bowlers, with an average score of mere 144.6 in the T20I format, Afghanistan skipper Mohammad Nabi did not hesitate to bowl first after winning the Toss. The pacers did not disappoint their captain one bit, as they got rid of the Sri Lankan top-3, within the first two Overs, and with only 5 runs on the scoreboard. Bhanuka Rajapksa did make use of all his experience with a fine 38 off 29 deliveries, but the rest of the batters in the order, were simply not up for the task, as the spinning trio of Mujeeb-ur-Rahman (4-0-24-1), Mohammad Nabi (4-0-14-2), and Rashid Khan (4-0-12-0) not only picked up wickets at regular intervals, but also kept the run-rate in check, with Sri Lanka, at the time of writing, struggling to get past the 100-run mark. Wickets continue to tumble in Dubai!! Afghanistan has picked the 8th wicket courtesy of some excellent bowling and much-better fielding, with two run-outs in two successive deliveries. 🇱🇰 – 69/8 after 13 overs #AfghanAtalan | #AsiaCup2022 pic.twitter.com/u4Oiyha9PW — Afghanistan Cricket Board (@ACBofficials) August 27, 2022 The straighter boundaries at the Dubai International Stadium are relatively smaller, at 65 meters across the vertical length. However, with around 80 meters on either sides of the wicket, the squarer boundaries are comparatively bigger, thereby allowing the spinners to give the ball a bit of extra air, and bowling them mostly away from the batters’ reach. Moreover, since the last year, no team has been able to breach the 200-run mark in T20Is, as chasing teams have dominated as far as the match results are concerned, especially in the past couple of years.","pubDate":"2022-08-27 16:00:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Asia Cup 2022, Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan Live Score: Fazalhaq Farooqi Stars As Afghanistan Roll Over Sri Lanka For 105 - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9hc2lhLWN1cC0yMDIyL2FzaWEtY3VwLTIwMjItc3JpLWxhbmthLXZzLWFmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLWdyb3VwLWItMXN0LW1hdGNoLXNsLXZzLWFmZy1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMzI5MjEwMNIBiQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9hc2lhLWN1cC0yMDIyL2FzaWEtY3VwLTIwMjItc3JpLWxhbmthLXZzLWFmZ2hhbmlzdGFuLWdyb3VwLWItMXN0LW1hdGNoLXNsLXZzLWFmZy1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMzI5MjEwMC9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Asia Cup 2022, Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan Live Score: Fazalhaq Farooqi Stars As Afghanistan Roll Over Sri Lanka For 105  NDTV SportsMatch Preview - Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan, Asia Cup 2022, Group B  ESPNcricinfoSri Lanka vs Afghanistan T20 Live Score And Updates, Asia Cup 2022 Live Telecast In India, Live Streaming In India, Asia Cup 2022 Live Score And Updates, SL vs AFG Live Score And Updates, Asia Cup 2022, Match 01, Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan  Cricket Addictor'Hosts' Sri Lanka welcome seasoned visitors in curtain raiser | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzShould Afghanistan batters look to take on the Sri Lanka spinners?  ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-27 15:56:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Disney Star bags ICC media rights in India till 2027","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/disney-star-bags-icc-media-rights-in-india-till-2027-2502528.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Disney Star won following a single-round sealed bid process which has yielded a significant uplift to the rights fee from the previous cycle continuing the impressive growth and reach of cricket","content":"The International Cricket Council on Saturday (August 27) confirmed Disney Star will be the home of all ICC cricket in India for the next four years having won the TV and digital rights to both men's and women's global events through to the end of 2027.

The highly anticipated battle for continental supremacy has begun, with Sri Lanka taking on Afghanistan from ‘Group B’ at the Dubai International Stadium . With chasing teams having won 13 out of the 14 previous T20Is at this venue, Afghanistan skipper Mohammad Nabi did not hesitate one bit, as he chose to field first post winning the Toss. “We want to bowl first here. It’s a fresh wicket, there’s cricket after a long time in Dubai. We have plenty of all-rounders,” said Nabi after the Toss. Conditions are likely to favour the fast bowlers. Stats also suggest that pacers do better at the Dubai International stadium…but today’s game might be about the spinners from both sides. Lots of quality against slightly mercurial batting line-ups. #AsiaCup #AFGvSL #AakashVani — Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) August 27, 2022 It is worth of a mention that the stadium is hosting its first T20I since the Australia versus New Zealand grand finale of the 2021 T20 World Cup. As per Khalid Al Zarooni, chairman of the board of Dubai Sports City, the Dubai International Stadium has a seating capacity for a total of 25,000 spectators, which can be extended to 30,000. While expressing his delight to host the ongoing Asia Cup 2022, Zarooni exclaimed, “We are delighted to host the 2022 Asia Cup, the second largest cricket event in the world. The gates will open three hours before the matches start. The ground has a 25,000 seating capacity, which can expand to 30,000.” As for the ongoing match, Afghanistan bowlers were right on the money with the new ball, as left-arm pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi dismissed Kusal Mendis (2 off 4) and Charith Asalanka (0 off 1) off the very first Over of the match. Right-arm pacer Naveen-ul-Haq, in the very next over got rid of Pathum Nissanka (3 off 7) as well, with the third umpire coming up with a controversial decision, reducing Sri Lanka to 5/3 in two Overs. However, with 20 runs coming off the final Over of the Powerplay bowled by Azmatullah Omarzai, Sri Lanka finished the phase on a stronger note, posting 41/3 after six Overs.","pubDate":"2022-08-27 14:52:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Disney Star Wins TV, Digital Rights For ICC Events In India From 2024-27","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/disney-star-wins-tv-digital-rights-for-icc-events-in-india-from-2024-27-3292364","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Disney Star has won the TV and digital rights for all International Cricket Council (ICC) events from 2024 to 2027, the sport's governing body confirmed on Saturday.","content":"Disney Star has won the TV and digital rights for all International Cricket Council (ICC) events from 2024 to 2027, the sport's governing body confirmed on Saturday. \"The International Cricket Council today confirmed Disney Star will be the home of all ICC cricket in India for the next four years having won the TV and digital rights to both men's and women's global events through to the end of 2027,\" the ICC said in a statement.
