Both teams came through the World Cup Qualifier where Sri Lanka beat the Netherlands twice in the Super Six (by 21 runs) and the final (by 128 runs). But Saturday’s fixture isn’t going to be all that easy for Sri Lanka who find themselves as the only team of the ten without a win in the World Cup. Netherlands skipper Scott Edwards made no bones about what they intend on achieving at the World Cup. “After qualifying we were pretty quick to set our minds to what we wanted to do at this tournament. We weren’t coming here just to have fun and enjoy it. We’re here to win games of cricket and give ourselves the best chance to make that next stage. South Africa is obviously a very strong side and they’ll be close to that semi-final spot. If we want to be amongst it, we’ve got to beat sides like this,” said Edwards who played a crucial part in Netherlands victory over South Africa with a match-winning knock of 78* off 69 balls that saw them lift themselves from a disastrous 82-5 to a challenging 245-8. “As a group we pride ourselves on playing total cricket which is, guys that are coming in at numbers 8, 9, 10 have just as much of the ability to put on those partnerships. But out there batting with them, it was just about giving ourselves a chance to go harder, later in the innings. And luckily enough, Roelof and Aryan in there played some unbelievable cameos to get us to what we thought was probably a roundabout par score.” The most notable aspect of Netherlands’ lower order batting was that they were able to sneak in extra runs converting ones into twos and twos into threes. “I think a lot of that goes down to our S&C [strength and conditioning] sort of work that the guys put in. It’s a brand of cricket that we want to play. And to be able to play that, guys have got to be fit enough,” said Edwards. “Most teams around the world are, but that’s definitely one of the focus points we have and they’re always nice when you can sneak a few runs here and there.”","pubDate":"2023-10-18 21:34:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"fab4f97b9edcec4505e967e86254f7fa","title":"Clinical Black Caps rout Afghanistan by 139 runs","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Clinical-Black-Caps-rout-Afghanistan-by-139-runs/23-754229","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"New Zealand came up with another thoroughly professional and clinical display to rout Afghanistan by 149 runs at Chepauk Stadium and maintain their unbeaten run in the Cricket World Cup. It was New Zealand’s fourth win in as many matches and saw them perched on top of the standings with eight points. However, their remaining matches are against tough opponents India, Pakistan, Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka. After New Zealand had run up a respectable 288, Afghanistan’s batting simply folded up for 139, their second lowest total in World Cups. Lockie Ferguson and Mitchell Santner picked up three wickets apiece and Trent Boult two as the Afghanistan batting got nowhere with the New Zealand bowlers maintaining tight lines and lengths. Of the 208 balls the Afghanistan innings lasted, there were 128 dot balls with only 11 fours and two sixes being struck. Top scorer was Rahmat Shah with 36 off 62 balls. New Zealand put into bat first, slipped from 109-1 to 110-4 losing three wickets for one run in eight balls as Azmatullah Omarzai struck twice in one over to get rid of two set batters, Rachin Ravindra (32) and Will Young (54) who both had lives early in their innings. When Rashid Khan had Daryl Mitchell caught for one, New Zealand’s innings was wobbling. The Afghan spinners were disciplined with their bowling, but the fielders let them down as they put down Glenn Phillips and Tom Latham and allowed them to consolidate with a partnership that produced 144 runs. Rashid Khan could have had four wickets but ended with just one, as New Zealand found an ideal launch pad to attack at the death. Although Naveen-ul-Haq claimed the wickets of both set batters Phillips for 71 off 80 balls (4 fours, 4 sixes) and Latham for 68 off 74 balls (3 fours, 2 sixes) in one over later on, Mark Chapman came in and swung freely, his late cameo helping New Zealand to finish with 288-6. New Zealand showed how to put a good total on the board in the old-fashioned way of ‘keep wickets in hand until the 40th over’ approach even after momentary setbacks. Scores: New Zealand 288-6 (50) (Devon Conway 20, Will Young 54, Rachin Ravindra 32, Tom Latham 68, Glenn Phillips 71, Mark Chapman 25*, Naveen-ul-Haq 2/48, Azmatullah Omarzai 2/56) Afghanistan 139 (34.4) (Rahmat Shah 36, Azmatullah Omarzai 27, Trent Boult 2/18, Mitchell Santner 3/39, Lockie Ferguson 3/19)","pubDate":"2023-10-18 21:34:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"2379a179e01b87e3a5ced4f454a0b5c7","title":"Papers: Newcastle weigh up move for Leverkusen striker Boniface","link":"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/20876/12987308/newcastle-weighing-up-move-for-bayer-leverkusen-striker-victor-boniface-paper-talk","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Thursday's newspapers...","content":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Thursday's newspapers...

Shakib was injured while running during the match. He bowled his quota of ten overs, but it was evident that he was in pain. After the game, he didn't turn up for the post-match interaction. During the pre-match press conference Hathurusingha was quizzed about the availability of the experienced all-rounder to which he replied, \"If he is not ready to play, we won't risk him. But if he's ready, then there's a chance of him playing tomorrow.\" \"He had a good batting session yesterday and did a little bit of running between the wickets. We did a scan today, so we are waiting for the results. At the moment he is okay. We haven't tried with bowling yet. So, he will come tomorrow morning and we will assess him again and then make a decision,\" Hathurusingha added. Bangladesh have had concerns in the batting department as they have struggled to put up runs on the board in the ongoing World Cup. With the Pune track promising to be a batting-friendly pitch, Hathurusingha talked about the approach that their team will look to opt for. \"Yeah, this wicket is probably the best batting wicket we came across so far. And even the practice wickets were similar, really good. We had a really good net session yesterday. As you rightly said, we haven't put up complete batting performance, or to that matter, complete performance with the ball and bat so far. So, we are expected to do as a complete performance. And we know that when we play as a team and we perform to our capabilities and we have beat big teams. We have done well in the past.

Stalwart batter Virat Kohli who is well known for his refined batting skills, has been a crucial figure in the field as he tops the chart of players with the biggest impact on the field after the conclusion of the first three games for each country. Kohli has completed a total of three catches in India's three World Cup 2023 matches. He is two shy of tournament leaders for non-wicket-keepers Matt Henry of New Zealand and Australia's experienced opener David Warner . However, his impact on the field stretched much further than that. Kohli is in a league of his own on the list of runs saved and pressure ratings after the conclusion of three matches for all teams at the event and his total of 22.30 points allows him to sit comfortably at the top spot for fielding impact at the World Cup. Kohli's closest competitors are a pair of star batters, with former England skipper Joe Root (four catches) and David Warner (five catches) at the second and third spots respectively. Ishan Kishan is the second Indian player who features in the Top-10 list with a tally of 13 points. For Pakistan, Shadab Khan features in the Top-10 list in the fifth spot with 15.13 points. Overall, India's performance in the field has been the one to watch out for. Indian fielders have claimed 14 catches in the tournament and saved a total of 10 runs. Till now, the Indian team has dropped two catches on the field, with defending champions England (1) the only side to have dropped less number of catches.

Upon the squad's return from France after their disappointing quarter-final defeat to Argentina, Gatland held court with the media to discuss his future and his plans to improve Wales even further over the next four years.

WG: “Mixed. I’m proud of where we’ve come from and what we've achieved as a group. I’m disappointed with the Argentinian result. I don’t want to take anything away from Argentina. \"Their game management was better than ours. They’ve outkicked us and kicked double the lengths of kicks. We created opportunities and missed a few lineouts and there were too many turnovers for us in the game as well. \"I’m disappointed because I thought the way we progressed we didn’t quite match it against Argentina. On reflection that’s where we are at the moment but we’ve seen where we can potentially get to.\" Q: How long does the pain last after a defeat like that? WG: “It’ll take a little bit of time. I tend to be OK after a game but two or three days later I tend to feel either the elation or the disappointment. \"We did have a chance but we weren’t quite there. We will take a lot of learnings from this disappointment. Read my weekly column in our rugby newsletter \"For us the benchmark of how to manage the game against Australia was outstanding. The question is how do we get to a place where we can do that consistently.\" Q: Do you want to stay on as Wales head coach for the next four years? WG: \"Absolutely. I was asked about that and said didn’t know what was in my contract. Had a joke with Nigel (Walker) before and said 'You can't get rid of me'. \"I think my contract said if we didn't get out of the pool they had a clause that said they could get rid of me. I said 'if you do want to pay me off that's up to you'. \"I'm excited about what we can start doing as a group. We've got an opportunity to bring some youngsters in and build on the cycle to 2027 with players having 50, 60, 70 caps behind them. \"There's an opportunity for us to build some closer relationships with the regions and some of the changes with coaches and personnel there. I'm excited by that because that hasn't always been the case in the past. \"Often those relationships have been quite fractured, not only from a coaching perspective but the things that were going on between the regions and the unions and we got dragged into those sort of things. That's really encouraging to getting on the same page and working with the same players. \"We have shown that we can improve and we have got an opportunity to play at a higher level. We want to work with them and keep building confidence. It's going to be incredibly important to us to keep players in Wales, to be part of something with their regions and also play international rugby. \"We've had a few conversations with players whose contracts are up. I'm saying to them the best thing for them is to stay in Wales and they can be looked after to get the best possible out of them in terms of playing international rugby. In order to do that we're progressing and performing at regional level too.\" Q: Do you want to take Wales on to the next World Cup? WG: \"That's the plan. When you look at it we've got such a small playing base we've got to look at how we bring these youngsters on and develop the Sam Costelow, Taine Plumtree, Jac Morgan - who I thought was outstanding and would have learned a lot from his leadership role - Aaron Wainwright is still a youngster at 26, we've got some exciting second-rows and backs coming through. \"When you look at the potential we've got as a nucleus, and some in the 20s as well, we can be really excited what we can achieve over the next three or four years.\" Q: Warren, how do you make sure things don't regress when you've got less time? WG: \"That's always the challenge. I would encourage the players to go back with a strong voice about the things they've learnt. \"I've said that in the past even when I was coaching Wasps I'd ask the English players what have you learnt and what can you bring to our environment to make us better as a group. \"That can work both ways. If things are going well at a region and a player comes in and say this is what we've been doing, we are more than comfortable to implement that into our pathway or our programme. \"Those are the sorts of things we will have to be comfortable with. It's not just about me or the head coaches at the regions, it's a collective responsibility about how we can all get better, and how we can all have an input about how those sort of things happen. \"When I say we weren't ready for a quarter-final there's not a lot of players in the squad who would have been a part of knockout football. The more we get an opportunity to be a part of a quarter-final or semi-final, you get more comfortable with that. \"We are starting from a relatively low base but everyone is well aware we've got to have a significant amount of improvement in the whole game here in Wales if we are going to be successful. That's not always about winning everything it's about overachieving. \"We are disappointed we didn't get to the semi-final although we are happy we got out of our pool but we want to do better. I think the regions have to put in the hard work at getting better, and making play-off stages to continue to develop players.\" Join the Wales Rugby WhatsApp community The Wales Rugby breaking news and top stories WhatsApp community has launched - and thousands of fans have already joined.

The backroom staff that I've got at the moment, everyone is on different cycles. \"It's about sitting down with them and talking with them along with talking to Nigel and the union about how we potentially go forward on those same contract cycles. I've seen a huge amount of growth from the staff since the Six Nations in terms of the work and effort they've put in and what we've learnt as coaches and the relationship we've developed over the last four or five months. \"It's been extremely positive and we can see it from certain aspects of the side where coaches have got a lot more confident in this pressure cooker environment and also working with the players.\" Q: How do you manage the process with the older players over the next few years in terms of bringing in the next generation? WG : \"It's looking at that age profile and looking at 2027 and thinking who in your mind is definitely not going to get there. Are there one or two who are part of the transition in terms of helping bringing youngsters through who have got that experience over the next 12 months or so. \"It's going to be a balancing act for us. I have spoken to some of those older players in terms of what their plans are and where they see themselves over the next couple of years. Some will continue to want to play regional rugby and still be available. It's just making sure we have honest and open conversations about what is going to happen. \"That's going to happen over the next couple of months. I spoke to Taulupe (Faletau) before he left France and I said get that arm fixed and then we'll sit down to talk about what you want to do over the next few years in terms of your playing. \"It's making sure we get it right. We are aware we need to give those youngsters opportunities. They need time in the middle and I don't want to leave some of them with not playing much international rugby over the next couple of years and then trying to get them up to speed in a short period. \"That's something there'll be some positive discussions around but every individual will be treated a little bit differently.\" Q: Do you think with a better relationship with the regions more promising youngsters will get given an opportunity? WG: \"It has been frustrating in the past because we’ve identified some talent and had to use the international stage to develop them. Things have changed and there are now fewer overseas players at the regions. \"The salary cap and everyone having to be conscious on the amount of money being spent on players to keep within budgets is a positive for younger players. They are going to get more opportunities at their regions. \"It was a cycle that we went through for a number of years when we had some talented players coming out of the U20s who would then move into the regional programme. If they weren’t quite ready for regional rugby it meant the youngsters wouldn’t get a chance because of the pressure on coaches to get results. \"Then they get to 23 and they’ve only played a dozen to 15 games. His agent would then knock on the door when the contracts were up for renewal and ask for a bit more money. They wouldn’t then give them any more and the coaches would go back to another 19-year-old. \"We saw that cycle for a long time when they didn’t get the chances. The regions need to give their youngsters opportunities and I think they will now do that. Do they have talent? Yes; will they make mistakes? Yes; do you have to go through some pain with them? Absolutely. My biggest argument in the past was we were signing overseas players of 27-28 who had played Super Rugby or provincial rugby and at the time were better than those youngsters. \"As result we didn’t see some of that development in them. We are in a position now where there aren’t anywhere near as many foreign players and the regions are having to be more proactive in developing their youngsters. I’d like to see them come through.\" Q: Do you support more opportunities for Tier Two nations? WG: \"I thought Portugal were one of the teams of the tournament. They were absolutely outstanding in the way they played. \"They benefitted from having a number of players coming from their sevens programme. They were a tough team. I didn’t realise until afterwards that the pool we were in was pretty even. The score we put on Georgia was the biggest amount of points they had conceded since the 2019 World Cup. They just need to play more rugby at a high level. Even the Uruguay game against the All Blacks was 0-0 after 20 minutes. \"You can see what those team can do when the adrenalin is pumped up. The difficulty for them is sustaining it beyond the 60-70-minute mark. They just need the chance to play against the best. \"When I first came to Wales, Roger Lewis asked me who do you want to play, I just said that any time you get the chance to play against a southern hemisphere side just jump at it. The only way we are going to get better is by playing against the best. \"World Rugby has that responsibility to grow the game and maybe we all need to be a bit more open minded in the future about what happens to the Six Nations. Can that grow a little bit, or how do we run the Tier 2 Six Nations with the possibility of relegation and promotion moving forward? \"There is a lot of money and jeopardy involved in that, but if we aren’t ambitious in terms of growing the game then we will continue to have the same top teams dominating. As a sports fan you want to see upsets. \"We’ve seen that at the Cricket World Cup with the Netherlands beating South Africa and Afghanistan beating England. Because of the regular fixtures they’ve had against the bigger nations we have seen them develop. In some way we need to follow the same model to keep developing the Tier Two nations.\" Q: Will you appoint co-captains again? \"I felt they both did outstanding jobs in their roles. I haven’t thought further ahead on that. Jac Morgan was absolutely outstanding. One of the questions I asked myself afterwards was did we get the No 6 and No 7 combination right in the quarter-final. \"It was quite a big debating point among the coaches. Jac was one of the best 7s at the World Cup and we took him away from that and put him in the number six role. Being the sort of person he is he was comfortable in doing that. I saw some huge growth in him as a captain and a player. \"As a captain, he is only going to get better. It was a little bit tougher for Dewi Lake in only starting one game. He didn’t have as much responsibility, but he was fantastic in the way he supported Jac. I haven’t thought about what happens moving forward. \"At the time having two youngsters who were respected by an older group of players who they supported, fitted for us at the World Cup. It’s the first time I’ve done that, and I’m probably not in favour of doing that unless it is required again. We will probably go back to the one-captain scenario.\"","pubDate":"2023-10-18 17:54:30","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article27936425.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1735439453.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","source_priority":16103,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7f0a4d39bf72d6d33fc5db3003d7cb87","title":"India vs Bangladesh World Cup 2023: ODI Records, MCA Stadium Records, Top Indian Batter, Bowler, Head-to-head","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/india-vs-bangladesh-world-cup-2023-odi-records-mca-stadium-records-top-indian-batter-bowler-head-to-head/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":[""],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Bangladesh World Cup 2023: ODI Records, MCA Stadium Records, Top Indian Batter, Bowler, Head-to-head","content":"India vs Bangladesh World Cup 2023: India have contested 7 matches at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium.

Babar, who scored an anchoring half-century against arch-rivals India on Saturday, got the reward for his performance as he kept India’s batting prodigy Shubman Gill at bay. The right-handed Indian batter is ranked second with 818 rating points, in touching distance with Babar Azam, who occupies the top position with 836 points. Meanwhile, Pakistan opening batters Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq, who were recently among the Top 10 batters, are now ranked 13th and 10th respectively. In-form South African opener Quinton de Kock, who scored back-to-back centuries in the ongoing ICC World Cup 2023 pipped his teammate Rassie van der Dussen to claim the third position in the rankings. Indian captain Rohit Sharma made a big leap of five places to sixth after amassing 131 runs against Afghanistan then backing it up with an imperious 86 from 63 balls against arch-rivals Pakistan. Afghanistan opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz — jumping 19 spots to 18th — and Netherlands captain Scott Edwards — climbing 16 places to 27th — made notable surges in the batting rankings. In the ICC ODI bowling rankings, however, experienced New Zealand pacer Trent Boult is in touching distance to occupy the top spot following a destructive spell against Bangladesh. He is a mere one rating point behind leader Josh Hazlewood after ascending a place in the latest update. Boult, who returned figures of 2/45 against Bangladesh after also dismissing Towhid Hridoy, also completed 200 wickets in ODIs. Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan climbs to fourth in bowling rankings while South Africa’s Keshav Maharaj jumps seven spots to equal fifth alongside Mujeeb Ur Rahman.","pubDate":"2023-10-18 17:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","source_priority":1484530,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7205846342c4ac5b048b30d1d10678e2","title":"Pakistan ‘under extra pressure’ in India with no fans","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/pakistan-under-extra-pressure-in-india-with-no-fans/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"BENGALURU (Agencies): Pakistan paid a heavy price for being “under extra pressure” in their World Cup defeat by arch-rivals India, said batsman Saud Shakeel, who Wednesday lamented the absence of the team’s passionate supporters from the tournament.

Pakistan were thrashed by seven wickets on Saturday at Ahmedabad’s 132,000-capacity stadium where there was only a handful of Pakistani supporters. Babar Azam’s team slumped from a solid 155-2 in the 30th over to be dismissed for a paltry 191. “I think we were under extra pressure so we tried to get out of that and wanted to play shots,” Shakeel told AFP on Wednesday. The smattering of Pakistani fans at the game were expatriates from the United Kingdon and United States. Supporters from across the border are effectively banned after a failure to gain visas. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday lodged an official complaint with the world governing body over the visa delays which have also kept many members of the country’s media at home. The PCB also complained over what they described as the “inappropriate behavior” of Indian fans toward the Pakistan squad at the Ahmedabad game. “When you have your crowd then you get the support. We did not get that and it was not in our hands,” added Shakeel. Despite an eighth loss in eight World Cup meetings with their arch-rivals, Pakistan are still well-placed in the tournament after wins over the Netherlands and Sri Lanka. Middle-order batsman Shakeel scored 68 against the Netherlands before making 31 in the game with Sri Lanka. He was out for just six against India. Next up for Pakistan is another high-profile duel, this time with five-time champions Australia in Bengaluru on Friday. “The mistakes we committed in the last game, we must overcome them. That match is gone. If we win against Australia then our position will get better,” added Shakeel. “Australia are always good in the World Cup. They are a very good side. We know our strong areas and we must play good cricket.” “We had a good start to the tournament with two wins. We want to go match by match and not commit the mistakes we did against India.” On Wednesday, all the Pakistan players with the exception of Mohammad Haris trained in Bengaluru. Haris is still suffering from a fever which laid low many of the squad when they arrived from Ahmedabad. Star fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi and opener Abdullah Shafique were the worst hit but were present in the nets at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.","pubDate":"2023-10-18 17:12:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","source_priority":1484530,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"5ef2b15b85a168bed4f47254a5a63dfa","title":"Netherlands’ skipper fires a warning to his opponents","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Netherlands--skipper-fires-a-warning-to-his-opponents/23-754233","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"LUCKNOW: Netherlands is going to be Sri Lanka’s next opponents in the ongoing Cricket World Cup and following their shocking win over South Africa on Monday at Dharamsala will certainly have their tails up coming into this game. Both teams came through the World Cup Qualifier where Sri Lanka beat the Netherlands twice in the Super Six (by 21 runs) and the final (by 128 runs). But Saturday’s fixture isn’t going to be all that easy for Sri Lanka who find themselves as the only team of the ten without a win in the World Cup. Netherlands skipper Scott Edwards made no bones about what they intend on achieving at the World Cup. “After qualifying we were pretty quick to set our minds to what we wanted to do at this tournament. We weren’t coming here just to have fun and enjoy it. We’re here to win games of cricket and give ourselves the best chance to make that next stage. South Africa is obviously a very strong side and they’ll be close to that semi-final spot. If we want to be amongst it, we’ve got to beat sides like this,” said Edwards who played a crucial part in Netherlands victory over South Africa with a match-winning knock of 78* off 69 balls that saw them lift themselves from a disastrous 82-5 to a challenging 245-8. “As a group we pride ourselves on playing total cricket which is, guys that are coming in at numbers 8, 9, 10 have just as much of the ability to put on those partnerships. But out there batting with them, it was just about giving ourselves a chance to go harder, later in the innings. And luckily enough, Roelof and Aryan in there played some unbelievable cameos to get us to what we thought was probably a roundabout par score.” The most notable aspect of Netherlands’ lower order batting was that they were able to sneak in extra runs converting ones into twos and twos into threes. “I think a lot of that goes down to our S&C [strength and conditioning] sort of work that the guys put in. It’s a brand of cricket that we want to play. And to be able to play that, guys have got to be fit enough,” said Edwards. “Most teams around the world are, but that’s definitely one of the focus points we have and they’re always nice when you can sneak a few runs here and there.”","pubDate":"2023-10-18 21:34:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"fab4f97b9edcec4505e967e86254f7fa","title":"Clinical Black Caps rout Afghanistan by 139 runs","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Clinical-Black-Caps-rout-Afghanistan-by-139-runs/23-754229","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"New Zealand came up with another thoroughly professional and clinical display to rout Afghanistan by 149 runs at Chepauk Stadium and maintain their unbeaten run in the Cricket World Cup. It was New Zealand’s fourth win in as many matches and saw them perched on top of the standings with eight points. However, their remaining matches are against tough opponents India, Pakistan, Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka. After New Zealand had run up a respectable 288, Afghanistan’s batting simply folded up for 139, their second lowest total in World Cups. Lockie Ferguson and Mitchell Santner picked up three wickets apiece and Trent Boult two as the Afghanistan batting got nowhere with the New Zealand bowlers maintaining tight lines and lengths. Of the 208 balls the Afghanistan innings lasted, there were 128 dot balls with only 11 fours and two sixes being struck. Top scorer was Rahmat Shah with 36 off 62 balls. New Zealand put into bat first, slipped from 109-1 to 110-4 losing three wickets for one run in eight balls as Azmatullah Omarzai struck twice in one over to get rid of two set batters, Rachin Ravindra (32) and Will Young (54) who both had lives early in their innings. When Rashid Khan had Daryl Mitchell caught for one, New Zealand’s innings was wobbling. The Afghan spinners were disciplined with their bowling, but the fielders let them down as they put down Glenn Phillips and Tom Latham and allowed them to consolidate with a partnership that produced 144 runs. Rashid Khan could have had four wickets but ended with just one, as New Zealand found an ideal launch pad to attack at the death. Although Naveen-ul-Haq claimed the wickets of both set batters Phillips for 71 off 80 balls (4 fours, 4 sixes) and Latham for 68 off 74 balls (3 fours, 2 sixes) in one over later on, Mark Chapman came in and swung freely, his late cameo helping New Zealand to finish with 288-6. New Zealand showed how to put a good total on the board in the old-fashioned way of ‘keep wickets in hand until the 40th over’ approach even after momentary setbacks. Scores: New Zealand 288-6 (50) (Devon Conway 20, Will Young 54, Rachin Ravindra 32, Tom Latham 68, Glenn Phillips 71, Mark Chapman 25*, Naveen-ul-Haq 2/48, Azmatullah Omarzai 2/56) Afghanistan 139 (34.4) (Rahmat Shah 36, Azmatullah Omarzai 27, Trent Boult 2/18, Mitchell Santner 3/39, Lockie Ferguson 3/19)","pubDate":"2023-10-18 21:34:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"2379a179e01b87e3a5ced4f454a0b5c7","title":"Papers: Newcastle weigh up move for Leverkusen striker Boniface","link":"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/20876/12987308/newcastle-weighing-up-move-for-bayer-leverkusen-striker-victor-boniface-paper-talk","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Thursday's newspapers...","content":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Thursday's newspapers...

Stalwart batter Virat Kohli who is well known for his refined batting skills, has been a crucial figure in the field as he tops the chart of players with the biggest impact on the field after the conclusion of the first three games for each country. Kohli has completed a total of three catches in India's three World Cup 2023 matches. He is two shy of tournament leaders for non-wicket-keepers Matt Henry of New Zealand and Australia's experienced opener David Warner . However, his impact on the field stretched much further than that. Kohli is in a league of his own on the list of runs saved and pressure ratings after the conclusion of three matches for all teams at the event and his total of 22.30 points allows him to sit comfortably at the top spot for fielding impact at the World Cup. Kohli's closest competitors are a pair of star batters, with former England skipper Joe Root (four catches) and David Warner (five catches) at the second and third spots respectively. Ishan Kishan is the second Indian player who features in the Top-10 list with a tally of 13 points. For Pakistan, Shadab Khan features in the Top-10 list in the fifth spot with 15.13 points. Overall, India's performance in the field has been the one to watch out for. Indian fielders have claimed 14 catches in the tournament and saved a total of 10 runs.

We've got an opportunity to bring some youngsters in and build on the cycle to 2027 with players having 50, 60, 70 caps behind them. \"There's an opportunity for us to build some closer relationships with the regions and some of the changes with coaches and personnel there. I'm excited by that because that hasn't always been the case in the past. \"Often those relationships have been quite fractured, not only from a coaching perspective but the things that were going on between the regions and the unions and we got dragged into those sort of things. That's really encouraging to getting on the same page and working with the same players. \"We have shown that we can improve and we have got an opportunity to play at a higher level. We want to work with them and keep building confidence. It's going to be incredibly important to us to keep players in Wales, to be part of something with their regions and also play international rugby. \"We've had a few conversations with players whose contracts are up. I'm saying to them the best thing for them is to stay in Wales and they can be looked after to get the best possible out of them in terms of playing international rugby. In order to do that we're progressing and performing at regional level too.\" Q: Do you want to take Wales on to the next World Cup? WG: \"That's the plan. When you look at it we've got such a small playing base we've got to look at how we bring these youngsters on and develop the Sam Costelow, Taine Plumtree, Jac Morgan - who I thought was outstanding and would have learned a lot from his leadership role - Aaron Wainwright is still a youngster at 26, we've got some exciting second-rows and backs coming through. \"When you look at the potential we've got as a nucleus, and some in the 20s as well, we can be really excited what we can achieve over the next three or four years.\" Q: Warren, how do you make sure things don't regress when you've got less time? WG: \"That's always the challenge. I would encourage the players to go back with a strong voice about the things they've learnt. \"I've said that in the past even when I was coaching Wasps I'd ask the English players what have you learnt and what can you bring to our environment to make us better as a group. \"That can work both ways. If things are going well at a region and a player comes in and say this is what we've been doing, we are more than comfortable to implement that into our pathway or our programme. \"Those are the sorts of things we will have to be comfortable with. It's not just about me or the head coaches at the regions, it's a collective responsibility about how we can all get better, and how we can all have an input about how those sort of things happen. \"When I say we weren't ready for a quarter-final there's not a lot of players in the squad who would have been a part of knockout football. The more we get an opportunity to be a part of a quarter-final or semi-final, you get more comfortable with that. \"We are starting from a relatively low base but everyone is well aware we've got to have a significant amount of improvement in the whole game here in Wales if we are going to be successful. That's not always about winning everything it's about overachieving. \"We are disappointed we didn't get to the semi-final although we are happy we got out of our pool but we want to do better. I think the regions have to put in the hard work at getting better, and making play-off stages to continue to develop players.\" Join the Wales Rugby WhatsApp community The Wales Rugby breaking news and top stories WhatsApp community has launched - and thousands of fans have already joined.

The backroom staff that I've got at the moment, everyone is on different cycles. \"It's about sitting down with them and talking with them along with talking to Nigel and the union about how we potentially go forward on those same contract cycles. I've seen a huge amount of growth from the staff since the Six Nations in terms of the work and effort they've put in and what we've learnt as coaches and the relationship we've developed over the last four or five months. \"It's been extremely positive and we can see it from certain aspects of the side where coaches have got a lot more confident in this pressure cooker environment and also working with the players.\" Q: How do you manage the process with the older players over the next few years in terms of bringing in the next generation? WG : \"It's looking at that age profile and looking at 2027 and thinking who in your mind is definitely not going to get there. Are there one or two who are part of the transition in terms of helping bringing youngsters through who have got that experience over the next 12 months or so. \"It's going to be a balancing act for us. I have spoken to some of those older players in terms of what their plans are and where they see themselves over the next couple of years. Some will continue to want to play regional rugby and still be available. It's just making sure we have honest and open conversations about what is going to happen. \"That's going to happen over the next couple of months. I spoke to Taulupe (Faletau) before he left France and I said get that arm fixed and then we'll sit down to talk about what you want to do over the next few years in terms of your playing. \"It's making sure we get it right. We are aware we need to give those youngsters opportunities. They need time in the middle and I don't want to leave some of them with not playing much international rugby over the next couple of years and then trying to get them up to speed in a short period. \"That's something there'll be some positive discussions around but every individual will be treated a little bit differently.\" Q: Do you think with a better relationship with the regions more promising youngsters will get given an opportunity? WG: \"It has been frustrating in the past because we’ve identified some talent and had to use the international stage to develop them. Things have changed and there are now fewer overseas players at the regions. \"The salary cap and everyone having to be conscious on the amount of money being spent on players to keep within budgets is a positive for younger players. They are going to get more opportunities at their regions. \"It was a cycle that we went through for a number of years when we had some talented players coming out of the U20s who would then move into the regional programme. If they weren’t quite ready for regional rugby it meant the youngsters wouldn’t get a chance because of the pressure on coaches to get results. \"Then they get to 23 and they’ve only played a dozen to 15 games. His agent would then knock on the door when the contracts were up for renewal and ask for a bit more money. They wouldn’t then give them any more and the coaches would go back to another 19-year-old. \"We saw that cycle for a long time when they didn’t get the chances. The regions need to give their youngsters opportunities and I think they will now do that. Do they have talent? Yes; will they make mistakes? Yes; do you have to go through some pain with them? Absolutely. My biggest argument in the past was we were signing overseas players of 27-28 who had played Super Rugby or provincial rugby and at the time were better than those youngsters. \"As result we didn’t see some of that development in them. We are in a position now where there aren’t anywhere near as many foreign players and the regions are having to be more proactive in developing their youngsters. I’d like to see them come through.\" Q: Do you support more opportunities for Tier Two nations? WG: \"I thought Portugal were one of the teams of the tournament. They were absolutely outstanding in the way they played. \"They benefitted from having a number of players coming from their sevens programme. They were a tough team. I didn’t realise until afterwards that the pool we were in was pretty even. The score we put on Georgia was the biggest amount of points they had conceded since the 2019 World Cup. They just need to play more rugby at a high level. Even the Uruguay game against the All Blacks was 0-0 after 20 minutes. \"You can see what those team can do when the adrenalin is pumped up. The difficulty for them is sustaining it beyond the 60-70-minute mark. They just need the chance to play against the best. \"When I first came to Wales, Roger Lewis asked me who do you want to play, I just said that any time you get the chance to play against a southern hemisphere side just jump at it. The only way we are going to get better is by playing against the best. \"World Rugby has that responsibility to grow the game and maybe we all need to be a bit more open minded in the future about what happens to the Six Nations. Can that grow a little bit, or how do we run the Tier 2 Six Nations with the possibility of relegation and promotion moving forward? \"There is a lot of money and jeopardy involved in that, but if we aren’t ambitious in terms of growing the game then we will continue to have the same top teams dominating. As a sports fan you want to see upsets. \"We’ve seen that at the Cricket World Cup with the Netherlands beating South Africa and Afghanistan beating England. Because of the regular fixtures they’ve had against the bigger nations we have seen them develop. In some way we need to follow the same model to keep developing the Tier Two nations.\" Q: Will you appoint co-captains again? \"I felt they both did outstanding jobs in their roles. I haven’t thought further ahead on that. Jac Morgan was absolutely outstanding. One of the questions I asked myself afterwards was did we get the No 6 and No 7 combination right in the quarter-final. \"It was quite a big debating point among the coaches. Jac was one of the best 7s at the World Cup and we took him away from that and put him in the number six role. Being the sort of person he is he was comfortable in doing that. I saw some huge growth in him as a captain and a player. \"As a captain, he is only going to get better. It was a little bit tougher for Dewi Lake in only starting one game. He didn’t have as much responsibility, but he was fantastic in the way he supported Jac. I haven’t thought about what happens moving forward. \"At the time having two youngsters who were respected by an older group of players who they supported, fitted for us at the World Cup. It’s the first time I’ve done that, and I’m probably not in favour of doing that unless it is required again. We will probably go back to the one-captain scenario.\"","pubDate":"2023-10-18 17:54:30","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article27936425.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1735439453.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","source_priority":16103,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7f0a4d39bf72d6d33fc5db3003d7cb87","title":"India vs Bangladesh World Cup 2023: ODI Records, MCA Stadium Records, Top Indian Batter, Bowler, Head-to-head","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/india-vs-bangladesh-world-cup-2023-odi-records-mca-stadium-records-top-indian-batter-bowler-head-to-head/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":[""],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Bangladesh World Cup 2023: ODI Records, MCA Stadium Records, Top Indian Batter, Bowler, Head-to-head","content":"India vs Bangladesh World Cup 2023: India have contested 7 matches at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium.

Babar, who scored an anchoring half-century against arch-rivals India on Saturday, got the reward for his performance as he kept India’s batting prodigy Shubman Gill at bay. The right-handed Indian batter is ranked second with 818 rating points, in touching distance with Babar Azam, who occupies the top position with 836 points. Meanwhile, Pakistan opening batters Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq, who were recently among the Top 10 batters, are now ranked 13th and 10th respectively. In-form South African opener Quinton de Kock, who scored back-to-back centuries in the ongoing ICC World Cup 2023 pipped his teammate Rassie van der Dussen to claim the third position in the rankings. Indian captain Rohit Sharma made a big leap of five places to sixth after amassing 131 runs against Afghanistan then backing it up with an imperious 86 from 63 balls against arch-rivals Pakistan. Afghanistan opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz — jumping 19 spots to 18th — and Netherlands captain Scott Edwards — climbing 16 places to 27th — made notable surges in the batting rankings. In the ICC ODI bowling rankings, however, experienced New Zealand pacer Trent Boult is in touching distance to occupy the top spot following a destructive spell against Bangladesh. He is a mere one rating point behind leader Josh Hazlewood after ascending a place in the latest update. Boult, who returned figures of 2/45 against Bangladesh after also dismissing Towhid Hridoy, also completed 200 wickets in ODIs. Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan climbs to fourth in bowling rankings while South Africa’s Keshav Maharaj jumps seven spots to equal fifth alongside Mujeeb Ur Rahman.","pubDate":"2023-10-18 17:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","source_priority":1484530,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7205846342c4ac5b048b30d1d10678e2","title":"Pakistan ‘under extra pressure’ in India with no fans","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/pakistan-under-extra-pressure-in-india-with-no-fans/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"BENGALURU (Agencies): Pakistan paid a heavy price for being “under extra pressure” in their World Cup defeat by arch-rivals India, said batsman Saud Shakeel, who Wednesday lamented the absence of the team’s passionate supporters from the tournament.

Pakistan were thrashed by seven wickets on Saturday at Ahmedabad’s 132,000-capacity stadium where there was only a handful of Pakistani supporters. Babar Azam’s team slumped from a solid 155-2 in the 30th over to be dismissed for a paltry 191. “I think we were under extra pressure so we tried to get out of that and wanted to play shots,” Shakeel told AFP on Wednesday. The smattering of Pakistani fans at the game were expatriates from the United Kingdon and United States. Supporters from across the border are effectively banned after a failure to gain visas. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday lodged an official complaint with the world governing body over the visa delays which have also kept many members of the country’s media at home. The PCB also complained over what they described as the “inappropriate behavior” of Indian fans toward the Pakistan squad at the Ahmedabad game. “When you have your crowd then you get the support. We did not get that and it was not in our hands,” added Shakeel. Despite an eighth loss in eight World Cup meetings with their arch-rivals, Pakistan are still well-placed in the tournament after wins over the Netherlands and Sri Lanka. Middle-order batsman Shakeel scored 68 against the Netherlands before making 31 in the game with Sri Lanka. He was out for just six against India. Next up for Pakistan is another high-profile duel, this time with five-time champions Australia in Bengaluru on Friday. “The mistakes we committed in the last game, we must overcome them. That match is gone. If we win against Australia then our position will get better,” added Shakeel. “Australia are always good in the World Cup. They are a very good side. We know our strong areas and we must play good cricket.” “We had a good start to the tournament with two wins. We want to go match by match and not commit the mistakes we did against India.” On Wednesday, all the Pakistan players with the exception of Mohammad Haris trained in Bengaluru. Haris is still suffering from a fever which laid low many of the squad when they arrived from Ahmedabad. Star fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi and opener Abdullah Shafique were the worst hit but were present in the nets at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.","pubDate":"2023-10-18 17:12:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","source_priority":1484530,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"5ef2b15b85a168bed4f47254a5a63dfa","title":"Netherlands’ skipper fires a warning to his opponents","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Netherlands--skipper-fires-a-warning-to-his-opponents/23-754233","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"LUCKNOW: Netherlands is going to be Sri Lanka’s next opponents in the ongoing Cricket World Cup and following their shocking win over South Africa on Monday at Dharamsala will certainly have their tails up coming into this game. Both teams came through the World Cup Qualifier where Sri Lanka beat the Netherlands twice in the Super Six (by 21 runs) and the final (by 128 runs). But Saturday’s fixture isn’t going to be all that easy for Sri Lanka who find themselves as the only team of the ten without a win in the World Cup. Netherlands skipper Scott Edwards made no bones about what they intend on achieving at the World Cup. “After qualifying we were pretty quick to set our minds to what we wanted to do at this tournament. We weren’t coming here just to have fun and enjoy it. We’re here to win games of cricket and give ourselves the best chance to make that next stage. South Africa is obviously a very strong side and they’ll be close to that semi-final spot. If we want to be amongst it, we’ve got to beat sides like this,” said Edwards who played a crucial part in Netherlands victory over South Africa with a match-winning knock of 78* off 69 balls that saw them lift themselves from a disastrous 82-5 to a challenging 245-8. “As a group we pride ourselves on playing total cricket which is, guys that are coming in at numbers 8, 9, 10 have just as much of the ability to put on those partnerships. But out there batting with them, it was just about giving ourselves a chance to go harder, later in the innings. And luckily enough, Roelof and Aryan in there played some unbelievable cameos to get us to what we thought was probably a roundabout par score.” The most notable aspect of Netherlands’ lower order batting was that they were able to sneak in extra runs converting ones into twos and twos into threes. “I think a lot of that goes down to our S&C [strength and conditioning] sort of work that the guys put in. It’s a brand of cricket that we want to play. And to be able to play that, guys have got to be fit enough,” said Edwards. “Most teams around the world are, but that’s definitely one of the focus points we have and they’re always nice when you can sneak a few runs here and there.”","pubDate":"2023-10-18 21:34:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"fab4f97b9edcec4505e967e86254f7fa","title":"Clinical Black Caps rout Afghanistan by 139 runs","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Clinical-Black-Caps-rout-Afghanistan-by-139-runs/23-754229","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"New Zealand came up with another thoroughly professional and clinical display to rout Afghanistan by 149 runs at Chepauk Stadium and maintain their unbeaten run in the Cricket World Cup. It was New Zealand’s fourth win in as many matches and saw them perched on top of the standings with eight points. However, their remaining matches are against tough opponents India, Pakistan, Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka. After New Zealand had run up a respectable 288, Afghanistan’s batting simply folded up for 139, their second lowest total in World Cups. Lockie Ferguson and Mitchell Santner picked up three wickets apiece and Trent Boult two as the Afghanistan batting got nowhere with the New Zealand bowlers maintaining tight lines and lengths. Of the 208 balls the Afghanistan innings lasted, there were 128 dot balls with only 11 fours and two sixes being struck. Top scorer was Rahmat Shah with 36 off 62 balls. New Zealand put into bat first, slipped from 109-1 to 110-4 losing three wickets for one run in eight balls as Azmatullah Omarzai struck twice in one over to get rid of two set batters, Rachin Ravindra (32) and Will Young (54) who both had lives early in their innings. When Rashid Khan had Daryl Mitchell caught for one, New Zealand’s innings was wobbling. The Afghan spinners were disciplined with their bowling, but the fielders let them down as they put down Glenn Phillips and Tom Latham and allowed them to consolidate with a partnership that produced 144 runs. Rashid Khan could have had four wickets but ended with just one, as New Zealand found an ideal launch pad to attack at the death. Although Naveen-ul-Haq claimed the wickets of both set batters Phillips for 71 off 80 balls (4 fours, 4 sixes) and Latham for 68 off 74 balls (3 fours, 2 sixes) in one over later on, Mark Chapman came in and swung freely, his late cameo helping New Zealand to finish with 288-6. New Zealand showed how to put a good total on the board in the old-fashioned way of ‘keep wickets in hand until the 40th over’ approach even after momentary setbacks. Scores: New Zealand 288-6 (50) (Devon Conway 20, Will Young 54, Rachin Ravindra 32, Tom Latham 68, Glenn Phillips 71, Mark Chapman 25*, Naveen-ul-Haq 2/48, Azmatullah Omarzai 2/56) Afghanistan 139 (34.4) (Rahmat Shah 36, Azmatullah Omarzai 27, Trent Boult 2/18, Mitchell Santner 3/39, Lockie Ferguson 3/19)","pubDate":"2023-10-18 21:34:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"2379a179e01b87e3a5ced4f454a0b5c7","title":"Papers: Newcastle weigh up move for Leverkusen striker Boniface","link":"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/20876/12987308/newcastle-weighing-up-move-for-bayer-leverkusen-striker-victor-boniface-paper-talk","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Thursday's newspapers...","content":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Thursday's newspapers...

Shakib was injured while running during the match. He bowled his quota of ten overs, but it was evident that he was in pain. After the game, he didn't turn up for the post-match interaction. During the pre-match press conference Hathurusingha was quizzed about the availability of the experienced all-rounder to which he replied, \"If he is not ready to play, we won't risk him. But if he's ready, then there's a chance of him playing tomorrow.\" \"He had a good batting session yesterday and did a little bit of running between the wickets. We did a scan today, so we are waiting for the results. At the moment he is okay. We haven't tried with bowling yet. So, he will come tomorrow morning and we will assess him again and then make a decision,\" Hathurusingha added. Bangladesh have had concerns in the batting department as they have struggled to put up runs on the board in the ongoing World Cup. With the Pune track promising to be a batting-friendly pitch, Hathurusingha talked about the approach that their team will look to opt for. \"Yeah, this wicket is probably the best batting wicket we came across so far. And even the practice wickets were similar, really good. We had a really good net session yesterday. As you rightly said, we haven't put up complete batting performance, or to that matter, complete performance with the ball and bat so far. So, we are expected to do as a complete performance. And we know that when we play as a team and we perform to our capabilities and we have beat big teams. We have done well in the past. So, I think fingers crossed, we are due for one of those days,\" Hathurusingha added.

Stalwart batter Virat Kohli who is well known for his refined batting skills, has been a crucial figure in the field as he tops the chart of players with the biggest impact on the field after the conclusion of the first three games for each country. Kohli has completed a total of three catches in India's three World Cup 2023 matches. He is two shy of tournament leaders for non-wicket-keepers Matt Henry of New Zealand and Australia's experienced opener David Warner . However, his impact on the field stretched much further than that. Kohli is in a league of his own on the list of runs saved and pressure ratings after the conclusion of three matches for all teams at the event and his total of 22.30 points allows him to sit comfortably at the top spot for fielding impact at the World Cup. Kohli's closest competitors are a pair of star batters, with former England skipper Joe Root (four catches) and David Warner (five catches) at the second and third spots respectively. Ishan Kishan is the second Indian player who features in the Top-10 list with a tally of 13 points. For Pakistan, Shadab Khan features in the Top-10 list in the fifth spot with 15.13 points. Overall, India's performance in the field has been the one to watch out for. Indian fielders have claimed 14 catches in the tournament and saved a total of 10 runs. Till now, the Indian team has dropped two catches on the field, with defending champions England (1) the only side to have dropped less number of catches. India will return to the on-field action against Bangladesh on Thursday at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Mumbai.","pubDate":"2023-10-18 18:04:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"b402074e4dbb9bfd21340287e8851696","title":"Warren Gatland Q&A: My future plans and what we must do with the four regions now","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/warren-gatland-qa-future-plans-27934955","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Steffan Thomas)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Warren Gatland has confirmed he will lead Wales to the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia","content":"Wales have confirmed Warren Gatland will lead Wales through to the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia. Gatland has only been back at the helm since December but has once again dragged Wales out of the doldrums by helping them earn respect at the recent World Cup in France. Under previous head coach Wayne Pivac Wales suffered embarrassment with home defeats against Italy and Georgia but Gatland has succeeded in laying strong foundations for the future. Upon the squad's return from France after their disappointing quarter-final defeat to Argentina, Gatland held court with the media to discuss his future and his plans to improve Wales even further over the next four years.

WG: “Mixed. I’m proud of where we’ve come from and what we've achieved as a group. I’m disappointed with the Argentinian result. I don’t want to take anything away from Argentina. \"Their game management was better than ours. They’ve outkicked us and kicked double the lengths of kicks. We created opportunities and missed a few lineouts and there were too many turnovers for us in the game as well. \"I’m disappointed because I thought the way we progressed we didn’t quite match it against Argentina. On reflection that’s where we are at the moment but we’ve seen where we can potentially get to.\" Q: How long does the pain last after a defeat like that? WG: “It’ll take a little bit of time. I tend to be OK after a game but two or three days later I tend to feel either the elation or the disappointment. \"We did have a chance but we weren’t quite there. We will take a lot of learnings from this disappointment. Read my weekly column in our rugby newsletter \"For us the benchmark of how to manage the game against Australia was outstanding. The question is how do we get to a place where we can do that consistently.\" Q: Do you want to stay on as Wales head coach for the next four years? WG: \"Absolutely. I was asked about that and said didn’t know what was in my contract. Had a joke with Nigel (Walker) before and said 'You can't get rid of me'. \"I think my contract said if we didn't get out of the pool they had a clause that said they could get rid of me. I said 'if you do want to pay me off that's up to you'. \"I'm excited about what we can start doing as a group. We've got an opportunity to bring some youngsters in and build on the cycle to 2027 with players having 50, 60, 70 caps behind them. \"There's an opportunity for us to build some closer relationships with the regions and some of the changes with coaches and personnel there. I'm excited by that because that hasn't always been the case in the past. \"Often those relationships have been quite fractured, not only from a coaching perspective but the things that were going on between the regions and the unions and we got dragged into those sort of things. That's really encouraging to getting on the same page and working with the same players. \"We have shown that we can improve and we have got an opportunity to play at a higher level. We want to work with them and keep building confidence. It's going to be incredibly important to us to keep players in Wales, to be part of something with their regions and also play international rugby. \"We've had a few conversations with players whose contracts are up. I'm saying to them the best thing for them is to stay in Wales and they can be looked after to get the best possible out of them in terms of playing international rugby. In order to do that we're progressing and performing at regional level too.\" Q: Do you want to take Wales on to the next World Cup? WG: \"That's the plan. When you look at it we've got such a small playing base we've got to look at how we bring these youngsters on and develop the Sam Costelow, Taine Plumtree, Jac Morgan - who I thought was outstanding and would have learned a lot from his leadership role - Aaron Wainwright is still a youngster at 26, we've got some exciting second-rows and backs coming through. \"When you look at the potential we've got as a nucleus, and some in the 20s as well, we can be really excited what we can achieve over the next three or four years.\" Q: Warren, how do you make sure things don't regress when you've got less time? WG: \"That's always the challenge. I would encourage the players to go back with a strong voice about the things they've learnt. \"I've said that in the past even when I was coaching Wasps I'd ask the English players what have you learnt and what can you bring to our environment to make us better as a group. \"That can work both ways. If things are going well at a region and a player comes in and say this is what we've been doing, we are more than comfortable to implement that into our pathway or our programme. \"Those are the sorts of things we will have to be comfortable with. It's not just about me or the head coaches at the regions, it's a collective responsibility about how we can all get better, and how we can all have an input about how those sort of things happen. \"When I say we weren't ready for a quarter-final there's not a lot of players in the squad who would have been a part of knockout football. The more we get an opportunity to be a part of a quarter-final or semi-final, you get more comfortable with that. \"We are starting from a relatively low base but everyone is well aware we've got to have a significant amount of improvement in the whole game here in Wales if we are going to be successful. That's not always about winning everything it's about overachieving. \"We are disappointed we didn't get to the semi-final although we are happy we got out of our pool but we want to do better. I think the regions have to put in the hard work at getting better, and making play-off stages to continue to develop players.\" Join the Wales Rugby WhatsApp community The Wales Rugby breaking news and top stories WhatsApp community has launched - and thousands of fans have already joined.

The backroom staff that I've got at the moment, everyone is on different cycles. \"It's about sitting down with them and talking with them along with talking to Nigel and the union about how we potentially go forward on those same contract cycles. I've seen a huge amount of growth from the staff since the Six Nations in terms of the work and effort they've put in and what we've learnt as coaches and the relationship we've developed over the last four or five months. \"It's been extremely positive and we can see it from certain aspects of the side where coaches have got a lot more confident in this pressure cooker environment and also working with the players.\" Q: How do you manage the process with the older players over the next few years in terms of bringing in the next generation? WG : \"It's looking at that age profile and looking at 2027 and thinking who in your mind is definitely not going to get there. Are there one or two who are part of the transition in terms of helping bringing youngsters through who have got that experience over the next 12 months or so. \"It's going to be a balancing act for us. I have spoken to some of those older players in terms of what their plans are and where they see themselves over the next couple of years. Some will continue to want to play regional rugby and still be available. It's just making sure we have honest and open conversations about what is going to happen. \"That's going to happen over the next couple of months. I spoke to Taulupe (Faletau) before he left France and I said get that arm fixed and then we'll sit down to talk about what you want to do over the next few years in terms of your playing. \"It's making sure we get it right. We are aware we need to give those youngsters opportunities. They need time in the middle and I don't want to leave some of them with not playing much international rugby over the next couple of years and then trying to get them up to speed in a short period. \"That's something there'll be some positive discussions around but every individual will be treated a little bit differently.\" Q: Do you think with a better relationship with the regions more promising youngsters will get given an opportunity? WG: \"It has been frustrating in the past because we’ve identified some talent and had to use the international stage to develop them. Things have changed and there are now fewer overseas players at the regions. \"The salary cap and everyone having to be conscious on the amount of money being spent on players to keep within budgets is a positive for younger players. They are going to get more opportunities at their regions. \"It was a cycle that we went through for a number of years when we had some talented players coming out of the U20s who would then move into the regional programme. If they weren’t quite ready for regional rugby it meant the youngsters wouldn’t get a chance because of the pressure on coaches to get results. \"Then they get to 23 and they’ve only played a dozen to 15 games. His agent would then knock on the door when the contracts were up for renewal and ask for a bit more money. They wouldn’t then give them any more and the coaches would go back to another 19-year-old. \"We saw that cycle for a long time when they didn’t get the chances. The regions need to give their youngsters opportunities and I think they will now do that. Do they have talent? Yes; will they make mistakes? Yes; do you have to go through some pain with them? Absolutely. My biggest argument in the past was we were signing overseas players of 27-28 who had played Super Rugby or provincial rugby and at the time were better than those youngsters. \"As result we didn’t see some of that development in them. We are in a position now where there aren’t anywhere near as many foreign players and the regions are having to be more proactive in developing their youngsters. I’d like to see them come through.\" Q: Do you support more opportunities for Tier Two nations? WG: \"I thought Portugal were one of the teams of the tournament. They were absolutely outstanding in the way they played. \"They benefitted from having a number of players coming from their sevens programme. They were a tough team. I didn’t realise until afterwards that the pool we were in was pretty even. The score we put on Georgia was the biggest amount of points they had conceded since the 2019 World Cup. They just need to play more rugby at a high level. Even the Uruguay game against the All Blacks was 0-0 after 20 minutes. \"You can see what those team can do when the adrenalin is pumped up. The difficulty for them is sustaining it beyond the 60-70-minute mark. They just need the chance to play against the best. \"When I first came to Wales, Roger Lewis asked me who do you want to play, I just said that any time you get the chance to play against a southern hemisphere side just jump at it. The only way we are going to get better is by playing against the best. \"World Rugby has that responsibility to grow the game and maybe we all need to be a bit more open minded in the future about what happens to the Six Nations. Can that grow a little bit, or how do we run the Tier 2 Six Nations with the possibility of relegation and promotion moving forward? \"There is a lot of money and jeopardy involved in that, but if we aren’t ambitious in terms of growing the game then we will continue to have the same top teams dominating. As a sports fan you want to see upsets. \"We’ve seen that at the Cricket World Cup with the Netherlands beating South Africa and Afghanistan beating England. Because of the regular fixtures they’ve had against the bigger nations we have seen them develop. In some way we need to follow the same model to keep developing the Tier Two nations.\" Q: Will you appoint co-captains again? \"I felt they both did outstanding jobs in their roles. I haven’t thought further ahead on that. Jac Morgan was absolutely outstanding. One of the questions I asked myself afterwards was did we get the No 6 and No 7 combination right in the quarter-final. \"It was quite a big debating point among the coaches. Jac was one of the best 7s at the World Cup and we took him away from that and put him in the number six role. Being the sort of person he is he was comfortable in doing that. I saw some huge growth in him as a captain and a player. \"As a captain, he is only going to get better. It was a little bit tougher for Dewi Lake in only starting one game. He didn’t have as much responsibility, but he was fantastic in the way he supported Jac. I haven’t thought about what happens moving forward. \"At the time having two youngsters who were respected by an older group of players who they supported, fitted for us at the World Cup. It’s the first time I’ve done that, and I’m probably not in favour of doing that unless it is required again. We will probably go back to the one-captain scenario.\"","pubDate":"2023-10-18 17:54:30","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article27936425.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1735439453.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","source_priority":16103,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7f0a4d39bf72d6d33fc5db3003d7cb87","title":"India vs Bangladesh World Cup 2023: ODI Records, MCA Stadium Records, Top Indian Batter, Bowler, Head-to-head","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/india-vs-bangladesh-world-cup-2023-odi-records-mca-stadium-records-top-indian-batter-bowler-head-to-head/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":[""],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Bangladesh World Cup 2023: ODI Records, MCA Stadium Records, Top Indian Batter, Bowler, Head-to-head","content":"India vs Bangladesh World Cup 2023: India have contested 7 matches at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium.

Babar, who scored an anchoring half-century against arch-rivals India on Saturday, got the reward for his performance as he kept India’s batting prodigy Shubman Gill at bay. The right-handed Indian batter is ranked second with 818 rating points, in touching distance with Babar Azam, who occupies the top position with 836 points. Meanwhile, Pakistan opening batters Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq, who were recently among the Top 10 batters, are now ranked 13th and 10th respectively. In-form South African opener Quinton de Kock, who scored back-to-back centuries in the ongoing ICC World Cup 2023 pipped his teammate Rassie van der Dussen to claim the third position in the rankings. Indian captain Rohit Sharma made a big leap of five places to sixth after amassing 131 runs against Afghanistan then backing it up with an imperious 86 from 63 balls against arch-rivals Pakistan. Afghanistan opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz — jumping 19 spots to 18th — and Netherlands captain Scott Edwards — climbing 16 places to 27th — made notable surges in the batting rankings. In the ICC ODI bowling rankings, however, experienced New Zealand pacer Trent Boult is in touching distance to occupy the top spot following a destructive spell against Bangladesh. He is a mere one rating point behind leader Josh Hazlewood after ascending a place in the latest update. Boult, who returned figures of 2/45 against Bangladesh after also dismissing Towhid Hridoy, also completed 200 wickets in ODIs. Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan climbs to fourth in bowling rankings while South Africa’s Keshav Maharaj jumps seven spots to equal fifth alongside Mujeeb Ur Rahman.","pubDate":"2023-10-18 17:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","source_priority":1484530,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7205846342c4ac5b048b30d1d10678e2","title":"Pakistan ‘under extra pressure’ in India with no fans","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/pakistan-under-extra-pressure-in-india-with-no-fans/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"BENGALURU (Agencies): Pakistan paid a heavy price for being “under extra pressure” in their World Cup defeat by arch-rivals India, said batsman Saud Shakeel, who Wednesday lamented the absence of the team’s passionate supporters from the tournament.

Pakistan were thrashed by seven wickets on Saturday at Ahmedabad’s 132,000-capacity stadium where there was only a handful of Pakistani supporters. Babar Azam’s team slumped from a solid 155-2 in the 30th over to be dismissed for a paltry 191. “I think we were under extra pressure so we tried to get out of that and wanted to play shots,” Shakeel told AFP on Wednesday. The smattering of Pakistani fans at the game were expatriates from the United Kingdon and United States. Supporters from across the border are effectively banned after a failure to gain visas. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday lodged an official complaint with the world governing body over the visa delays which have also kept many members of the country’s media at home. The PCB also complained over what they described as the “inappropriate behavior” of Indian fans toward the Pakistan squad at the Ahmedabad game. “When you have your crowd then you get the support. We did not get that and it was not in our hands,” added Shakeel. Despite an eighth loss in eight World Cup meetings with their arch-rivals, Pakistan are still well-placed in the tournament after wins over the Netherlands and Sri Lanka. Middle-order batsman Shakeel scored 68 against the Netherlands before making 31 in the game with Sri Lanka. He was out for just six against India. Next up for Pakistan is another high-profile duel, this time with five-time champions Australia in Bengaluru on Friday. “The mistakes we committed in the last game, we must overcome them. That match is gone. If we win against Australia then our position will get better,” added Shakeel. “Australia are always good in the World Cup. They are a very good side. We know our strong areas and we must play good cricket.” “We had a good start to the tournament with two wins. We want to go match by match and not commit the mistakes we did against India.” On Wednesday, all the Pakistan players with the exception of Mohammad Haris trained in Bengaluru. Haris is still suffering from a fever which laid low many of the squad when they arrived from Ahmedabad. Star fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi and opener Abdullah Shafique were the worst hit but were present in the nets at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.","pubDate":"2023-10-18 17:12:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","source_priority":1484530,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
