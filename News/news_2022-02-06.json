Earlier, India had won the U19 World Cup in 2000, 2008, 2012, and 2018. Taking to Twitter, BCCI treasurer Arun Dhumal said: \"What an amazing performance by India U-19 team @ bcci to win the #Under19WorldCup2022. The team remained unbeaten throughout the tournament and displayed amazing teamwork and prospects. Well played Rajangad Bawa, Ravi Kumar, Shaik Rasheed, and Nishant Sindhu.\" Chasing 190, India got off to the worst start possible as Joshua Boyden dismissed Angkrish Raghuvanshi (0) on the third ball of the innings. Harnoor Singh and Shaik Rasheed then got together at the crease and the duo put on 49 runs for the second wicket. As soon as India started to gain an upper hand, England stormed right back into the contest in the 18th over as Thomas Aspinwall dismissed Harnoor (21), reducing India to 49/2. Skipper Yash Dhull next joined Rasheed in the middle and both batters stitched together a partnership of 46 runs which saw Rasheed (50) going past his 50-run mark. However, as soon as he reached the milestone, he ended up giving his wicket away to James Sales. In his next over, Sales picked up the scalp of Dhull (17), and India was reduced to 97/4, still needing 93 runs for the win. Raj Bawa (35) and Nishant Sindhu (50*) then ensured that India does not lose wickets in a cluster. In the end, India registered a four-wicket win to lift the U19 World Cup for the fifth time.

Sutherland, whose daughter Annabel played for Australia, said the pulsating finish was a great advertisement for women’s Test cricket. “I went up to watch, and it was a great event,” Sutherland said. “Canberra is a great place to watch sport, it’s a beautiful ground. The pitch and outfield were absolutely spot on for a women’s Test match. “I guess you just never know with Test cricket how it unfolds, but to have a game that finishes like that with four results possible in the last over, it’s all you can wish for as a cricket fan and an observer.” Sutherland said it will be the red-ball game, and not necessarily the T20 format, which will help grow women’s cricket in future years. “With the professionalisation of the women’s game, I think you can see the standard and spectacle of watching women’s cricket getting better and better all the time,” he said. “With that creates an even stronger and more compelling case for more women’s Test cricket.

As it stands, the memorandum of understanding between Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers Association restricts the national women’s team to one Test match a year. But a Cricket Australia spokesperson said they would be looking at staging more women’s Test cricket in the future. “Cricket Australia is supportive of playing as much Test cricket as is practical, as evidenced by hosting Test matches versus both India and England as part of multi-format series this season, while supporting the global growth of the women’s game,” the spokesperson said.","image_url":null,"source_id":"smh","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘There’ll be more of it’: Sutherland backs women’s Test cricket","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/there-ll-be-more-of-it-sutherland-backs-women-s-test-cricket-20220204-p59tsh.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Damien Ractliffe"],"video_url":null,"description":"Last month’s Ashes Test captured public imagination and former Cricket Australia boss James Sutherland says it’s the format to grow the women’s game.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-06 00:44:46","full_description":"Former Cricket Australia boss James Sutherland says Test cricket will be the format to grow the women’s game after last month’s Ashes Test captured the public’s imagination.

South African players celebrate at the 1992 World Cup. Credit: The Age Archives The welcoming party was divided into three groups: representatives of the local African National Congress support group, with their ANC flags and chants of “Cricket yes, apartheid no”; representatives of Perth’s white expatriate South African population, with their national flag and whistles of joy; and representatives of the Australian Cricket Board, with their faces beaming and hands outstretched. A spokesman for the ANC support group, Mr Glen Mashinini, stressed that his group was at Perth’s international airport in support of the team, which, he said, represented an important step in the movement towards democracy and integration in South Africa. Only about 50 people were at the airport to welcome the team members, who were whisked quickly and unobtrusively into town while their captain, coach and manager attended a news conference. The team’s captain, the former Australian Test player Kepler Wessels, said his players had been fine-tuned for the requirements of the international limited-overs carnival starting on 22 February. “This event gives us the opportunity to play the West Indies and Pakistan for the first time in our history,” Wessels said. “The players in this squad are very excited about that but also apprehensive because they are going into the unknown.” South Africa is in Australia to prepare for the World Cup, having been granted a late entry into the competition by a special sitting of the international Cricket Council in Sharjah last October. The Australian Cricket Board was at the forefront of the delicate negotiations that brought about South Africa’s return in time for the World Cup. South Africa’s 14-man squad includes one black player, the 40-year-old spin bowler Omar Henry, who played against Kim Hughes’s rebel side during the turbulent days of the mid-1980s.","image_url":null,"source_id":"theage","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Narendra Modi Stadium stats: List of Narendra Modi Stadium ODI records in batting and bowling","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-narendra-modi-stadium-stats-list-of-narendra-modi-stadium-odi-records-in-batting-and-bowling/","keywords":["Cricket","India","West Indies","West Indies tour of India 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Narendra Modi Stadium stats and ODI records: Ahmedabad will be hosting an ODI after more than seven years this afternoon.

The Top Five wicket-takers at this venue are former India captain Kapil Dev (10), former Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga (7), Gayle (6), former West Indies fast bowler Winston Benjamin (5) and former Sri Lanka fast bowler Farvez Maharoof (5). Among active players, Ravichandran Ashwin (5), Ravi Rampaul (4), Tim Southee (3), Seekkuge Prasanna (3) and Shoaib Malik (3) are the highest wicket-takers at the Narendra Modi Stadium. West Indies fast bowler Kemar Roach, who had played his last ODI against India in Port of Spain almost 30 months ago, is their only bowler from the current squad to pick a wicket here. Opening the bowling in a bilateral ODI in 2011, Roach had dismissed India pacer R Vinay Kumar in his 10-over spell. Narendra Modi Stadium ODI records Out of 46 completed ODI innings in Ahmedabad, 300+ innings scores have been registered on six occasions (thrice by India).

Team India have been crowned champions of the 14th edition of the ICC U19 World Cup, as they defeated England by 4 wickets at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua. With the win, India have now won the prestigious tournament for a record fifth time, having previously lifted the silverware during the 2000, 2008, 2012 and 2018 editions. The title triumph script was written by India’s fast bowling duo of Ravi Kumar (9-1-34-4) and Raj Bawa (9.5-1-31-5) who shared a total of 9 wickets between them to run riot on the England batting order, dismissing them for a modest 189 off 44.5 Overs. Bawa in-fact become the first Indian to take a five-wicket haul in an ICC event final. Moreover, this is the first time two pace bowlers took 4+ wickets in an Under-19 ODI innings for India. Bawa (35 off 54) also contributed with the bat, as he was involved in a crucial 67-run partnership for the 5th wicket alonsgside Nishant Sindhu (50* off 54). In reply, chasing a rather modest total of 189/10 posted by England, India were handed a huge blow only on the second delivery of the chase, as Angkrish Raghuvanshi (0 off 2), team’s highest run-scorer in the tournament was back in the hut for a Duck. The ‘Boys in Blue’, courtesy the early blow decided to thread with caution for the chase thereafter, as the duo of Harnoor Singh (21 off 46) and Shaik Rasheed (50 off 84) brought up the team’s fifty during the 19th Over of the innings. With India huffing and puffing towards the target, the chase was ultimately pulled off in a Dhoni-esque manner with another Indian wicketkeeper-batter, Dinesh Bana hitting the winning six to win it for his country with 14 deliveries to spare. Man of the series U19 World Cup 2022 South Africa’s batter Dewald Brevis aka ‘Baby AB’ by his teammates due to his uncanny resemblance with the Proteas superstar AB de Villiers’s style of batting, was the stand-out performer of the tournament by some distance. To put it in a nutshell, Brevis has smashed most runs (506), most fifties (3), most hundreds (2), most 4s (45), and most 6s (18) in the U19 World Cup 2022. His 506 runs have come at an average of 84.33 and a strike rate of 90.19 across 6 matches. Courtesy, his marvelous show throughout the event, he was adjudged the ‘Player of the tournament’ during the post match presentation. South Africa’s Dewald Brevis is the Player of the Tournament at the #U19WorldCup2022.

This is a record-extending fifth triumph for India in the U19 World Cup. England's attempt to win their second title, since winning the tournament way back in 1998 ended in disappointment as the unbeaten Indian juggernaut steamrolled their opposition. India were tremendous with the ball, reducing England to 61/6, before rearguard from James Rew (95) took the team to 189 all out. India were made to work hard for their runs and eventually it was unbeaten knock of 50 from Nishant Sindhu and another half-century from vice-captain Shaik Rasheed (50) that took the team home. Raj Angad Bawa was adjudged player of the match for his devastating spell of 5/31 and mature knock of 35 that set up the victory.

During the final match of the ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup 2022 between India U-19 and England U-19 in North Sound, India beat England by 4 wickets to lift their fifth junior World Cup. A 190-run run-chase wasn’t a one-sided affair for India as England colts tried their best to challenge the opposition despite defending a below par target. Individual half-centuries by batter Nishant Sindhu (50*) vice-captain Shaik Rasheed (50) turned out to be crucial as India sealed the chase in the 48th over on the back of wicket-keeper Dinesh Bana (12*) hitting consecutive sixes off James Sales. Sindhu, 17, not only scored a maiden YODI half-century but scored it at a strike rate of 92.59 including five fours and a six. Having lost captain Yash Dhull (17) in the 29th over, India were in a spot of bother. However, it was a game-changing 67-run partnership for the fifth wicket between Sindhu and Raj Bawa (35) which turned the tables for them. Man of the Match India U19 vs England U19 today Bawa, who was introduced into the attack as a first-change bowler in the seventh over by Dhull, bowled a record spell picking bowling figures of 9.5-1-31-5. Having dismissed George Thomas (27), William Luxton (4), George Bell (0) and Rehan Ahmed (10), the 19-year old right-arm pacer played a titular role in reducing England to 61/6 in the 17th over by running through their middle-order at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Stadium.

To test positive (for Covid) but show the kind of resilience and positive attitude was exemplary. I think the BCCI has to be complemented. The number of matches and tournaments each age group level gets to play, whether U16, U19 or U23... unfortunately due to Covid they didn't get to play any tournaments and that's why I think this tournament win is very special.\" \"It's important but this is just a learning process and just the start of their journey.

Former India captain Virat Kohli has been dominating the headlines ever since he decided to relinquish his captaincy post of the IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) post the end of the 14th season of the league. Having taken the responsibility for as many as eight years, starting the 2013 season, the 33-year-old took the vital call without a title to boast of. The decision was followed by his relinquishment from team India’s T20I captaincy as well, which further led to him being sacked as the ODI skipper by the BCCI. If this was not it, the country’s most decorated captain also stepped down as the team’s Test leader as well, post the 1-2 Test series loss against South Africa. Adding on to the aforementioned tumultuous challenges he has been facing off-late, the arduous wait for the elusive 71st International Century by his fans have only further increased the weight of expectations he has been carrying all these years. During a candid interaction for ‘The RCB podcast’ ahead of IPL 2022, the star India batter opened up on his struggles when going through a lean patch, and how he picks himself up when the clouds of self-doubt hover above his head. He also spoke in brief, that one aspect of his journey as a Cricketer that remains unseen by the fans and audiences. Its always you vs you. pic.twitter.com/9zBG8O95Qp — Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) January 30, 2022 Virat Kohli mentions the one aspect of his Cricket journey When asked during the podcast as to what it is that the audience does not see about his Cricket journey, Virat Kohli exclaimed, “It’s the moments when you are sitting in your room with absolute zero confidence, with zero conviction that you can perform the next day, and what it takes to overcome that”. “I can show you training videos, I can show you what I do on a monthly basis; and yes, you can take inspiration and all that but it is very difficult for anyone to know what it takes for you to play under the kind of pressure you have to play in, keep up with those performances, make sure that you are committing yourself 200% to make your team win, and when things are not going right how you manage all those expectations from yourself, not from people. So that, I think is the most challenging part of being at a top level for 15-20 years. “It’s a very delicate thing to do. When you know you are not doing well and you feel like you don’t wanna work, you don’t wanna go practice, or don’t wanna go to the gym. It eats you up from the inside because that’s not who you are, and your mind is dominating you, and it’s making you feel like you are not good enough. “So your one foot is in doubt, and the other foot is in this empty space in between. But, you know that this true nature of yours, which is ‘fearless’, ‘believe in yourself’, ‘instinctively work for yourself’ is on the other side. And, you go for it because as an individual you feel like you are respecting all the phases of your life, and even in your worse times you are committed to do the hard work and it’s not based on success. That for me is the real game,” Kohli further completed. RCB have retained Kohli as one of the three players at INR 15 Crore for the upcoming 15th season of the IPL. The franchise, however, will have to appoint a new captain for the team.
