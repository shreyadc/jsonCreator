Pat Cummins has issued a public statement after the resignation of Justin Langer as the head coach of the side. The current contract of Langer was set to expire mid-way this season. There were reports of a heated argument between CA and Justin Langer. CA offered Langer a short-term contract, but Langer decided to reject it. Cricket Australia rejected the rumours, but the resignation of Langer came just after it. Langer joined the broken Australian team after the infamous Sand Paper gate incident. Langer won the T20 World Cup with Australia, whereas he also retained the Ashes a couple of times. Pat Cummins issues a public statement Justin Langer, in his statement, said that he apologize for this intense style of coaching. However, Cummins believes that he should not have apologized. “Justin has acknowledged that his style was intense. And it was,” Cummins said. “I think the apology was unnecessary.” “Because the players were OK with JL’s intensity.” “It came from a good place – his fierce love of Australia and the baggy green – something which has served Australian cricket well for three decades.” “And Justin’s intensity drove a better team culture and higher team standards.” I don’t understand the people slamming Pat Cummins for not publicly backing Justin Langer. I have no idea what their relationship was like but if he didn’t want Langer to stay on, then are you saying he should have been two-faced about it? Surely that’s worse? — Brydon Coverdale (@brydoncoverdale) February 5, 2022 Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden criticized the role of players and support staff in deciding the coach’s position. Cummins although said that it was the right step, and the players wanted a new style of coaching set. “To be better players for Australia, from this solid foundation, we need a new style of coaching and skill set,” Cummins said. “This was the feedback the players gave to Cricket Australia. And it’s the feedback I understand support staff also gave.” “We welcome that Cricket Australia invited the players and staff to contribute to CA’s evaluation.” “I add that as professional sportspeople we would have accepted any decision CA were to make because that’s what professionals do.” “CA have made a brave call to transition, given the team has been winning.” The post “We need a new style of coaching and skill set”: Pat Cummins backs Cricket Australia’s decision of not sticking with Justin Langer appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-02-09 03:05:52","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI Dream11 Team Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Hints: Captain, Probable Playing 11s, Team News; Injury Updates For Today’s IND vs WI 2nd ODI at Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad 1:30 PM IST February 9","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-vs-wi-dream11-team-prediction-fantasy-cricket-hints-captain-probable-playing-11s-team-news-injury-updates-for-today-s-ind-vs-wi-2nd-odi-at-narendra-modi-stadium-ahmedabad-130-pm-ist-february-9-2434699.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs West Indies Dream11 Team Prediction India vs West Indies 2nd ODI - Check My Dream11 Team, Best players list of IND vs WI, West Indies Dream11 Team Player List, India Dream11 Team Player List, Dream11 Guru Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips India vs West Indies ODI series, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Playing Tips.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-09 03:02:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mithali Co. look to get ready for WC","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/mithali-co-look-to-get-ready-for-wc-368388","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Queenstown, February 8The Indian women's cricket team will get to fine tune its ODI World Cup preparations in a six-game limited-overs series against hosts New Zealand, beginning with the one-off T20 here tomorrow.The T20 is scheduled ahead of the five ODIs starting February 12.

Last week, Cricket Australia offered the 51-year-old West Australian just a six-month contract extension, prompting him to resign with immediate effect. Assistant coach Andrew McDonald was appointed interim head coach ahead of next month’s Pakistan tour. Watch The Dettol T20 Series Australia vs Sri Lanka. Every Game Live & On-Demand on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > Cummins copped some criticism for not making his position clear leading up to Langer’s resignation, with several former players condemning the pace bowler for refusing to show support for his embattled coach. Ex-teammate Mitchell Johnson was the most scathing, calling the new Test skipper “gutless” . But the New South Welshman has released a statement ahead of Australia’s five-match T20 series against Sri Lanka, explaining the team needed a “new style of coaching and skill set”. Cummins conceded that Langer’s coaching style was “intense”, but denied that players and support took issues with it. The 28-year-old also took a pointed swipe at former players who have slammed him in the media, saying he will continue to stick up for his teammates throughout the transition process. Pat Cummins’ full statement “There has been much public comment since Justin Langer’s resignation as the Coach of the Australian Cricket team,” Cummins said. “For good reason, I haven’t made public comment before today. “To speak about a decision, which was yet to be made and which is for Cricket Australia to make, would have put Cricket Australia and the team in an impossible position. “I’d never do that. “I believe in respecting the sanctity of the change room and proper process. “Now that a decision has been made by Justin to resign and given his own public comments and others by Cricket Australia, I can provide some clarity. “Justin has acknowledged that his style was intense.

Cricket writer Melinda Farrell tweeted: “That’s one heck of a payoff line.” The Age’s Daniel Brettig posted: “That final line is very much to the point.” Code Sports’ Lachlan McKirdy tweeted: “I think it’s a pretty respectful statement considering all that’s gone on and good detail into the thoughts behind the decision. And it’s pretty clear he’s acting in the best interests of his team going forward. The sticking up for his mates line is very strong.” Cummins will speak to the media at Sydney Olympic Park at 1.30pm AEDT on Wednesday. âTo all past players, I want to say this: Just as you have always stuck up for your mates, Iâm sticking up for mine.â - Pat Cummins with a message to the former greats who have lined up current players after Justin Langer's resignation. Langer was appointed national men’s coach in the frenzied turmoil of Australian cricket’s darkest hour following the infamous ball-tampering saga of March 2018. He was tasked with restoring pride in the national team and despite producing mixed results, he left with Australia as the No. 1 ranked Test team, reigning T20 World Cup champions and a 4-0 Ashes triumph. CA chief executive Nick Hockley said in a statement: “Justin has been an outstanding coach of the Australian men’s team over the past four years. “He has restored the trust in the team and his legacy is assured. “We are extremely proud of his achievements since he took over in 2018, including the recent T20 World Cup victory and Ashes success. “We are naturally disappointed Justin has decided against continuing as coach but respect his decision and wish him all the best in the future. “I would like to sincerely thank Justin and also his family for all that they have given to Australian cricket over the past four years, for which we remain eternally grateful.” Test batsman Marnus Labuschagne was among the victims as NSW gained an early ascendancy at the Gabba against Queensland.

The director of the game in England and the national coach have paid the price for the debacle in Australia with their jobs, and possibly their cricketing careers. Ashley Giles , director of England’s men’s cricket, was the first to be shown the door, and deadwood head coach Chris Silverwood followed a day later Giles, of course, cannot be forgiven for giving Silverwood the ultimate power of running the show when he was clearly out of his depth. After the first two losses in Australia, this column mentioned that Silverwood would find himself out in the cold as soon as the team touched down at Heathrow after England just missed a 5-0 whitewash thanks to a desperate last-wicket stand in the fourth Test. I suppose Silverwood was given a few extra days of reprieve to get his laundry done. The house-cleaning continued when Silverwood’s assistant Graham Thorpe also found himself out of the door. Thorpe was the batting specialist, but his team had their bats locked up in cold storage in all five Tests and a leaked video of heavy drinking sessions with the players saw more empties than runs. The only one to escape the axe was captain Joe Root , as his players threw their support behind him. But Root isn’t devoid of this embarrassment Down Under, as he and his coach were responsible for one selection blunder after another. Root gets another chance of putting that horrific show behind him during the tour of the West Indies later this month. The ball has now been handed to former England captain and opening batsman Andrew Strauss to run the national team. The highly-respected Strauss is a first-class administrator who stepped down from office after his late wife Ruth’s struggle with cancer. His temporary return has been applauded by players and fans alike and his first stint in charge was to appoint former all-rounder Paul Collingwood as a fill-in replacement for the tour of the West Indies. Few names that come to mind as to Silverwood’s replacement include former England wicket-keeper Alec Stewart, South African Gary Kirsten , and Andy Flower , the Zimbabwean who previously took England to the top of the Test rankings in 2011 and three Ashes series wins. Kirsten, though would be the ideal choice, as he won the 2011 World Cup with India and then coached South Africa. He was previously bypassed for the job by Silverwood. While the blood-letting in England was expected after that humiliating tour, there was a bombshell dropped in Australia as well. Coach Justin Langer told Cricket Australia to take their job and stuff it. This announcement came out of the blue, as this former legendary opening batsman famous for his grit and intensity found these same characteristics disdained by some on this team. His departure after just winning the Ashes and guiding his country to its first World Twenty20 title left the Aussie public shaking their heads in disbelief. Some of the greats who played with Langer, including Ricky Ponting , Matthew Hayden , and Mitchell Johnson , were among three several high-profile players who criticized some of the “faceless players” who concocted Langer’s downfall. Langer was roped in as coach to restore pride in the national team after the sandpaper scandal in 2018 that reduced the Aussies to a bunch of cheats. Langer, obviously, did a great job in rebuilding the team and restoring trust with the Australian public. But as Cricket Australia sat down to decide on Langer’s four-year contract that ends in June, he was only handed a six-month extension. That was a slap in the face for Langer. Johnson, who reduced England to buttercups with his thunderbolts in the 2013-14 Ashes series, tore a strip off Cricket Australia and current Aussie skipper Pat Cummins in a scathing column for the West Australian. “Cummins holds a lot of power and must have been central to what’s happened,’’ wrote Johnson. “He’s clearly had an agenda to get in a coach he wants. His recent interviews have been gutless by not respecting his coach when he could have been upfront from the start.’’ While England had the simple task of tying the can to Giles and Silverwood, this Langer issue Down Under isn’t going to go away in a hurry with the light focused firmly on Cummins, who was the toast of Australia barely a month ago, and Cricket Australia for failing to stand up for their coach. INDIA ON TOP India won its fifth Under-19 World Cup by defeating England by four wickets in an exciting final played at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Ground in Antigua. In a final between two unbeaten squads England put up 189 and India replied with 195 for six in 47.4 overs. James Rew led England with a fluent 95 and Indian seamers Raj Bawa (five for 31) and Ravi Kumar (four for 34) starred for India.

Seven of those 13 played for Australia. Five of those seven wore the baggy green.

It’s no wonder Sydney-based left-hander Jarrad Burke , who made an unbeaten 100 in the final against South Africa 20 years ago today, declared it the finest youth team ever assembled.

Dan Christian was squeezed out for the final despite averaging 93 for the tournament, and who would have thought journeyman-turned-IPL cash cow Craig Simmons would become a Big Bash sensation 12 years down the track. Then there was George Bailey, Adam Crosthwaite, Aaron Bird, Rob Cassell and Craig Philipson . If you hadn’t heard of Burke, you are either not from Sydney or do not have access to MyCricket. Crosthwaite believes he’s in the top 10 all-rounders ever in Sydney club cricket. A decade ago he played three T20s for NSW and was the player who made way for NRL legend Andrew Johns. At 39, he’s still batting in the middle order for Fairfield, though he concedes the end is near. Even the non-professional cricketer of the group – Adam Fleming - was an outstanding swing bowler for Steve Smith’s club Sutherland, representing NSW in 2nd XI cricket off and on for seven years before back injuries cruelled him. It was on February 9, 2002 Australia won its 14th straight youth ODI, capping off a remarkably dominant tournament. To acknowledge the occasion and take a nostalgic dive back into the on-field stories and off-field shenanigans from two decades ago, foxsports.com.au spoke with nine players and coach Wayne Phillips from the trip. Australia’s cricket team celebrating winning Under-19 world cricket cup over South Africa. Source: AFP THE LEAD UP Australia’s preparation was thorough and organised. Late in 2001, the bulk of the squad toured New Zealand to acclimatise to conditions. Players then competed in the national championships in Adelaide, which led to a 25-man squad being named, including future Australian players Paine, Hilfenhaus and Ferguson. Just before Christmas, the squad was cut to 14. In the winter of 2001, Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin were revealed as the locations for the initial stage of the tournament, with teams staying in university dorm accommodation, much to the frustration of India and Pakistan. “Teams are lodged at Lincoln University hostels where there is only one lavatory and one shower for at least six persons,” a Pakistani newspaper reported. “It is difficult for the boys on the day of the match to be punctual, as they have to queue up for their turn to use the bathroom and lavatory. “Pakistani and Asian players are struggling with frozen meat food.” The report also claimed that players were also having to do their own laundry: “Many of them have this experience in their life for the first time,” it read. A month after the tournament finished, Cricinfo reported that one Indian player, Maninda Bisla, “lost about five kgs and lived mostly on milk and fruit.” The ICC laughed off the claims. “As far as they, and we, are concerned everything is fine,” tournament organiser Tim Murdoch said in response to the initial article. As if India’s complaints about food, accommodation and grounds were not enough, they also accused the ICC of not dealing with a Pakistani bowler’s suspect action during the tournament. Team adviser and 116-Test veteran Dilip Vengsarkar did not hold back in an interview with an Indian publication weeks after the final. “Junaid Zia, their (Pakistan’s) medium pacer, threw the ball blatantly while bowling and would have put Shoaib Akhtar to shame,” he said. Ultimately he was one of three players the ICC sighted for suspect actions during the tournament. Group matches were scheduled to take place from January 19-25, with the top two teams in each of the four groups qualifying for a Super League, to be played at Lincoln and Christchurch. The bottom two teams from each group would play in Auckland. Australia, fresh off whitewashing England across the Tasman in a warm-up series, had the West Indies, Scotland and Kenya to contend with in Group D. “I believe that you can and will win the Youth World Cup,” iconic West Indian fast bowler Wes Hall said pre-tournament of a team which included Dwayne Bravo, Darren Sammy and Ravi Rampaul. “There is no doubt in my mind that you will make the West Indies proud. If you listen to the instructions of your coach and manager, and you all play to the best of your ability, I have no doubt that you will return to the Caribbean as champions.” England, which had a pit stop in Australia en route to New Zealand, had issues of their own. George Bailey explained. “England was in disarray,” he said. “If you go back through their team, not many did much with their careers. We played them in a practice game and their skipper sent a teammate off the field because they were arguing.” India’s captain was gloveman Parthiv Patel, plus they boasted Irfan Pathan and Suresh Raina. Pakistan had future captain Salman Butt and fast bowler Umar Gul. “He has pace and is quite a good prospect,” West Indian great and part-time Pakistan team consultant Clive Lloyd said of Gul pre-tournament. Hosts New Zealand selected Ross Taylor as captain and Jesse Ryder, while Tatenda Taibu – who would be named player of the tournament – was Zimbabwe’s skipper. There was one player in the tournament who had already made his test debut: Bangladesh’s Mohammad Ashraful. Name the senior internationals... Source: FOX SPORTS A RECORD TO SAVIOUR To this day, Australia’s 6-480 in the opening match of the 2002 World Cup is the highest ever score in a youth tournament. The Aussies walloped 21 sixes, with Simmons belting 155 and Marsh 125. In reply, Kenya was bowled out for 50. The final margin: 430 runs, more than 100 runs greater than the next biggest victory in under 19 history. “I wasn’t sure if I’d be playing, but in the first game we took on a mighty Kenyan team,” Simmons said with a hint of sarcasm. “Half of them looked like they hadn’t played cricket before. We were playing on a tiny little ground and SOS (Marsh) and I were hitting them clean out of the stadium.” The venue was Carisbrook, also known in New Zealand as The House of Pain. The location prompted coach Phillips to offer an inspirational video two days out from the first game. “The All Blacks never get beaten there,” Bailey said. “He went for the inspiration angle and showed us a 20-minute video with the lights off. It was designed for everyone to get pumped up. “The lights came on and Mark Cosgrove was fast asleep! It was so funny.” Crosthwaite, who had just finished year 11 and had pipped Paine to be the team’s wicket-keeper, dobbed himself in. “Flippa put an inspirational video of the Wallabies beating the All Blacks down there. Being a Melburnian I wasn’t that interested, plus I was badly hungover, so I nodded off. I got a lot of crap for that when the lights came on.” On the field, whatever motivational tactics the coach decided to use clearly worked. Marsh and Simmons combined for a partnership of 168 in 18 overs, belting 15 sixes between them against the hapless Kenyans. Kenya, which had only qualified automatically because their senior team was progressing on the ODI rankings, had no hope. One bowler finished with 0-95 from 9 overs. “You can imagine after making 480 there was a bit of laughing and carrying on,” Bailey recalled. “But Flip (Wayne Phillips) stormed in, slammed the door and screamed: ‘Right, you blokes, I can hear a lot of laughter out there. Remember one thing, if Kenya wants a bonus point here, they are going to come at us pretty hard!’ The changing room erupted, according to Doherty. “Wayne Phillips’ lunchtime speech was amazing,” he said. “All the boys lost it. It was totally unexpected after we made close to 500.” Phillips added: “The boys looked at me and thought ‘who the f… is this idiot!?’ Cosgrove said: “Then he went over the road to get a coffee and he came back and Kenya were 5 for 9!” In reality, Kenya were 6 for 9, with one of their batters retiring hurt due to cramp. “I’m certain it was because he was terrified of facing Aaron Bird and Robbie Cassell,” Bailey laughed. Phillips agreed: “Aaron Bird was too rapid. The poor batter came off and we were shaking our heads.” Jarrod Burke gets a handshake from his skipper Cameron White. Source: Getty Images THROUGH THE EYES OF ‘FLIP’ Phillips spent much of the tournament creating motifs to engage the boys. It began on the plane trip over, according to Bailey. “In his true style, Flip gathered us all together and told us he’d seen one of the greatest films of all time. He’d taken some great quotes out of it,” Bailey said. It was along the lines of ‘The Greeks don’t write epitaphs, they just live their best lives.’ “That sort of became our theme throughout and the catch cry. Before the semi-final, he spoke to someone who was running the scoreboard and as we walked out to the field it lit up and said: ‘Remember the Greeks!’” Early in the tournament, Phillips realised his message was getting a bit stale. Some members of the squad would zone out when he was speaking. He needed to recapture the spark. To engage the teenagers, he created an acrostic poem: Fun, understanding, cricket, knowledge, (space), tightness, honesty, integrity, sensitivity. If you read the first letter of each word vertically, it said F*** THIS. From then on, he kept it as simple as possible and allowed the batters to bat and the bowlers to bowl with instruction kept to a minimum. The players loved his laid back, slightly left of centre method. “I remember going into selection chats, which was most nights with Flippa,” skipper White said. “He’d have the red wine and cheese and crackers out and we’d talk cricket for a long time. He was very relaxed and created a great environment. “I enjoyed his company as an 18-year-old and have done so ever since. We had a strong relationship.” There was also a solid work-hard, play-hard mantra during the tournament, which Phillips adhered to himself. “I recall a training session where Flippa turned up under the weather,” said Doherty, whose 16 wickets at an average of 9.5 topped all others. “Quite a few of the other teams had come to watch us train. Flippa deliberately got our batters to bowl and our bowlers to bat. “Then he called the training session off halfway through. Batters went to pad up and he was like ‘nah fellas, we are done. The other teams have seen what they need to see.’ “It was a good social tour. Crossy (Crosthwaite) was under age so we had to sneak him around. But he was amongst it, don’t worry about that. Cozzy (Cosgrove) was the oldest 16 year old you’ve ever seen. He led the charge. Socially it was a bloody good tour. We certainly had fun.” Cosgrove himself was disappointed fellow South Australians Ferguson and Cameron Borgas were not selected, but still enjoyed the experience. “Flippa made that trip really enjoyable,” he said. “You knew it was a special team that gelled so well. The hard work paid off. “I batted six and hardly batted for the entire tournament. It was great. We celebrated our wins and enjoyed ourselves.” Fleming, who played four games and now coaches his son’s under-10 team in Sydney, knew he was part of something special. “We had such great quality in the squad, especially the spinners,” he said. “There was a very relaxed atmosphere from the coach which allowed our team to play as well as it did.” Burke added: “It was like a party to be fair. The entire tournament was unbelievable. We trained hard and partied hard when we had days off.” Burke (C) celebrates his 100 not out with teammates Craig Simmons (L) and Daniel Christian (R). Source: Getty Images MOMENTUM In the first 10 days of the tournament, Australia defeated Kenya, West Indies, Scotland, South Africa and England. The 116-run win over England was particularly satisfying for Crosthwaite, who was awarded man of the match for his 49 from 26 balls as he and Bailey combined for an unbeaten stand of 85 from the final six overs of the innings. “Adam’s performance today was most impressive,” Australia coach Phillips told local reporters at the time. “He’s a tremendously skilful young man.” England then lost 7-53 in reply, with Beau Casson snaring 4-33 from 10 overs. Future international Nick Compton had a dirty day, crawling to 12 from 49 balls before Bird had him caught behind. Earlier, he dropped three critical catches: Burke, Bailey and Crosthwaite. “I remember him in tears afterwards,” Bailey said of Compton. Crosthwaite added: “We just kept hitting the ball to him and he kept spilling it. Mine was a dolly at deep mid-wicket which went down. We knew It was one of those days where we just banged up on them. It was nice. “George and I went crazy. Everytime I walked out to bat we were in a really good position so I could play with freedom.” England team manager James Whittaker said: “It was a shame that we dropped three vital catches and three different players all got established.” Five days earlier, White – who along with Marsh and Doherty was one of three players to have made his Shield debut before the World Cup – was at his destructive best against Scotland. The skipper came to the crease with his team 2-48, and left with red ink at 5-335. He and Dan Christian (93 from 88 balls) put on 212, which remains the highest ever partnership for the fourth wicket in youth cricket. The Scots were never in the hunt, bundled out for 106. After the Scotland victory, Cricinfo described Bird as a “Jason Gillespie lookalike.” White also made 80 to see the Aussies home against the Kiwis on February 1. From there, they had a week’s break before the semi-final against the West Indies. “We went bungee jumping the day before the semi-final,” Crosthwaite said. “Flip didn’t think I’d do it so he paid for my jump. But he said he’d only pay if we got nude. “So there Dan Christian and I were taking our clothes off but they wouldn’t let us, so we did it in our budgie smugglers. It was totally bizarre. And just before a World Cup semi-final! Throughout this period of matches, Australia was challenged incrementally but always came out on top. Aside from the England game where Doherty was rotated out, Phillips selected four tweakers in each XI. Casson and White provided wrist spin, while Doherty and all-rounder Burke were both left-arm orthodox bowlers. “We’d go with two quicks and four spinners,” Crosthwaite continued. “Doherty was awesome and nobody could pick Casson’s wrong-un. When a right-hander came in, we all knew the first ball would spin away from the bat.” Bailey added: “We won it with spin. We were bowling upwards of 35 overs of spin each game. We squeezed and had a good fielding team.” “If they were sub-continent conditions we would have had other teams bowl lots of spin to us,” Doherty said. “But we had good spinners with guys who had experience under their belts. In junior cricket, young batters struggle against good spin... We bowled a lot of spin, which suited me.” Bird (L) and Craig Simmonds (R) congratulate 100 not out man Jarrad Burke. Source: Getty Images THE MORE THINGS CHANGE, THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME Picked on the same side of the draw, India and Pakistan played against each other on January 31. Pakistan successfully chased down India’s 181 with two wickets in hand, but it was the off-field gestures that made headlines. “A diplomatic incident occurred at the ICC Under-19 World Cup today between the Indian and Pakistan sides - but it was not the sort of incident to cause antagonism or shame,” Cricinfo reported. “It was a moment of pride, for both countries, as they put aside the differences being experienced on the Kashmir frontier. “It was a moment of joy, as the two teams went into a marquee at the ground after the game and embraced, each player, manager, fitness trainer, the works.” Salman Butt, who made 85 and captained Pakistan, spoke after the win. “We don’t want this, this is our game. We are not at the border, we are not at the war. “We are going to play at the next level of the game against each other. We want to play in a brotherly manner.” Since then, the two countries have played five bilateral one-day series’ at senior level and just one since 2008. CRUNCH TIME Australia’s win over the West Indies in the semi-final was more difficult than the scorecard would have you believe. Chasing 253 to win, the West Indies were cruising at 2-102 in the 20th over. Enter Doherty (2-26) and Casson (2-28). The pair stifled the West Indians, who could only muster 61 runs between overs 20 and 40, losing 8-57 to send the Aussies into the final. “I still think the West Indies were the second-best team in that competition,” Cosgrove said. “Our spinners got us through in that one.” As a fresh-faced gloveman picked ahead of Paine because he was more “flamboyant,” according to Phillips, Crosthwaite was in awe of the West Indies. “I was 17 at the time and played against some those guys who looked 35,” he laughed. “They were massive. There was a player who had the highest pitched voice I’d ever heard and was the tallest guy I’d ever seen. His name was Ryan Nurse.” Nurse, a right-arm pace bowler, would finish the tournament his team’s leading wicket-taker and fifth overall. From Barbados, he notched 16 first-class appearances, the last of which was in 2006, though Crosthwaite remembers him clearly. “These guys were the coolest cats in the world.” Bailey explains rationale for Test squad | 01:42 THE FINAL Australia were heavy favourites heading into the final. But of all the teams they had overcome so far, South Africa had pushed them the furthest. On January 28, the Aussies defeated the Proteas by five wickets. The big danger two weeks later was Hashim Amla, who had been playing first-class cricket for two years already. Before the match, Australia received messages of support from national captain Steve Waugh – who was playing his last limited overs games for Australia in the VB series – and Perth-based Simmons took calls from Michael Hussey, Justin Langer and Adam Gilchrist. South Africa’s captain appeared in ominous form early in the match, moving to 29 from 34 balls. “I ran Hashim Amla out in the final just quietly,” Bailey said. Doherty was bowling at the time. “Hashim Amla was the star and Bails ran him out in the final,” he said. “Apart from SOS, Amla was the one everyone was talking about. “It was a little dab to point off my bowling, then an under arm from Bailey would have hit the bowler’s end stumps. Out!” Amla conceded it was his fault when quizzed after the match. “My own run out was definitely a big turning point. We had lost two quick wickets earlier and we had started to peg them back. It was my fault and I will definitely learn from the experience.” White completes the run out South Africa's captain Hamish Amla during the U/19 World Cup cricket final. Source: Getty Images From 2-82, South Africa limped to 9-206. Amla later admitted they needed at least 220. Australia passed the target three down and with almost five overs to spare, but not before a mid-pitch collision between Burke and Marsh that saw the latter run out for 35. “Shaun and I hit each other pretty hard,” Burke remembered. “We were both watching the ball as I was coming back for two. He landed on his back and I stayed on my feet. He ended up getting run out.” Crosthwaite added: “It was that left-hander thing where they hit the ball and run across the pitch. “It was weird. Shaun was a prodigy and we were like ‘oh my god, he is our best player.’ But in the end the rest of the boys got it done easily. Shaun came off second best though.” Burke was on 96 when Australia required two runs to win. At the other end was Bailey, who had just replaced White at the crease. “We needed six to win and George Bailey and I got it down to two to win,” Burke said. “Bails said to me ‘you are either going to hit a two or a four, or we will lose the game’. It was a phenomenal group of blokes to be honest. “Then I edged one through slips!” White added: “We had a bloke by the name of Jarrad Burke in our team who is a NSW multiple record holder in first grade for wickets and runs. He bowled 10 overs most games and made a ton in the final.” Simmons believes Burke would have played more professional cricket if he had moved interstate. “He was a really good cricketer and he’s still playing,” he said. “He was in the squad at NSW for a while. But that state is so strong and it’s hard to get an opportunity.” CELEBRATIONS The Australians celebrated long and hard into the night. After getting asked to leave a Christchurch nightclub, Bailey organised for him and five teammates to sleep on the pitch. “I remember getting kicked out of a nightclub after we won it in Christchurch,” Cosgrove said. “That was good fun. I snuck in with a couple of the older boys.” As for Fleming? “I also remember getting kicked out of a nightclub in Christchurch,” he laughed. “They were going around checking everyone’s ID to see if they had an Aussie one so they would get kicked out. They realised that we had drunk enough and it was time to go home.” Doherty was part of the group that slept under the stars. “It was a beautiful clear February night,” he said. “We knocked off South Africa. The wicket was hard as a rock. It was probably the hardest deck you can imagine. We popped a couple of mattresses down there and got up and flew home the next morning. “We climbed a few flagpoles and pinched some memorabilia and got in some strife for that. We had a bloody good time.” In Fairfax papers back in Australia, comparisons were already being made. “The top three, all left-handers (Burke, Simmons and Marsh), echoed Australia’s opening trio of Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer,” one article declared. The tournament victory is one of just two for Australia since 1998, when the ICC mandated a biannual under-19 World Cup. In 2004, Crosthwaite returned as keeper, while Paine was captain. But the Aussies never recovered from Ferguson’s knee injury on the eve of the tournament and the title was won by Pakistan. Just as his older brother did in 2002 Mitch Marsh was a key member of Australia’s 2010 triumph - also in New Zealand . On Wednesday, the 20-year anniversary of their 2002 triumph, the players and coach share a special bond that will never be broken. “The team we had was pretty bloody extraordinary,” Doherty said. “I don’t think there has been a better team that has played in an under-19 World Cup,” Burke added. “It wasn’t taking the piss, it was just ruthless cricket that we played throughout,” Crosthwaite said. “I still look back and think about some of the names and consider how good the team was. It was very good,” White said. As for Cosgrove, who still plays club cricket in Adelaide, he will never stop talking about the success he was part of. “I can’t believe it was 20 years,” he told foxsports.com.au . “It’s gone so quickly. I still bump into guys like Whitey and Marsh and we reminisce about the time when we dominated the world so easily.” The winning moment. Source: Getty Images WAYNE PHILLIPS ON EVERY PLAYER: CRAIG SIMMONS (WA) He was quiet and there was nothing fancy about the great man as a left-handed opening bat. That’s him to a tee. He was a bit nervy and not quite sure if he was up to it. We believed in him and he got it done. A beauty. JARRAD BURKE (NSW) Top of the order who knew so much about the game. He was almost un-coachable because he knew more about cricket than I did! AARON BIRD (NSW) A seriously fast bowler and we threw him the new ball. We believed in what he had and he landed them well for us throughout the tournament. ADAM FLEMING (NSW) He didn’t have the pace but had good control and swing. He did really well, was quiet and a good contributor. If not for injuries, he would have played first-class cricket. CRAIG PHILLIPSON (QLD) From Queensland, he was around the mark the entire time. He never dominated but was always there making a contribution. XAVIER DOHERTY (TAS) He was left arm, throw it to him, no problems at all. Cameron White was great with him so we knew he would land his 10 overs, no problems at all. Fantastic fella. ADAM CROSTHWAITE (VIC) He was a ripper who had some scallywag about him as the keeper. He did it very well. In the team photo sure enough, there he is in the front row. He set the standard and did all the things that a keeper needed to do. He just had a little bit more flamboyance I suppose than Tim at the time in one-day cricket. That was Crossy. He had some spark about him and we were keen on that. It worked well. CAMERON WHITE (VIC) He was the best young man. I still speak with him. I’m mortified he is not my son in law. I have two daughters, both of whom have married other men (laughs)! He was outstanding and has maintained that attitude and ability. The easiest selection of all time. ROB CASSELL (VIC) He has done bloody well. He was so darn reliable. If we needed something done, he’d be ready to go. No issue ever with him BEAU CASSON (WA) He was a bit different with that left-arm wrist spin. He was organised, disciplined and very talented. DAN CHRISTIAN (NSW) I still see him on TV and he still sends me text messages! He was a real character and had great hitting ability. In one game he came in at the end and belted these poor kids. It was unnecessary! He was more of a bowler then and a lower order hitter, rather than a batter. MARK COSGROVE (SA) He had some flair about him and a scallywag who I knew from Adelaide. I love still seeing him and sharing memories from that tour. SHAUN MARSH (WA) Batted at the top of the order and was classy the way he went about it. It’s how he went through his entire career. It was fairly quiet after that run out and thankfully Whitey came in and put it all to bed in the final. GEORGE BAILEY (TAS) When Whitey needed a break, we could go to George no problem at all. He fitted in perfectly. He also made important runs.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The system shake-up Australian cricket needs","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/justin-langer-australia-coach-quits-pat-cummins-captain-ian-chappell-opinion-news/78f32029-98c0-4bc0-a63a-d7e851434fb0","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket legend Ian Chappell staunchly believes a Test team shouldn't need a head coach, and the captain needs to be the top dog.","content":"Cricket legend Ian Chappell staunchly believes a Test team shouldn't need a head coach.And if the modern game insists on them, Chappell says the captain should still hold the most power over on-field decisions and the team.His comments come in the wake of a disastrous week for Australian cricket, in which Justin Langer quit his post as national men's coach, prompting bitter former teammates to come out all guns blazing in the media.READ MORE: Chinese censors intervene after Olympic fiascoREAD MORE: IOC president's Peng Shuai revelation raises fresh questionsREAD MORE: Legend's warning for stars in wake of Langer dramaIt reached a farcical crescendo on Sunday when retired firebrand bowler Mitchell Johnson labelled current Test captain Pat Cummins \"gutless\" and accused him - and his teammates - of white-anting Langer.Chappell is not in the same camp as the former players, instead siding squarely with Cummins and his peers.\"I don't believe in coaches.

After an action-packed IPL retention and draft events, wherein the 10 franchises brainstormed their ways towards deciding upon their picks for the new season, a majority of them would need to seal their wicketkeeper-batter berth during the imminent mega auction. Barring the Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Rajasthan Royals (RR), Lucknow Super Giants, and Delhi Capitals, where their respective skippers are the keeper-batter options, other 6 franchises would go neck-to-neck to bid for the best suited option from the pool of players. The aforementioned 4 teams would also need a back-up option or two, which might well lead to a bidding war like no other in the auction history. Let’s look at the top 5 potential names who might earn loads during the bidding war amongst the franchises. IPL 2022 mega auction wicketkeepers Quinton de Kock This Proteas wicketkeeper-batter has to be the most sought-after wicketkeeper option at the auction tables. Having been placed amongst the 10 marquee names in the auction list, QdK is also the lone wicketkeeper-batter in the list, which might well lead to an intense bidding war, with Mumbai Indians (MI) most likely to be at the helm for his acquisition. During the previous season of the league, the 29-year-old was MI’s third-highest run-scorer with a total of 297 runs at an average of 29.70. During their title-winning run in the 2020 season, the wicketkeeper-batter had amassed 503 runs at an average of 35.92, including 4 half-centuries. During the previous 3 years of his stay at the MI camp, QdK has amassed a total of 1329 runs- the most for his team during that period, and sixth-highest overall in the IPL. Moreover, the fact that he is available for the entire season gives him a further edge over other players. Ishan Kishan He was the expected to be the most sought-after wicketkeeper-batter during the mega auction. But, with QdK’s inclusion in the marquee list, Ishan Kishan has perhaps lost out on some decent, additional bidding given that now he would come lower down the order in the capped-wicketkeepers’ list. During the 2020 season, Kishan was MI’s highest run-scorer with a total of 516 runs across 13 innings, at an average of 57.33. Additionally, he smashed 30 sixes- the most by a player in that season. Anything below INR 10 Crore for this pocket-sized dynamo would be a legit steal for any franchise. Ishan Kishan may become the most expensive buy in IPL auctions 2022. — Abhishek Mukherjee (@ovshake42) January 29, 2022 ALSO READ: 5 uncapped players IPL teams might target Jonny Bairstow Very few Overseas batters have been successful in the IPL, and England’s Jonny Bairstow is one of them. Ever since his inclusion in the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2019, his partnership with David Warner had been one of the biggest positives for the ‘Orange Army’ alongside Rashid Khan. From 2019-2021, Bairstow has scored 1038 runs at an average of 41.52 and a strike rate of 142.19 for SRH. Bought at mere INR 2.2 Crore during the 2019 auction, expect this English opening batter to earn loads this time around. KS Bharat Brought at a base price of INR 20 Lakh during the IPL 2021 auction by the RCB, KS Bharat had been a blessing for the franchise the previous season. Despite having batted in mere 7 innings for them in the previous season, his 191 runs at an average of 38.20, including a 52-ball 78* against the table toppers Delhi Capitals, helped him garner plenty eyeballs despite limited opportunities. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy last year, Bharat became only the second batter after Prithvi Shaw to hit consecutive 150+ scores in 50-Overs Cricket. Additionally, with the probability of majority franchises looking for an Indian wicket-keeping option or two in their squad, this 28-year-old wicketkeeper from Andhra Pradesh has it all for the franchises to fight for him in their squad. Matthew Wade His 41* off 17 deliveries at a strike rate of 241.17 against Pakistan during the semi-final of the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup was not a fluke by any means. Post that, he ended his Big Bash League (2021-22) season as the third-highest run-getter for the Hobart Hurricanes, smashing 325 runs across 13 innings, at a strike rate of 134.85. On the basis of recent form, this Southpaw batter is likely to earn more than someone like a Nicholas Pooran or Dinesh Karthik. He might well receive a snub as well if franchises opt for IPL experience.
