After the game was reduced to 18 overs a side due to delayed start, Pakistan won a crucial toss and decided to bat first. However, the Pakistani batters failed to show their potential and were bowled out for only 99, a target easily reached by India, who had been defeated by Australia in their opening game the other day. Opener Muneeba Ali remained the top-scorer for Pakistan, making a 30-ball 32, striking three fours and one six. Aliya Riaz chipped in with a 22-ball 18 which included two fours. Skipper Bismah Maroof, who came at No3, managed 22-ball 18 which had two hits to the fence. Omaima Sohail and Ayesha Naseem scored ten runs each. India’s spinners Sneh Rana (2-15) and Radha Yadav (2-18) did the main damage. India raced to the target in only the 12th over after losing just two wickets. Smriti Mandhana smashed a fantastic 63 not out, striking eight fours and three sixes. aShafali Verma made a nine-ball 16 with two fours and one six. Sabbhineni Meghana scored a 16-ball 14 which included two fours. Leg-spinner Tuba Hassan and Omaima Sohail got one wicket each. This was the second loss for Pakistan and they are now out of the semi-finals race. Pakistan had been beaten by Barbados by 15 runs in their first game. Pakistan rested their key all-rounder Nida Dar due to concussion. Nida had been hit on her helmet in the first game against Barbados. A PCB spokesman said that she is well but will remain under observation for five days. Nida had hit unbeaten 50 in Pakistan’s lost cause against Barbados. Smriti Mandhana was declared as player of the match for her super fifty.","pubDate":"2022-08-01 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Proteas young gun takes a catch for the ages!","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/proteas-young-gun-takes-a-catch-for-the-ages/video/6b423aed3d2880071674a484b0943001","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: South African young gun Tristan Stubbs pulled off a magnificent catch to dismiss England's Moeen Ali during the 3rd T20I","content":"Cricket: South African young gun Tristan Stubbs pulled off a magnificent catch to dismiss England's Moeen Ali during the 3rd T20I","pubDate":"2022-07-31 23:58:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Canadian cricketers make short work of Malaysia in Challenge League play","link":"https://www.richmond-news.com/national-sports/canadian-cricketers-make-short-work-of-malaysia-in-challenge-league-play-5645165","keywords":null,"creator":["Canadian Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"KING CITY, Ont. — Harsh Thaker scored 57 runs not out and Saad Bin Zafar took five wickets to help Canada to a dominant 121-run victory over Malaysia in ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League A play Sunday.","content":"KING CITY, Ont. — Harsh Thaker scored 57 runs not out and Saad Bin Zafar took five wickets to help Canada to a dominant 121-run victory over Malaysia in ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League A play Sunday. Canada won the toss and elected to bat first. Opener Rayyan Pathan scored 49 and Shreyas Movva added 39 as Canada finished 239 for eight after its 50 overs. Malaysia was all out for 118 in the 30th over. The six-team tournament, which runs through Aug. 7 at the Maple Leaf Cricket Club, is part of the World Cup qualifying process. Denmark, Malaysia, Qatar, Singapore and Vanuatu are also taking part. The Canadian men, who previously defeated Denmark and Singapore, take on Qatar on Wednesday. The Challenge Leagues are a 2 1/2-year competition involving 12 teams considered three steps away from the 2023 World Cup. The King City event was originally slated to be held last August but was pushed back due to the pandemic. There are two Challenge Leagues, A and B, each comprising six teams that play 15 matches each over two years. Canada is in Group A while Group B is made up of Bermuda, Hong Kong, Italy, Jersey, Kenya and Uganda. Canada currently tops Group A at 7-1 while Uganda heads Group B at 8-2. The top team in each league at the end of the competition will secure two of the six places in the Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier Playoff to be held later in 2022, alongside the bottom four of Men’s CWC League 2. The top two teams from the playoff continue in the hunt to participate in India 2023. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 31, 2022 The Canadian Press","pubDate":"2022-07-31 22:31:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"richmond-news","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LeBron James’ 2021 $37 million salary is insanely higher than entire WNBA’s salary combined","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/nba-news-lebron-james-2021-37-million-salary-is-insanely-higher-than-entire-wnbas-salary-combined/","keywords":["Basketball","Lebron James","Los Angeles Lakers","NBA","WNBA"],"creator":["Ashish Priyadarshi"],"video_url":null,"description":"LeBron James is a wealthy man, and he’s making a great deal of money for the Lakers.

It may surprise you, but he earns more than the entire WNBA salaries combined. A new collective bargaining deal in 2021 helped WNBA players earn a lot more money than they were used to making. However, the point remains that the disparity between women’s and men’s sports still stands. All-star guard Jewell Lloyd is the highest paid WNBA player on a per-year basis after she signed a two-year, $463,030 contract for a salary of $231,515. Meanwhile, the veteran minimum in the NBA is at $1.81 million. The WNBA and women’s sports across the world are looking for ways to find equal pay, but the fight remains long and tough. New Zealand broke major ground in this venture when they announced that their women’s cricket team would earn the same money from matches as their men’s team. The NBA and WNBA are still a ways off this mark. Recently, a post went viral showing how LeBron’s salary was more than the WNBA’s entire salary, and if that doesn’t show the gap between the two leagues, nothing does. This is a crazy stat. LeBron really gets paid more than the entirety of the WNBA 🤯 pic.twitter.com/Ql7hd4qYQA — NBA Memes (@NBAMemes) July 31, 2022 Also Read: $2.1 billion worth Michael Jordan’s $100 million spending on social justice shows he is more than mansions and cars In 2021, the collective bargaining agreement for the WNBA gave players more money. The base super-max salary was set at $221,450 for the 2021 WNBA season while the base max deal was $190,550. The minimum a player could make is $58,710. The new CBA set a higher salary cap too. The cap was set at $1,339,000. This money is distributed among the 11-12 players on a WNBA roster. With 12 teams in the league, a salary cap of about $1.3 million sets the total salary in the league at roughly $15.6 million. Of course, not all teams occupy at the cap, and so the total salary for the league stands at the $12 million mark mentioned earlier. LeBron James’ 2021 salary more than triples that total salary. He earned $37 million for the season, showing that he’s head and shoulders above the entire league. Of course, it’s not just LeBron who’s making more than the WNBA. Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and about 100 other NBA players earned more than the $12 million mark the WNBA is set at.

But I wanted to come along too and watch since Pakistan women were playing,” she said of her first trip to a stadium not 10 minutes from her home, but one she never considered she’d walk into, having only a mild passing interest in the sport. A women’s sport wave has been sweeping over England all of this last week, with the football team becoming European Women’s champions beating Germany in the final. “It’s not like anyone stopped me. But I never felt like watching men’s cricket. But Indian women vs Pakistan women I didn’t want to miss at all,” says the mother, out-numbered at least five to one by Indian families who thronged Edgbaston, including a bunch who came down from London to introduce their young daughters to the sport. That India-Pakistan is pencilled into any big cricket event as a certainty of a pool game is a given. However, the Commonwealth Games were banking on a Sunday blockbuster, hoping the women’s game could draw out the large diaspora of Birmingham into the stadium. Not many could predict how shockingly one-sided it eventually was – the Indian crowds out-screaming Pakistan ones, in the same way their team dished out a 8-wicket dismissal of Pakistan’s hopes. 𝐀𝐋𝐋 𝐎𝐕𝐄𝐑! Clinical with the ball & splendid with the bat, 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐛𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐏𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧 by 8 wickets in their 2nd Commonwealth Games match. 👏 👏 Vice-captain @mandhana_smriti smashes 63*. 🙌 🙌 Scorecard ▶️ https://t.co/6xtXSkd1O7 #B2022 #TeamIndia #INDvPAK pic.twitter.com/MVUX3yFO4s — BCCI Women (@BCCIWomen) July 31, 2022 India stuck to their bowling plans, and then Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Varma kept it clinical, for a fairly easy win, with an eye on advancement. Pakistan, without the concussed Nida Dar, lacked any firepower and got nicely rolled over. But for the Games, it was the anticipation of getting bums on seats that this game held any significance. Women’s cricket can tease out the ‘family crowds’ – women and children not always smitten by cricket, but amazed at young women having a go at team sport and turning up to watch them – and there was no better city than Birmingham with its ethnic composition to target that South Asian base. Means much more to Pak Barney, a British Pakistani from Worcestershire, runs an “Asian-only” club called ‘Kempsey’, where his daughter plays cricket on a girls’ team they are beginning to put together. He trekked up to Birmingham to take cues on how to grow his women’s team, alongwith other members of his club – Hindus and Sikhs as well. “In our community, there are several restrictions on women playing sport because of the dress code. But cricket is fully clothed, so it was easier to encourage my daughter to play it. It’s excellent to watch the Pakistan team play and show our girls that this is possible. Sure, little girls have watched men’s teams for years and been fans. But it’s different when they have to start playing. Watching Harmanpreet (Kaur) and (Smrit) Mandhana of India, watching Nida Dar, those are role models,” Barney says. “We do things together here – Indians and Pakistanis. We socialise, we have colleagues from the other country, we eat together. And of course, we watch cricket together. We can fill up any stadium, so why not for the girls?” he says. Pakistan won the Asian Games gold in 2010, and then captain and top bowler Sana Mir had said that the gold in the 50-over format made Pakistan realise that women could win big in sport. The follow-up didn’t materialise, but for a nation starved of sportswomen competing at the topmost level, T20 cricket is the most obvious bet for things to get properly serious. 📹 From 50/1 to 99 all out, Pakistan’s batting lineup collapsed like a house of cards against #TeamIndia in #CWG2022 🃏💪 #INDvPAK #BirminghamMeinJitegaHindustanHamara 🫶 #B2022 #SonySportsNetwork #SirfSonyPeDikhega pic.twitter.com/kis89f94AF — Sony Sports Network (@SonySportsNetwk) July 31, 2022 Nobel laureate Malala Yousufzai visited the Pak dressing room after their loss to Barbados, and a goodly crowd lingered on to watch both role models – in sport and education – from up close. “Women’s cricket deserves a chance to become a popular sport on its own. I came to the Games only because it was women and India-Pakistan,” says Shaz. A fight we’ve won: Harman It might still need hyphenating with Pakistan in Birmingham and the general cheer of the Games, but the number of Indian fans who trooped in on Sunday, hoping to catch another Harman blinder, was tremendous. The Indian captain’s 2017 innings against Australia in the World Cup semifinal is stuff of legend, but after the win on Sunday, Harman admitted to another fight women have won. “When I started playing cricket, we had no crowds. I knew it is a fight we will have to fight to get people to come in and watch us. It can’t be just because they want to support “women”. We needed to perform and entertain, and play good matches and win to attract crowds. Now I can say, we are doing that,” she would say. Young girls would walk up to her and tell her they wanted to become like her. “It feels nice when they say that we are the reason they want to play cricket,” she says.

While India skipper Rohit Sharma scored a brilliant half-century (64 off 44) after nine T20Is, wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik (41 off 19) played the role of a finisher yet again with absolute finesse. As for the bowling department, each of the six bowlers played their part almost perfectly, to keep a strong Windies batting order quiet throughout the chase. The Warner Park is set to host its eleventh T20I tomorrow, with the last one played at this venue back in January 2020 between West Indies and Ireland, which saw the home side triumph by 9 wickets.

That one was a little scary for me, purely because I was new to the Indian team at the time. ‘Did we do something wrong’ I wondered? I won’t say what was discussed in it, but let me tell you this much: A ‘Players Only’ meeting means the sh*t is getting real. The Indian women’s cricket team recently had a ‘Player’s Only’ meeting, ahead of their tour to Sri Lanka last month. And judging by what we’ve seen from India on the field since then, it was not a scary one. It was a good one. India whitewashed Sri Lanka in the ODI series. India won the T20I series 2-1. These were expected results. But then India came to the Commonwealth Games, and pushed Australia like few teams have in the recent past, coming very close to beating them. If Australia were pushed, Pakistan were pulverised. Once Pakistan’s 50-run second wicket stand was snapped, India strangled the rest of the batting, claiming the next eight wickets for 49 runs. And then, Smriti Mandhana put the foot on the proverbial throat, smashing the fifth ball she faced for six over mid on. India chased down Pakistan’s target of 100 in the 12th over losing two wickets, operating at a run rate close to 9. There were no jitters, no opportunity to let the chatter around an India-Pakistan game affect them. It was about getting the job done. While entertaining the crowd, the largest seen at Edgbaston so far. And it was deliberate: “The message is clear for us. Before the Sri Lanka series we definitely had a word about it, talking about the kind of culture we want to set for for the next generation and the kind of cricket we want to play for the next few years” said Mandhana, who finished with 63* off 42. “We took all the inputs from all the players and all the inputs were definitely in one direction: that we have to go out there and just be little more aggressive than what we have been.” This aggression looks like calculated risk-taking, the kind we saw from Harmanpreet Kaur, who successfully backed her sweep against Australia despite that team sometimes setting two deep square legs to her. And Mandhana, focusing on timing the ball rather than smashing it like her opening partner Shafali Verma does. “It’s not about taking unnecessary risk, but you know, expressing ourselves.” That term may be cliche in the elite sporting world, but it’s also significant that a group of Indian female players identified it. “That was one takeaway all 15 of us actually believed in. That thought of going out there and trying to set the culture for the generations to come. Hopefully we can set a standard where we reach closer to winning regularly.” This was the same meeting in which, as Harmanpreet shared, a younger member of the team came up with the thought of developing the ‘killing attitude’. “I had asked all the girls, what is the thing that we want to set for the team? Pooja (Vastrakar) gave a good answer, that killing attitude. Right now, we’re working for that. Whenever we are doing something, playing or training, we are trying to create that mahaul jaha pe sab isi ke upar baat karte hai. That killing attitude is something everyone is talking about and working on.” It’s too early to say how far this new attitude will take the Indian team. But players taking ownership, independent of the team management, is a step in the right direction. One thing can be said with confidence: the Edgbaston crowd contained plenty of young boys and girls. If this is the next generation Mandhana is looking to influence, what they saw on Sunday will surely leave a good impression.

During the third T20I of the ongoing South Africa’s tour of England in Southampton, rookie South Africa batter Tristan Stubbs excelled on the field to put on display a memorable catch. It all happened at the halfway mark of the innings when Stubbs didn’t let go of a minuscule catching opportunity. Playing his first match of the series, South Africa batter Aiden Markram managed to get more bounce on a delivery only to pick a wicket. Wanting to nudge a Markram delivery on the off-side, Ali ended up spooning the ball towards cover where Stubbs pulled off a spectacular catch. Taking a few steps to his left to make the ground, Stubbs then timed his dive to perfection to catch the with one hand whilst being airborne. Shocked by the proceedings, Ali returned to the pavilion at The Rose Bowl after scoring 3 (5). The 35-year old player was part of a batting collapse which bundled out England for 101 in 16.4 overs in a 192-run chase. Ali, who himself picked a wicket in his only over this evening, saw Markram doing the same in the second innings. Opening the bowling for the visitors, spinner Keshav Maharaj picked a couple of wickets but fellow spinner Tabraiz Shamsi won the laurels on the back of career-best bowling figures of 4-0-24-5. A 90-run victory powered South Africa to a 2-1 series victory after the ODI series had resulted in a 1-1 draw earlier this month.

Defending men’s champions Southern Braves will host and take on the Welsh Fire in the tournament opener at the Ageas Bowl on August 3, while women’s champion the Oval Invincibles would host Northern Superchargers at The Kia Oval on August 11, as the second edition of the much anticipated ‘The Hundred’ is all set to get underway. Eight men’s sides would play eight group stage matches each – one each against six other teams, while twice against their regional nearest rival. On the other hand, the eight women’s sides would only play six group stage matches each, as they begin their second season a week late, owing to their participation in the ongoing Commonwealth Games 2022. The development means that some teams would not meet during the group stage. All match days from August 11 (the day women begin their season) will be double-headers with men’s and women’s games on the same day, and at the same venue. The Hundred TV coverage Sky Sports will telecast all the men’s and women’s fixtures of the competition in England live after payment of a subscription fee, while the BBC will also telecast 18 selected matches (as per their agreement with the ECB) live on free-to-air television, including both finals from Lord’s on September 3.

While the India and Pakistan rivalry is centred around men's cricket, the women fully understand its significance and their increasing role in it. With Birmingham recognised as one of Britain's most diverse cities with large Indian and Pakistani communities the crowd at the Edgbaston oval was the largest of the tournament. The atmosphere outside the ground on a drizzly morning was more family outing than the hysteria that usually follows a men's meeting as fathers and mothers with children in tow soaked up the fun. \"It's just a game at the end of the day but a good game,\" summed up one father in an India jersey accompanied by four young girls. The occasion was not lost on the players or the fans, the cheering was loud and constant. At the conclusion no one was leaving Egbaston and setting themselves on fire, as distraught fans have done in the past when results have not gone their way, but the smiles on the faces of India supporters signalled their trip home was going to be a more up beat one. \"It is always a special feeling when you play against Pakistan but I would like to say it is just another game and not like, \"ohhhh Pakistan\",\" said Sneh Rana. \"But it is a good game always. \"It is a special feeling.\" (Reporting by Steve Keating in Birmigham, additional reporting Shrivathsa Sridhar, Editing by Ed Osmond)","pubDate":"2022-07-31 16:27:00","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/08/01/1679869.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my","country":["malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LIVE ENG vs SA 3rd T20I Score: Jos Buttler Departs After Sluggish Knock - Cricket Country News","link":"https://news.google.com/__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?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LIVE ENG vs SA 3rd T20I Score: Jos Buttler Departs After Sluggish Knock  Cricket Country NewsENG vs SA Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- South Africa Tour of England, 3rd T20I  Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - South Africa vs England, South Africa in England 2022, 3rd T20I  ESPNcricinfoShamsi 5-24 Seals Series | Highlights - England v South Africa | 3rd Men's Vitality IT20 2022  England & Wales Cricket BoardEngland v South Africa | 3rd T20 | The match in 5  SuperSportView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-31 16:24:40","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Games-'Friendly Games' have an edge when India play Pakistan at cricket","link":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/games-friendly-games-have-edge-when-india-play-pakistan-cricket-2848481","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"BIRMINGHAM, England: The Commonwealth Games like to be referred to as the \"Friendly Games\" and up until Sunday (Jul 31) even India and Pakistan cricketers had bought into the idea.

With Birmingham recognised as one of Britain's most diverse cities with large Indian and Pakistani communities the crowd at the Edgbaston oval was the largest of the tournament. The atmosphere outside the ground on a drizzly morning was more family outing than the hysteria that usually follows a men's meeting as fathers and mothers with children in tow soaked up the fun. \"It's just a game at the end of the day but a good game,\" summed up one father in an India jersey accompanied by four young girls. The occasion was not lost on the players or the fans, the cheering was loud and constant. At the conclusion no one was leaving Egbaston and setting themselves on fire, as distraught fans have done in the past when results have not gone their way, but the smiles on the faces of India supporters signalled their trip home was going to be a more up beat one. \"It is always a special feeling when you play against Pakistan but I would like to say it is just another game and not like, 'ohhhh Pakistan',\" said Sneh Rana. \"But it is a good game always. \"It is a special feeling.\" Catch the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games LIVE on meWATCH.

The second T20I of the ongoing India’s tour of West Indies will be played in Basseterre tomorrow as the venue will welcome back international cricket after more than 30 months. The last international match at the Warner Park was a West Indies vs Ireland T20I before the COVID-19 pandemic. West Indies, who’ve won all the 10 T20Is played at this venue, have a praiseworthy record on the back of six victories and two losses in the last 13 years. ALSO READ: Warner Park pitch report for second West Indies vs India T20I India, on the other hand, will be playing their first-ever T20I here on Monday. Having played an ODI and Test match in St Kitts during their 2006 tour of West Indies, India will be playing a match here after 16 years. Readers must note that India are yet to win a match at the Warner Park. Highest T20I run-scorers at the Warner Park among active cricketers are Evin Lewis (120), Sam Billings (87), Andrew Balbirnie (64), Joe Root (59) and Mahmudullah (56). As far as batters taking part in this series are concerned, West Indian quartet of Shimron Hetmyer (22), Rovman Powell (17), Nicholas Pooran (13) and Jason Holder (11) have all returned with minimal returns in spite of playing several T20I innings here in the past.

Aditya K Halder July 31, 2022 21:10:24 IST Jeremy Lalrinnunga holds the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games podium in Birmingham on Sunday. AP Kolkata : Becoming India's first Youth Olympic Champion at the age of 15 and a Commonwealth Games gold medallist and record holder by 19, it's nice to be Jeremy Lalrinnunga at the moment. The 19-year-old Mizo lived up to his expectations in Birmingham on Sunday when he clinched India's second gold medal , after Tokyo Olympic star Mirabai Chanu, with a record lift of 300kg (Snatch: 140 + Clean and jerk: 160). However, Sunday's win didn't come as smooth as experts expected with Jeremy's might put to test with an unexpected injury. pic.twitter.com/aRnBpWco1B Age 19. Debut. Games Record. Jeremy Lalrinnunga, everyone. — Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) July 31, 2022 For somebody, who is capable of lifting 167kg in clean and jerk in the past, Jeremy found his thigh muscle cramped right before the decisive last segment, forcing him to push his limits. It all came down to lifting 160kg on the day if Jeremy wanted to keep a fast-catching Samoa's Viapava Ioane. Commonwealth Games: India schedule , Results , Medals tally Going through that pain, Jeremy still desperately wanted that gold as a major success has alluded him for four years now and this was his chance. However, the athlete felt confused with the calculations as to lifting how much weight should be enough to seal the top spot. However, having his trusted coach Vijay Sharma (national weightlifting coach) by his side meant all he had to worry about was how to deal with the muscle cramp and focus on lifting the weight suggested. \"The muscle cramp hit me at a bad time, I am fine now but at that time the pain was difficult and made it difficult for me to judge on how much weight should I pick to ensure the gold in this condition. But I knew I could trust my coach in letting me know how much I need to lift in order to win the gold. I just followed his instruction because wherever I have reached today, it's all because of him,\" said Jeremy while answering a question by Firstpost during SAI's media press conference. Lifting 160kg turned out to be just enough as rival Ioane, who earlier lifted 127kg in snatch, was left with the huge task of pulling 174kg to win the gold medal. Despite his valiant attempts, the Samoan couldn't breach the mark and had to console himself with the silver medal and clean and jerk Games record (166kg). For Jeremy, the result meant the world. Since his 2018 Youth Olympic success in Buenos Aires, the teenager endured some tough times with knee and back injuries, which eventually hurt his rankings and subsequently a Tokyo Olympics spot. Lifting three tons over my shoulder wouldn’t have been possible without the strength of my nation backing me. ️‍♂️ This is gold is just the beginning! #WeAreTeamIndia #CWG22 #B2022 #Weightlifting #GoldForIndia #blessed pic.twitter.com/LJqy45f6GS — Jeremy Lalrinnunga (@raltejeremy) July 31, 2022 He did give himself a bright start in the senior circuit with a Youth Asian Championship silver medal in Thailand in 2019 but injuries soon crept in and took away the momentum that the lifter built since 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic did him no favour as being locked at the NIS Patiala camp with next to no training not only hit his growth but also made him feel homesick away from family in Aizawal in the hours of crisis that gripped the entire world. Sport in Jeremy's blood Of course, missing his family made a lot of sense for a teenager but even more, if your father has been the biggest inspiration of your life and has always been the guiding force. \"My father (Lalneihtluanga) has been a great boxer and won a lot of medals (seven-time national champion),\" Jeremy said before the CWG. \"It came naturally to me to become a boxer but then my friends were taking up weightlifting, I decided to follow them as I loved the power that was involved in it. I was lucky to have Malsawma sir there, who taught me weightlifting.\" In a year's time, Army Sports Institute coach Zarzokima saw the gifted weightlifter during a vacation in Aizawl and decided to shortlist the boy at just 9 for further nurturing as Jeremy had to leave his home and move to Pune. Growing through the ranks at the ASI Pune while developing his skills, Jeremy eventually came across national coach Vijay Sharma who decided to speak to the boy about training him with the national team. \"I heard about him before and when I eventually saw him compete, I was really keen because he had the physique and technique for a weightlifter,\" said Vijay during a frank conversation before the CWG. \"What I liked about him more was that he was focussed and obedient. He was always willing to follow whatever I asked him to do and that's what stands him apart from others.\" Click here for our complete coverage of the 2022 Commonwealth Games.

The third T20 of the the series will also be played at St Kitts before the action moved to Florida in United States of America.

The same report said that the players were supposted to get the Visa in St Kitts itself but now they will be needed to go back to Trinidad to get their documents and if they get a all-clear, will fly to USA from there. __ Snapshots from an official reception of #TeamIndia hosted by the High Commissioner, @drkjsrini in St. Kitts. pic.twitter.com/N2l0icfy6a — BCCI (@BCCI) July 31, 2022 Ricky Skerritt, the president of the CWI, has also said that there is a Plan B being considered if the USA visas do not arrive in time.

After a successful conduction of England and Wales Cricket Board’s professional franchise tournament – ‘The Hundred’ last year in the months of July and August, the second edition of the 100-ball tournament is scheduled to commence from August 3 onwards (for men), with the grand finale to take place on September 3. As for the women’s fixtures, the second season would commence a week later from August 11 onwards, due to their involvement in the ongoing Commonwealth Games 2022. Men’s champions Southern Braves will host and take on the Welsh Fire in the tournament opener at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton, while women’s champion the Oval Invincibles would host Northern Superchargers at The Kia Oval on August 11. Each of the eight men’s teams would play against the other six teams once, and the remaining, nearest regional rivals twice. On the other hand, due to women’s cricket’s involvement in the Commonwealth Games this year as well, there will only be six group games for them, which would mean that some teams would not meet during the group stage.

Firstly, instead of a six-ball Over which marks the change of ends, this format allows a change of ends only after 10 deliveries, with each bowler allowed to bowl either five or ten consecutive balls. While the first 25-balls constitute the Powerplay in each innings, a bowler can bowl a maximum of only 20 deliveries in a match. A maximum of two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle during the powerplay. The team which would top the points table after the end of the group stage would qualify directly for the grand finale at the Lord’s Cricket Ground on September 3, while the second and third placed sides would face each other in the ‘Eliminator’, slated to take place on September 2 at the Ageas Bowl, Southampton for both men and women.","pubDate":"2022-07-31 15:40:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CWG 2022: Harmanpreet Kaur surpasses MS Dhoni to script spectacular India captaincy record with Pakistan win","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games/cwg-2022-harmanpreet-kaur-surpasses-ms-dhoni-to-script-spectacular-india-captaincy-record-with-pakistan-win-101659278524848.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"With the big win their second group-stage tie in the competition, after having lost to Australia in the opener, captain Harmanpreet scripted a spectacular India captaincy record in T20I cricket, surpassing the legendary MS Dhoni.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-31 15:09:00","image_url":"https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/07/31/1600x900/New_Project_-_2022-07-31T202349.109_1659279276614_1659279286053_1659279286053.jpg","source_id":"hindustantimes","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL owners keen to sign players to 12-month deals amid \"global dominance\" concerns","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/cricket/ipl-kolkata-knight-riders-mysore-27622248","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Matthew Cooper)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Indian Premier League's influence on world cricket is continuing to grow, with team owners buying up franchises in various T20 leagues across the world","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-31 14:17:15","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24761152.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-943251576.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
