Followed categories will be added to My News. Australian cricket greats and pundits alike are lining up to pick apart the nation’s failed T20 World Cup campaign . Read through comments from Michael Clarke, or tune into an interview with Shane Watson, and they all want to know the same thing. Where was the spark? Where was the intensity? It’s crunch time at the T20 World Cup and you can catch every match live and ad-free in play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > You’ll read plenty of reasons for Australia looking like a team that ran out of puff, chiefly because of the gruelling lead-up to the tournament. But as the dust settles, it feels worth noting that this side lacked intensity months after it pushed aside a coach for being too intense. Oh how Justin Langer would have loathed many aspects of this Australian performance. Australia let its standards drop in all three areas. It was uncharacteristically sluggish in the field, dropping six catches. According to The Telegraph , only one nation had a worse success rate than Australia’s 68 per cent. With the bat, Australia was rolled for 111 by New Zealand, stumbled in a small chase against Sri Lanka, and only took 25 runs off the final four overs against Afghanistan. With the ball, New Zealand put up 3-200 while Ireland was allowed to go from teetering at 5-25 to 137. Justin Langer was the odd-man out for Australia’s failed T20 World Cup defence. The T20 World Cup might be one of the most cutthroat tournaments in all team sport, while it should be said Australia wasn’t poor, having won three of its four completed matches. Nonetheless, these were all avoidable lapses that shaped the course of Australia’s title defence. Clarke said the lack of edge on display was “very un-Australian” compared to what was seen at last year’s World Cup, which was won under Langer. “I think Australians in general, on the biggest stage under the most amount of pressure, always put it in on the line and have a crack,” he said on Sky Sports Radio . “We’re not scared to lose. “Yet we picked an aggressive 11 in this World Cup squad yet played so defensively. Very un-Australian.” Watson said Australia “lacked intensity”, adding: “It was very, very disappointing to watch the brand of cricket that the Aussies played during this tournament.” Nonetheless, in arguably the biggest example of how Australia has moved on from Langer, Glenn Maxwell felt relaxed enough in defeat to admit that he’s already gotten over it. “Cricket never stops so you don’t get time to dwell. Maybe when you retire you think back to ‘it would have been nice to win that’ but it doesn’t mean anything,” Maxwell said. “I wish we had of won but we didn‘t.” The drop in playing standards would have angered Langer, but his blood would’ve been boiling after Maxwell’s comments. Langer wouldn’t have let it slide. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images) Imagine a key player being so outwardly nonchalant about the underperformance of the national cricket team in any other era, let alone Langer’s. Go back to before the tournament started, and even captain Aaron Finch was raising eyebrows by saying that Australia was already “tired”. Former Australia all-rounder Simon O’Donnell said it was akin to “waving the white flag” before the tournament even started. “I couldn’t understand how emotionless we were, particularly in that format,” he said on SEN. “You’re playing for your country. Before you play a tournament for your country, you’re saying ‘we’re very tired’. It’s just not right.” Australia had already lost its bark since Sandpapergate, but at the World Cup, it had lost its bite, too. Other nations rejoiced. Former England captain Michael Vaughan said on Cricbuzz live that Australia was no longer “ruthless” and was “a nice team to play against”. Indian sports producer and former Kolkata Knight Riders team director Joy Bhattacharjya pointed to the cultural change, led by McDonald, as a potential reason. “I think somewhere there’s a little bit of steel they need. Things have changed,” he said on the program. “Justin Langer was a very different type of coach and I think you have a different kind of culture now with Andrew McDonald.” ‘WOULD HAVE GOT A MASSIVE BOOT UP THE BACKSIDE’ Times change and players are happy with the new culture they’ve helped create under coach Andrew McDonald, who collaborates with players rather than dictates to them. It’s a relaxed environment the players want but, in flopping at the T20 World Cup, they’ve left themselves open to the big question: Is it the environment they need? Andrew McDonald will have questions to answer. Rewind to March this year and the Australian cricket team couldn’t have looked like a happier place. McDonald was in charge, Langer the hard taskmaster had departed, and Australia was claiming a 1-0 Test series win in Pakistan to kick off the new reign. The external anger over how Langer — who had just won the T20 World Cup and Ashes 4-0 — was pushed aside immediately quietened. No harm was done to McDonald’s reputation in a 1-1 draw in Sri Lanka in the middle of the year, while August and September’s white ball games were treated as mere warm-ups for the World Cup. The T20 World Cup was therefore the first time McDonald experienced a high-pressure environment on home soil — and it proved to be a failure. Watson said that up until that point, both McDonald and head selector George Bailey had enjoyed a “pretty cruisy ride”. Now McDonald has been opened up to a level of criticism he was yet to face. “A T20 World Cup at home where the team didn’t perform as the group certainly can, the microscope will be on them, as it should be,” Watson said. “There are a lot of questions that need to be answered by the coaches and the selection staff to be able to right the wrongs. It seems to be the same patterns that we’re not learning lessons from.” Criticism of McDonald will inevitably tie in with Langer, and how this Australian side might’ve fared if he was still involved. Would have Australia surrendered so limply against New Zealand? Would have it taken the foot off the gas when opportunities for big wins arose? We can’t know the answer to these questions, but with Australia clearly lacking intensity, you can’t help but wonder if it lost more than it bargained for when Langer walked out the door. Clarke said that if Langer was still in charge, Australia would have had a completely different attitude heading in. “I feel for Andrew McDonald because he’s a great bloke but I guarantee to you, if JL was coach of this team, this team would have got a massive boot up the backside well before the tournament started,” he said. Now old wounds are being reopened with Langer enjoying another round of public support, several months after he left. At the front of the charge is O’Donnell. He has renewed the debate around Langer’s exit, which was put in motion last year when Tim Paine, Aaron Finch and Pat Cummins led a player revolt of sorts. With the players worn down by his intensity and micromanagement, Langer agreed to take a step back — and strong results followed. Even so, he was only offered a six-month renewal after the Ashes with McDonald a clear favourite to lead among players and Cricket Australia. O’Donnell said he now “only sees trouble” for McDonald’s future. “When the player opinion started coming in is when this got murky,” he said. “I’m a great believer that you can’t lead by negotiation. You cannot lead by saying ‘I’ll do it this way as long as you guys are happy’. Andrew McDonald must put his stamp on this and say, ‘this is me as a coach’. “He’s part player-appointed, so how does he do it? How is he their mate and their boss as well? When you muddy that line, I only see trouble.” ‘A SOUR TASTE’ What we’re also starting to learn is that Langer’s departure might’ve had more of a long-lasting impact than first realised. Clarke calls it a “real dislike”. O’Donnell says it’s a “sour taste”. Whatever it is, there’s a general feeling that the Australian cricket team might be on the nose with the public once more. The way in which Langer was pushed into the background by players in 2021, and then effectively altogether by CA, was a controversial incident. It was easy to quantify the outrage of Australian cricket legends and Langer’s former teammates through their strong public reactions. Harder to quantify, however, was how the decision went down with fans — although that might be becoming clearer. Australia’s World Cup matches were poorly attended, from nearly 35,000 in the opener at the SCG, down to about 18,000 in the final match at Adelaide Oval. Many fans aren’t interested until the first ball of the Test summer, but Adam Gilchrist warned that the attendances might speak to more than just the nation’s part-time relationship with cricket. “Whether those crowds being down and the appetite and enthusiasm for World Cup is reflective of the current team, I’ve got no idea,” he said on SEN . “People vote with their feet, but I don’t know if it was too early in the summer ... we’ll see how it plays out over the summer.” Michael Clarke and Simon O’Donnell believe that there’s unrest over Langer’s departure. O’Donnell believes that the lukewarm reception for the Australian cricket team can be traced back to Langer’s departure. “The Langer thing is big in this,” O’Donnell said. “People didn’t like how that happened. “Justin Langer was much loved. And that unceremonious dumping of the coach and the players’ activity behind the scenes, that has left a sour taste in a lot of people’s mouth.” News Corp senior cricket writer Robert Craddock said O’Donnell “was right”, adding: “There is a disconnect and a slight hangover from the Justin Langer era. “Justin may not have been the players’ favourite, but there was a lot of residual affection for that guy out in the public. “I hear it, I see it in comments at the bottom of my stories. I get the players’ argument about why Langer had to go and I get that, but given his record, there was a lot of public affection for him.” It’s something that Clarke has noted as well. In his role as a radio presenter and broadcaster, the former Australia captain said he’s noted growing schadenfreude within the public as a result of the unrest around Langer’s exit. “I said it on here a few weeks back — at the moment it feels like there is a real dislike for the Aussie team,” he said. “I want to see that change. We’ve already got messages this morning. So many people are happy that Australia lost. “There’s still angst around Justin Langer being sacked, or resigning, whatever happened there. There’s still angst around our style of play and how we’re playing.” With Austraia back in action next week for an ODI series against England, and the Test summer just around the corner, the team’s relationship with the public will be put to the test. And if the results don’t start to go Australia’s way again soon, Langer’s reputation will only grow further and undermine that of McDonald.

Babar Azam’s men will now face the familiar New Zealand side in the first semi-final of the T20 World Cup 2022, at the (SCG) today. Interestingly, both the teams have not lost at the SCG in this World Cup. While New Zealand won both their matches convincingly against Australia and Sri Lanka, Pakistan defeated South Africa here during the ‘Super 12’ stage. Just a few days before the commencement of the Cup, Pakistan had defeated the Black Caps in the final of the New Zealand T20I Tri-Series 2022, by 5 wickets. Both the teams had faced each other thrice in this series, with Pakistan winning two of them and New Zealand winning one. However, regardless to say, that it is Kane Williamson’s men who have played better all-round Cricket in the World Cup so far. The between both the teams has been bettered by Pakistan. Moreover, they have won more against the Kiwis over the years. If this was not it, they have also won four of the previous six T20Is against Pakistan as well. Having said that, the poor batting approach and form on display by the Pakistan opening batting pair of skipper Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan might prove to be costly for their team during the semi-final today. Moreover for New Zealand, with Kane Williamson getting runs under his belt in the previous two matches, and Glenn Phillips going through a wonderful patch of form so far, the at the SCG place them above Pakistan in the batting department. In the bowling department, Pakistan will again rely on their pace battery, which will pose to be a threat as by Williamson on the match eve. However, the Kiwi bowlers have also been up to the task so far, with none of them having leaked runs at more than 7.50 run per Over during the ‘Super 12′ stage. All in all, based on both the teams’ performance in this World Cup so far, New Zealand will start as favourites to win the first semi-final.","pubDate":"2022-11-08 20:26:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WWE News: Sheamus Set for Cricket Wireless Appearance, WarGames Preview Video","link":"https://411mania.com/wrestling/wwe-news-sheamus-set-for-cricket-wireless-appearance-wargames-preview-video/","keywords":["Sheamus","Survivor Series","WarGames","WWE"],"creator":["JeffreyHarris"],"video_url":null,"description":"More WWE news...

Highest successful run chases at the SCG in T20I history The record for the highest successful T2oI run-chase at the SCG belongs to team India, when they chased down the total of 197/5 scored by hosts Australia during the third T20I on the last ball, with 7 wickets in hand in January 2016. Shane Watson’s century (124* off 71) went in vain, as half-centuries from Rohit Sharma (52), Virat Kohli (50), and a 25-ball 49* off the bat of Suresh Raina chased the target down. In fact, the record for second and third highest successful run-chases at this venue is also registered under team India’s name, in the years 2020 and 2018 respectively.

Kohli's century drought lasted for three years before he finally reached a three-digit score during the Asia Cup earlier this year in the UAE. From there, Kohli has not looked back. After scoring an unbeaten 122 against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup, Kohli has recorded four half0centuries in the next 10 innings; that includes three in the ongoing T20 World Cup. With 246 runs in five games, Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the T20 World Cup 2022 and with two more possible games, the top-order batsman has a chance to extend his lead. Ahead of the Asia Cup, Kohli took a month's break. According to Stokes, that certainly helped the talented batsman to rejuvenate and find form. In 2022, Kohli has scored over 700 runs and is currently in fourth place in the list of most runs in T20Is. \"We as players and those who have played against him a lot, you never take anything he's done in the game before into the game he's got there. So just lay off a bit maybe,\" added Stokes. Enjoying the process. 🙌♥️ . #𝗩𝗜deo pic.twitter.com/DmTpAarmzi India and England will face off in the second semi-final of the T20 World Cup 2022 on Thursday (Nov. 10) at Adelaide Oval. The first semi-final is on Wednesday and is between New Zealand and Pakistan at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). T20 World Cup: We must not allow Surya to get on a rampage, says Ben Stokes Meanwhile, Stokes also stated that World No. 1 T20I batsman Suryakumar Yadav could be a major threat to England in the semi-final. Suryakumar has been in excellent form in the T20 World Cup, registering three half-centuries at a strike-rate of over 190. He is the only batsman to have accumulated 1,000 or more runs in the shortest format this year on the international platform. Surya, who comes in at No. 4, has so far scored 1,026 runs in 28 games at an average of 44.60 and strike-rate of 186.54. Earlier this year, Surya scored his maiden ton for India that came in a T20I against England in Nottingham.

Much like players of any other team, English cricketers must have been euphoric at the prospect of qualifying for their fourth white-ball World Cup semi-final in a row. Having said that, sealing a 142-run target with only four wickets and a couple of balls to spare was far away from ideal execution of their plans. Stokes, however, revealed that his sole goal was to “be there till the end” and win the match irrespective of the margin of victory as the same would’ve guaranteed them a semi-final berth. England, who finished Group 2 points table at the second position, will now lock horns against India at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday in their quest to reach the final. Stokes, who labeled India as a “very good team”, didn’t want to ponder much about their strengths. With England arguably being the best team on paper in this tournament, Stokes laid emphasis on playing according to their capability. “We come here in Adelaide where the dimensions of the ground are completely different to what we’ve been used to playing in our group stages. We found that a little bit with the SCG [Sydney Cricket Ground] with a . Same thing again here but we also know that we get to bat on the same wicket,” Stokes told in a posted on their Twitter handle. “As a team, we’d like to focus more on ourselves than the opposition because we know that if we we play anywhere near to the capability of the talent we’ve got in the dressing room, we’re a very hard team to beat.” Not just in their last match but it is true that England are yet to play according to their real potential in this World Cup. A team known to redefine this format, England are really expected to do well in a world event such as this. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that Stokes was inch-perfect in his observation of the Adelaide Oval’s . England, who had played their last Super 12 match in Sydney, have also played in Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane in this World Cup.","pubDate":"2022-11-08 16:39:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rohit Sharma T20 World Cup 2022 runs: Hitman Rohit 2022 World Cup innings list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-rohit-sharma-t20-world-cup-2022-runs-hitman-rohit-2022-world-cup-innings-list/","keywords":["Cricket","ICC T20 World Cup 2022","Rohit Sharma"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Team India will take on England in the second semi-final of the ongoing T20 World Cup 2022, at the Adelaide Oval on November 10 (Thursday).

A strong, deep English batting line-up will test the Indian bowlers, particularly during the second-half of their innings when they have been the most vulnerable in the past few months or so. However the the new ball pair of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Arshdeep Singh have consistently made the ball talk during the ‘Super 12’ stage, which the England side will be wary of as well. On the batting front, the pair of Virat Kohli and have been exceptional to say the least, and have carried the line-up on their shoulders during the entirety of their team’s journey towards the semi-final. While KL Rahul, after failures in the first three matches has finally had his touch back with consecutive half-centuries against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, his strike rate in the Powerplay still remains an area of concern. However, it is the average returns off the bat of his opening partner cum team skipper Rohit Sharma, which has led to furrowed foreheads of the team management and the fans. Barring his 39-ball 53 against Netherlands at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) where too he had initially struggled to get going, Rohit Sharma has not played any other single inning in the T20 World Cup 2022 so far, which does justice to either his potential or reputation as a batter in World Cricket. : Across the five innings in this World Cup so far, Rohit has scored mere 89 runs at an average and strike rate of 17.80 and 109.87 respectively. With the likes of Hardik Pandya and Dinesh Karthik not having played anywhere near their potential best as well so far, it remains high-time imperative for Rohit to turn-up against England and provide a perfect platform for the rest of the batters to capitalize on. 4 (7), versus Pakistan at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) 53 (39) versus Netherlands at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) 15 (14) versus South Africa at Perth Stadium 2 (8) versus Bangladesh at Adelaide Oval 15 (13) versus Zimbabwe at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).","pubDate":"2022-11-08 16:34:10","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Vijay Hazare Trophy: Mohammed replaces injured Natarajan in Tamil Nadu squad","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/domestic/vijay-hazare-trophy-tamil-nadu-tn-squad-t-natarajan-m-mohammed/article66112625.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        PTI  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"A press release from Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) here on Tuesday said M Mohammed would replace Natarajan in the 15-strong squad for the tournament.","content":"Tamil Nadu left-arm pacer T.

Afridi produced his best performance in the tournament so far with the ball when he finished with figures of 4-22 against Bangladesh on Sunday and that spell helped Pakistan earn a semi-final spot. Pakistan will meet in-form New Zealand at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Wednesday and the Australia great Ponting said Afridi is the key player in that game. \"He might say that he's not back to 100 percent just yet, but from what I've seen it looks like he's going along beautifully and he now holds the key for Pakistan progressing in the tournament,\" ICC quoted Ponting as saying. Afridi's wicketless performance in Pakistan's first two T20 World Cup matches against India and Zimbabwe may have cast some doubt on his ability to quickly recover, but Ponting always had faith in the left-handed pacer's abilities. \"(I never had any doubt) as you just know what he's capable of when he's out there on the field. And as I said, even if he's not at 100 per cent, if he's operating at 90 per cent, he's still going to have more of an impact on games than most because of how good he is. So look, he might have had a few worries in the back of his own mind and the Pakistan hierarchy and coaching group might have had a few worries in their mind, but not anymore. He's got through really well so far and hopefully for them two more games to go,\" Ponting said. Ponting said Afridi's resurgence was similar to how Indian superstar Virat Kohli had suddenly found his form in Australia and said that sometimes you simply have to have faith in the best players to deliver on the biggest stages. Promoted \"It's almost a bit like the India scenario with Virat (Kohli) coming into this tournament. Sometimes you just have to stick with them and pick them and let them go because champion players will find a way to get the job done.

While the outcomes of these two semifinals will determine the T20 World Cup 2022's two finalists, there is a chance that both India and New Zealand will advance to the championship match. The two semifinal games could be affected by rain, much as it did during the Super 12s. No one can rule out the potential that both semifinal matches would be postponed due to the modest likelihood of rain on both days. Both teams split the two points throughout the league stage. In the knockout stage, there cannot be a game that is fully washed out by rain because there must be a winner.

However, if inclement weather stops both games on a the team that finished higher on the Super 12s points table will go though. As a result, if the semifinal game between Pakistan and New Zealand results in a No Result, New Zealand will go to the final because they won Group 1. India will go to the final if Semifinal 2 between India and England results in a tie. Therefore, if the two semifinal games are cancelled, India and New Zealand will play in the final game at MCG on November 13. PAK vs NZ Pitch Report The Sydney Cricket Ground has long been a batting haven, so both teams should put up some strong performances. Due to the high calibre batters on both teams, a high-scoring game is expected. The aid will be plenty to keep bowlers motivated, especially the new-ball bowlers, so they shouldn't be discouraged in the interim. However, batting first should be the call based on the matches played so far as opposed to batting second and an average score on this pitch is projected to be 168. The surface at Sydney Cricket Ground is balanced and has been good for both departments thus far. In the 17 games that have been played here, the team that batted first has won 10.

Gunathilaka was arrested at the Sri Lanka team hotel in the early hours of Sunday morning and charged with four counts of sexual intercourse without consent following a police investigation. The 31-year-old, who has played eight Tests, 47 ODIs and 46 T20s, remains in custody in Australia after twice being denied bail. Sri Lanka Cricket has suspended Gunathilaka from all forms of cricket, with the rest of the squad having returned home without him. Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka denied bail in Sydney court on rape charges Read more The governing body has now announced the formation of a three-person panel to probe the incident, as well as other occurrences that are claimed to have happened during Sri Lanka’s time in Australia. Sri Lanka Cricket did not give details of the incidents that will be examined, but Queensland’s Courier Mail newspaper has reported the investigation will also look into claims that another squad member was involved in a fight at a casino in Brisbane. According to the Courier Mail, Sri Lankan news has reported that the unnamed player was involved in a fight with a group of men at a casino in the lead-up to the team’s World Cup Super 12s match against Afghanistan at the Gabba on 1 November. A statement said: “Sri Lanka Cricket wishes to announce the appointment of a three-member investigation panel consisting of Justice Sisira Ratnayake (retired High Court judge), Mr Niroshana Perera (attorney-at-law), and Mr Asela Rekawa (attorney-at-law) to initiate an inquiry into the alleged incident involving player Danushka Gunathilaka. “The committee will also focus the inquiry on various alleged incidents that have come to the attention of Sri Lanka Cricket and that are said to have allegedly taken place during the national team’s stay in Australia. “The panel in this process will call for an immediate explanation from the team manager pertaining to his conduct, with references to the occurrence of such incidents,” the statement continued. “The executive committee will take stern disciplinary action against the players and/or officials if any wrongdoing or negligence [is proved] when carrying out official duties.” Gunathilaka played just one match at the World Cup – the qualifying group defeat to Namibia – before a tear to his left hamstring ruled him out of the rest of the tournament, although he remained with the squad. Sri Lanka were eliminated at the Super 12s stage, losing their final match against England at the SCG at the weekend. Sri Lanka Cricket will reportedly pay for Gunathilaka’s legal expenses after he was refused bail and ordered to remain in custody. His lawyer, Anand Amaranath told ESPN’s Cricinfo he expects those funds to be “recovered from [Gunathilaka] later - it’s a loan essentially”. Gunathilaka could remain in custody for more than a year if further appeals against the denial of bail are unsuccessful.","pubDate":"2022-11-08 15:04:03","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baa0a032293d43636f6d249dc1be24ccc3e70dae/0_71_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5ff9b85adb3323cc825e0611e920bb14","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka Cricket investigating ‘various alleged incidents’ during T20 World Cup - The Guardian","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyL25vdi8wOC9zcmktbGFua2EtY3JpY2tldC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW5nLXZhcmlvdXMtYWxsZWdlZC1pbmNpZGVudHMtdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sri Lanka Cricket investigating ‘various alleged incidents’ during T20 World Cup  The GuardianSri Lanka Cricket sets up panel to investigate sexual assault allegations against Danushka Gunathilaka, looking into 'various alleged incidents'  ABC NewsDanushka Gunathilaka denied bail | 7NEWS  7NEWS AustraliaLankans look at more alleged Cup incidents  Illawarra MercuryGravitas: Sri Lankan Cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka charged with Rape  WIONView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-08 15:04:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lagaan 2.0: Netizens recall Aamir Khan’s iconic flick ahead of India’s T20 World Cup semi-final against England","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/trending/lagaan-2-0-netizens-recall-aamir-khans-iconic-flick-ahead-of-indias-t20-world-cup-semi-final-against-england-448923","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Chandigarh, November 8The high-octane clash between India and England to seal spot for T20 World Cup final is going to take place on November 10 in Adelaide Oval.The anxiety and adrenaline rush among India fans seem to be one of a kind ahead of big game.

Australia are scheduled to host England in a three-match ODI series, starting next week. The T20I series between both sides ended just before the T20 World Cup went underway Down Under last month. Jos Buttler and Co sealed the series 2-0 with the final T20I being washed away by rain. The ODI series will begin on Nov. 17 at Adelaide Oval. The second and third ODIs will be played on Nov. 19 and Nov. 20 in Sydney and Melbourne respectively. Head, who also bowls off-spin, last played for Australia during their Sri Lanka and Pakistan tours earlier this year between March and July. Head, who missed the series against Zimbabwe and New Zealand to be with his partner for the birth of their first child, is all set to take the recently retired Aaron Finch's place in the ODI squad. The upcoming ODI series against England will also mark Pat Cummins' first assignment as the 50-over skipper of the Australian national team. Even though Australia have preferred managing the workload of their three first-choice fast bowlers - Mitchell Starc, Cummins and Josh Hazlewood - in bilateral assignments, the trio has been picked to play both the series following their early exit from the ongoing T20 World Cup.Australia's batting line-up goes down as low as No. 8, a strategy that has seen Australia use several all-rounders in their side such as Glenn Maxwell, Mitch Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, Ashton Agar and even Marnus Labuschagne. The five-time World Cup winners will hope that the strategy pays off considering the elite tournament is next year in India.\"When you get to a World Cup you want to have a couple of ways of trying to win a tournament. At this stage we expect that India will be reasonably good at batting wickets for that World Cup – so looking at different ways of being able to exploit a longer batting line-up and some pretty handy all-round skill sets with some of those bowlers. \"That's obviously an option. We've been talking about trying to play that team for 12 or 18 months and clearly, it relies a lot on the fitness and health of a number of players. You can throw Ashton Agar into that mix as well, in terms of a bit of extra batting … you've got some options there to keep batting deep,\" selection chief George Bailey told reporters on Tuesday. Australia's ODI squad: Pat Cummins (c), Ashton Agar, Alex Carey (wk), Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, David Warner, Adam ZampaAustralia vs West Indies: Marcus Harris returns to Test squadMeanwhile, Australia also announced their Test squad for a two-match Test series, which will take place after the 50-over games against England. In the lead-up to the T20 World Cup, Australia played a T20I series against West Indies as well at home, which the hosts clean-swept with a 2-0 victory. There were no real surprises in the 13-man squad Cricket Australia picked for those two Tests against West Indies, with the first one beginning on Nov. 30 in Perth. The second Test will be played from Dec. 8 in Adelaide. Opening batsman Marcus Harris, who wasn't part of the senior squad in Sri Lanka, has made a comeback following his impressive performances in County Cricket and in the Sheffield Shield. While he is likely to be the reserved batter, Scott Boland is expected to be the backup pacer to the first-choice trio.\"After some larger squads for the sub-continent tours over the winter, we have returned to a very similar squad to that which performed strongly last summer in comprehensively winning the Ashes. Marcus Harris retains his place after continuing to perform for Gloucestershire in the English County competition and a strong start to the Marsh Sheffield Shield season,\" added Bailey.
