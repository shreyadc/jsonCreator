Five new sports have been added to the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles , with baseball, cricket, lacrosse and squash confirmed for the program along with the non-contact variant of American football. Instead of tackling players to the ground, flag football involves a defensive team removing a flag or flag belt from the ball carrier to end a down. A number of current or former NFL stars are already throwing their names in the hat to play it at the LA Games, including the likes of Rob Gronkowski , Tyreek Hill, Micah Parsons and AJ Brown. And now Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end dominating headlines right now amid his budding romance with Taylor Swift , has declared interest in joining Team USA in 2028. Flag football (right) is set to become an Olympic sport for the first time ever in 2028 - and Travis Kelce (left) is desperate to get involved Five new sports have been added to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, including flag football While he admits he may be too old to play, Kelce wants to be on Team USA in some capacity Yet during the latest episode of his New Heights podcast with brother Jason, 35, the 34-year-old admitted he may be too old to play. '2028... we're gonna be long gone,' he said. Jason then mentioned Gronkowski, 34, who has spoken of his own desire to play : 'I don't wanna speak for Gronk, but Gronk's probably gonna be a little bit old too at that point.' Travis continued: 'Me and Gronk are the same age, so we're all gonna be in the same boat in that regard. 'I think we're all just gonna be assistant coaches or some s***. But I need a f****ng gold medal, so I need to be on that roster somehow or someway.' The 2028 Games will take place over the summer, meaning current players would be unavailable for their respective NFL training camps should they be permitted to play. NFL executive Peter O'Reilly said earlier this month that the organization will work with the player's union on allowing both current and former players to participate, admitting the Olympics is the 'pinnacle' of sport. O'Reilly said: 'Ultimately, that decision on the makeup of Team USA is a decision of USA Football and the national governing body or the governing bodies around the world in similar roles because we are thinking about Team USA, but there are also a lot of other passports in the NFL -- 113 foreign-born players on NFL rosters as of Week 5. Kelce was speaking with his brother Jason (left) on their latest New Heights podcast episode The Kansas City Chiefs star has been dominating headlines amid his romance with Taylor Swift 'So, that opportunity for athletes to represent their countries, we understand the desire, what they have spoken out about and what we will continue to do is work with the players, [NFL] Players Association and the clubs in the time ahead to determine the process and then work with USA Football and IFAF [International Federation of American Football] on that.' Regardless of the number of foreign players currently plying their trade in the NFL, Kelce believes flag football in 2028 will be a one-sided affair in the USA's favor. 'Yeah, we're going to absolutely smoke everyone,' he concluded. 'Like, who has a chance? 'I'm actually surprised that this is becoming an Olympic sport, because I would like to just see what flag football looks like in other countries right now.

The F64 category is for athletes with a leg amputation who compete with prosthetics in a standing position. Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted this photo on his X (formerly Twitter) account congratulating Sumit Antil for winning the Gold Medal in the Men's Javelin F64 event at the Asian Para Games (Narendra Modi twitter) India's total medal count after three competition days stood at 64 (15 gold, 20 silver, 29 bronze) and they were placed at the sixth spot. Hosts China continued to dominate the Para Games, their medals tally touching the 300 mark (118 gold, 96 silver, 86 bronze). Iran (74 medals), Japan (69 medals), Thailand (63 medals), and Uzbekistan (55 medals) were placed ahead of India. Thailand and Uzbekistan leapfrogged India on account of a higher gold count despite having a lower overall medal tally. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Out of the 30 medals that India won on Wednesday, 17 — including all six golds — came from athletics with Antil leading the charge with a record-breaking show. The 25-year-old reigning Paralympics champion broke his own world record on his third throw. His series read an impressive 66.22m, 70.48m, and 73.29m. He fouled on his fourth attempt and didn't take the last two throws, but by then, a gold medal and the Asian, Games, and World records had been comfortably secured. Such was Antil's dominance that the silver medallist from Sri Lanka, S Arachchige Kodithuwakku's best effort (64.09) landed 9.2m shy of the winning throw. Pushpendra Singh won the bronze with a throw of 62.06m while another Indian, Sandeep, finished fourth with a throw of 61.84m in the six-man final. A serial record breaker, Antil is the only para javelin thrower in the world to breach the 70m barrier, a mark he hit twice in Hangzhou. His record-breaking streak began at the Paris Grand Prix in 2019 where he threw 61.32m and bettered it the same year with an effort of 62.88m in the World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai. At the Tokyo Paralympics, Antil broke the world record thrice, eventually winning the gold with a 68.55m throw. Antil got down to record-breaking business at the Indian Open Para Athletics Championships last year where his effort of 68.62m bettered his Tokyo mark. Antil arrived in Hangzhgou on the back of another world record — a 70.83m effort at the World Para Athletics Championships in Paris this July — and while his winning the gold appeared almost pre-ordained, his breaking another world record underscored Antil's appetite for success. Hailing from Sonepat in Haryana, Antil was training to be a wrestler before he met with an accident in 2015 that left him hospitalised for 53 days and resulted in the amputation of his left leg. Unlike most F64 athletes, Antil doesn't compete with a blade but uses a prosthetic foot. “I feel like the blades were consuming the power that I wanted to put on the equipment. Then I switched to the normal foot. I think that this was great for me because I read my body and what my body actually requires, rather than watching videos of other Para athletes,\" he told the International Paralympic Committee in an earlier interview. Another Indian, Sundar Singh Gurjar, also set a new world record in the men's F46 javelin with a throw of 68.60m en route a gold medal. In fact, Indians swept all three medals in the event with Rinku (67.08m) and Ajeet Singh (63.52m) completing the top three. Ankur's double delight Ankur Dhama became the first Indian to win two gold medals in a single edition of the Asian Para Games as he followed his T11 5000m win with a top finish in the T11 1500m race with a time of 4:27.70. It was 1-2 for the Indians in the women's T11 1500m event with Rakshitha Raju (5:21.45) and Killaka Lalitha (5:48.85) taking gold and silver respectively. Rakshitha had won a gold in the same event in the 2018 Asian Para Games in Jakarta. Haney and Nimisha Suresh Chakkungalparambil added gold medals in men's F37/38 javelin throw and women's T47 long jump events. Haney produced a Games record of 55.97m while Nimisha cleared 5.15m. In women's F54/55 discus throw, Pooja won a silver with an effort of 18.17m while Narayan Thakur and Shreyansh Trivedi picked up a bronze each in men's T35 200m and T37 200m with times of 29.83 and 25.26 respectively. \"Exciting news!

Cancelo sends in an excellent diagonal ball to Alonso at the far post and the Spaniard forces a quick-thinking save from Riznyk of the header. But another threatening freekick for Barcelona will offer little respite for the young keeper. 17:50 47 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar This time, Barcelona waste no time getting off the mark, setting up a freekick in the Shakhtar half which Gundogan lifts over the wall and out of play. 17:48 Second-half: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Out they come, with neither team having made tweaks to their starting XI. Let's get back underway in Barcelona. 17:36 Torres scores for his grandmother 17:34 Half-time: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Shakhtar haven't been able to give Barcelona any sort of scare so far; the home side might think they deserve even more than a two-nil cushion at the break. But perhaps Pusic can turn it all around with his first rousing half-time talk? 17:33 45+2 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Kryskiv streaks through the centre of the Barcelona half, but opts not to challenge Ter Stegen, instead passing off to Bondarenko was is efficiently challenged by Cancelo. As the whistle blows for half-time, Shakhtar couldn't be heading into the dressing room with less confidence, I'd think. 17:29 43 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Torres picks up a sloppy yellow card for a sliding challenge on Konoplia, but they're deep in Shakhtar's half, and the visitors continue to look mired in it. When they do venture out, Barcelona look well-drilled and thoughtful, and quickly unpick the growing attack without fuss on the edge of their box. 17:26 40 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Barcelona are hungry now, and capitalise on some uneasiness on the edge of the Shakhtar box. Stepanenko is drawn into a heroic block to stop the home side from making it three-nil, but hands Barca a corner. The visitors ensure Barca can do little with it, but the Blaugrana keep hold of posession, and don't look like they'll be easing up on the threat anytime soon. 17:23 GOAL! Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar (Fermin Lopez 36') Goal number two, and a deserved strike for Lopez from very little indeed! The player was robbed with his wobbly hit of the post, but he's rewarded now, as he collects a clever ball from Torres and blasts from the edge of the box after outdancing several Shakhtar shirts. No chance for Riznyk. 17:21 35 mins: Barcelona 1-0 Shakhtar Shakhtar attempt to spark a flood forward, but Bondarenko is chopped down by Gundogan. A freekick pushes them forward, but the visitors still look a little toothless, with Barcelona quickly overturning their guests. Yamal, who has looked zippy so far, attempts to send a cross over to his opposite number on the left flank, but the ball skitters out of play. 17:17 31 mins: Barcelona 1-0 Shakhtar A fair scoreline, in this blogger's eyes - Barcelona have been on top for large swathes of the game, and although Shakhtar had fought off attacks well up to that point, a goal felt like a matter of time. 17:16 GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Shakhtar (Torres 28') The initial call was offside, but VAR takes its time... and the goal is given! The strike was a rocket, with Torres stretching to connect with the ball cleanly. 17:14 28 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar A sliding Konopolia is accidently caught in the face by Alonso, but there's not enough in it to charge the former Chelsea man. But Shakhtar look to pull the rug from under Barcelona's momentum, Sudakov darting forward towards goal and catching defenders unaware. Handing off to Bondarenko just ahead of the box saps the challenge, and quickly Barcelona are back in control. Flooding forward, Lopez first strikes the post, before Torres picks up the rebound and leathers it past the Ukrainian goalkeeper to stretch the netting. But it's ruled out! Or is it... 17:10 25 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Alonso picks up the ball deep in Barca's half, and just before he loses it, he wings it to Cancelo and the home side set off at pace. Yamal on the right looks for a route into the box, but has defenders stuck to him like glue, and can only fire the ball into the boot of a player in white - or so it looked like. Shakhtar have the goal kick in the end. 17:08 22 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Kryskiv goes to ground, and looks upset. There wasn't any interference with him - which could make it all the more serious news for Shakhtar. The rest of the pitch grabs a stolen water break, as the forward limps to the sideline. He's back on a few moments later - hopefully there's no cause for concern. 17:06 19 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Gundogan sweeps in a corner for Barcelona, but Shakhtar players are clogging the box and the ball leaps out. Felix wins a good-looking freekick, though, when he's rumbled by Konoplia's arm to the face. The former Chelsea loanee is 30 yards out, to the left of goal, but rather than sending it into the box, he cuts sideways to Lopez. But his team-mate can't cleanly find a waiting Araujo, and Shakhtar lock up to keep the home side out. 17:04 16 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar An opening chance for Shakhtar! Not the cleanest, but the home side goofed and opened the door with Cancelo heading the ball to the feet of Sikan as Shakhtar sniff around the box. He has his strike on the edge of the box blocked, and Barcelona look to save their blushes with action at the other end. Picking up the ball midway through the Shakhtar half, Felix runs at Riznyk one-on-one but leaves it too late to shoot. The goalkeeper makes a quick-thinking stop. 17:00 13 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Shakhtar are looking firm enough as they keep hold of possession, but it's likely a waiting game for the home side. Snatching the ball back, Gundogan sets off down the left, but can't catch a looping pass which flies out of play. 16:58 11 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar A little push from Romeo and Bondarenko goes down like he's been hit with a hammer. To no avail, however, as Cancelo gets the throw inside the Shakhtar half. 16:54 9 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Riznyk is forced into the first save of the night and Lopez will be kicking himself he wasn't able to bury the ball in the back of the net at close range. But now Shakhtar have a chance to be off and running, Konoplia sneaking in from the right before Cancelo fells him, swiping the ball back. 16:53 7 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Barcelona win their first corner, which swings in for Romeu to leap at, but his connection loops over the bar, despite Riznyk jumping at full stretch. The home side keep the pressure up as Shakhtar hold onto possession, with Riznyk opting for a long ball to put the breaks on a burgeoning Barcelona threat. 16:50 4 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Barcelona snuff out Shakhtar's attempt to boot the ball upfield, and Lopez is allowed a chance to dart into the box. His casual attempt is kept under control by Riznyk with ease, setting up the visitors' first trip towards Ter Stegen. 16:48 2 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Barcelona don't need to burst out of the starting gates tonight, and are content to hold on to possession, gently paddling the ball around as they look for their first foray into the Shakhtar half. Pusics' players are doing a good job at clogging up the midfield, before Lopez attempts to sneak down the right. 16:46 Our first kick-off of the evening The players stream out of the tunnel at a... not overflowing Olímpic Lluís Companys Stadium. The Champions League anthem gets a thorough whistle, however, before both teams shake hands. Let's get underway in Spain! 16:35 All change at Shaktar Barcelona should prove quite the opposition to debut against for Marino Pusic, who was appointed to head up the Ukrainian side just yesterday by sporting director Darijo Srna. That's right - October 24. Srna sacked previous manager Patrick van Leeuwen after a difficult start to the season, and just 10 games in charge. The Dutch manager was appointed at the start of the 2023/24 campaign, following the departure of Igor Jovićević. Could this be something of a free hit for the side under the circumstances? 16:26 The players are out and warming up! 16:23 PETE JENSON: Barcelona president Joan Laporta has come out fighting after the club were accused of paying referees to fix matches... his decisions have paid off on the pitch, but can he stay in his role amid this bribery scandal? There's never a dull day at Barcelona where president Joan Laporta can be hailed for fixing the finances, and urged to resign over the bribery scandal, all in the same day. What kind of day will Sunday be? Well that depends on how Barcelona deal with Athletic Bilbao. If they win and go into next Saturday’s Clasico on good form then the mood will be good, until the next allegation drops of course. Laporta claimed on Thursday that this is all a campaign against the club coming from dark forces in Madrid who want to destabilise the team that won LaLiga last season. READ MORE BELOW. Should Laporta resign as Barcelona president over bribery scandal? PETE JENSON: There's never a dull day at Barcelona where president Joan Laporta can be hailed for fixing the finances, and urged to resign over the bribery scandal, all in 24 hours. Mail Online 16:16 A poignant visit before kick-off Before today's kick-off, Shakhtar captain Taras Stepanenko took time out to visit an injured Ukrainian soldier currently receiving treatment at a hospital in Barcelona after losing part of his skull whilst serving in August 2022. The Ukrainian club - once based in the Donbas region - has paid for Vitaly Shumei's extensive neurorehabilition at the Guttmann Brain Health Institute. The 35-year-old has been in Catalonia for five months, and his condition is thought to be improving. 'Strong emotions and all,' Stepanenko told Reuters after the visit. 'I really wanted to cry, because when you see him, he is a really strong guy who protect(ed) our country.' 16:09 Just what we need - another Barcelona wonderkid... On the bench tonight? 17-year-old Marc Guiu. Shakhtar will desperately hope he stays there after his last substitution for Xavi's side. Guiu scored his first-ever LaLiga goal just 33 seconds after being brought on against Athletic Club for his senior debut. Lamine Yamal, on his second Champions League start, feels like a veteran in comparison. 16:06 Team news: changes in focus The home side are forced into making four changes from the side that bested Porto with 10 men on their last European matchday. Gavi will serve his ban after picking up two yellows in Portugal, and Balde, Kounde, and Lewandowski are traded for Martinez, Alonso, and Torres - perhaps with one eye on the weekend's Big One. Marino Pusix makes just two changes to the European Shakhtar side, bringing in Bondarenko and Bondar over Nazaryna and Rakitskiy. 15:58 Barcelona gunning for top Xavi's men currently sit atop Group H, after wins against FC Porto and a barnstormer against Royal Antwerp, but a win against third-placed Shakhtar could shore up their hold as they look to reach the knock-out stages for the first time since 2020. Strong domestic form should sharpen the Blaugrana ahead of tonight's kick-off - Barca are still unbeaten in LaLiga ahead of the weekend's El Clasico. Here's Group H as things stand: 1. Barcelona - 6 2. Porto - 3 3. Shakhtar - 3 4. Royal Antwerp - 0 15:52 Barcelona reveal CGI footage of their 'insane' stadium's renovation plans which includes a complete upper-tier reconstruction and a new roof emblazoned with their Spotify sponsor Barcelona have revealed their ambitious plans for renovations to the Nou Camp in a new computer-generated video on social media. The Blaugrana have moved their base to the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium in Barcelona this term, with the iconic Nou Camp going under the knife for a predicted 18 months while work takes place. However, despite its status in the game as one of the sport's biggest and best venues, the facilities had been in urgent need of attention, after years of decay.

England's vice-captain has looked on in frustration after being dropped just one game into the tournament, since when victory over Bangladesh has been followed by crushing defeats against Afghanistan and South Africa . Another defeat by Sri Lanka - who have also lost three out of four - would almost certainly end England's hopes of retaining the trophy they won four years ago. It would also amount to one of the lamest title defences in nearly 50 years of one-day World Cups. And Moeen, who believes the 'spark' is missing, has warned his team-mates not to go home with any regrets, suggesting they have lacked intent and are taking the whole thing 'too seriously'. Moeen is expected to return to the side on Thursday at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium he knows well from his time with Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL. And he has no intention of dying wondering. Moeen Ali (middle) has challenged his team-mates to have no regrets from this World Cup 'When you sit outside for a while, you see things you don't see when you're playing, and I feel like our intent hasn't been there,' he said. 'I'm going to make sure that, if I get my chance, I'll use all that intent I have.' POSSIBLE TEAMS England : 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Dawid Malan, 3 Joe Root, 4 Ben Stokes, 5 Jos Buttler (capt, wkt), 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Chris Woakes, 8 David Willey, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Gus Atkinson, 11 Mark Wood. Sri Lanka : 1 Pathum Nissanka, 2 Kusal Perera, 3 Kusal Mendis (capt, wkt), 4 Sadeera Samarawickrama, 5 Charith Asalanka, 6 Dhananjaya de Silva, 7 Angelo Mathews, 8 Dunith Wellalage, 9 Maheesh Theekshana, 10 Kasun Rajitha, 11 Dilshan Madushanka. <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/sport/cricket/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement Moeen has been stewing behind the scenes, dismayed by England's departure from the aggression that has made them double world champions, and baffled by the transition from four all-rounders in the game against New Zealand to none at all against South Africa. That change in policy has typified what managing director Rob Key believes a crippling tendency to 'overthink'. 'He's probably right,' said Moeen. 'Sometimes you think too much, and it just doesn't work for us. 'A lot of the time, I feel England have set the trend for the last few years, and we've probably moved away from that.' Above all, he said the fun had disappeared from England's changing-room, a comment that does not make happy reading for head coach Matthew Mott and captain Jos Buttler. 'We haven't enjoyed it as a team as much, because we've been losing and we're not playing that well,' he said. 'You can see sometimes from the outside that we've probably lost that enjoyment. 'Speaking to a few of the players, they've certainly said that they're missing having me at mid-off. But it's not why we're losing, obviously.' Moeen's return will come at the expense either of Harry Brook, who remains the spare batsman, despite his high-class 66 against Afghanistan, or one of the seamers. It has been frustrating for Moeen, having been dropped just one game into the tournament He (right) conceded that the fun factor looks to have vanished from England's dressing room But Bangalore usually offers help for the quicker bowlers, and England have already lost the services of the injured Reece Topley. With this game coming too early for his replacement, Brydon Carse, a return to Chris Woakes, who was dropped against South Africa, cannot be ruled out. Sri Lanka have not lost a World Cup game to England since 1999, and have drafted in injury replacement Angelo Mathews, who in that time has played in three of their four tournament wins against them, and made a match-winning 85 not out in the shock win at Headingley four years ago. On Wednesday night, he was promising to 'fight fire with fire'. There's also the matter of Chris Silverwood, the Sri Lanka coach whose time in charge of England ended on a sour note after the 2021-22 Ashes. It would sum up England's World Cup if the man they sacked 20 months ago now has a hand in their demise. 'I'm sure deep down, like everybody else would, you're trying to prove a point,' said Moeen. 'It might motivate him even more.' For England, it's a scenario that does not bear thinking about.

The club claim to have discovered evidence of Goatley misappropriating Middlesex funds after he resigned due to ill health in 2021, but he strongly denies any wrongdoing and is not facing formal legal proceedings. Goatley's family have complained to the ECB about Middlesex's alleged conduct claiming they have felt threatened by the club's approach to the matter. In addition to making regular demands for varying sums of money Middlesex also proposed acquiring an interest in Goatley's parents home last year. Earlier this year the family also received what appeared to be a draft press release, purporting to be from the club, outlining the allegations against Goatley which they interpreted as threatening. ECB sources have confirmed to Mail Sport that they have had two meetings with the Goatley's and have pledged to investigate. 'We cannot comment on a specific case, but all complaints that come to the ECB are properly dealt with,' the ECB said in a statement. Middlesex have demanded Richard Goatley pays them hundreds of thousands of pounds over alleged misappropriate funds, allegations the former chief executive denies Goatley's wife has claimed Middlesex's behaviour has been 'at odds with the values of cricket' 'What Middlesex has done to us has been a form of hell' Goatley's wife, Lucy Ayliffe, told Mail Sport . 'Their behaviour is at odds with the values of cricket. 'They have made demands for life ruining sums of money. Who would agree to pay tens of thousands of pounds without being shown why it was owed? It feels like Richard has been assumed guilty without being shown any evidence and not given the opportunity to clear his name. We have turned to the ECB for help because what has happened to us.' The Goatley family chose to speak out after Middlesex made elements of the dispute public last month. In a press release published on the club's website on 27 September Middlesex stated 'there are on-going legal proceedings between the club and its former CEO Richard Goatley,' a claim the club amended the following day after receiving complaints from the family's lawyers, Cole Khan Solicitors. 'There are no formal legal proceedings or letters before action' Cole Khan confirmed in a statement to Mail Sport . 'We are awaiting a response to our calls to resolve this amicably.' The extraordinary saga began when Goatley suffered a stroke whilst in a Middlesex meeting in April 2021, which led to the club announcing his resignation three months later. The family claim Middlesex only paid Goatley part of Richard's severance package. In September 2021 Middlesex wrote to him claiming he owed them tens of thousands of pounds. The extraordinary affair has, according to the family, led them to spiral into debt and a repossession order being placed on their own home. After the initial demands for money Ayliffe received an email in December 2021 from Middlesex chairman, Mike O'Farrell, stating the matter had been resolved, but the legal letters returned the following year. In November last year, Middlesex wrote to Goatley's father, David, suggesting that a means of settling the case might be to acquire an interest in the family's home. In August this year a blank email appears to have been sent from Middlesex to Goatley. The email contained an attachment titled GOATLEY MEMBERS STATEMENT AJC – the initials of chief executive Andrew John Cornish and gave the impression of being a draft press release. Middlesex chief executive Andrew Cornish, who succeeded Goatley in July 2021, sees the funny side after being sacked by Somerset in 2019 The attachment alleged that Middlesex had discovered irregular payments made from their bank accounts to a joint account in the name of Goatley and his wife. O'Farrell has denied sending the press release, which was not dated and led the family to feel it could be published at any time. Cornish joined Middlesex as a consultant in September 2020 12 months after he was sacked by Somerset, before replacing Goatley as chief executive in July 2021. Middlesex declined to comment when contacted by Mail Sport , but sources at the club insist Goatley was treated fairly following his resignation. The club also claim that they have tried to reach an amicable settlement, but will now pursue the matter through the courts.

Five new sports have been added to the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles , with baseball, cricket, lacrosse and squash confirmed for the program along with the non-contact variant of American football. Instead of tackling players to the ground, flag football involves a defensive team removing a flag or flag belt from the ball carrier to end a down. A number of current or former NFL stars are already throwing their names in the hat to play it at the LA Games, including the likes of Rob Gronkowski , Tyreek Hill, Micah Parsons and AJ Brown. And now Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end dominating headlines right now amid his budding romance with Taylor Swift , has declared interest in joining Team USA in 2028. Flag football (right) is set to become an Olympic sport for the first time ever in 2028 - and Travis Kelce (left) is desperate to get involved Five new sports have been added to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, including flag football While he admits he may be too old to play, Kelce wants to be on Team USA in some capacity Yet during the latest episode of his New Heights podcast with brother Jason, 35, the 34-year-old admitted he may be too old to play. '2028... we're gonna be long gone,' he said. Jason then mentioned Gronkowski, 34, who has spoken of his own desire to play : 'I don't wanna speak for Gronk, but Gronk's probably gonna be a little bit old too at that point.' Travis continued: 'Me and Gronk are the same age, so we're all gonna be in the same boat in that regard. 'I think we're all just gonna be assistant coaches or some s***. But I need a f****ng gold medal, so I need to be on that roster somehow or someway.' The 2028 Games will take place over the summer, meaning current players would be unavailable for their respective NFL training camps should they be permitted to play. NFL executive Peter O'Reilly said earlier this month that the organization will work with the player's union on allowing both current and former players to participate, admitting the Olympics is the 'pinnacle' of sport. O'Reilly said: 'Ultimately, that decision on the makeup of Team USA is a decision of USA Football and the national governing body or the governing bodies around the world in similar roles because we are thinking about Team USA, but there are also a lot of other passports in the NFL -- 113 foreign-born players on NFL rosters as of Week 5. Kelce was speaking with his brother Jason (left) on their latest New Heights podcast episode The Kansas City Chiefs star has been dominating headlines amid his romance with Taylor Swift 'So, that opportunity for athletes to represent their countries, we understand the desire, what they have spoken out about and what we will continue to do is work with the players, [NFL] Players Association and the clubs in the time ahead to determine the process and then work with USA Football and IFAF [International Federation of American Football] on that.' Regardless of the number of foreign players currently plying their trade in the NFL, Kelce believes flag football in 2028 will be a one-sided affair in the USA's favor. 'Yeah, we're going to absolutely smoke everyone,' he concluded. 'Like, who has a chance? 'I'm actually surprised that this is becoming an Olympic sport, because I would like to just see what flag football looks like in other countries right now.

The 25-year-old reigning Paralympics champion broke his own world record on his third throw. His series read an impressive 66.22m, 70.48m, and 73.29m. He fouled on his fourth attempt and didn't take the last two throws, but by then, a gold medal and the Asian, Games, and World records had been comfortably secured. Such was Antil's dominance that the silver medallist from Sri Lanka, S Arachchige Kodithuwakku's best effort (64.09) landed 9.2m shy of the winning throw. Pushpendra Singh won the bronze with a throw of 62.06m while another Indian, Sandeep, finished fourth with a throw of 61.84m in the six-man final. A serial record breaker, Antil is the only para javelin thrower in the world to breach the 70m barrier, a mark he hit twice in Hangzhou. His record-breaking streak began at the Paris Grand Prix in 2019 where he threw 61.32m and bettered it the same year with an effort of 62.88m in the World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai. At the Tokyo Paralympics, Antil broke the world record thrice, eventually winning the gold with a 68.55m throw. Antil got down to record-breaking business at the Indian Open Para Athletics Championships last year where his effort of 68.62m bettered his Tokyo mark. Antil arrived in Hangzhgou on the back of another world record — a 70.83m effort at the World Para Athletics Championships in Paris this July — and while his winning the gold appeared almost pre-ordained, his breaking another world record underscored Antil's appetite for success. Hailing from Sonepat in Haryana, Antil was training to be a wrestler before he met with an accident in 2015 that left him hospitalised for 53 days and resulted in the amputation of his left leg. Unlike most F64 athletes, Antil doesn't compete with a blade but uses a prosthetic foot. “I feel like the blades were consuming the power that I wanted to put on the equipment. Then I switched to the normal foot. I think that this was great for me because I read my body and what my body actually requires, rather than watching videos of other Para athletes,\" he told the International Paralympic Committee in an earlier interview. Another Indian, Sundar Singh Gurjar, also set a new world record in the men's F46 javelin with a throw of 68.60m en route a gold medal. In fact, Indians swept all three medals in the event with Rinku (67.08m) and Ajeet Singh (63.52m) completing the top three. Ankur's double delight Ankur Dhama became the first Indian to win two gold medals in a single edition of the Asian Para Games as he followed his T11 5000m win with a top finish in the T11 1500m race with a time of 4:27.70. It was 1-2 for the Indians in the women's T11 1500m event with Rakshitha Raju (5:21.45) and Killaka Lalitha (5:48.85) taking gold and silver respectively. Rakshitha had won a gold in the same event in the 2018 Asian Para Games in Jakarta. Haney and Nimisha Suresh Chakkungalparambil added gold medals in men's F37/38 javelin throw and women's T47 long jump events. Haney produced a Games record of 55.97m while Nimisha cleared 5.15m. In women's F54/55 discus throw, Pooja won a silver with an effort of 18.17m while Narayan Thakur and Shreyansh Trivedi picked up a bronze each in men's T35 200m and T37 200m with times of 29.83 and 25.26 respectively. \"Exciting news!

Cancelo sends in an excellent diagonal ball to Alonso at the far post and the Spaniard forces a quick-thinking save from Riznyk of the header. But another threatening freekick for Barcelona will offer little respite for the young keeper. 17:50 47 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar This time, Barcelona waste no time getting off the mark, setting up a freekick in the Shakhtar half which Gundogan lifts over the wall and out of play. 17:48 Second-half: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Out they come, with neither team having made tweaks to their starting XI. Let's get back underway in Barcelona. 17:36 Torres scores for his grandmother 17:34 Half-time: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Shakhtar haven't been able to give Barcelona any sort of scare so far; the home side might think they deserve even more than a two-nil cushion at the break. But perhaps Pusic can turn it all around with his first rousing half-time talk? 17:33 45+2 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Kryskiv streaks through the centre of the Barcelona half, but opts not to challenge Ter Stegen, instead passing off to Bondarenko was is efficiently challenged by Cancelo. As the whistle blows for half-time, Shakhtar couldn't be heading into the dressing room with less confidence, I'd think. 17:29 43 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Torres picks up a sloppy yellow card for a sliding challenge on Konoplia, but they're deep in Shakhtar's half, and the visitors continue to look mired in it. When they do venture out, Barcelona look well-drilled and thoughtful, and quickly unpick the growing attack without fuss on the edge of their box. 17:26 40 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Barcelona are hungry now, and capitalise on some uneasiness on the edge of the Shakhtar box. Stepanenko is drawn into a heroic block to stop the home side from making it three-nil, but hands Barca a corner. The visitors ensure Barca can do little with it, but the Blaugrana keep hold of posession, and don't look like they'll be easing up on the threat anytime soon. 17:23 GOAL! Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar (Fermin Lopez 36') Goal number two, and a deserved strike for Lopez from very little indeed! The player was robbed with his wobbly hit of the post, but he's rewarded now, as he collects a clever ball from Torres and blasts from the edge of the box after outdancing several Shakhtar shirts. No chance for Riznyk. 17:21 35 mins: Barcelona 1-0 Shakhtar Shakhtar attempt to spark a flood forward, but Bondarenko is chopped down by Gundogan. A freekick pushes them forward, but the visitors still look a little toothless, with Barcelona quickly overturning their guests. Yamal, who has looked zippy so far, attempts to send a cross over to his opposite number on the left flank, but the ball skitters out of play. 17:17 31 mins: Barcelona 1-0 Shakhtar A fair scoreline, in this blogger's eyes - Barcelona have been on top for large swathes of the game, and although Shakhtar had fought off attacks well up to that point, a goal felt like a matter of time. 17:16 GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Shakhtar (Torres 28') The initial call was offside, but VAR takes its time... and the goal is given! The strike was a rocket, with Torres stretching to connect with the ball cleanly. 17:14 28 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar A sliding Konopolia is accidently caught in the face by Alonso, but there's not enough in it to charge the former Chelsea man. But Shakhtar look to pull the rug from under Barcelona's momentum, Sudakov darting forward towards goal and catching defenders unaware. Handing off to Bondarenko just ahead of the box saps the challenge, and quickly Barcelona are back in control. Flooding forward, Lopez first strikes the post, before Torres picks up the rebound and leathers it past the Ukrainian goalkeeper to stretch the netting. But it's ruled out! Or is it... 17:10 25 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Alonso picks up the ball deep in Barca's half, and just before he loses it, he wings it to Cancelo and the home side set off at pace. Yamal on the right looks for a route into the box, but has defenders stuck to him like glue, and can only fire the ball into the boot of a player in white - or so it looked like. Shakhtar have the goal kick in the end. 17:08 22 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Kryskiv goes to ground, and looks upset. There wasn't any interference with him - which could make it all the more serious news for Shakhtar. The rest of the pitch grabs a stolen water break, as the forward limps to the sideline. He's back on a few moments later - hopefully there's no cause for concern. 17:06 19 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Gundogan sweeps in a corner for Barcelona, but Shakhtar players are clogging the box and the ball leaps out. Felix wins a good-looking freekick, though, when he's rumbled by Konoplia's arm to the face. The former Chelsea loanee is 30 yards out, to the left of goal, but rather than sending it into the box, he cuts sideways to Lopez. But his team-mate can't cleanly find a waiting Araujo, and Shakhtar lock up to keep the home side out. 17:04 16 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar An opening chance for Shakhtar! Not the cleanest, but the home side goofed and opened the door with Cancelo heading the ball to the feet of Sikan as Shakhtar sniff around the box. He has his strike on the edge of the box blocked, and Barcelona look to save their blushes with action at the other end. Picking up the ball midway through the Shakhtar half, Felix runs at Riznyk one-on-one but leaves it too late to shoot. The goalkeeper makes a quick-thinking stop. 17:00 13 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Shakhtar are looking firm enough as they keep hold of possession, but it's likely a waiting game for the home side. Snatching the ball back, Gundogan sets off down the left, but can't catch a looping pass which flies out of play. 16:58 11 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar A little push from Romeo and Bondarenko goes down like he's been hit with a hammer. To no avail, however, as Cancelo gets the throw inside the Shakhtar half. 16:54 9 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Riznyk is forced into the first save of the night and Lopez will be kicking himself he wasn't able to bury the ball in the back of the net at close range. But now Shakhtar have a chance to be off and running, Konoplia sneaking in from the right before Cancelo fells him, swiping the ball back. 16:53 7 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Barcelona win their first corner, which swings in for Romeu to leap at, but his connection loops over the bar, despite Riznyk jumping at full stretch. The home side keep the pressure up as Shakhtar hold onto possession, with Riznyk opting for a long ball to put the breaks on a burgeoning Barcelona threat. 16:50 4 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Barcelona snuff out Shakhtar's attempt to boot the ball upfield, and Lopez is allowed a chance to dart into the box. His casual attempt is kept under control by Riznyk with ease, setting up the visitors' first trip towards Ter Stegen. 16:48 2 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Barcelona don't need to burst out of the starting gates tonight, and are content to hold on to possession, gently paddling the ball around as they look for their first foray into the Shakhtar half. Pusics' players are doing a good job at clogging up the midfield, before Lopez attempts to sneak down the right. 16:46 Our first kick-off of the evening The players stream out of the tunnel at a... not overflowing Olímpic Lluís Companys Stadium. The Champions League anthem gets a thorough whistle, however, before both teams shake hands. Let's get underway in Spain! 16:35 All change at Shaktar Barcelona should prove quite the opposition to debut against for Marino Pusic, who was appointed to head up the Ukrainian side just yesterday by sporting director Darijo Srna. That's right - October 24. Srna sacked previous manager Patrick van Leeuwen after a difficult start to the season, and just 10 games in charge. The Dutch manager was appointed at the start of the 2023/24 campaign, following the departure of Igor Jovićević. Could this be something of a free hit for the side under the circumstances? 16:26 The players are out and warming up! 16:23 PETE JENSON: Barcelona president Joan Laporta has come out fighting after the club were accused of paying referees to fix matches... his decisions have paid off on the pitch, but can he stay in his role amid this bribery scandal? There's never a dull day at Barcelona where president Joan Laporta can be hailed for fixing the finances, and urged to resign over the bribery scandal, all in the same day. What kind of day will Sunday be? Well that depends on how Barcelona deal with Athletic Bilbao. If they win and go into next Saturday’s Clasico on good form then the mood will be good, until the next allegation drops of course. Laporta claimed on Thursday that this is all a campaign against the club coming from dark forces in Madrid who want to destabilise the team that won LaLiga last season. READ MORE BELOW. Should Laporta resign as Barcelona president over bribery scandal? PETE JENSON: There's never a dull day at Barcelona where president Joan Laporta can be hailed for fixing the finances, and urged to resign over the bribery scandal, all in 24 hours. Mail Online 16:16 A poignant visit before kick-off Before today's kick-off, Shakhtar captain Taras Stepanenko took time out to visit an injured Ukrainian soldier currently receiving treatment at a hospital in Barcelona after losing part of his skull whilst serving in August 2022. The Ukrainian club - once based in the Donbas region - has paid for Vitaly Shumei's extensive neurorehabilition at the Guttmann Brain Health Institute. The 35-year-old has been in Catalonia for five months, and his condition is thought to be improving. 'Strong emotions and all,' Stepanenko told Reuters after the visit. 'I really wanted to cry, because when you see him, he is a really strong guy who protect(ed) our country.' 16:09 Just what we need - another Barcelona wonderkid... On the bench tonight? 17-year-old Marc Guiu. Shakhtar will desperately hope he stays there after his last substitution for Xavi's side. Guiu scored his first-ever LaLiga goal just 33 seconds after being brought on against Athletic Club for his senior debut. Lamine Yamal, on his second Champions League start, feels like a veteran in comparison. 16:06 Team news: changes in focus The home side are forced into making four changes from the side that bested Porto with 10 men on their last European matchday. Gavi will serve his ban after picking up two yellows in Portugal, and Balde, Kounde, and Lewandowski are traded for Martinez, Alonso, and Torres - perhaps with one eye on the weekend's Big One. Marino Pusix makes just two changes to the European Shakhtar side, bringing in Bondarenko and Bondar over Nazaryna and Rakitskiy. 15:58 Barcelona gunning for top Xavi's men currently sit atop Group H, after wins against FC Porto and a barnstormer against Royal Antwerp, but a win against third-placed Shakhtar could shore up their hold as they look to reach the knock-out stages for the first time since 2020. Strong domestic form should sharpen the Blaugrana ahead of tonight's kick-off - Barca are still unbeaten in LaLiga ahead of the weekend's El Clasico. Here's Group H as things stand: 1. Barcelona - 6 2. Porto - 3 3. Shakhtar - 3 4. Royal Antwerp - 0 15:52 Barcelona reveal CGI footage of their 'insane' stadium's renovation plans which includes a complete upper-tier reconstruction and a new roof emblazoned with their Spotify sponsor Barcelona have revealed their ambitious plans for renovations to the Nou Camp in a new computer-generated video on social media. The Blaugrana have moved their base to the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium in Barcelona this term, with the iconic Nou Camp going under the knife for a predicted 18 months while work takes place. However, despite its status in the game as one of the sport's biggest and best venues, the facilities had been in urgent need of attention, after years of decay.

England's vice-captain has looked on in frustration after being dropped just one game into the tournament, since when victory over Bangladesh has been followed by crushing defeats against Afghanistan and South Africa . Another defeat by Sri Lanka - who have also lost three out of four - would almost certainly end England's hopes of retaining the trophy they won four years ago. It would also amount to one of the lamest title defences in nearly 50 years of one-day World Cups. And Moeen, who believes the 'spark' is missing, has warned his team-mates not to go home with any regrets, suggesting they have lacked intent and are taking the whole thing 'too seriously'. Moeen is expected to return to the side on Thursday at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium he knows well from his time with Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL. And he has no intention of dying wondering. Moeen Ali (middle) has challenged his team-mates to have no regrets from this World Cup 'When you sit outside for a while, you see things you don't see when you're playing, and I feel like our intent hasn't been there,' he said. 'I'm going to make sure that, if I get my chance, I'll use all that intent I have.' POSSIBLE TEAMS England : 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Dawid Malan, 3 Joe Root, 4 Ben Stokes, 5 Jos Buttler (capt, wkt), 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Chris Woakes, 8 David Willey, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Gus Atkinson, 11 Mark Wood. Sri Lanka : 1 Pathum Nissanka, 2 Kusal Perera, 3 Kusal Mendis (capt, wkt), 4 Sadeera Samarawickrama, 5 Charith Asalanka, 6 Dhananjaya de Silva, 7 Angelo Mathews, 8 Dunith Wellalage, 9 Maheesh Theekshana, 10 Kasun Rajitha, 11 Dilshan Madushanka. <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/sport/cricket/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement Moeen has been stewing behind the scenes, dismayed by England's departure from the aggression that has made them double world champions, and baffled by the transition from four all-rounders in the game against New Zealand to none at all against South Africa. That change in policy has typified what managing director Rob Key believes a crippling tendency to 'overthink'. 'He's probably right,' said Moeen. 'Sometimes you think too much, and it just doesn't work for us. 'A lot of the time, I feel England have set the trend for the last few years, and we've probably moved away from that.' Above all, he said the fun had disappeared from England's changing-room, a comment that does not make happy reading for head coach Matthew Mott and captain Jos Buttler. 'We haven't enjoyed it as a team as much, because we've been losing and we're not playing that well,' he said. 'You can see sometimes from the outside that we've probably lost that enjoyment. 'Speaking to a few of the players, they've certainly said that they're missing having me at mid-off. But it's not why we're losing, obviously.' Moeen's return will come at the expense either of Harry Brook, who remains the spare batsman, despite his high-class 66 against Afghanistan, or one of the seamers. It has been frustrating for Moeen, having been dropped just one game into the tournament He (right) conceded that the fun factor looks to have vanished from England's dressing room But Bangalore usually offers help for the quicker bowlers, and England have already lost the services of the injured Reece Topley. With this game coming too early for his replacement, Brydon Carse, a return to Chris Woakes, who was dropped against South Africa, cannot be ruled out. Sri Lanka have not lost a World Cup game to England since 1999, and have drafted in injury replacement Angelo Mathews, who in that time has played in three of their four tournament wins against them, and made a match-winning 85 not out in the shock win at Headingley four years ago. On Wednesday night, he was promising to 'fight fire with fire'. There's also the matter of Chris Silverwood, the Sri Lanka coach whose time in charge of England ended on a sour note after the 2021-22 Ashes. It would sum up England's World Cup if the man they sacked 20 months ago now has a hand in their demise. 'I'm sure deep down, like everybody else would, you're trying to prove a point,' said Moeen. 'It might motivate him even more.' For England, it's a scenario that does not bear thinking about.

The club claim to have discovered evidence of Goatley misappropriating Middlesex funds after he resigned due to ill health in 2021, but he strongly denies any wrongdoing and is not facing formal legal proceedings. Goatley's family have complained to the ECB about Middlesex's alleged conduct claiming they have felt threatened by the club's approach to the matter. In addition to making regular demands for varying sums of money Middlesex also proposed acquiring an interest in Goatley's parents home last year. Earlier this year the family also received what appeared to be a draft press release, purporting to be from the club, outlining the allegations against Goatley which they interpreted as threatening. ECB sources have confirmed to Mail Sport that they have had two meetings with the Goatley's and have pledged to investigate. 'We cannot comment on a specific case, but all complaints that come to the ECB are properly dealt with,' the ECB said in a statement. Middlesex have demanded Richard Goatley pays them hundreds of thousands of pounds over alleged misappropriate funds, allegations the former chief executive denies Goatley's wife has claimed Middlesex's behaviour has been 'at odds with the values of cricket' 'What Middlesex has done to us has been a form of hell' Goatley's wife, Lucy Ayliffe, told Mail Sport . 'Their behaviour is at odds with the values of cricket. 'They have made demands for life ruining sums of money. Who would agree to pay tens of thousands of pounds without being shown why it was owed? It feels like Richard has been assumed guilty without being shown any evidence and not given the opportunity to clear his name. We have turned to the ECB for help because what has happened to us.' The Goatley family chose to speak out after Middlesex made elements of the dispute public last month. In a press release published on the club's website on 27 September Middlesex stated 'there are on-going legal proceedings between the club and its former CEO Richard Goatley,' a claim the club amended the following day after receiving complaints from the family's lawyers, Cole Khan Solicitors. 'There are no formal legal proceedings or letters before action' Cole Khan confirmed in a statement to Mail Sport . 'We are awaiting a response to our calls to resolve this amicably.' The extraordinary saga began when Goatley suffered a stroke whilst in a Middlesex meeting in April 2021, which led to the club announcing his resignation three months later. The family claim Middlesex only paid Goatley part of Richard's severance package. In September 2021 Middlesex wrote to him claiming he owed them tens of thousands of pounds. The extraordinary affair has, according to the family, led them to spiral into debt and a repossession order being placed on their own home. After the initial demands for money Ayliffe received an email in December 2021 from Middlesex chairman, Mike O'Farrell, stating the matter had been resolved, but the legal letters returned the following year. In November last year, Middlesex wrote to Goatley's father, David, suggesting that a means of settling the case might be to acquire an interest in the family's home. In August this year a blank email appears to have been sent from Middlesex to Goatley. The email contained an attachment titled GOATLEY MEMBERS STATEMENT AJC – the initials of chief executive Andrew John Cornish and gave the impression of being a draft press release. Middlesex chief executive Andrew Cornish, who succeeded Goatley in July 2021, sees the funny side after being sacked by Somerset in 2019 The attachment alleged that Middlesex had discovered irregular payments made from their bank accounts to a joint account in the name of Goatley and his wife. O'Farrell has denied sending the press release, which was not dated and led the family to feel it could be published at any time. Cornish joined Middlesex as a consultant in September 2020 12 months after he was sacked by Somerset, before replacing Goatley as chief executive in July 2021. Middlesex declined to comment when contacted by Mail Sport , but sources at the club insist Goatley was treated fairly following his resignation. The club also claim that they have tried to reach an amicable settlement, but will now pursue the matter through the courts.

Five new sports have been added to the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles , with baseball, cricket, lacrosse and squash confirmed for the program along with the non-contact variant of American football. Instead of tackling players to the ground, flag football involves a defensive team removing a flag or flag belt from the ball carrier to end a down. A number of current or former NFL stars are already throwing their names in the hat to play it at the LA Games, including the likes of Rob Gronkowski , Tyreek Hill, Micah Parsons and AJ Brown. And now Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end dominating headlines right now amid his budding romance with Taylor Swift , has declared interest in joining Team USA in 2028. Flag football (right) is set to become an Olympic sport for the first time ever in 2028 - and Travis Kelce (left) is desperate to get involved Five new sports have been added to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, including flag football While he admits he may be too old to play, Kelce wants to be on Team USA in some capacity Yet during the latest episode of his New Heights podcast with brother Jason, 35, the 34-year-old admitted he may be too old to play. '2028... we're gonna be long gone,' he said. Jason then mentioned Gronkowski, 34, who has spoken of his own desire to play : 'I don't wanna speak for Gronk, but Gronk's probably gonna be a little bit old too at that point.' Travis continued: 'Me and Gronk are the same age, so we're all gonna be in the same boat in that regard. 'I think we're all just gonna be assistant coaches or some s***. But I need a f****ng gold medal, so I need to be on that roster somehow or someway.' The 2028 Games will take place over the summer, meaning current players would be unavailable for their respective NFL training camps should they be permitted to play. NFL executive Peter O'Reilly said earlier this month that the organization will work with the player's union on allowing both current and former players to participate, admitting the Olympics is the 'pinnacle' of sport. O'Reilly said: 'Ultimately, that decision on the makeup of Team USA is a decision of USA Football and the national governing body or the governing bodies around the world in similar roles because we are thinking about Team USA, but there are also a lot of other passports in the NFL -- 113 foreign-born players on NFL rosters as of Week 5. Kelce was speaking with his brother Jason (left) on their latest New Heights podcast episode The Kansas City Chiefs star has been dominating headlines amid his romance with Taylor Swift 'So, that opportunity for athletes to represent their countries, we understand the desire, what they have spoken out about and what we will continue to do is work with the players, [NFL] Players Association and the clubs in the time ahead to determine the process and then work with USA Football and IFAF [International Federation of American Football] on that.' Regardless of the number of foreign players currently plying their trade in the NFL, Kelce believes flag football in 2028 will be a one-sided affair in the USA's favor. 'Yeah, we're going to absolutely smoke everyone,' he concluded. 'Like, who has a chance? 'I'm actually surprised that this is becoming an Olympic sport, because I would like to just see what flag football looks like in other countries right now.

The F64 category is for athletes with a leg amputation who compete with prosthetics in a standing position. Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted this photo on his X (formerly Twitter) account congratulating Sumit Antil for winning the Gold Medal in the Men's Javelin F64 event at the Asian Para Games (Narendra Modi twitter) India's total medal count after three competition days stood at 64 (15 gold, 20 silver, 29 bronze) and they were placed at the sixth spot. Hosts China continued to dominate the Para Games, their medals tally touching the 300 mark (118 gold, 96 silver, 86 bronze). Iran (74 medals), Japan (69 medals), Thailand (63 medals), and Uzbekistan (55 medals) were placed ahead of India. Thailand and Uzbekistan leapfrogged India on account of a higher gold count despite having a lower overall medal tally. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Out of the 30 medals that India won on Wednesday, 17 — including all six golds — came from athletics with Antil leading the charge with a record-breaking show. The 25-year-old reigning Paralympics champion broke his own world record on his third throw. His series read an impressive 66.22m, 70.48m, and 73.29m. He fouled on his fourth attempt and didn't take the last two throws, but by then, a gold medal and the Asian, Games, and World records had been comfortably secured. Such was Antil's dominance that the silver medallist from Sri Lanka, S Arachchige Kodithuwakku's best effort (64.09) landed 9.2m shy of the winning throw. Pushpendra Singh won the bronze with a throw of 62.06m while another Indian, Sandeep, finished fourth with a throw of 61.84m in the six-man final. A serial record breaker, Antil is the only para javelin thrower in the world to breach the 70m barrier, a mark he hit twice in Hangzhou. His record-breaking streak began at the Paris Grand Prix in 2019 where he threw 61.32m and bettered it the same year with an effort of 62.88m in the World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai. At the Tokyo Paralympics, Antil broke the world record thrice, eventually winning the gold with a 68.55m throw. Antil got down to record-breaking business at the Indian Open Para Athletics Championships last year where his effort of 68.62m bettered his Tokyo mark. Antil arrived in Hangzhgou on the back of another world record — a 70.83m effort at the World Para Athletics Championships in Paris this July — and while his winning the gold appeared almost pre-ordained, his breaking another world record underscored Antil's appetite for success. Hailing from Sonepat in Haryana, Antil was training to be a wrestler before he met with an accident in 2015 that left him hospitalised for 53 days and resulted in the amputation of his left leg. Unlike most F64 athletes, Antil doesn't compete with a blade but uses a prosthetic foot. “I feel like the blades were consuming the power that I wanted to put on the equipment. Then I switched to the normal foot. I think that this was great for me because I read my body and what my body actually requires, rather than watching videos of other Para athletes,\" he told the International Paralympic Committee in an earlier interview. Another Indian, Sundar Singh Gurjar, also set a new world record in the men's F46 javelin with a throw of 68.60m en route a gold medal. In fact, Indians swept all three medals in the event with Rinku (67.08m) and Ajeet Singh (63.52m) completing the top three. Ankur's double delight Ankur Dhama became the first Indian to win two gold medals in a single edition of the Asian Para Games as he followed his T11 5000m win with a top finish in the T11 1500m race with a time of 4:27.70. It was 1-2 for the Indians in the women's T11 1500m event with Rakshitha Raju (5:21.45) and Killaka Lalitha (5:48.85) taking gold and silver respectively. Rakshitha had won a gold in the same event in the 2018 Asian Para Games in Jakarta. Haney and Nimisha Suresh Chakkungalparambil added gold medals in men's F37/38 javelin throw and women's T47 long jump events. Haney produced a Games record of 55.97m while Nimisha cleared 5.15m. In women's F54/55 discus throw, Pooja won a silver with an effort of 18.17m while Narayan Thakur and Shreyansh Trivedi picked up a bronze each in men's T35 200m and T37 200m with times of 29.83 and 25.26 respectively. \"Exciting news!

Cancelo sends in an excellent diagonal ball to Alonso at the far post and the Spaniard forces a quick-thinking save from Riznyk of the header. But another threatening freekick for Barcelona will offer little respite for the young keeper. 17:50 47 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar This time, Barcelona waste no time getting off the mark, setting up a freekick in the Shakhtar half which Gundogan lifts over the wall and out of play. 17:48 Second-half: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Out they come, with neither team having made tweaks to their starting XI. Let's get back underway in Barcelona. 17:36 Torres scores for his grandmother 17:34 Half-time: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Shakhtar haven't been able to give Barcelona any sort of scare so far; the home side might think they deserve even more than a two-nil cushion at the break. But perhaps Pusic can turn it all around with his first rousing half-time talk? 17:33 45+2 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Kryskiv streaks through the centre of the Barcelona half, but opts not to challenge Ter Stegen, instead passing off to Bondarenko was is efficiently challenged by Cancelo. As the whistle blows for half-time, Shakhtar couldn't be heading into the dressing room with less confidence, I'd think. 17:29 43 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Torres picks up a sloppy yellow card for a sliding challenge on Konoplia, but they're deep in Shakhtar's half, and the visitors continue to look mired in it. When they do venture out, Barcelona look well-drilled and thoughtful, and quickly unpick the growing attack without fuss on the edge of their box. 17:26 40 mins: Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar Barcelona are hungry now, and capitalise on some uneasiness on the edge of the Shakhtar box. Stepanenko is drawn into a heroic block to stop the home side from making it three-nil, but hands Barca a corner. The visitors ensure Barca can do little with it, but the Blaugrana keep hold of posession, and don't look like they'll be easing up on the threat anytime soon. 17:23 GOAL! Barcelona 2-0 Shakhtar (Fermin Lopez 36') Goal number two, and a deserved strike for Lopez from very little indeed! The player was robbed with his wobbly hit of the post, but he's rewarded now, as he collects a clever ball from Torres and blasts from the edge of the box after outdancing several Shakhtar shirts. No chance for Riznyk. 17:21 35 mins: Barcelona 1-0 Shakhtar Shakhtar attempt to spark a flood forward, but Bondarenko is chopped down by Gundogan. A freekick pushes them forward, but the visitors still look a little toothless, with Barcelona quickly overturning their guests. Yamal, who has looked zippy so far, attempts to send a cross over to his opposite number on the left flank, but the ball skitters out of play. 17:17 31 mins: Barcelona 1-0 Shakhtar A fair scoreline, in this blogger's eyes - Barcelona have been on top for large swathes of the game, and although Shakhtar had fought off attacks well up to that point, a goal felt like a matter of time. 17:16 GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Shakhtar (Torres 28') The initial call was offside, but VAR takes its time... and the goal is given! The strike was a rocket, with Torres stretching to connect with the ball cleanly. 17:14 28 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar A sliding Konopolia is accidently caught in the face by Alonso, but there's not enough in it to charge the former Chelsea man. But Shakhtar look to pull the rug from under Barcelona's momentum, Sudakov darting forward towards goal and catching defenders unaware. Handing off to Bondarenko just ahead of the box saps the challenge, and quickly Barcelona are back in control. Flooding forward, Lopez first strikes the post, before Torres picks up the rebound and leathers it past the Ukrainian goalkeeper to stretch the netting. But it's ruled out! Or is it... 17:10 25 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Alonso picks up the ball deep in Barca's half, and just before he loses it, he wings it to Cancelo and the home side set off at pace. Yamal on the right looks for a route into the box, but has defenders stuck to him like glue, and can only fire the ball into the boot of a player in white - or so it looked like. Shakhtar have the goal kick in the end. 17:08 22 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Kryskiv goes to ground, and looks upset. There wasn't any interference with him - which could make it all the more serious news for Shakhtar. The rest of the pitch grabs a stolen water break, as the forward limps to the sideline. He's back on a few moments later - hopefully there's no cause for concern. 17:06 19 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Gundogan sweeps in a corner for Barcelona, but Shakhtar players are clogging the box and the ball leaps out. Felix wins a good-looking freekick, though, when he's rumbled by Konoplia's arm to the face. The former Chelsea loanee is 30 yards out, to the left of goal, but rather than sending it into the box, he cuts sideways to Lopez. But his team-mate can't cleanly find a waiting Araujo, and Shakhtar lock up to keep the home side out. 17:04 16 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar An opening chance for Shakhtar! Not the cleanest, but the home side goofed and opened the door with Cancelo heading the ball to the feet of Sikan as Shakhtar sniff around the box. He has his strike on the edge of the box blocked, and Barcelona look to save their blushes with action at the other end. Picking up the ball midway through the Shakhtar half, Felix runs at Riznyk one-on-one but leaves it too late to shoot. The goalkeeper makes a quick-thinking stop. 17:00 13 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Shakhtar are looking firm enough as they keep hold of possession, but it's likely a waiting game for the home side. Snatching the ball back, Gundogan sets off down the left, but can't catch a looping pass which flies out of play. 16:58 11 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar A little push from Romeo and Bondarenko goes down like he's been hit with a hammer. To no avail, however, as Cancelo gets the throw inside the Shakhtar half. 16:54 9 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Riznyk is forced into the first save of the night and Lopez will be kicking himself he wasn't able to bury the ball in the back of the net at close range. But now Shakhtar have a chance to be off and running, Konoplia sneaking in from the right before Cancelo fells him, swiping the ball back. 16:53 7 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Barcelona win their first corner, which swings in for Romeu to leap at, but his connection loops over the bar, despite Riznyk jumping at full stretch. The home side keep the pressure up as Shakhtar hold onto possession, with Riznyk opting for a long ball to put the breaks on a burgeoning Barcelona threat. 16:50 4 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Barcelona snuff out Shakhtar's attempt to boot the ball upfield, and Lopez is allowed a chance to dart into the box. His casual attempt is kept under control by Riznyk with ease, setting up the visitors' first trip towards Ter Stegen. 16:48 2 mins: Barcelona 0-0 Shakhtar Barcelona don't need to burst out of the starting gates tonight, and are content to hold on to possession, gently paddling the ball around as they look for their first foray into the Shakhtar half. Pusics' players are doing a good job at clogging up the midfield, before Lopez attempts to sneak down the right. 16:46 Our first kick-off of the evening The players stream out of the tunnel at a... not overflowing Olímpic Lluís Companys Stadium. The Champions League anthem gets a thorough whistle, however, before both teams shake hands. Let's get underway in Spain! 16:35 All change at Shaktar Barcelona should prove quite the opposition to debut against for Marino Pusic, who was appointed to head up the Ukrainian side just yesterday by sporting director Darijo Srna. That's right - October 24. Srna sacked previous manager Patrick van Leeuwen after a difficult start to the season, and just 10 games in charge. The Dutch manager was appointed at the start of the 2023/24 campaign, following the departure of Igor Jovićević. Could this be something of a free hit for the side under the circumstances? 16:26 The players are out and warming up! 16:23 PETE JENSON: Barcelona president Joan Laporta has come out fighting after the club were accused of paying referees to fix matches... his decisions have paid off on the pitch, but can he stay in his role amid this bribery scandal? There's never a dull day at Barcelona where president Joan Laporta can be hailed for fixing the finances, and urged to resign over the bribery scandal, all in the same day. What kind of day will Sunday be? Well that depends on how Barcelona deal with Athletic Bilbao. If they win and go into next Saturday’s Clasico on good form then the mood will be good, until the next allegation drops of course. Laporta claimed on Thursday that this is all a campaign against the club coming from dark forces in Madrid who want to destabilise the team that won LaLiga last season. READ MORE BELOW. Should Laporta resign as Barcelona president over bribery scandal? PETE JENSON: There's never a dull day at Barcelona where president Joan Laporta can be hailed for fixing the finances, and urged to resign over the bribery scandal, all in 24 hours. Mail Online 16:16 A poignant visit before kick-off Before today's kick-off, Shakhtar captain Taras Stepanenko took time out to visit an injured Ukrainian soldier currently receiving treatment at a hospital in Barcelona after losing part of his skull whilst serving in August 2022. The Ukrainian club - once based in the Donbas region - has paid for Vitaly Shumei's extensive neurorehabilition at the Guttmann Brain Health Institute. The 35-year-old has been in Catalonia for five months, and his condition is thought to be improving. 'Strong emotions and all,' Stepanenko told Reuters after the visit. 'I really wanted to cry, because when you see him, he is a really strong guy who protect(ed) our country.' 16:09 Just what we need - another Barcelona wonderkid... On the bench tonight? 17-year-old Marc Guiu. Shakhtar will desperately hope he stays there after his last substitution for Xavi's side. Guiu scored his first-ever LaLiga goal just 33 seconds after being brought on against Athletic Club for his senior debut. Lamine Yamal, on his second Champions League start, feels like a veteran in comparison. 16:06 Team news: changes in focus The home side are forced into making four changes from the side that bested Porto with 10 men on their last European matchday. Gavi will serve his ban after picking up two yellows in Portugal, and Balde, Kounde, and Lewandowski are traded for Martinez, Alonso, and Torres - perhaps with one eye on the weekend's Big One. Marino Pusix makes just two changes to the European Shakhtar side, bringing in Bondarenko and Bondar over Nazaryna and Rakitskiy. 15:58 Barcelona gunning for top Xavi's men currently sit atop Group H, after wins against FC Porto and a barnstormer against Royal Antwerp, but a win against third-placed Shakhtar could shore up their hold as they look to reach the knock-out stages for the first time since 2020. Strong domestic form should sharpen the Blaugrana ahead of tonight's kick-off - Barca are still unbeaten in LaLiga ahead of the weekend's El Clasico. Here's Group H as things stand: 1. Barcelona - 6 2. Porto - 3 3. Shakhtar - 3 4. Royal Antwerp - 0 15:52 Barcelona reveal CGI footage of their 'insane' stadium's renovation plans which includes a complete upper-tier reconstruction and a new roof emblazoned with their Spotify sponsor Barcelona have revealed their ambitious plans for renovations to the Nou Camp in a new computer-generated video on social media. The Blaugrana have moved their base to the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium in Barcelona this term, with the iconic Nou Camp going under the knife for a predicted 18 months while work takes place. However, despite its status in the game as one of the sport's biggest and best venues, the facilities had been in urgent need of attention, after years of decay.

England's vice-captain has looked on in frustration after being dropped just one game into the tournament, since when victory over Bangladesh has been followed by crushing defeats against Afghanistan and South Africa . Another defeat by Sri Lanka - who have also lost three out of four - would almost certainly end England's hopes of retaining the trophy they won four years ago. It would also amount to one of the lamest title defences in nearly 50 years of one-day World Cups. And Moeen, who believes the 'spark' is missing, has warned his team-mates not to go home with any regrets, suggesting they have lacked intent and are taking the whole thing 'too seriously'. Moeen is expected to return to the side on Thursday at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium he knows well from his time with Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL. And he has no intention of dying wondering. Moeen Ali (middle) has challenged his team-mates to have no regrets from this World Cup 'When you sit outside for a while, you see things you don't see when you're playing, and I feel like our intent hasn't been there,' he said. 'I'm going to make sure that, if I get my chance, I'll use all that intent I have.' POSSIBLE TEAMS England : 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Dawid Malan, 3 Joe Root, 4 Ben Stokes, 5 Jos Buttler (capt, wkt), 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Chris Woakes, 8 David Willey, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Gus Atkinson, 11 Mark Wood. Sri Lanka : 1 Pathum Nissanka, 2 Kusal Perera, 3 Kusal Mendis (capt, wkt), 4 Sadeera Samarawickrama, 5 Charith Asalanka, 6 Dhananjaya de Silva, 7 Angelo Mathews, 8 Dunith Wellalage, 9 Maheesh Theekshana, 10 Kasun Rajitha, 11 Dilshan Madushanka. <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/sport/cricket/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement Moeen has been stewing behind the scenes, dismayed by England's departure from the aggression that has made them double world champions, and baffled by the transition from four all-rounders in the game against New Zealand to none at all against South Africa. That change in policy has typified what managing director Rob Key believes a crippling tendency to 'overthink'. 'He's probably right,' said Moeen. 'Sometimes you think too much, and it just doesn't work for us. 'A lot of the time, I feel England have set the trend for the last few years, and we've probably moved away from that.' Above all, he said the fun had disappeared from England's changing-room, a comment that does not make happy reading for head coach Matthew Mott and captain Jos Buttler. 'We haven't enjoyed it as a team as much, because we've been losing and we're not playing that well,' he said. 'You can see sometimes from the outside that we've probably lost that enjoyment. 'Speaking to a few of the players, they've certainly said that they're missing having me at mid-off. But it's not why we're losing, obviously.' Moeen's return will come at the expense either of Harry Brook, who remains the spare batsman, despite his high-class 66 against Afghanistan, or one of the seamers. It has been frustrating for Moeen, having been dropped just one game into the tournament He (right) conceded that the fun factor looks to have vanished from England's dressing room But Bangalore usually offers help for the quicker bowlers, and England have already lost the services of the injured Reece Topley. With this game coming too early for his replacement, Brydon Carse, a return to Chris Woakes, who was dropped against South Africa, cannot be ruled out. Sri Lanka have not lost a World Cup game to England since 1999, and have drafted in injury replacement Angelo Mathews, who in that time has played in three of their four tournament wins against them, and made a match-winning 85 not out in the shock win at Headingley four years ago. On Wednesday night, he was promising to 'fight fire with fire'. There's also the matter of Chris Silverwood, the Sri Lanka coach whose time in charge of England ended on a sour note after the 2021-22 Ashes. It would sum up England's World Cup if the man they sacked 20 months ago now has a hand in their demise. 'I'm sure deep down, like everybody else would, you're trying to prove a point,' said Moeen. 'It might motivate him even more.' For England, it's a scenario that does not bear thinking about.

The club claim to have discovered evidence of Goatley misappropriating Middlesex funds after he resigned due to ill health in 2021, but he strongly denies any wrongdoing and is not facing formal legal proceedings. Goatley's family have complained to the ECB about Middlesex's alleged conduct claiming they have felt threatened by the club's approach to the matter. In addition to making regular demands for varying sums of money Middlesex also proposed acquiring an interest in Goatley's parents home last year. Earlier this year the family also received what appeared to be a draft press release, purporting to be from the club, outlining the allegations against Goatley which they interpreted as threatening. ECB sources have confirmed to Mail Sport that they have had two meetings with the Goatley's and have pledged to investigate. 'We cannot comment on a specific case, but all complaints that come to the ECB are properly dealt with,' the ECB said in a statement. Middlesex have demanded Richard Goatley pays them hundreds of thousands of pounds over alleged misappropriate funds, allegations the former chief executive denies Goatley's wife has claimed Middlesex's behaviour has been 'at odds with the values of cricket' 'What Middlesex has done to us has been a form of hell' Goatley's wife, Lucy Ayliffe, told Mail Sport . 'Their behaviour is at odds with the values of cricket. 'They have made demands for life ruining sums of money. Who would agree to pay tens of thousands of pounds without being shown why it was owed? It feels like Richard has been assumed guilty without being shown any evidence and not given the opportunity to clear his name. We have turned to the ECB for help because what has happened to us.' The Goatley family chose to speak out after Middlesex made elements of the dispute public last month. In a press release published on the club's website on 27 September Middlesex stated 'there are on-going legal proceedings between the club and its former CEO Richard Goatley,' a claim the club amended the following day after receiving complaints from the family's lawyers, Cole Khan Solicitors. 'There are no formal legal proceedings or letters before action' Cole Khan confirmed in a statement to Mail Sport . 'We are awaiting a response to our calls to resolve this amicably.' The extraordinary saga began when Goatley suffered a stroke whilst in a Middlesex meeting in April 2021, which led to the club announcing his resignation three months later. The family claim Middlesex only paid Goatley part of Richard's severance package. In September 2021 Middlesex wrote to him claiming he owed them tens of thousands of pounds. The extraordinary affair has, according to the family, led them to spiral into debt and a repossession order being placed on their own home. After the initial demands for money Ayliffe received an email in December 2021 from Middlesex chairman, Mike O'Farrell, stating the matter had been resolved, but the legal letters returned the following year. In November last year, Middlesex wrote to Goatley's father, David, suggesting that a means of settling the case might be to acquire an interest in the family's home. In August this year a blank email appears to have been sent from Middlesex to Goatley. The email contained an attachment titled GOATLEY MEMBERS STATEMENT AJC – the initials of chief executive Andrew John Cornish and gave the impression of being a draft press release. Middlesex chief executive Andrew Cornish, who succeeded Goatley in July 2021, sees the funny side after being sacked by Somerset in 2019 The attachment alleged that Middlesex had discovered irregular payments made from their bank accounts to a joint account in the name of Goatley and his wife. O'Farrell has denied sending the press release, which was not dated and led the family to feel it could be published at any time. Cornish joined Middlesex as a consultant in September 2020 12 months after he was sacked by Somerset, before replacing Goatley as chief executive in July 2021. Middlesex declined to comment when contacted by Mail Sport , but sources at the club insist Goatley was treated fairly following his resignation. The club also claim that they have tried to reach an amicable settlement, but will now pursue the matter through the courts.
