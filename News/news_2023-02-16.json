After bowling Quetta out for jus t 110 in 18.5 overs, Multan reached the target in 13.3 overs. Despite having little to defend, Quetta had an approach that if the wicket supported Sultans bowlers it would surely be beneficial for them as well. That attitude earned them an early wicket when medium pacer Nuwan Thushara trapped Shan Masood (3) lbw in the second over, but that was the only wicket to fall during the innings. Mohammad Rizwan with patience and Rilee Rossouw with aggression did not let Quetta's strategy work well. As Rizwan held one end steady, Rossouw smacked every loose delivery coming his way for a boundary. He got his fifty off just 33 balls and then went on to score 78 in 42 balls. Rizwan scored 28 in 34 balls. Rossouw hit nine fours and three sixes while Rizwan timed two strokes across the ropes. “I have been playing so much cricket so this was just another game. I am feeling pretty alright. On batting in Multan, it is fantastic to be back here and playing in front of a crowd,” said Rossouw. \"Everyone loves this franchise and everyone plays from the heart. The way we treat each other is with a lot of respect and we enjoy playing,\" he added. It was the pace trio of Sameen, Abbas Afridi, and Ihsan that gave their team an early edge over Quetta. Ihsan was on fire throughout his quota of overs. Ihsan claimed two back to back wickets to push Quetta to the wall. Sameen struck in his first over bringing down the rivals run scoring battery Martin Guptill after he made seven runs. The next to fall was Abdul Wahid Bangalzai, who was caught at mid-on by Kieron Pollard off Abbas Afridi. Quetta lost Sarfaraz Ahmed when Ihsan bowled a fiery delivery to rattle the stumps. The skipper went back after scoring just two runs. Ihsan struck again in his second over, as he sent destructive batter Jason Roy packing after scoring 27 runs, the highest from his side. The tall bowler continued to impress with his fiery pace. He trapped in-form Iftikhar Ahmed for an lbw, reducing Quetta to 46-5. A few overs later Usama Mir struck with the wicket of Mohammad Nawaz and Ihsan dismissed Umar Akmal, who produced 11 runs in 14 balls. Nawaz made 14 in 18 balls. Ihsan for his fifth wicket targeted Naseem Shah (1). Quetta were in tatters at 68 for eight in 12.4 overs. “It feels very good. I made a few mistakes in the first match. But in this match, I bowled the right length balls and that is why I was able to pick up five wickets,” said Ihsan. “The pitch was supporting pacers and support from the fans was also very great and hopefully I can keep performing in the games to come.” Veteran all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez, who was sent down the order, and Mohammad Husnain then took the score to 99, before the latter became the second victim of Sameen in the 18th over. He was the second highest scorer for Quetta with 22 runs. After an addition of 11 runs, the entire Quetta batting folded with the fall of the wicket of Hafeez for 18 runs that came in 15 balls. He was the second scalp of Abbas. “We could not start well. In the first 10 overs, we could not get going. We should give credit to them for the way they bowled,” said Sarfaraz. \"Hopefully we can bounce back in the matches that remain. We have plenty of pace (in the bowling attack) but if we don't bowl in the right areas, we will not be able to pick wickets,” he added.

Karachi Kings have lost their first game and will be under pressure a little bit,” he said. Azhar said that they have prepared well for the event. “Our preparation is good as most of the players have been playing consistent cricket. The foreign players as well as the local players were involved in different leagues. They are all ready and waiting for tomorrow’s game,” Azhar said. “Paul Stirling, Colin Munro, Rassie van der Dussen, Tom Curran and Gus Atkinson are available for tomorrow’s match,” Azhar said. “It will be easy for us to form playing XI this season. When we play at different venues we will consider which bowler will be able to prove better for the team. Cricket is played in the ground and not on paper. We have to play well to win,” Azhar stressed. He said that spin will play a massive role. “Spin will play a massive role. Our skipper (Shadab) is one of the best leg-spinners in the world. We have all kinds of varieties including left-arm spinner. We have a finger spinner in Abrar who did so well recently in Test matches. We will see which player we have to play against which opposition. Our spin department covers so many things,” Azhar said. He did not agree when a reporter said that United had not been impressive under Shadab’s captaincy. “I think Shadab was always one step ahead in matches which we have played so far. Last year we played 26 players. Our main strength was not in the park and if still you go to the playoffs it shows your team is doing well and your captain is right. Shadab is very talented and he knows cricket and he can be a very good captain,” said Azhar, a former international all-rounder. Azhar said that they want their fielders to do well in the event. “We are focusing on this area and want our fielding to appear prominent in this tournament because a crucial catch and a crucial run-out can change the game,” he said. Azhar wants United to win a title under his coaching. “In 2016 I was part of this team when we won the title. I will try to make this team champions again. It would be a proud moment for me if this team reclaimed the title under my coaching,” Azhar said. Meanwhile, after losing their opener against Peshawar Zalmi by just two runs on Tuesday, Kings rested on Wednesday.

Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is tapping into sports outside of rugby league to gain an understanding of the mentality that goes into performing at the highest level Leeds Rhinos' coach Rohan Smith using mentality from other sports stars Smith has exchanged sporting views with Jonny Bairstow and Jesse Marsch Lifted the Rhinos from 11th in the table to fifth last season and into a Grand Final By David Coverdale For Mailonline Published: 21:46, 15 February 2023 | Updated: 22:41, 15 February 2023 e-mail View comments The Ashes are still four months away but one Australian at Headingley has already been given a lesson in Bazball. Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is a keen cricket fan and met England and Yorkshire batsman Jonny Bairstow at a Rugby League World Cup match last autumn. As they sat together at Headingley, Bairstow told Smith all about the Test team’s new carefree, attacking approach under Brendon McCullum - and the Aussie now wants to bring Bazball to rugby league. ‘Jonny is a big Rhinos fan,’ Smith explains to Sportsmail ahead of his side’s Super League opener at Warrington on Thursday. ‘We have had a few messages and I actually watched the Australia and Fiji World Cup game with him here. ‘It was good to have a chat with someone who loves rugby league but plays a different sport. I am very inquisitive about other sports and the mentality that goes into performing at the highest level. Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is a fan of speaking to figures in sports outside of rugby Smith met up with Jonny Bairstow during Rugby League World Cup match last autumn ‘Some of the stuff we chatted about was around the enjoyment of the game and playing with freedom. That doesn’t mean that you hit every ball for four or six, but you have the freedom to see the ball and hit the ball. ‘That mentality can apply to rugby league - having the freedom to throw a pass without any pressure from above. It was cool to chat about that sort of stuff.’ Smith has often tapped into other sports, exchanging regular messages with his former fellow Leeds coach Jesse Marsch, who was sacked by the Premier League club last week. ‘I went over and watched Leeds United training last year,’ he says. ‘Jesse was very hands on. You could see he is very passionate about his sport and his coaching. He lives and breathes it. ‘We kept in conversation with texts to see how each other was doing. It was good to be able to bounce ideas off with him and have a couple of messages each week from a bloke who was working in the biggest competition in the world and under a lot of pressure.’ Smith has also spent time with bosses from rugby union, basketball and Australian rules. But his own first foray into coaching was not a team or ball sport. ‘As a 17-year-old, I started teaching swimming to four and six-year-olds,’ he reveals. ‘So, without knowing it at the time, that gave me some grounding as a coach. If you can deal with those kind of kids, you can probably deal with anything!’ Smith, though, was always destined to be a rugby league coach, even though he never played the sport professionally. His father Brian had a stellar coaching career, including spells in charge of Hull FC, Bradford and Wakefield. Former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch was another name Smith enjoyed exchanging views with Smith led the Rhinos from 11th in the table to fifth, and all the way to the Grand Final ‘It’s been a lifetime of education from him,’ says Smith, who lived in Leeds as a teenager during his dad’s days as Bradford boss and is now back with his wife and three children. ‘I am really grateful that all those conversations I had as a kid were helping to shape my own journey.’ In the Super League this season, Smith will also pits his wits against his uncle Tony - Brian’s younger brother – who is now coach of Hull FC, having previously led Leeds to two Grand Final wins in 2004 and 2007. ‘We will be playing Hull FC not Tony, but afterwards it will be nice to have a chat and a beer,’ says Smith. ‘Tony has probably been the most influential coach in the Super League era. He’s built up a lot of clubs and had success at different teams, including here. ‘Before I came here, I asked him if there would be any reason not to take on this opportunity at such a great club. He said, “No, go for it”. He thought it would be a great opportunity for me and that I was ready for it, which was all I needed. If I can achieve a little bit of what he did here, I’d be happy.’ Smith almost emulated his uncle immediately last season. After taking charge of the Rhinos in May, he lifted them from 11th in the table to fifth, then into the Grand Final, where they lost 24-12 to St Helens. Going into this campaign, Leeds’ youthful side are only rated as fourth favourites to win their first title since 2017, behind Saints, Wigan and Warrington. But Smith adds: ‘The expectation at this club is to win. Every Rhinos fan and sponsor expects that. Last season, we had a good finish, but we didn’t win anything, so hopefully we can get ourselves in a position to play the big ones again this year. There’s everything to play for.’ Share or comment on this article: Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is tapping into sports outside of rugby league e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

In a bombshell exclusive last week Sportsmail revealed that a group of super-wealthy Qatari investors want to buy Manchester United . Should they succeed – and they think they will – they will waste little time on returning the Premier League giants to the top both on and off the field. Here, Mike Keegan examines how – with money no object – that takeover could look and details what could be the biggest sports and regeneration project this country has ever seen. They arrive at Manchester Airport ’s United Terminal (via Qatar Airways’ United Shuttle) and are whisked by the high-speed United Express (painted red, white and black) to the newly-opened United Station. The journey takes 10 minutes. From the platform, with ‘Glory, Glory Man United’ playing over the speakers, they get their first glimpse of the world-famous Stretford End, all glass and chrome following its no-expense spared revamp. Qatari investors are set to make a huge bid for Manchester United in the coming days Manager Erik ten Hag would get a massive transfer kitty if the deal went through United Monorail then carries them the short distance to United World, a giant entertainment complex in the shadows of Old Trafford surrounded by luxury apartments and high-end restaurants. Inside, safe from Manchester’s notorious climate, they shop until they drop. Anything you could wish for comes with United branding. They fill their baskets with replica shirts and a Captain Marvel Rolex before smashing a penalty past Peter Schmeichel in the interactive plaza. They pay for footage which they hastily post on their social media accounts. Then, they are back onto the monorail where a hologram of Eric Cantona wanders the aisle and tells them all about the history of the Theatre of Dreams and what to expect when they are inside. The stadium takes their breath away. The leaky roof is a thing of the past. This is £2bn well spent by the Qatari group who took control five years ago. There are no fewer than eight tiers of corporate hospitality to choose from and the 80,000 seats all offer crystal clear views of the hallowed turf. The new owners have taken the knowledge and expertise obtained from building seven new arenas for the 2022 World Cup and taken it up a level. They have gone for two spaces in Redzone, because they want the authentic experience and the unrivalled atmosphere promised. They are in padded, heated seats and can order food and drinks via the United+ App, to which they subscribe every year. While they may live thousands of miles away, it makes them feel like part of the United family. The app, a snip at the equivalent of £20 a month, offers them anything from exclusive content to the chance to bid in an auction in exchange for a personalised message from a player of their choice. The visitors, just two of the 659m global followers United boast, barely have time to catch their breath before Erik ten Hag’s Premier League and Champions League winners take to the field. Club legends such as Eric Cantona could be honoured in several ways around a new-look club Jude Bellingham - one of the most sought-after prospects in Europe - could become United club captain If star forward Marcus Rashford continues his fine form he could too become a club legend Today, captain Jude Bellingham takes centre stage as the resurgent red machine takes another three points to put them six points clear of rivals City and Newcastle. But there are heroes all over the pitch. Since Qatar replaced the Glazers dividends and debt payments have become a thing of the past. Instead there is investment. Investment on a scale never seen before. Some of the biggest names in the world are here in red shirts and white shorts. Following the routine victory it is back on the monorail to Red Devils’ Lair, one of three-United themed hotels built on the vast acreage of land around Old Trafford that the Qataris have transformed. It was not cheap, but a guest appearance from Kylian Mbappe, signed for a world record £250m from Paris Saint-Germain, and a Michelin-Star meal (accompanied by wines chosen by Sir Alex Ferguson) makes it worthwhile. As they nod off, in rooms adorned with pictures of United greats from George Best to Marcus Rashford, they plan their next trip. Sound far-fetched? It might, but should the Qatar group this newspaper revealed wanted to buy Manchester United succeed, it may not be a million miles away from reality. Those with knowledge of the prospective buyers have disclosed that they intend to move quickly and decisively. They see United as the biggest club in the world and will waste no time in ensuring that they start to act like it. Potential is the key word. Clubs like United do not come onto the market often. Across the industry it is widely recognised that, under the Glazers, United have not come close to monetising that vast following. Along with arming Erik ten Hag with the players he needs, making sure that happens will be top of the list. When it comes to Old Trafford, they would get a head start. Backed into a corner by fan fury, the Glazers brought in the architects. The plans and proposals – revamp or rebuild – are already drawn up. With money no object, a £2bn transformation may well be on the cards. Either way, corporate hospitality will be at the heart of any project. Everton are seeking to bring in an ‘eight-tier’ offering at their new home next to the Mersey and United have examined similar, with a range from an upgraded seat and access to separate food and drink kiosks to a champagne-and-caviar Tunnel Club similar to those operated at Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. United's owners Joel (L) and Avram (R) Glazer are seeking north of £6bn to sell the club Extracting cash from the pockets of those who attend will be the priority. There is no real fan zone and the numerous acreage the club owns around Old Trafford offers an opportunity to rectify that. United World makes sense. Every day, tourists from across the world head to the stadium, creating a trade in the sale of unofficial goods on the forecourts. Getting that cash and much more into the club’s pockets will be part of any plans. As for the United Station, it already exists – kind of. Behind the Stretford End sits a freight terminal currently rented out and already a decent revenue-generator. Some have wondered if that terminal could be brought back under club control and even act as a second, major rail station for Manchester – aimed at those on the more affluent southern side of the city who would then not need to travel into the centre. It could also act as a hub on matchdays, go some way to easing the crippling traffic chaos currently faced by thousands who stay until the final whistle and offer a rapid connection to the airport. The Qataris will be well aware of the project their neighbours from Abu Dhabi have carried out five miles to the east. They created the blueprint. But this would be likely to look very different. What we now know as the Etihad Stadium is surrounded by one of the most deprived areas in the country. The City takeover was made more palatable because of the investment made in such a community. The dynamics at Old Trafford, however, would be different. This is prime real estate, served by an efficient tram network, with MediaCity across the water. High-end apartments, restaurants and five-star hotels, something Manchester lacks, would make sense. That would be palatable for the town hall chiefs given the influx of spend, council tax and business rates they would bring. ‘When everything is done, this could even be a second city centre,’ one industry insider explained. ‘Or at the very least a vibrant city-centre south-west.’ Do not rule out a link with the other Old Trafford. Lancashire County Cricket Club’s own, Test-hosting home, heavily sponsored by Dubai-based Emirates, is unrecognisable following a decade of redevelopment. There is a precedent. While the look of the ground has totally changed, the capacity is barely untouched. Instead, a new hotel (with another on the way) and The Point – a giant red box which offers various levels of hospitality – dominate the landscape at a venue which no longer relies on cricket alone to generate revenue. While houses and a town hall separate the two grounds, they are linked by a road which in theory could be pedestrianised and, if money was no object, form the centrepiece of a northern sports village which could, for example, include a new stadium for United’s women’s team, whose supporters currently have to trek to Leigh – 15 miles away and in the borough of Wigan. A huge investment in the women’s side would not harm Qatar’s image problem. Indeed, Trafford council has already drafted plans for what they have named a ‘Processional Route’ that would link the two venues. The finances involved, should Qatar go big, would be immense. The £6bn the Glazers want would be dwarfed. They can afford it. Get it right and the all-important revenue streams would soar. On Friday, US merchant bankers Raine Group will open the sealed bids and start the next stage of the process. Should the Qataris prevail nothing – including United World at Qatar Airways Old Trafford – is off the table.

Credit: Getty Images “They need to find a way,” he said of Australia’s batsmen on spinning pitches as they head into the second Test at Delhi, beginning on Friday, after losing by an innings and 132 runs in Nagpur last week. “They didn’t get selection right. Not playing Head was ridiculous, and he could have bowled some extra overs. “The hardest thing for him now is how is he going to try and stay in the side after having such an amazing two years at home. “If he’s ever going to succeed it was going to be off the back of the confidence the home series gave him. It’s a really tough one for him. Obviously they had their reasons but the records of the other blokes aren’t overly flattering either apart from [Steve] Smith, and [Marnus] Labuschagne is obviously a good player of spin.” Marnus Labuschagne top-scored for Australia in the first Test. Credit: Getty Images The batsman under most pressure to keep his spot is Matt Renshaw after a first-ball duck and two at Nagpur. He is likely to be replaced by all-rounder Cameron Green should he prove his fitness following a broken finger. Following Australia’s home series win against South Africa, most of the Test players joined the Big Bash, further boosting its post-COVID revival, which left the shortest lead-up to an Indian Test tour in history. Australia spent a few days training at North Sydney Oval on a scarified pitch and then on spinning practice wickets in Bangalore before the first Test. “Ideally, they should have played a tour game,” said Lehmann, now an assistant coach with the Brisbane Heat. “They don’t like to do that because the tour match we played last time (2017) was on a green wicket. “But it’s still batting for a long period of times in the heat and getting used to the ball, things like that. So a tour game would have been handy ideally, but they decided to do the BBL didn’t they, which was good for the Heat because we got Marnus and Uzzie [Usman Khawaja], but maybe they needed a tour game. It’s easy in hindsight, though, isn’t it.” Lehmann was delighted with the preparation a two-week training camp in Dubai gave his squad ahead of the 2017 tour. Australia won the first Test and had opportunities in the other three Tests before going down 2-1 in the series. “It’s a fantastic spot to prepare,” Lehmann said of Dubai. “We were lucky enough to get there before going to India. We couldn’t have been any better prepared, and we came close [to winning the series]. “Hopefully these guys can repeat that [2017 performance] and get back on track.” Darren Lehmann, the last Australian coach to be part of a Test win in India. Credit: Getty Images “You’ve just got to bat big because 177 is never going to be enough. It was turning, so you’re trying to get to 250. If it was 250 it’s a different game.” Australia had India 5-168 and 7-240 before the home side went on to make 400, aided by some sloppy fielding, with No.9 Axar Patel scoring 84 in more than four hours as part of a tail that wagged furiously. Australia’s top scorer in the first innings was Labuschagne with 49 and in the second innings Steve Smith with an unbeaten 25 as Australia were bowled out for 91.

West Indies made 118/6 after winning the toss at Newlands. Sharma broke through after West Indies reached 78/1 in the 15th over, with former captain Stafanie Taylor and Shemaine Campbelle looking dangerous in a 74-run second-wicket partnership. Campbelle (30) attempted a reverse sweep and Smriti Mandhana took a good catch diving forward at backward point. Mandhana was back in action after missing India's win against Pakistan on Sunday because of a finger injury. Taylor, in her second match since being injured last September, scored 42 and was striking the ball solidly after a slow start. But three balls after Campbelle's dismissal she was given out leg before wicket to Sharma on review. Chinelle Henry was run out in the next over as West Indies lost three wickets for two runs within six balls. Sharma bowled Afy Fletcher in the last over to become the first Indian bowler to take 100 wickets in T20 Internationals. She finished with 3/15.

After bowling Quetta out for jus t 110 in 18.5 overs, Multan reached the target in 13.3 overs. Despite having little to defend, Quetta had an approach that if the wicket supported Sultans bowlers it would surely be beneficial for them as well. That attitude earned them an early wicket when medium pacer Nuwan Thushara trapped Shan Masood (3) lbw in the second over, but that was the only wicket to fall during the innings. Mohammad Rizwan with patience and Rilee Rossouw with aggression did not let Quetta's strategy work well. As Rizwan held one end steady, Rossouw smacked every loose delivery coming his way for a boundary. He got his fifty off just 33 balls and then went on to score 78 in 42 balls. Rizwan scored 28 in 34 balls. Rossouw hit nine fours and three sixes while Rizwan timed two strokes across the ropes. “I have been playing so much cricket so this was just another game. I am feeling pretty alright. On batting in Multan, it is fantastic to be back here and playing in front of a crowd,” said Rossouw. \"Everyone loves this franchise and everyone plays from the heart. The way we treat each other is with a lot of respect and we enjoy playing,\" he added. It was the pace trio of Sameen, Abbas Afridi, and Ihsan that gave their team an early edge over Quetta. Ihsan was on fire throughout his quota of overs. Ihsan claimed two back to back wickets to push Quetta to the wall. Sameen struck in his first over bringing down the rivals run scoring battery Martin Guptill after he made seven runs. The next to fall was Abdul Wahid Bangalzai, who was caught at mid-on by Kieron Pollard off Abbas Afridi. Quetta lost Sarfaraz Ahmed when Ihsan bowled a fiery delivery to rattle the stumps. The skipper went back after scoring just two runs. Ihsan struck again in his second over, as he sent destructive batter Jason Roy packing after scoring 27 runs, the highest from his side. The tall bowler continued to impress with his fiery pace. He trapped in-form Iftikhar Ahmed for an lbw, reducing Quetta to 46-5. A few overs later Usama Mir struck with the wicket of Mohammad Nawaz and Ihsan dismissed Umar Akmal, who produced 11 runs in 14 balls. Nawaz made 14 in 18 balls. Ihsan for his fifth wicket targeted Naseem Shah (1). Quetta were in tatters at 68 for eight in 12.4 overs. “It feels very good. I made a few mistakes in the first match. But in this match, I bowled the right length balls and that is why I was able to pick up five wickets,” said Ihsan. “The pitch was supporting pacers and support from the fans was also very great and hopefully I can keep performing in the games to come.” Veteran all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez, who was sent down the order, and Mohammad Husnain then took the score to 99, before the latter became the second victim of Sameen in the 18th over. He was the second highest scorer for Quetta with 22 runs. After an addition of 11 runs, the entire Quetta batting folded with the fall of the wicket of Hafeez for 18 runs that came in 15 balls. He was the second scalp of Abbas. “We could not start well. In the first 10 overs, we could not get going. We should give credit to them for the way they bowled,” said Sarfaraz. \"Hopefully we can bounce back in the matches that remain. We have plenty of pace (in the bowling attack) but if we don't bowl in the right areas, we will not be able to pick wickets,” he added.

Karachi Kings have lost their first game and will be under pressure a little bit,” he said. Azhar said that they have prepared well for the event. “Our preparation is good as most of the players have been playing consistent cricket. The foreign players as well as the local players were involved in different leagues. They are all ready and waiting for tomorrow’s game,” Azhar said. “Paul Stirling, Colin Munro, Rassie van der Dussen, Tom Curran and Gus Atkinson are available for tomorrow’s match,” Azhar said. “It will be easy for us to form playing XI this season. When we play at different venues we will consider which bowler will be able to prove better for the team. Cricket is played in the ground and not on paper. We have to play well to win,” Azhar stressed. He said that spin will play a massive role. “Spin will play a massive role. Our skipper (Shadab) is one of the best leg-spinners in the world. We have all kinds of varieties including left-arm spinner. We have a finger spinner in Abrar who did so well recently in Test matches. We will see which player we have to play against which opposition. Our spin department covers so many things,” Azhar said. He did not agree when a reporter said that United had not been impressive under Shadab’s captaincy. “I think Shadab was always one step ahead in matches which we have played so far. Last year we played 26 players. Our main strength was not in the park and if still you go to the playoffs it shows your team is doing well and your captain is right. Shadab is very talented and he knows cricket and he can be a very good captain,” said Azhar, a former international all-rounder. Azhar said that they want their fielders to do well in the event. “We are focusing on this area and want our fielding to appear prominent in this tournament because a crucial catch and a crucial run-out can change the game,” he said. Azhar wants United to win a title under his coaching. “In 2016 I was part of this team when we won the title. I will try to make this team champions again. It would be a proud moment for me if this team reclaimed the title under my coaching,” Azhar said. Meanwhile, after losing their opener against Peshawar Zalmi by just two runs on Tuesday, Kings rested on Wednesday.

Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is tapping into sports outside of rugby league to gain an understanding of the mentality that goes into performing at the highest level Leeds Rhinos' coach Rohan Smith using mentality from other sports stars Smith has exchanged sporting views with Jonny Bairstow and Jesse Marsch Lifted the Rhinos from 11th in the table to fifth last season and into a Grand Final By David Coverdale For Mailonline Published: 21:46, 15 February 2023 | Updated: 22:41, 15 February 2023 e-mail View comments The Ashes are still four months away but one Australian at Headingley has already been given a lesson in Bazball. Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is a keen cricket fan and met England and Yorkshire batsman Jonny Bairstow at a Rugby League World Cup match last autumn. As they sat together at Headingley, Bairstow told Smith all about the Test team’s new carefree, attacking approach under Brendon McCullum - and the Aussie now wants to bring Bazball to rugby league. ‘Jonny is a big Rhinos fan,’ Smith explains to Sportsmail ahead of his side’s Super League opener at Warrington on Thursday. ‘We have had a few messages and I actually watched the Australia and Fiji World Cup game with him here. ‘It was good to have a chat with someone who loves rugby league but plays a different sport. I am very inquisitive about other sports and the mentality that goes into performing at the highest level. Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is a fan of speaking to figures in sports outside of rugby Smith met up with Jonny Bairstow during Rugby League World Cup match last autumn ‘Some of the stuff we chatted about was around the enjoyment of the game and playing with freedom. That doesn’t mean that you hit every ball for four or six, but you have the freedom to see the ball and hit the ball. ‘That mentality can apply to rugby league - having the freedom to throw a pass without any pressure from above. It was cool to chat about that sort of stuff.’ Smith has often tapped into other sports, exchanging regular messages with his former fellow Leeds coach Jesse Marsch, who was sacked by the Premier League club last week. ‘I went over and watched Leeds United training last year,’ he says. ‘Jesse was very hands on. You could see he is very passionate about his sport and his coaching. He lives and breathes it. ‘We kept in conversation with texts to see how each other was doing. It was good to be able to bounce ideas off with him and have a couple of messages each week from a bloke who was working in the biggest competition in the world and under a lot of pressure.’ Smith has also spent time with bosses from rugby union, basketball and Australian rules. But his own first foray into coaching was not a team or ball sport. ‘As a 17-year-old, I started teaching swimming to four and six-year-olds,’ he reveals. ‘So, without knowing it at the time, that gave me some grounding as a coach. If you can deal with those kind of kids, you can probably deal with anything!’ Smith, though, was always destined to be a rugby league coach, even though he never played the sport professionally. His father Brian had a stellar coaching career, including spells in charge of Hull FC, Bradford and Wakefield. Former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch was another name Smith enjoyed exchanging views with Smith led the Rhinos from 11th in the table to fifth, and all the way to the Grand Final ‘It’s been a lifetime of education from him,’ says Smith, who lived in Leeds as a teenager during his dad’s days as Bradford boss and is now back with his wife and three children. ‘I am really grateful that all those conversations I had as a kid were helping to shape my own journey.’ In the Super League this season, Smith will also pits his wits against his uncle Tony - Brian’s younger brother – who is now coach of Hull FC, having previously led Leeds to two Grand Final wins in 2004 and 2007. ‘We will be playing Hull FC not Tony, but afterwards it will be nice to have a chat and a beer,’ says Smith. ‘Tony has probably been the most influential coach in the Super League era. He’s built up a lot of clubs and had success at different teams, including here. ‘Before I came here, I asked him if there would be any reason not to take on this opportunity at such a great club. He said, “No, go for it”. He thought it would be a great opportunity for me and that I was ready for it, which was all I needed. If I can achieve a little bit of what he did here, I’d be happy.’ Smith almost emulated his uncle immediately last season. After taking charge of the Rhinos in May, he lifted them from 11th in the table to fifth, then into the Grand Final, where they lost 24-12 to St Helens. Going into this campaign, Leeds’ youthful side are only rated as fourth favourites to win their first title since 2017, behind Saints, Wigan and Warrington. But Smith adds: ‘The expectation at this club is to win. Every Rhinos fan and sponsor expects that. Last season, we had a good finish, but we didn’t win anything, so hopefully we can get ourselves in a position to play the big ones again this year. There’s everything to play for.’ Share or comment on this article: Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is tapping into sports outside of rugby league e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

The bespectacled left-hander spurred Pakistan to a total of 165 for five after they were sent in to bat. Ireland were bowled out for 95, with left-arm spinner Nashra Sandhu claiming career-best figures of four for 18. The slightly-built Muneeba had not previously scored a half-century in 44 T20 internationals although she made a one-day international hundred against the same opponents in Lahore last November. Muneeba and veteran Nida Dar (33) shared a third-wicket partnership of 101. Muneeba faced 68 balls and hit 14 fours in her landmark innings. Ireland beat Pakistan 2-1 in a T20 series in Pakistan in November but were outplayed in a match between two sides who lost their opening World Cup matches.

In a bombshell exclusive last week Sportsmail revealed that a group of super-wealthy Qatari investors want to buy Manchester United . Should they succeed – and they think they will – they will waste little time on returning the Premier League giants to the top both on and off the field. Here, Mike Keegan examines how – with money no object – that takeover could look and details what could be the biggest sports and regeneration project this country has ever seen. They arrive at Manchester Airport ’s United Terminal (via Qatar Airways’ United Shuttle) and are whisked by the high-speed United Express (painted red, white and black) to the newly-opened United Station. The journey takes 10 minutes. From the platform, with ‘Glory, Glory Man United’ playing over the speakers, they get their first glimpse of the world-famous Stretford End, all glass and chrome following its no-expense spared revamp. Qatari investors are set to make a huge bid for Manchester United in the coming days Manager Erik ten Hag would get a massive transfer kitty if the deal went through United Monorail then carries them the short distance to United World, a giant entertainment complex in the shadows of Old Trafford surrounded by luxury apartments and high-end restaurants. Inside, safe from Manchester’s notorious climate, they shop until they drop. Anything you could wish for comes with United branding. They fill their baskets with replica shirts and a Captain Marvel Rolex before smashing a penalty past Peter Schmeichel in the interactive plaza. They pay for footage which they hastily post on their social media accounts. Then, they are back onto the monorail where a hologram of Eric Cantona wanders the aisle and tells them all about the history of the Theatre of Dreams and what to expect when they are inside. The stadium takes their breath away. The leaky roof is a thing of the past. This is £2bn well spent by the Qatari group who took control five years ago. There are no fewer than eight tiers of corporate hospitality to choose from and the 80,000 seats all offer crystal clear views of the hallowed turf. The new owners have taken the knowledge and expertise obtained from building seven new arenas for the 2022 World Cup and taken it up a level. They have gone for two spaces in Redzone, because they want the authentic experience and the unrivalled atmosphere promised. They are in padded, heated seats and can order food and drinks via the United+ App, to which they subscribe every year. While they may live thousands of miles away, it makes them feel like part of the United family. The app, a snip at the equivalent of £20 a month, offers them anything from exclusive content to the chance to bid in an auction in exchange for a personalised message from a player of their choice. The visitors, just two of the 659m global followers United boast, barely have time to catch their breath before Erik ten Hag’s Premier League and Champions League winners take to the field. Club legends such as Eric Cantona could be honoured in several ways around a new-look club Jude Bellingham - one of the most sought-after prospects in Europe - could become United club captain If star forward Marcus Rashford continues his fine form he could too become a club legend Today, captain Jude Bellingham takes centre stage as the resurgent red machine takes another three points to put them six points clear of rivals City and Newcastle. But there are heroes all over the pitch. Since Qatar replaced the Glazers dividends and debt payments have become a thing of the past. Instead there is investment. Investment on a scale never seen before. Some of the biggest names in the world are here in red shirts and white shorts. Following the routine victory it is back on the monorail to Red Devils’ Lair, one of three-United themed hotels built on the vast acreage of land around Old Trafford that the Qataris have transformed. It was not cheap, but a guest appearance from Kylian Mbappe, signed for a world record £250m from Paris Saint-Germain, and a Michelin-Star meal (accompanied by wines chosen by Sir Alex Ferguson) makes it worthwhile. As they nod off, in rooms adorned with pictures of United greats from George Best to Marcus Rashford, they plan their next trip. Sound far-fetched? It might, but should the Qatar group this newspaper revealed wanted to buy Manchester United succeed, it may not be a million miles away from reality. Those with knowledge of the prospective buyers have disclosed that they intend to move quickly and decisively. They see United as the biggest club in the world and will waste no time in ensuring that they start to act like it. Potential is the key word. Clubs like United do not come onto the market often. Across the industry it is widely recognised that, under the Glazers, United have not come close to monetising that vast following. Along with arming Erik ten Hag with the players he needs, making sure that happens will be top of the list. When it comes to Old Trafford, they would get a head start. Backed into a corner by fan fury, the Glazers brought in the architects. The plans and proposals – revamp or rebuild – are already drawn up. With money no object, a £2bn transformation may well be on the cards. Either way, corporate hospitality will be at the heart of any project. Everton are seeking to bring in an ‘eight-tier’ offering at their new home next to the Mersey and United have examined similar, with a range from an upgraded seat and access to separate food and drink kiosks to a champagne-and-caviar Tunnel Club similar to those operated at Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. United's owners Joel (L) and Avram (R) Glazer are seeking north of £6bn to sell the club Extracting cash from the pockets of those who attend will be the priority. There is no real fan zone and the numerous acreage the club owns around Old Trafford offers an opportunity to rectify that. United World makes sense. Every day, tourists from across the world head to the stadium, creating a trade in the sale of unofficial goods on the forecourts. Getting that cash and much more into the club’s pockets will be part of any plans. As for the United Station, it already exists – kind of. Behind the Stretford End sits a freight terminal currently rented out and already a decent revenue-generator. Some have wondered if that terminal could be brought back under club control and even act as a second, major rail station for Manchester – aimed at those on the more affluent southern side of the city who would then not need to travel into the centre. It could also act as a hub on matchdays, go some way to easing the crippling traffic chaos currently faced by thousands who stay until the final whistle and offer a rapid connection to the airport. The Qataris will be well aware of the project their neighbours from Abu Dhabi have carried out five miles to the east. They created the blueprint. But this would be likely to look very different. What we now know as the Etihad Stadium is surrounded by one of the most deprived areas in the country. The City takeover was made more palatable because of the investment made in such a community. The dynamics at Old Trafford, however, would be different. This is prime real estate, served by an efficient tram network, with MediaCity across the water. High-end apartments, restaurants and five-star hotels, something Manchester lacks, would make sense. That would be palatable for the town hall chiefs given the influx of spend, council tax and business rates they would bring. ‘When everything is done, this could even be a second city centre,’ one industry insider explained. ‘Or at the very least a vibrant city-centre south-west.’ Do not rule out a link with the other Old Trafford. Lancashire County Cricket Club’s own, Test-hosting home, heavily sponsored by Dubai-based Emirates, is unrecognisable following a decade of redevelopment. There is a precedent. While the look of the ground has totally changed, the capacity is barely untouched. Instead, a new hotel (with another on the way) and The Point – a giant red box which offers various levels of hospitality – dominate the landscape at a venue which no longer relies on cricket alone to generate revenue. While houses and a town hall separate the two grounds, they are linked by a road which in theory could be pedestrianised and, if money was no object, form the centrepiece of a northern sports village which could, for example, include a new stadium for United’s women’s team, whose supporters currently have to trek to Leigh – 15 miles away and in the borough of Wigan. A huge investment in the women’s side would not harm Qatar’s image problem. Indeed, Trafford council has already drafted plans for what they have named a ‘Processional Route’ that would link the two venues. The finances involved, should Qatar go big, would be immense. The £6bn the Glazers want would be dwarfed. They can afford it. Get it right and the all-important revenue streams would soar. On Friday, US merchant bankers Raine Group will open the sealed bids and start the next stage of the process. Should the Qataris prevail nothing – including United World at Qatar Airways Old Trafford – is off the table.

The last coach to win a Test in India for almost two decades, during the 2017 tour, Lehmann believes Australia should have played a tour match on arrival and endorsed the two-week training camp the 2017 team had in Dubai. Travis Head training in Nagpur before being left out of the first Test. Credit: Getty Images “They need to find a way,” he said of Australia’s batsmen on spinning pitches as they head into the second Test at Delhi, beginning on Friday, after losing by an innings and 132 runs in Nagpur last week. “They didn’t get selection right. Not playing Head was ridiculous, and he could have bowled some extra overs. “The hardest thing for him now is how is he going to try and stay in the side after having such an amazing two years at home. “If he’s ever going to succeed it was going to be off the back of the confidence the home series gave him. It’s a really tough one for him. Obviously they had their reasons but the records of the other blokes aren’t overly flattering either apart from [Steve] Smith, and [Marnus] Labuschagne is obviously a good player of spin.” Marnus Labuschagne top-scored for Australia in the first Test. Credit: Getty Images The batsman under most pressure to keep his spot is Matt Renshaw after a first-ball duck and two at Nagpur. He is likely to be replaced by all-rounder Cameron Green should he prove his fitness following a broken finger. Following Australia’s home series win against South Africa, most of the Test players joined the Big Bash, further boosting its post-COVID revival, which left the shortest lead-up to an Indian Test tour in history. Australia spent a few days training at North Sydney Oval on a scarified pitch and then on spinning practice wickets in Bangalore before the first Test. “Ideally, they should have played a tour game,” said Lehmann, now an assistant coach with the Brisbane Heat. “They don’t like to do that because the tour match we played last time (2017) was on a green wicket. “But it’s still batting for a long period of times in the heat and getting used to the ball, things like that. So a tour game would have been handy ideally, but they decided to do the BBL didn’t they, which was good for the Heat because we got Marnus and Uzzie [Usman Khawaja], but maybe they needed a tour game. It’s easy in hindsight, though, isn’t it.” Lehmann was delighted with the preparation a two-week training camp in Dubai gave his squad ahead of the 2017 tour. Australia won the first Test and had opportunities in the other three Tests before going down 2-1 in the series. “It’s a fantastic spot to prepare,” Lehmann said of Dubai. “We were lucky enough to get there before going to India. We couldn’t have been any better prepared, and we came close [to winning the series]. “Hopefully these guys can repeat that [2017 performance] and get back on track.” Darren Lehmann, the last Australian coach to be part of a Test win in India. Credit: Getty Images “You’ve just got to bat big because 177 is never going to be enough. It was turning, so you’re trying to get to 250. If it was 250 it’s a different game.” Australia had India 5-168 and 7-240 before the home side went on to make 400, aided by some sloppy fielding, with No.9 Axar Patel scoring 84 in more than four hours as part of a tail that wagged furiously. Australia’s top scorer in the first innings was Labuschagne with 49 and in the second innings Steve Smith with an unbeaten 25 as Australia were bowled out for 91.

After bowling Quetta out for jus t 110 in 18.5 overs, Multan reached the target in 13.3 overs. Despite having little to defend, Quetta had an approach that if the wicket supported Sultans bowlers it would surely be beneficial for them as well. That attitude earned them an early wicket when medium pacer Nuwan Thushara trapped Shan Masood (3) lbw in the second over, but that was the only wicket to fall during the innings. Mohammad Rizwan with patience and Rilee Rossouw with aggression did not let Quetta's strategy work well. As Rizwan held one end steady, Rossouw smacked every loose delivery coming his way for a boundary. He got his fifty off just 33 balls and then went on to score 78 in 42 balls. Rizwan scored 28 in 34 balls. Rossouw hit nine fours and three sixes while Rizwan timed two strokes across the ropes. “I have been playing so much cricket so this was just another game. I am feeling pretty alright. On batting in Multan, it is fantastic to be back here and playing in front of a crowd,” said Rossouw. \"Everyone loves this franchise and everyone plays from the heart. The way we treat each other is with a lot of respect and we enjoy playing,\" he added. It was the pace trio of Sameen, Abbas Afridi, and Ihsan that gave their team an early edge over Quetta. Ihsan was on fire throughout his quota of overs. Ihsan claimed two back to back wickets to push Quetta to the wall. Sameen struck in his first over bringing down the rivals run scoring battery Martin Guptill after he made seven runs. The next to fall was Abdul Wahid Bangalzai, who was caught at mid-on by Kieron Pollard off Abbas Afridi. Quetta lost Sarfaraz Ahmed when Ihsan bowled a fiery delivery to rattle the stumps. The skipper went back after scoring just two runs. Ihsan struck again in his second over, as he sent destructive batter Jason Roy packing after scoring 27 runs, the highest from his side. The tall bowler continued to impress with his fiery pace. He trapped in-form Iftikhar Ahmed for an lbw, reducing Quetta to 46-5. A few overs later Usama Mir struck with the wicket of Mohammad Nawaz and Ihsan dismissed Umar Akmal, who produced 11 runs in 14 balls. Nawaz made 14 in 18 balls. Ihsan for his fifth wicket targeted Naseem Shah (1). Quetta were in tatters at 68 for eight in 12.4 overs. “It feels very good. I made a few mistakes in the first match. But in this match, I bowled the right length balls and that is why I was able to pick up five wickets,” said Ihsan. “The pitch was supporting pacers and support from the fans was also very great and hopefully I can keep performing in the games to come.” Veteran all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez, who was sent down the order, and Mohammad Husnain then took the score to 99, before the latter became the second victim of Sameen in the 18th over. He was the second highest scorer for Quetta with 22 runs. After an addition of 11 runs, the entire Quetta batting folded with the fall of the wicket of Hafeez for 18 runs that came in 15 balls. He was the second scalp of Abbas. “We could not start well. In the first 10 overs, we could not get going. We should give credit to them for the way they bowled,” said Sarfaraz. \"Hopefully we can bounce back in the matches that remain. We have plenty of pace (in the bowling attack) but if we don't bowl in the right areas, we will not be able to pick wickets,” he added.

Karachi Kings have lost their first game and will be under pressure a little bit,” he said. Azhar said that they have prepared well for the event. “Our preparation is good as most of the players have been playing consistent cricket. The foreign players as well as the local players were involved in different leagues. They are all ready and waiting for tomorrow’s game,” Azhar said. “Paul Stirling, Colin Munro, Rassie van der Dussen, Tom Curran and Gus Atkinson are available for tomorrow’s match,” Azhar said. “It will be easy for us to form playing XI this season. When we play at different venues we will consider which bowler will be able to prove better for the team. Cricket is played in the ground and not on paper. We have to play well to win,” Azhar stressed. He said that spin will play a massive role. “Spin will play a massive role. Our skipper (Shadab) is one of the best leg-spinners in the world. We have all kinds of varieties including left-arm spinner. We have a finger spinner in Abrar who did so well recently in Test matches. We will see which player we have to play against which opposition. Our spin department covers so many things,” Azhar said. He did not agree when a reporter said that United had not been impressive under Shadab’s captaincy. “I think Shadab was always one step ahead in matches which we have played so far. Last year we played 26 players. Our main strength was not in the park and if still you go to the playoffs it shows your team is doing well and your captain is right. Shadab is very talented and he knows cricket and he can be a very good captain,” said Azhar, a former international all-rounder. Azhar said that they want their fielders to do well in the event. “We are focusing on this area and want our fielding to appear prominent in this tournament because a crucial catch and a crucial run-out can change the game,” he said. Azhar wants United to win a title under his coaching. “In 2016 I was part of this team when we won the title. I will try to make this team champions again. It would be a proud moment for me if this team reclaimed the title under my coaching,” Azhar said. Meanwhile, after losing their opener against Peshawar Zalmi by just two runs on Tuesday, Kings rested on Wednesday.

Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is tapping into sports outside of rugby league to gain an understanding of the mentality that goes into performing at the highest level Leeds Rhinos' coach Rohan Smith using mentality from other sports stars Smith has exchanged sporting views with Jonny Bairstow and Jesse Marsch Lifted the Rhinos from 11th in the table to fifth last season and into a Grand Final By David Coverdale For Mailonline Published: 21:46, 15 February 2023 | Updated: 22:41, 15 February 2023 e-mail View comments The Ashes are still four months away but one Australian at Headingley has already been given a lesson in Bazball. Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is a keen cricket fan and met England and Yorkshire batsman Jonny Bairstow at a Rugby League World Cup match last autumn. As they sat together at Headingley, Bairstow told Smith all about the Test team’s new carefree, attacking approach under Brendon McCullum - and the Aussie now wants to bring Bazball to rugby league. ‘Jonny is a big Rhinos fan,’ Smith explains to Sportsmail ahead of his side’s Super League opener at Warrington on Thursday. ‘We have had a few messages and I actually watched the Australia and Fiji World Cup game with him here. ‘It was good to have a chat with someone who loves rugby league but plays a different sport. I am very inquisitive about other sports and the mentality that goes into performing at the highest level. Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is a fan of speaking to figures in sports outside of rugby Smith met up with Jonny Bairstow during Rugby League World Cup match last autumn ‘Some of the stuff we chatted about was around the enjoyment of the game and playing with freedom. That doesn’t mean that you hit every ball for four or six, but you have the freedom to see the ball and hit the ball. ‘That mentality can apply to rugby league - having the freedom to throw a pass without any pressure from above. It was cool to chat about that sort of stuff.’ Smith has often tapped into other sports, exchanging regular messages with his former fellow Leeds coach Jesse Marsch, who was sacked by the Premier League club last week. ‘I went over and watched Leeds United training last year,’ he says. ‘Jesse was very hands on. You could see he is very passionate about his sport and his coaching. He lives and breathes it. ‘We kept in conversation with texts to see how each other was doing. It was good to be able to bounce ideas off with him and have a couple of messages each week from a bloke who was working in the biggest competition in the world and under a lot of pressure.’ Smith has also spent time with bosses from rugby union, basketball and Australian rules. But his own first foray into coaching was not a team or ball sport. ‘As a 17-year-old, I started teaching swimming to four and six-year-olds,’ he reveals. ‘So, without knowing it at the time, that gave me some grounding as a coach. If you can deal with those kind of kids, you can probably deal with anything!’ Smith, though, was always destined to be a rugby league coach, even though he never played the sport professionally. His father Brian had a stellar coaching career, including spells in charge of Hull FC, Bradford and Wakefield. Former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch was another name Smith enjoyed exchanging views with Smith led the Rhinos from 11th in the table to fifth, and all the way to the Grand Final ‘It’s been a lifetime of education from him,’ says Smith, who lived in Leeds as a teenager during his dad’s days as Bradford boss and is now back with his wife and three children. ‘I am really grateful that all those conversations I had as a kid were helping to shape my own journey.’ In the Super League this season, Smith will also pits his wits against his uncle Tony - Brian’s younger brother – who is now coach of Hull FC, having previously led Leeds to two Grand Final wins in 2004 and 2007. ‘We will be playing Hull FC not Tony, but afterwards it will be nice to have a chat and a beer,’ says Smith. ‘Tony has probably been the most influential coach in the Super League era. He’s built up a lot of clubs and had success at different teams, including here. ‘Before I came here, I asked him if there would be any reason not to take on this opportunity at such a great club. He said, “No, go for it”. He thought it would be a great opportunity for me and that I was ready for it, which was all I needed. If I can achieve a little bit of what he did here, I’d be happy.’ Smith almost emulated his uncle immediately last season. After taking charge of the Rhinos in May, he lifted them from 11th in the table to fifth, then into the Grand Final, where they lost 24-12 to St Helens. Going into this campaign, Leeds’ youthful side are only rated as fourth favourites to win their first title since 2017, behind Saints, Wigan and Warrington. But Smith adds: ‘The expectation at this club is to win. Every Rhinos fan and sponsor expects that. Last season, we had a good finish, but we didn’t win anything, so hopefully we can get ourselves in a position to play the big ones again this year. There’s everything to play for.’ Share or comment on this article: Leeds Rhinos coach Rohan Smith is tapping into sports outside of rugby league e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

In a bombshell exclusive last week Sportsmail revealed that a group of super-wealthy Qatari investors want to buy Manchester United . Should they succeed – and they think they will – they will waste little time on returning the Premier League giants to the top both on and off the field. Here, Mike Keegan examines how – with money no object – that takeover could look and details what could be the biggest sports and regeneration project this country has ever seen. They arrive at Manchester Airport ’s United Terminal (via Qatar Airways’ United Shuttle) and are whisked by the high-speed United Express (painted red, white and black) to the newly-opened United Station. The journey takes 10 minutes. From the platform, with ‘Glory, Glory Man United’ playing over the speakers, they get their first glimpse of the world-famous Stretford End, all glass and chrome following its no-expense spared revamp. Qatari investors are set to make a huge bid for Manchester United in the coming days Manager Erik ten Hag would get a massive transfer kitty if the deal went through United Monorail then carries them the short distance to United World, a giant entertainment complex in the shadows of Old Trafford surrounded by luxury apartments and high-end restaurants. Inside, safe from Manchester’s notorious climate, they shop until they drop. Anything you could wish for comes with United branding. They fill their baskets with replica shirts and a Captain Marvel Rolex before smashing a penalty past Peter Schmeichel in the interactive plaza. They pay for footage which they hastily post on their social media accounts. Then, they are back onto the monorail where a hologram of Eric Cantona wanders the aisle and tells them all about the history of the Theatre of Dreams and what to expect when they are inside. The stadium takes their breath away. The leaky roof is a thing of the past. This is £2bn well spent by the Qatari group who took control five years ago. There are no fewer than eight tiers of corporate hospitality to choose from and the 80,000 seats all offer crystal clear views of the hallowed turf. The new owners have taken the knowledge and expertise obtained from building seven new arenas for the 2022 World Cup and taken it up a level. They have gone for two spaces in Redzone, because they want the authentic experience and the unrivalled atmosphere promised. They are in padded, heated seats and can order food and drinks via the United+ App, to which they subscribe every year. While they may live thousands of miles away, it makes them feel like part of the United family. The app, a snip at the equivalent of £20 a month, offers them anything from exclusive content to the chance to bid in an auction in exchange for a personalised message from a player of their choice. The visitors, just two of the 659m global followers United boast, barely have time to catch their breath before Erik ten Hag’s Premier League and Champions League winners take to the field. Club legends such as Eric Cantona could be honoured in several ways around a new-look club Jude Bellingham - one of the most sought-after prospects in Europe - could become United club captain If star forward Marcus Rashford continues his fine form he could too become a club legend Today, captain Jude Bellingham takes centre stage as the resurgent red machine takes another three points to put them six points clear of rivals City and Newcastle. But there are heroes all over the pitch. Since Qatar replaced the Glazers dividends and debt payments have become a thing of the past. Instead there is investment. Investment on a scale never seen before. Some of the biggest names in the world are here in red shirts and white shorts. Following the routine victory it is back on the monorail to Red Devils’ Lair, one of three-United themed hotels built on the vast acreage of land around Old Trafford that the Qataris have transformed. It was not cheap, but a guest appearance from Kylian Mbappe, signed for a world record £250m from Paris Saint-Germain, and a Michelin-Star meal (accompanied by wines chosen by Sir Alex Ferguson) makes it worthwhile. As they nod off, in rooms adorned with pictures of United greats from George Best to Marcus Rashford, they plan their next trip. Sound far-fetched? It might, but should the Qatar group this newspaper revealed wanted to buy Manchester United succeed, it may not be a million miles away from reality. Those with knowledge of the prospective buyers have disclosed that they intend to move quickly and decisively. They see United as the biggest club in the world and will waste no time in ensuring that they start to act like it. Potential is the key word. Clubs like United do not come onto the market often. Across the industry it is widely recognised that, under the Glazers, United have not come close to monetising that vast following. Along with arming Erik ten Hag with the players he needs, making sure that happens will be top of the list. When it comes to Old Trafford, they would get a head start. Backed into a corner by fan fury, the Glazers brought in the architects. The plans and proposals – revamp or rebuild – are already drawn up. With money no object, a £2bn transformation may well be on the cards. Either way, corporate hospitality will be at the heart of any project. Everton are seeking to bring in an ‘eight-tier’ offering at their new home next to the Mersey and United have examined similar, with a range from an upgraded seat and access to separate food and drink kiosks to a champagne-and-caviar Tunnel Club similar to those operated at Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. United's owners Joel (L) and Avram (R) Glazer are seeking north of £6bn to sell the club Extracting cash from the pockets of those who attend will be the priority. There is no real fan zone and the numerous acreage the club owns around Old Trafford offers an opportunity to rectify that. United World makes sense. Every day, tourists from across the world head to the stadium, creating a trade in the sale of unofficial goods on the forecourts. Getting that cash and much more into the club’s pockets will be part of any plans. As for the United Station, it already exists – kind of. Behind the Stretford End sits a freight terminal currently rented out and already a decent revenue-generator. Some have wondered if that terminal could be brought back under club control and even act as a second, major rail station for Manchester – aimed at those on the more affluent southern side of the city who would then not need to travel into the centre. It could also act as a hub on matchdays, go some way to easing the crippling traffic chaos currently faced by thousands who stay until the final whistle and offer a rapid connection to the airport. The Qataris will be well aware of the project their neighbours from Abu Dhabi have carried out five miles to the east. They created the blueprint. But this would be likely to look very different. What we now know as the Etihad Stadium is surrounded by one of the most deprived areas in the country. The City takeover was made more palatable because of the investment made in such a community. The dynamics at Old Trafford, however, would be different. This is prime real estate, served by an efficient tram network, with MediaCity across the water. High-end apartments, restaurants and five-star hotels, something Manchester lacks, would make sense. That would be palatable for the town hall chiefs given the influx of spend, council tax and business rates they would bring. ‘When everything is done, this could even be a second city centre,’ one industry insider explained. ‘Or at the very least a vibrant city-centre south-west.’ Do not rule out a link with the other Old Trafford. Lancashire County Cricket Club’s own, Test-hosting home, heavily sponsored by Dubai-based Emirates, is unrecognisable following a decade of redevelopment. There is a precedent. While the look of the ground has totally changed, the capacity is barely untouched. Instead, a new hotel (with another on the way) and The Point – a giant red box which offers various levels of hospitality – dominate the landscape at a venue which no longer relies on cricket alone to generate revenue. While houses and a town hall separate the two grounds, they are linked by a road which in theory could be pedestrianised and, if money was no object, form the centrepiece of a northern sports village which could, for example, include a new stadium for United’s women’s team, whose supporters currently have to trek to Leigh – 15 miles away and in the borough of Wigan. A huge investment in the women’s side would not harm Qatar’s image problem. Indeed, Trafford council has already drafted plans for what they have named a ‘Processional Route’ that would link the two venues. The finances involved, should Qatar go big, would be immense. The £6bn the Glazers want would be dwarfed. They can afford it. Get it right and the all-important revenue streams would soar. On Friday, US merchant bankers Raine Group will open the sealed bids and start the next stage of the process. Should the Qataris prevail nothing – including United World at Qatar Airways Old Trafford – is off the table.

The last coach to win a Test in India for almost two decades, during the 2017 tour, Lehmann believes Australia should have played a tour match on arrival and endorsed the two-week training camp the 2017 team had in Dubai.

Credit: Getty Images “They need to find a way,” he said of Australia’s batsmen on spinning pitches as they head into the second Test at Delhi, beginning on Friday, after losing by an innings and 132 runs in Nagpur last week. “They didn’t get selection right. Not playing Head was ridiculous, and he could have bowled some extra overs. “The hardest thing for him now is how is he going to try and stay in the side after having such an amazing two years at home. “If he’s ever going to succeed it was going to be off the back of the confidence the home series gave him. It’s a really tough one for him. Obviously they had their reasons but the records of the other blokes aren’t overly flattering either apart from [Steve] Smith, and [Marnus] Labuschagne is obviously a good player of spin.” Marnus Labuschagne top-scored for Australia in the first Test. Credit: Getty Images The batsman under most pressure to keep his spot is Matt Renshaw after a first-ball duck and two at Nagpur. He is likely to be replaced by all-rounder Cameron Green should he prove his fitness following a broken finger. Following Australia’s home series win against South Africa, most of the Test players joined the Big Bash, further boosting its post-COVID revival, which left the shortest lead-up to an Indian Test tour in history. Australia spent a few days training at North Sydney Oval on a scarified pitch and then on spinning practice wickets in Bangalore before the first Test. “Ideally, they should have played a tour game,” said Lehmann, now an assistant coach with the Brisbane Heat. “They don’t like to do that because the tour match we played last time (2017) was on a green wicket. “But it’s still batting for a long period of times in the heat and getting used to the ball, things like that. So a tour game would have been handy ideally, but they decided to do the BBL didn’t they, which was good for the Heat because we got Marnus and Uzzie [Usman Khawaja], but maybe they needed a tour game. It’s easy in hindsight, though, isn’t it.” Lehmann was delighted with the preparation a two-week training camp in Dubai gave his squad ahead of the 2017 tour. Australia won the first Test and had opportunities in the other three Tests before going down 2-1 in the series. “It’s a fantastic spot to prepare,” Lehmann said of Dubai. “We were lucky enough to get there before going to India. We couldn’t have been any better prepared, and we came close [to winning the series]. “Hopefully these guys can repeat that [2017 performance] and get back on track.” Darren Lehmann, the last Australian coach to be part of a Test win in India. Credit: Getty Images “You’ve just got to bat big because 177 is never going to be enough. It was turning, so you’re trying to get to 250. If it was 250 it’s a different game.” Australia had India 5-168 and 7-240 before the home side went on to make 400, aided by some sloppy fielding, with No.9 Axar Patel scoring 84 in more than four hours as part of a tail that wagged furiously. Australia’s top scorer in the first innings was Labuschagne with 49 and in the second innings Steve Smith with an unbeaten 25 as Australia were bowled out for 91.

West Indies made 118/6 after winning the toss at Newlands. Sharma broke through after West Indies reached 78/1 in the 15th over, with former captain Stafanie Taylor and Shemaine Campbelle looking dangerous in a 74-run second-wicket partnership. Campbelle (30) attempted a reverse sweep and Smriti Mandhana took a good catch diving forward at backward point. Mandhana was back in action after missing India's win against Pakistan on Sunday because of a finger injury. Taylor, in her second match since being injured last September, scored 42 and was striking the ball solidly after a slow start. But three balls after Campbelle's dismissal she was given out leg before wicket to Sharma on review. Chinelle Henry was run out in the next over as West Indies lost three wickets for two runs within six balls. Sharma bowled Afy Fletcher in the last over to become the first Indian bowler to take 100 wickets in T20 Internationals. She finished with 3/15.

Pakistan lost their opening game against arch-rivals India by seven wickets on Sunday at the same venue, their bowling unit failing to defend a challenging total of 149/4 with Jemimah Rodrigues taking the game away from their grasp with an unbeaten fifty. Ireland began their campaign against more fancied neighbours England at the Boland Park in Paarl, where spinners Sophie Ecclestone (3/13) and Sarah Glenn’s (3/19) three-fors ensured they got bowled out with a little over 100 on board. Alice Capsey’s 22-ball 51 then ensured the Englishwomen got home with more than five overs to spare, even if they lost wickets in a heap towards the end. While Ireland announced an unchanged XI for their second game of the tournament, Pakistan had one change to their lineup — Tuba Hassan replacing Sidra Ameen.
