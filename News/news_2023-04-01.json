The Harare Sports Club was buzzing with excitement as fans poured in to rally behind their beloved Chevrons. As the players took to the field, the roar of the crowd was deafening. It seemed like the whole of Zimbabwe had turned out to support their team. The Netherlands put up a valiant fight, but it was no match for the Chevrons, who made light work of their opponents to win the series 2-1. This was just the latest in a string of international cricket matches that had been recording huge numbers in fan attendance. The Bulawayo Metropolitan Cricket Association (BMCA) Chairperson, Godwin Dube, weighed in on what he thought was behind the massive turnout. According to Dube, Zimbabwe’s form in international cricket was one of the key factors behind the rise in follower-ship and filling up of stadia. “The purple patch being experienced by our national teams on the international stage. Our senior national teams have done fairly well in the last 13 months, the teams have shown a lot of fight even against the traditional powerhouses leading to more optimism and inspiration to the populace. This has made more people want to associate with cricket,” he said. Dube also credited the increase in attendance to the fact that a good amount of cricket had been played in the country over the last few years. So far this year, three teams have toured the country, including a Test tour which took place at Queens Sports Club against the West Indies in February. This had made it easier to market and associate with the game, leading to a good positive vibe among all cricket stakeholders, and more people falling in love with the sport as a result. “A good amount of cricket has also been played in the last few years hence it has become easier to market and associate with the game. This has led to a good positive vibe among all cricket stakeholders, more people have fallen in love as a result,” he said. Cricket is known as the gentlemen’s game, and it attracts families to come and enjoy the game without any hassles. The non-violent environment plays a part in attracting many people to the stadiums as it is almost unexpected to experience violence in stadiums. Social media has also played a significant role in increasing interest in the sport. With more than three billion people connected to social networks around the world, cricket in Zimbabwe is one sport that has been talked about the most on social media. The Zimbabwe Cricket application has made it easy for people to track and follow games, leading to increased interest in the sport. “A lot has been done to market the game games, the use of social media, influencers and increased articles in traditional print media has all played a big part. In Bulawayo alone, there are more than 10 groups that I have come across, former and current players are active in these groups. The amount of cricket discussions is almost addictive and it is rare to miss any cricket activity or story happening in the country. “The Zimbabwe Cricket App has also made it possible to track and keep in touch with all cricket being played in the four corners of the country hence fans are able to track the progress of all players and competitions,” said Dube. The inactivity of other popular sports such as football and rugby has also been beneficial to the increased popularity of cricket. As Zimbabwe prepares to host the 2023 ODI World Cup Qualifiers in June, the numbers of fans in cricket stadiums are likely to increase, and the excitement is palpable. The Chevrons are set to take the cricketing world by storm, and Zimbabwe’s love for the sport is only going to grow stronger. — @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-03-31 22:05:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Inaugural South Asia Lawyers’ Cricket Cup kicks off in Colombo","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Inaugural-South-Asia-Lawyers--Cricket-Cup-kicks-off-in-Colombo/23-746957","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The inaugural South Asia Lawyers’ Cricket Cup kicked off in Colombo on Thursday and will go on till 5 April.

Gaikwad was all class in his 92 off 50 balls before Titans pulled things back in the middle overs to limit Chennai Super Kings to 178 for seven after opting to bowl first in front of a near capacity crowd at the world’s largest cricket stadium here. In the form of his life over the past three months, Gill played some jaw-dropping strokes in his 63 off 36 balls to set up a fine win for the home team. Titans got home in 19.2 overs. Gill’s opening partner Wriddhiman Saha showed he has still got it as he smashed a couple of sixes and as many fours in his 16-ball 25 that got the Titans going in the run chase. Gill’s best shot of the innings was the back foot punch off CSK’s impact player Tushar Deshpande and he followed with a pick up shot over midwicket. Titans’ impact player Sai Sudharsan, who was used in place of an injured Kane Williamson, contributed with 22 off 17 balls. When Gill departed, Titans needed 41 off the last five overs but CSK managed to take the game down to the wire. It needed a cameo from Rashid Khan (10 not out off 3) to settled the nerves in the Titans dressing room. Earlier, it was a display of effortless hitting from Gaikwad, who relied on his lofted drives over extra cover and crisp pull shots to collect as many as nine sixes. Apart from Gaikwad, the only other batter who put the Titans under pressure was Moeen Ali who came up with a 17-ball 23. Ali’s flat six off Mohammad Shami on a free-hit ball was the highlight of his cameo. Gaikwad pulled IPL debutant Joshua Little on his very first ball to set the tone of his innings. That over went for 15 runs and with Shami conceding 17 runs in the following over, CSK got the momentum they were looking for. Titans’ trump card Rashid Khan was introduced in the powerplay and as he often does, he got the wicket that his team was looking for by getting the dangerous looking Ali caught behind. Rashid’s second over saw him getting rid of England Test captain Ben Stokes, who too was caught by wicketkeeper Saha, leaving CSK at 70 for three. However, the fall of wickets did not make Gaikwad change his game as he kept getting the boundaries. He welcomed Alzarri Joseph into the attack by smashing him for three sixes in the eighth over. Titans did well to stem the flow of runs in the middle overs and got the wicket of Ambati Rayudu. Shivam Dube struggled to find the big hits and that put pressure on Gaikwad who was caught in the deep in the 17th over and missed out on a deserving hundred. Skipper M S Dhoni came out to bat at number eight but still managed to make an impact as he pulled Little for a six before flicking him for a four in the final over, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Williamson injured his knee while fielding at the boundary and limped off the field. The last five overs yielded 45 runs for CSK.

बाहर हो गए। अब उनकी जगह डेविड वॉर्नर को कप्तान बनाया गया है। दिल्ली कैपिटल्स को आईपीएल 2023 में अपना पहला लखनऊ सुपर जायंट्स के खिलाफ खेलना है। अब वॉर्नर ने पंत के लिए बड़ा बयान दिया है। दिल्ली कैपिटल्स के मौजूदा सीजन के कप्तान डेविड वॉर्नर ने कहा कि टीम चाहती है कि नियमित कप्तान ऋषभ पंत ‘चोट से उबरने में अपना पूरा समय लें’ और किसी तरह की जल्दबाजी ना करें। वॉर्नर ने लखनऊ सुपर जायंट्स के खिलाफ शनिवार को खेले जाने वाले टीम के शुरूआती मुकाबले से पहले कहा कि वह हमारा समर्थन करने के लिए उत्सुक है। मुझे यकीन है कि वह स्टेडियम में आकर हमारे मैचों को देखना चाहेंगे। डेविड वॉर्नर ने कहा कि लेकिन हम चाहते है कि वह चोट से उबरे और पूरा आराम कर जल्दी से स्वस्थ होने पर ध्यान दें। वॉर्नर ने टीम में उप-कप्तान के रूप में अक्षर पटेल की भूमिका के बारे में भी बात की। उन्होंने कहा कि अक्षर को टीम के सभी खिलाड़ियों के बारे में काफी जानकारी है। वह गेंदबाजों को जानकारी देने और भाषा की समस्या से निपटने में भी मेरी मदद करेगा। इस ओपनर बल्लेबाज ने कहा कि 2019 के बाद पहली बार होम-अवे फॉर्मेट में टूर्नामेंट की वापसी से टीमों को घरेलू मैदान का फायदा होगा। उन्होंने कहा कि आपको अपने घरेलू मैदान पर विकेट को समझने का मौका मिलता है। इसके साथ ही आपके प्रशंसकों का भी साथ मिलता है, जो हौसला बढ़ाते हैं। पिछले सीजन ऋषभ पंत की अगुवाई में दिल्ली कैपिटल्स की टीम अच्छा प्रदर्शन नहीं कर पाई थी। टीम 14 में से सिर्फ 7 मुकाबले ही जीत पाई थी। वहीं, 7 में उसे हार का सामना करना पड़ा। इसी वजह से दिल्ली की टीम प्लेऑफ के लिए क्वालीफाई नहीं कर पाई। इस बार दिल्ली कैपिटल्स वॉर्नर की कप्तानी में अच्छा प्रदर्शन करना चाहेगी। वॉर्नर की कप्तानी में ही सनराइजर्स हैदराबाद ने साल 2016 में खिताब जीता था। उनके पास कप्तानी का अनुभव भी है।","pubDate":"2023-03-31 18:27:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"इम्पैक्ट प्लेयर रूल इस वजह से

सुपरकिंग्स के कप्तान महेंद्र सिंह धोनी ने गुजरात टाइटंस के खिलाफ इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग मुकाबले से पहले कहा कि टीम में इम्पैक्ट प्लेयर का होना फायदेमंद है क्योंकि इससे फैसले करने की प्रक्रिया आसान हो

Proteas, quite emphatically, brushed off any suggestions that the plucky Netherlands could catch them off-guard again with a comprehensive eight-wicket victory in the second ODI between the two sides here in Benoni on Friday night.","content":"At Willowmoore Park An orange stumbling block? What orange stumbling block? The Proteas, quite emphatically, brushed off any suggestions that the plucky Netherlands could catch them off-guard again with a comprehensive eight-wicket victory in the second ODI between the two sides here in Benoni on Friday night. To some, the trauma of last year’s early elimination from the T20 World Cup – when the Dutch shocked their more illustrious opponents in Adelaide – still enjoyed some top-of-mind awareness, but not among the men who mattered. South Africa’s calmness and efficiency on a day where a dodgy weather forecast added some unnecessary extra tension was notable. After all, a no-result would’ve, in all likelihood, meant Temba Bavuma and his teammates would have to go to Zimbabwe in June and qualify there for the 50-over showpiece in India later this year. Instead, they can still breathe going into Sunday’s Pink ODI at the Wanderers. RECAP | Proteas v Netherlands Rendering the Proteas’ mindset even more impressive to witness was that they could easily have started becoming frustrated and even panicky when the opening powerplay didn’t quite go according to plan. Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen delivered contrasting spells as the new ball pair as the Netherlands opening pair of Vikram Singh and Max O’Dowd put on 58 in 11 overs. Rabada cut a frustrated figure as his deliveries did virtually nothing to trouble the openers, which was in stark contrast to the prodigious movement the lanky Jansen received. The former eventually lost some of his discipline, notably when Singh swung him twice for six over the mid-wicket region, allowing the visitors to absorb the wiles of Jansen, who bowled a superb spell for no reward. Yet, in a testament to his growing influence, Sisanda Magala provided the magic that shifted the hosts into the pound seats. After a substandard first over, he returned to strike twice in two overs, including the key wicket of Singh, who was surprised by his bounce after crafting a 53-ball 43. With the introduction of Anrich Nortje’s pace (2/24) seriously discomforting visitors, the Proteas eventual ascendancy allowed Tabraiz Shamsi to regain some confidence. The wrist spinner admittedly had an undemanding match situation to operate in though he laudably took full advantage. Making full use of his stock leg-break and bowling fuller, he confounded his victims to end with 3/25 off 10 good overs. Magala also returned to claim his third to finish with 3/37. For the Dutch, Teja Nidamanuru – despite being hampered by a tight hamstring – showed grit and good technique to make 47, notably hooking Jansen for two sixes in the lanky quick’s seventh over. The Proteas’ reply exemplified their “aggressive yet clever” mantra. Quinton de Kock threw away his wicket early to a poor sweep shot though it must be said that he was engaged in a mental battle with Dutch skipper Scott Edwards, who packed the off-side field and starved the left-hander of one of his main scoring areas. However, that would prove to be South Africa’s only real batting hiccup as Temba Bavuma, who was class personified with an unbeaten 90 off 79, first consolidated with Rassie van der Dussen (31) to ensure that the hosts were well ahead of the DLS par score at the 20-over mark. And when Aiden Markram (51 off 39) joined him at the crease, the pair cut loose with a partnership for an unbeaten partnership of 102 off just 69 deliveries, a stand that will go a long way towards boosting their net run rate too on the Super League table.","pubDate":"2023-03-31 17:28:11","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"धोनी के इस शॉट ने जीता स्टेडियम में बैठे 1 लाख लोगों का दिल, एक साल बाद दिखा माही का ये रूप","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/ipl-2023-ms-dhoni-six-vs-gujarat-titans-video-went-viral-on-social-media-2023-03-31-947321","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"एमएस धोनी ने गुजरात टाइटंस के खिलाफ आईपीएल 2023 के पहले मुकाबले में एक ही शॉट से महफिल लूट ली।","content":"आईपीएल 2023 के पहले मुकाबले में गुजरात टाइटंस के सामने चेन्नई सुपर किंग्स की टीम है। इस मैच में गुजरात के कप्तान हार्दिक पांड्या ने टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी का फैसला किया। सीएसके ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए बोर्ड पर 7 विकेट खोकर 178 रन लगाए। इस मैच में सभी की नजरें महेंद्र सिंह धोनी पर टिकी थीं। धोनी आखिर के 2 ओवरों में बल्लेबाजी के लिए आए भी और उनके एक ही शॉट ने मैदान में बैठे लोगों का दिल जीत लिया। दुनिया के सबसे बेहतरीन फिनिशर्स में से एक धोनी ने एक बार फिर दिखा दिया कि क्यों उन्हें सबसे बेस्ट माना जाता है। सीएसके की पारी के आखिरी ओवर में धोनी ने युवा जोशुआ लिटिल की गेंद पर 85 मीटर का एक लंबा छक्का मारा। दरअसल 19वें ओवर की तीसरी गेंद पर धोनी का बल्ला जोर से घूमा और गेंद लेग साइड में बहुत दूर जाकर गिरी। माही के इस एक शॉट से मैदान में बैठे हजारों लोग जोर से चिल्लाए। इससे पता चल रहा था कि स्टेडियम में बैठे लोगों को धोनी का बेसब्री से इंतजार था। इस मैच में सीएसके ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए 7 विकेट खोकर 178 रन बनाए। सीएसके की ओर से रुतुराज गायकवाड़ ने 92 रनों की बेहतरीन पारी खेली। वहीं 23 रन मोइन अली के बल्ले से निकले। इसके अलावा अंत में एमएस धोनी ने नाबाद 14 रनों की पारी खेली। वहीं गुजरात की बात करें तो उनकी ओर से मोहम्मद शमी, अलजारी जोसेफ और राशिद खान ने दो-दो विकेट लिए। वहीं जोशुआ लिटिल को एक विकेट मिला। डेवन कॉनवे, रुतुराज गायकवाड़, बेन स्टोक्स, अंबाती रायडू, मोइन अली, शिवम दूबे, एमएस धोनी (कप्तान/विकेटकीपर), रवींद्र जडेजा, मिचेल सेंटनर, दीपक चाहर, राजवर्धन हैंगरगेकर ऋद्धिमान साहा (विकेटकीपर), शुभमन गिल, केन विलियमसन, हार्दिक पांड्या (कप्तान), विजय शंकर, राहुल तेवतिया, राशिद खान, मोहम्मद शमी, जोशुआ लिटिल, यश दयाल, अल्जारी जोसेफ","pubDate":"2023-03-31 16:19:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Ruturaj Gaikwad gets out in nervous 90s, falls short of special milestone","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ruturaj-gaikwad-gets-out-in-nervous-90s-falls-short-of-special-milestone-ipl-2023-gujarat-titans-vs-chennai-super-kings-2023-03-31-859357","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ruturaj Gaikwad displayed impressive batting performance in the opening match of the IPL 2023 between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings on Friday.

The post SuperSport snaps up IPL broadcasting rights at the 11th hour as 16 South Africans prepare to shine appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"SuperSport announced on Friday that they would be broadcasting the Indian Premier League (IPL) after extensive negotiations between SuperSport and Viacom18 — the broadcast rights holder. “Following updated conversations with the rights holder, DStv can confirm that all Indian Premier League matches in 2023 will be broadcast on SuperSport,” read a statement on Friday. “SuperSport reached a commercial agreement with the rights holders to broadcast the IPL, starting today.” This after SuperSport released a statement yesterday that they would not be broadcasting the IPL for the first time since the inaugural tournament in 2008. “SuperSport previously held broadcast rights to the IPL. Following unsuccessful commercial discussions with the rights holder, we will therefore not broadcast the IPL as of this year’s edition,” SuperSport said in a statement on Thursday, a day before the commencement of the tournament. SuperSport lost a broadcasting rights bid of the IPL of Sub-Saharan Africa to Viacom18 last year. Viacom18 also won the rights to Australia, New Zealand and England. While Viacom18 does not have a presence in any of the countries, viewers in the aforementioned countries can watch the IPL via broadcasters who have subsequently made deals with Viacom18. SuperSport could initially not reach a similar agreement with Viacom18 until Friday 31 March, the day of the first match of the season — between last season’s champions Gujarat Titans and the most successful IPL team in history, Chennai Super Kings. South Africa’s cricket-watching market is not massive in comparison to the global audience who tune in to the IPL yearly. The IPL consistently reaches over 200 million television viewers while only around 1.3 million South Africans have access to SuperSport. India, however, has a vested interest in South African cricket after purchasing the franchise rights of all six SA20 teams. On the field, South Africa have 16 players (17 if dual international David Wiese is included) who have been purchased by various IPL teams. South Africa’s nationally contracted players Sisanda Magala, David Miller, Anrich Nortje, Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen, Lungi Ngidi, Kagiso Rabada, Heinrich Klaasen and Quinton de Kock will miss the start of the IPL due to their Proteas’ commitments in the ongoing One Day International series against the Netherlands in the country. Dewald Brevis of MI Cape Town ducks from a bouncer bowled by Wiaan Mulder of Durban’s Super Giants during the Betway SA20 match between Durban’s Super Giants and MI Cape Town at Kingsmead Stadium on February 2, 2023 in Durban, South Africa. (Photo: SA20/Sportzpics/Gallo Images) Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis and Duan Jansen — twin brother of Marco — will all run out for Mumbai Indians. It will be Jansen’s first time participating in the IPL, having been in India last year as a net bowler. Jansen played four matches for MI Cape Town in the SA20, picking up four scalps at an economy rate of 8.57. While his numbers weren’t incredible, Jansen has all the tools to be an exceptional cricketer and he is still only 22 years old. Both Stubbs and Brevis played for Mumbai Indians last year for the first time. It was the tournament that put Brevis on the international map after launching massive “no-look” sixes off star international bowlers. Brevis played a total of seven matches and scored 161 runs, at an average of 23.00. Stubbs, meanwhile, joined the IPL late last year and played only two matches. He was run out without facing a ball in his first innings before being dismissed for single digits in his second hit-out. Stubbs’ form has not been in world-beating form in recent months, having scored a solid 190 runs in 11 innings in the SA20 at a strike rate of 133.80. The big-hitter has a high ceiling and an excellent showing in the IPL could push his case for being selected for South Africa’s 50-over World Cup squad in India later this year. Donovan Ferreira and Magala will both make their debuts in the IPL if they get a run out for Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings respectively. Ferreira is a jack-of-all-trades. A big-hitter that bowls on occasional off-breaks as well as being a wicketkeeper. Ferreira was the Joburg Super King’s fourth-highest run-scorer in the SA20 with 164 in 10 innings. He also picked up three wickets in the nine overs he bowled at a tidy economy rate of six. Magala, meanwhile, was a late replacement for the injured New Zealand all-rounder Kyle Jamieson for the Chennai Super Kings. Magala has been a consistent domestic performer for a long time. He was the tied fifth-highest wicket-taker in the SA20 with 14 scalps. Other South African participants at this year’s IPL include Faf du Plessis and Aiden Markram who will captain the Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sunrisers Hyderabad respectively.

The Harare Sports Club was buzzing with excitement as fans poured in to rally behind their beloved Chevrons. As the players took to the field, the roar of the crowd was deafening. It seemed like the whole of Zimbabwe had turned out to support their team. The Netherlands put up a valiant fight, but it was no match for the Chevrons, who made light work of their opponents to win the series 2-1. This was just the latest in a string of international cricket matches that had been recording huge numbers in fan attendance. The Bulawayo Metropolitan Cricket Association (BMCA) Chairperson, Godwin Dube, weighed in on what he thought was behind the massive turnout. According to Dube, Zimbabwe’s form in international cricket was one of the key factors behind the rise in follower-ship and filling up of stadia. “The purple patch being experienced by our national teams on the international stage. Our senior national teams have done fairly well in the last 13 months, the teams have shown a lot of fight even against the traditional powerhouses leading to more optimism and inspiration to the populace. This has made more people want to associate with cricket,” he said. Dube also credited the increase in attendance to the fact that a good amount of cricket had been played in the country over the last few years. So far this year, three teams have toured the country, including a Test tour which took place at Queens Sports Club against the West Indies in February. This had made it easier to market and associate with the game, leading to a good positive vibe among all cricket stakeholders, and more people falling in love with the sport as a result. “A good amount of cricket has also been played in the last few years hence it has become easier to market and associate with the game. This has led to a good positive vibe among all cricket stakeholders, more people have fallen in love as a result,” he said. Cricket is known as the gentlemen’s game, and it attracts families to come and enjoy the game without any hassles. The non-violent environment plays a part in attracting many people to the stadiums as it is almost unexpected to experience violence in stadiums. Social media has also played a significant role in increasing interest in the sport. With more than three billion people connected to social networks around the world, cricket in Zimbabwe is one sport that has been talked about the most on social media. The Zimbabwe Cricket application has made it easy for people to track and follow games, leading to increased interest in the sport. “A lot has been done to market the game games, the use of social media, influencers and increased articles in traditional print media has all played a big part. In Bulawayo alone, there are more than 10 groups that I have come across, former and current players are active in these groups. The amount of cricket discussions is almost addictive and it is rare to miss any cricket activity or story happening in the country. “The Zimbabwe Cricket App has also made it possible to track and keep in touch with all cricket being played in the four corners of the country hence fans are able to track the progress of all players and competitions,” said Dube. The inactivity of other popular sports such as football and rugby has also been beneficial to the increased popularity of cricket. As Zimbabwe prepares to host the 2023 ODI World Cup Qualifiers in June, the numbers of fans in cricket stadiums are likely to increase, and the excitement is palpable. The Chevrons are set to take the cricketing world by storm, and Zimbabwe’s love for the sport is only going to grow stronger. — @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-03-31 22:05:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Inaugural South Asia Lawyers’ Cricket Cup kicks off in Colombo","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Inaugural-South-Asia-Lawyers--Cricket-Cup-kicks-off-in-Colombo/23-746957","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The inaugural South Asia Lawyers’ Cricket Cup kicked off in Colombo on Thursday and will go on till 5 April.

Gaikwad was all class in his 92 off 50 balls before Titans pulled things back in the middle overs to limit Chennai Super Kings to 178 for seven after opting to bowl first in front of a near capacity crowd at the world’s largest cricket stadium here. In the form of his life over the past three months, Gill played some jaw-dropping strokes in his 63 off 36 balls to set up a fine win for the home team. Titans got home in 19.2 overs. Gill’s opening partner Wriddhiman Saha showed he has still got it as he smashed a couple of sixes and as many fours in his 16-ball 25 that got the Titans going in the run chase. Gill’s best shot of the innings was the back foot punch off CSK’s impact player Tushar Deshpande and he followed with a pick up shot over midwicket. Titans’ impact player Sai Sudharsan, who was used in place of an injured Kane Williamson, contributed with 22 off 17 balls. When Gill departed, Titans needed 41 off the last five overs but CSK managed to take the game down to the wire. It needed a cameo from Rashid Khan (10 not out off 3) to settled the nerves in the Titans dressing room. Earlier, it was a display of effortless hitting from Gaikwad, who relied on his lofted drives over extra cover and crisp pull shots to collect as many as nine sixes. Apart from Gaikwad, the only other batter who put the Titans under pressure was Moeen Ali who came up with a 17-ball 23. Ali’s flat six off Mohammad Shami on a free-hit ball was the highlight of his cameo. Gaikwad pulled IPL debutant Joshua Little on his very first ball to set the tone of his innings. That over went for 15 runs and with Shami conceding 17 runs in the following over, CSK got the momentum they were looking for. Titans’ trump card Rashid Khan was introduced in the powerplay and as he often does, he got the wicket that his team was looking for by getting the dangerous looking Ali caught behind. Rashid’s second over saw him getting rid of England Test captain Ben Stokes, who too was caught by wicketkeeper Saha, leaving CSK at 70 for three. However, the fall of wickets did not make Gaikwad change his game as he kept getting the boundaries. He welcomed Alzarri Joseph into the attack by smashing him for three sixes in the eighth over. Titans did well to stem the flow of runs in the middle overs and got the wicket of Ambati Rayudu. Shivam Dube struggled to find the big hits and that put pressure on Gaikwad who was caught in the deep in the 17th over and missed out on a deserving hundred. Skipper M S Dhoni came out to bat at number eight but still managed to make an impact as he pulled Little for a six before flicking him for a four in the final over, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Williamson injured his knee while fielding at the boundary and limped off the field. The last five overs yielded 45 runs for CSK.

बाहर हो गए। अब उनकी जगह डेविड वॉर्नर को कप्तान बनाया गया है। दिल्ली कैपिटल्स को आईपीएल 2023 में अपना पहला लखनऊ सुपर जायंट्स के खिलाफ खेलना है। अब वॉर्नर ने पंत के लिए बड़ा बयान दिया है। दिल्ली कैपिटल्स के मौजूदा सीजन के कप्तान डेविड वॉर्नर ने कहा कि टीम चाहती है कि नियमित कप्तान ऋषभ पंत ‘चोट से उबरने में अपना पूरा समय लें’ और किसी तरह की जल्दबाजी ना करें। वॉर्नर ने लखनऊ सुपर जायंट्स के खिलाफ शनिवार को खेले जाने वाले टीम के शुरूआती मुकाबले से पहले कहा कि वह हमारा समर्थन करने के लिए उत्सुक है। मुझे यकीन है कि वह स्टेडियम में आकर हमारे मैचों को देखना चाहेंगे। डेविड वॉर्नर ने कहा कि लेकिन हम चाहते है कि वह चोट से उबरे और पूरा आराम कर जल्दी से स्वस्थ होने पर ध्यान दें। वॉर्नर ने टीम में उप-कप्तान के रूप में अक्षर पटेल की भूमिका के बारे में भी बात की। उन्होंने कहा कि अक्षर को टीम के सभी खिलाड़ियों के बारे में काफी जानकारी है। वह गेंदबाजों को जानकारी देने और भाषा की समस्या से निपटने में भी मेरी मदद करेगा। इस ओपनर बल्लेबाज ने कहा कि 2019 के बाद पहली बार होम-अवे फॉर्मेट में टूर्नामेंट की वापसी से टीमों को घरेलू मैदान का फायदा होगा। उन्होंने कहा कि आपको अपने घरेलू मैदान पर विकेट को समझने का मौका मिलता है। इसके साथ ही आपके प्रशंसकों का भी साथ मिलता है, जो हौसला बढ़ाते हैं। पिछले सीजन ऋषभ पंत की अगुवाई में दिल्ली कैपिटल्स की टीम अच्छा प्रदर्शन नहीं कर पाई थी। टीम 14 में से सिर्फ 7 मुकाबले ही जीत पाई थी। वहीं, 7 में उसे हार का सामना करना पड़ा। इसी वजह से दिल्ली की टीम प्लेऑफ के लिए क्वालीफाई नहीं कर पाई। इस बार दिल्ली कैपिटल्स वॉर्नर की कप्तानी में अच्छा प्रदर्शन करना चाहेगी। वॉर्नर की कप्तानी में ही सनराइजर्स हैदराबाद ने साल 2016 में खिताब जीता था। उनके पास कप्तानी का अनुभव भी है।","pubDate":"2023-03-31 18:27:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"इम्पैक्ट प्लेयर रूल इस वजह से

सुपरकिंग्स के कप्तान महेंद्र सिंह धोनी ने गुजरात टाइटंस के खिलाफ इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग मुकाबले से पहले कहा कि टीम में इम्पैक्ट प्लेयर का होना फायदेमंद है क्योंकि इससे फैसले करने की प्रक्रिया आसान हो

Proteas, quite emphatically, brushed off any suggestions that the plucky Netherlands could catch them off-guard again with a comprehensive eight-wicket victory in the second ODI between the two sides here in Benoni on Friday night.","content":"At Willowmoore Park An orange stumbling block? What orange stumbling block? The Proteas, quite emphatically, brushed off any suggestions that the plucky Netherlands could catch them off-guard again with a comprehensive eight-wicket victory in the second ODI between the two sides here in Benoni on Friday night. To some, the trauma of last year’s early elimination from the T20 World Cup – when the Dutch shocked their more illustrious opponents in Adelaide – still enjoyed some top-of-mind awareness, but not among the men who mattered. South Africa’s calmness and efficiency on a day where a dodgy weather forecast added some unnecessary extra tension was notable. After all, a no-result would’ve, in all likelihood, meant Temba Bavuma and his teammates would have to go to Zimbabwe in June and qualify there for the 50-over showpiece in India later this year. Instead, they can still breathe going into Sunday’s Pink ODI at the Wanderers. RECAP | Proteas v Netherlands Rendering the Proteas’ mindset even more impressive to witness was that they could easily have started becoming frustrated and even panicky when the opening powerplay didn’t quite go according to plan. Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen delivered contrasting spells as the new ball pair as the Netherlands opening pair of Vikram Singh and Max O’Dowd put on 58 in 11 overs. Rabada cut a frustrated figure as his deliveries did virtually nothing to trouble the openers, which was in stark contrast to the prodigious movement the lanky Jansen received. The former eventually lost some of his discipline, notably when Singh swung him twice for six over the mid-wicket region, allowing the visitors to absorb the wiles of Jansen, who bowled a superb spell for no reward. Yet, in a testament to his growing influence, Sisanda Magala provided the magic that shifted the hosts into the pound seats. After a substandard first over, he returned to strike twice in two overs, including the key wicket of Singh, who was surprised by his bounce after crafting a 53-ball 43. With the introduction of Anrich Nortje’s pace (2/24) seriously discomforting visitors, the Proteas eventual ascendancy allowed Tabraiz Shamsi to regain some confidence. The wrist spinner admittedly had an undemanding match situation to operate in though he laudably took full advantage. Making full use of his stock leg-break and bowling fuller, he confounded his victims to end with 3/25 off 10 good overs. Magala also returned to claim his third to finish with 3/37. For the Dutch, Teja Nidamanuru – despite being hampered by a tight hamstring – showed grit and good technique to make 47, notably hooking Jansen for two sixes in the lanky quick’s seventh over. The Proteas’ reply exemplified their “aggressive yet clever” mantra. Quinton de Kock threw away his wicket early to a poor sweep shot though it must be said that he was engaged in a mental battle with Dutch skipper Scott Edwards, who packed the off-side field and starved the left-hander of one of his main scoring areas. However, that would prove to be South Africa’s only real batting hiccup as Temba Bavuma, who was class personified with an unbeaten 90 off 79, first consolidated with Rassie van der Dussen (31) to ensure that the hosts were well ahead of the DLS par score at the 20-over mark. And when Aiden Markram (51 off 39) joined him at the crease, the pair cut loose with a partnership for an unbeaten partnership of 102 off just 69 deliveries, a stand that will go a long way towards boosting their net run rate too on the Super League table.","pubDate":"2023-03-31 17:28:11","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"धोनी के इस शॉट ने जीता स्टेडियम में बैठे 1 लाख लोगों का दिल, एक साल बाद दिखा माही का ये रूप","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/ipl-2023-ms-dhoni-six-vs-gujarat-titans-video-went-viral-on-social-media-2023-03-31-947321","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"एमएस धोनी ने गुजरात टाइटंस के खिलाफ आईपीएल 2023 के पहले मुकाबले में एक ही शॉट से महफिल लूट ली।","content":"आईपीएल 2023 के पहले मुकाबले में गुजरात टाइटंस के सामने चेन्नई सुपर किंग्स की टीम है। इस मैच में गुजरात के कप्तान हार्दिक पांड्या ने टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी का फैसला किया। सीएसके ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए बोर्ड पर 7 विकेट खोकर 178 रन लगाए। इस मैच में सभी की नजरें महेंद्र सिंह धोनी पर टिकी थीं। धोनी आखिर के 2 ओवरों में बल्लेबाजी के लिए आए भी और उनके एक ही शॉट ने मैदान में बैठे लोगों का दिल जीत लिया। दुनिया के सबसे बेहतरीन फिनिशर्स में से एक धोनी ने एक बार फिर दिखा दिया कि क्यों उन्हें सबसे बेस्ट माना जाता है। सीएसके की पारी के आखिरी ओवर में धोनी ने युवा जोशुआ लिटिल की गेंद पर 85 मीटर का एक लंबा छक्का मारा। दरअसल 19वें ओवर की तीसरी गेंद पर धोनी का बल्ला जोर से घूमा और गेंद लेग साइड में बहुत दूर जाकर गिरी। माही के इस एक शॉट से मैदान में बैठे हजारों लोग जोर से चिल्लाए। इससे पता चल रहा था कि स्टेडियम में बैठे लोगों को धोनी का बेसब्री से इंतजार था। इस मैच में सीएसके ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए 7 विकेट खोकर 178 रन बनाए। सीएसके की ओर से रुतुराज गायकवाड़ ने 92 रनों की बेहतरीन पारी खेली। वहीं 23 रन मोइन अली के बल्ले से निकले। इसके अलावा अंत में एमएस धोनी ने नाबाद 14 रनों की पारी खेली। वहीं गुजरात की बात करें तो उनकी ओर से मोहम्मद शमी, अलजारी जोसेफ और राशिद खान ने दो-दो विकेट लिए। वहीं जोशुआ लिटिल को एक विकेट मिला। डेवन कॉनवे, रुतुराज गायकवाड़, बेन स्टोक्स, अंबाती रायडू, मोइन अली, शिवम दूबे, एमएस धोनी (कप्तान/विकेटकीपर), रवींद्र जडेजा, मिचेल सेंटनर, दीपक चाहर, राजवर्धन हैंगरगेकर ऋद्धिमान साहा (विकेटकीपर), शुभमन गिल, केन विलियमसन, हार्दिक पांड्या (कप्तान), विजय शंकर, राहुल तेवतिया, राशिद खान, मोहम्मद शमी, जोशुआ लिटिल, यश दयाल, अल्जारी जोसेफ","pubDate":"2023-03-31 16:19:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Ruturaj Gaikwad gets out in nervous 90s, falls short of special milestone","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ruturaj-gaikwad-gets-out-in-nervous-90s-falls-short-of-special-milestone-ipl-2023-gujarat-titans-vs-chennai-super-kings-2023-03-31-859357","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ruturaj Gaikwad displayed impressive batting performance in the opening match of the IPL 2023 between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings on Friday.

Following unsuccessful commercial discussions with the rights holder, we will therefore not broadcast the IPL as of this year’s edition,” SuperSport said in a statement on Thursday, a day before the commencement of the tournament. SuperSport lost a broadcasting rights bid of the IPL of Sub-Saharan Africa to Viacom18 last year. Viacom18 also won the rights to Australia, New Zealand and England.

SuperSport could initially not reach a similar agreement with Viacom18 until Friday 31 March, the day of the first match of the season — between last season’s champions Gujarat Titans and the most successful IPL team in history, Chennai Super Kings. South Africa’s cricket-watching market is not massive in comparison to the global audience who tune in to the IPL yearly. The IPL consistently reaches over 200 million television viewers while only around 1.3 million South Africans have access to SuperSport. India, however, has a vested interest in South African cricket after purchasing the franchise rights of all six SA20 teams. On the field, South Africa have 16 players (17 if dual international David Wiese is included) who have been purchased by various IPL teams. South Africa’s nationally contracted players Sisanda Magala, David Miller, Anrich Nortje, Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen, Lungi Ngidi, Kagiso Rabada, Heinrich Klaasen and Quinton de Kock will miss the start of the IPL due to their Proteas’ commitments in the ongoing One Day International series against the Netherlands in the country.

(Photo: SA20/Sportzpics/Gallo Images) Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis and Duan Jansen — twin brother of Marco — will all run out for Mumbai Indians. It will be Jansen’s first time participating in the IPL, having been in India last year as a net bowler. Jansen played four matches for MI Cape Town in the SA20, picking up four scalps at an economy rate of 8.57. While his numbers weren’t incredible, Jansen has all the tools to be an exceptional cricketer and he is still only 22 years old. Both Stubbs and Brevis played for Mumbai Indians last year for the first time. It was the tournament that put Brevis on the international map after launching massive “no-look” sixes off star international bowlers. Brevis played a total of seven matches and scored 161 runs, at an average of 23.00. Stubbs, meanwhile, joined the IPL late last year and played only two matches. He was run out without facing a ball in his first innings before being dismissed for single digits in his second hit-out. Stubbs’ form has not been in world-beating form in recent months, having scored a solid 190 runs in 11 innings in the SA20 at a strike rate of 133.80. The big-hitter has a high ceiling and an excellent showing in the IPL could push his case for being selected for South Africa’s 50-over World Cup squad in India later this year. Donovan Ferreira and Magala will both make their debuts in the IPL if they get a run out for Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings respectively. Ferreira is a jack-of-all-trades. A big-hitter that bowls on occasional off-breaks as well as being a wicketkeeper. Ferreira was the Joburg Super King’s fourth-highest run-scorer in the SA20 with 164 in 10 innings. He also picked up three wickets in the nine overs he bowled at a tidy economy rate of six. Magala, meanwhile, was a late replacement for the injured New Zealand all-rounder Kyle Jamieson for the Chennai Super Kings. Magala has been a consistent domestic performer for a long time. He was the tied fifth-highest wicket-taker in the SA20 with 14 scalps. Other South African participants at this year’s IPL include Faf du Plessis and Aiden Markram who will captain the Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sunrisers Hyderabad respectively.

The Harare Sports Club was buzzing with excitement as fans poured in to rally behind their beloved Chevrons. As the players took to the field, the roar of the crowd was deafening. It seemed like the whole of Zimbabwe had turned out to support their team. The Netherlands put up a valiant fight, but it was no match for the Chevrons, who made light work of their opponents to win the series 2-1. This was just the latest in a string of international cricket matches that had been recording huge numbers in fan attendance. The Bulawayo Metropolitan Cricket Association (BMCA) Chairperson, Godwin Dube, weighed in on what he thought was behind the massive turnout. According to Dube, Zimbabwe’s form in international cricket was one of the key factors behind the rise in follower-ship and filling up of stadia. “The purple patch being experienced by our national teams on the international stage. Our senior national teams have done fairly well in the last 13 months, the teams have shown a lot of fight even against the traditional powerhouses leading to more optimism and inspiration to the populace. This has made more people want to associate with cricket,” he said. Dube also credited the increase in attendance to the fact that a good amount of cricket had been played in the country over the last few years. So far this year, three teams have toured the country, including a Test tour which took place at Queens Sports Club against the West Indies in February. This had made it easier to market and associate with the game, leading to a good positive vibe among all cricket stakeholders, and more people falling in love with the sport as a result. “A good amount of cricket has also been played in the last few years hence it has become easier to market and associate with the game. This has led to a good positive vibe among all cricket stakeholders, more people have fallen in love as a result,” he said. Cricket is known as the gentlemen’s game, and it attracts families to come and enjoy the game without any hassles. The non-violent environment plays a part in attracting many people to the stadiums as it is almost unexpected to experience violence in stadiums. Social media has also played a significant role in increasing interest in the sport. With more than three billion people connected to social networks around the world, cricket in Zimbabwe is one sport that has been talked about the most on social media. The Zimbabwe Cricket application has made it easy for people to track and follow games, leading to increased interest in the sport. “A lot has been done to market the game games, the use of social media, influencers and increased articles in traditional print media has all played a big part. In Bulawayo alone, there are more than 10 groups that I have come across, former and current players are active in these groups. The amount of cricket discussions is almost addictive and it is rare to miss any cricket activity or story happening in the country. “The Zimbabwe Cricket App has also made it possible to track and keep in touch with all cricket being played in the four corners of the country hence fans are able to track the progress of all players and competitions,” said Dube. The inactivity of other popular sports such as football and rugby has also been beneficial to the increased popularity of cricket. As Zimbabwe prepares to host the 2023 ODI World Cup Qualifiers in June, the numbers of fans in cricket stadiums are likely to increase, and the excitement is palpable. The Chevrons are set to take the cricketing world by storm, and Zimbabwe’s love for the sport is only going to grow stronger. — @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-03-31 22:05:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Inaugural South Asia Lawyers’ Cricket Cup kicks off in Colombo","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Inaugural-South-Asia-Lawyers--Cricket-Cup-kicks-off-in-Colombo/23-746957","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The inaugural South Asia Lawyers’ Cricket Cup kicked off in Colombo on Thursday and will go on till 5 April.

Gaikwad was all class in his 92 off 50 balls before Titans pulled things back in the middle overs to limit Chennai Super Kings to 178 for seven after opting to bowl first in front of a near capacity crowd at the world’s largest cricket stadium here. In the form of his life over the past three months, Gill played some jaw-dropping strokes in his 63 off 36 balls to set up a fine win for the home team. Titans got home in 19.2 overs. Gill’s opening partner Wriddhiman Saha showed he has still got it as he smashed a couple of sixes and as many fours in his 16-ball 25 that got the Titans going in the run chase. Gill’s best shot of the innings was the back foot punch off CSK’s impact player Tushar Deshpande and he followed with a pick up shot over midwicket. Titans’ impact player Sai Sudharsan, who was used in place of an injured Kane Williamson, contributed with 22 off 17 balls. When Gill departed, Titans needed 41 off the last five overs but CSK managed to take the game down to the wire. It needed a cameo from Rashid Khan (10 not out off 3) to settled the nerves in the Titans dressing room. Earlier, it was a display of effortless hitting from Gaikwad, who relied on his lofted drives over extra cover and crisp pull shots to collect as many as nine sixes. Apart from Gaikwad, the only other batter who put the Titans under pressure was Moeen Ali who came up with a 17-ball 23. Ali’s flat six off Mohammad Shami on a free-hit ball was the highlight of his cameo. Gaikwad pulled IPL debutant Joshua Little on his very first ball to set the tone of his innings. That over went for 15 runs and with Shami conceding 17 runs in the following over, CSK got the momentum they were looking for. Titans’ trump card Rashid Khan was introduced in the powerplay and as he often does, he got the wicket that his team was looking for by getting the dangerous looking Ali caught behind. Rashid’s second over saw him getting rid of England Test captain Ben Stokes, who too was caught by wicketkeeper Saha, leaving CSK at 70 for three. However, the fall of wickets did not make Gaikwad change his game as he kept getting the boundaries. He welcomed Alzarri Joseph into the attack by smashing him for three sixes in the eighth over. Titans did well to stem the flow of runs in the middle overs and got the wicket of Ambati Rayudu. Shivam Dube struggled to find the big hits and that put pressure on Gaikwad who was caught in the deep in the 17th over and missed out on a deserving hundred. Skipper M S Dhoni came out to bat at number eight but still managed to make an impact as he pulled Little for a six before flicking him for a four in the final over, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Williamson injured his knee while fielding at the boundary and limped off the field. The last five overs yielded 45 runs for CSK.

बाहर हो गए। अब उनकी जगह डेविड वॉर्नर को कप्तान बनाया गया है। दिल्ली कैपिटल्स को आईपीएल 2023 में अपना पहला लखनऊ सुपर जायंट्स के खिलाफ खेलना है। अब वॉर्नर ने पंत के लिए बड़ा बयान दिया है। दिल्ली कैपिटल्स के मौजूदा सीजन के कप्तान डेविड वॉर्नर ने कहा कि टीम चाहती है कि नियमित कप्तान ऋषभ पंत ‘चोट से उबरने में अपना पूरा समय लें’ और किसी तरह की जल्दबाजी ना करें। वॉर्नर ने लखनऊ सुपर जायंट्स के खिलाफ शनिवार को खेले जाने वाले टीम के शुरूआती मुकाबले से पहले कहा कि वह हमारा समर्थन करने के लिए उत्सुक है। मुझे यकीन है कि वह स्टेडियम में आकर हमारे मैचों को देखना चाहेंगे। डेविड वॉर्नर ने कहा कि लेकिन हम चाहते है कि वह चोट से उबरे और पूरा आराम कर जल्दी से स्वस्थ होने पर ध्यान दें। वॉर्नर ने टीम में उप-कप्तान के रूप में अक्षर पटेल की भूमिका के बारे में भी बात की। उन्होंने कहा कि अक्षर को टीम के सभी खिलाड़ियों के बारे में काफी जानकारी है। वह गेंदबाजों को जानकारी देने और भाषा की समस्या से निपटने में भी मेरी मदद करेगा। इस ओपनर बल्लेबाज ने कहा कि 2019 के बाद पहली बार होम-अवे फॉर्मेट में टूर्नामेंट की वापसी से टीमों को घरेलू मैदान का फायदा होगा। उन्होंने कहा कि आपको अपने घरेलू मैदान पर विकेट को समझने का मौका मिलता है। इसके साथ ही आपके प्रशंसकों का भी साथ मिलता है, जो हौसला बढ़ाते हैं। पिछले सीजन ऋषभ पंत की अगुवाई में दिल्ली कैपिटल्स की टीम अच्छा प्रदर्शन नहीं कर पाई थी। टीम 14 में से सिर्फ 7 मुकाबले ही जीत पाई थी। वहीं, 7 में उसे हार का सामना करना पड़ा। इसी वजह से दिल्ली की टीम प्लेऑफ के लिए क्वालीफाई नहीं कर पाई। इस बार दिल्ली कैपिटल्स वॉर्नर की कप्तानी में अच्छा प्रदर्शन करना चाहेगी। वॉर्नर की कप्तानी में ही सनराइजर्स हैदराबाद ने साल 2016 में खिताब जीता था। उनके पास कप्तानी का अनुभव भी है।","pubDate":"2023-03-31 18:27:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"इम्पैक्ट प्लेयर रूल इस वजह से

Proteas, quite emphatically, brushed off any suggestions that the plucky Netherlands could catch them off-guard again with a comprehensive eight-wicket victory in the second ODI between the two sides here in Benoni on Friday night.","content":"At Willowmoore Park An orange stumbling block? What orange stumbling block? The Proteas, quite emphatically, brushed off any suggestions that the plucky Netherlands could catch them off-guard again with a comprehensive eight-wicket victory in the second ODI between the two sides here in Benoni on Friday night. To some, the trauma of last year’s early elimination from the T20 World Cup – when the Dutch shocked their more illustrious opponents in Adelaide – still enjoyed some top-of-mind awareness, but not among the men who mattered. South Africa’s calmness and efficiency on a day where a dodgy weather forecast added some unnecessary extra tension was notable. After all, a no-result would’ve, in all likelihood, meant Temba Bavuma and his teammates would have to go to Zimbabwe in June and qualify there for the 50-over showpiece in India later this year. Instead, they can still breathe going into Sunday’s Pink ODI at the Wanderers. RECAP | Proteas v Netherlands Rendering the Proteas’ mindset even more impressive to witness was that they could easily have started becoming frustrated and even panicky when the opening powerplay didn’t quite go according to plan. Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen delivered contrasting spells as the new ball pair as the Netherlands opening pair of Vikram Singh and Max O’Dowd put on 58 in 11 overs. Rabada cut a frustrated figure as his deliveries did virtually nothing to trouble the openers, which was in stark contrast to the prodigious movement the lanky Jansen received. The former eventually lost some of his discipline, notably when Singh swung him twice for six over the mid-wicket region, allowing the visitors to absorb the wiles of Jansen, who bowled a superb spell for no reward. Yet, in a testament to his growing influence, Sisanda Magala provided the magic that shifted the hosts into the pound seats. After a substandard first over, he returned to strike twice in two overs, including the key wicket of Singh, who was surprised by his bounce after crafting a 53-ball 43. With the introduction of Anrich Nortje’s pace (2/24) seriously discomforting visitors, the Proteas eventual ascendancy allowed Tabraiz Shamsi to regain some confidence. The wrist spinner admittedly had an undemanding match situation to operate in though he laudably took full advantage. Making full use of his stock leg-break and bowling fuller, he confounded his victims to end with 3/25 off 10 good overs. Magala also returned to claim his third to finish with 3/37. For the Dutch, Teja Nidamanuru – despite being hampered by a tight hamstring – showed grit and good technique to make 47, notably hooking Jansen for two sixes in the lanky quick’s seventh over. The Proteas’ reply exemplified their “aggressive yet clever” mantra. Quinton de Kock threw away his wicket early to a poor sweep shot though it must be said that he was engaged in a mental battle with Dutch skipper Scott Edwards, who packed the off-side field and starved the left-hander of one of his main scoring areas. However, that would prove to be South Africa’s only real batting hiccup as Temba Bavuma, who was class personified with an unbeaten 90 off 79, first consolidated with Rassie van der Dussen (31) to ensure that the hosts were well ahead of the DLS par score at the 20-over mark. And when Aiden Markram (51 off 39) joined him at the crease, the pair cut loose with a partnership for an unbeaten partnership of 102 off just 69 deliveries, a stand that will go a long way towards boosting their net run rate too on the Super League table.","pubDate":"2023-03-31 17:28:11","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"धोनी के इस शॉट ने जीता स्टेडियम में बैठे 1 लाख लोगों का दिल, एक साल बाद दिखा माही का ये रूप","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/ipl-2023-ms-dhoni-six-vs-gujarat-titans-video-went-viral-on-social-media-2023-03-31-947321","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"एमएस धोनी ने गुजरात टाइटंस के खिलाफ आईपीएल 2023 के पहले मुकाबले में एक ही शॉट से महफिल लूट ली।","content":"आईपीएल 2023 के पहले मुकाबले में गुजरात टाइटंस के सामने चेन्नई सुपर किंग्स की टीम है। इस मैच में गुजरात के कप्तान हार्दिक पांड्या ने टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी का फैसला किया। सीएसके ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए बोर्ड पर 7 विकेट खोकर 178 रन लगाए। इस मैच में सभी की नजरें महेंद्र सिंह धोनी पर टिकी थीं। धोनी आखिर के 2 ओवरों में बल्लेबाजी के लिए आए भी और उनके एक ही शॉट ने मैदान में बैठे लोगों का दिल जीत लिया। दुनिया के सबसे बेहतरीन फिनिशर्स में से एक धोनी ने एक बार फिर दिखा दिया कि क्यों उन्हें सबसे बेस्ट माना जाता है। सीएसके की पारी के आखिरी ओवर में धोनी ने युवा जोशुआ लिटिल की गेंद पर 85 मीटर का एक लंबा छक्का मारा। दरअसल 19वें ओवर की तीसरी गेंद पर धोनी का बल्ला जोर से घूमा और गेंद लेग साइड में बहुत दूर जाकर गिरी। माही के इस एक शॉट से मैदान में बैठे हजारों लोग जोर से चिल्लाए। इससे पता चल रहा था कि स्टेडियम में बैठे लोगों को धोनी का बेसब्री से इंतजार था। इस मैच में सीएसके ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए 7 विकेट खोकर 178 रन बनाए। सीएसके की ओर से रुतुराज गायकवाड़ ने 92 रनों की बेहतरीन पारी खेली। वहीं 23 रन मोइन अली के बल्ले से निकले। इसके अलावा अंत में एमएस धोनी ने नाबाद 14 रनों की पारी खेली। वहीं गुजरात की बात करें तो उनकी ओर से मोहम्मद शमी, अलजारी जोसेफ और राशिद खान ने दो-दो विकेट लिए। वहीं जोशुआ लिटिल को एक विकेट मिला। डेवन कॉनवे, रुतुराज गायकवाड़, बेन स्टोक्स, अंबाती रायडू, मोइन अली, शिवम दूबे, एमएस धोनी (कप्तान/विकेटकीपर), रवींद्र जडेजा, मिचेल सेंटनर, दीपक चाहर, राजवर्धन हैंगरगेकर ऋद्धिमान साहा (विकेटकीपर), शुभमन गिल, केन विलियमसन, हार्दिक पांड्या (कप्तान), विजय शंकर, राहुल तेवतिया, राशिद खान, मोहम्मद शमी, जोशुआ लिटिल, यश दयाल, अल्जारी जोसेफ","pubDate":"2023-03-31 16:19:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Ruturaj Gaikwad gets out in nervous 90s, falls short of special milestone","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ruturaj-gaikwad-gets-out-in-nervous-90s-falls-short-of-special-milestone-ipl-2023-gujarat-titans-vs-chennai-super-kings-2023-03-31-859357","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ruturaj Gaikwad displayed impressive batting performance in the opening match of the IPL 2023 between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings on Friday.

The post SuperSport snaps up IPL broadcasting rights at the 11th hour as 16 South Africans prepare to shine appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"SuperSport announced on Friday that they would be broadcasting the Indian Premier League (IPL) after extensive negotiations between SuperSport and Viacom18 — the broadcast rights holder. “Following updated conversations with the rights holder, DStv can confirm that all Indian Premier League matches in 2023 will be broadcast on SuperSport,” read a statement on Friday. “SuperSport reached a commercial agreement with the rights holders to broadcast the IPL, starting today.” This after SuperSport released a statement yesterday that they would not be broadcasting the IPL for the first time since the inaugural tournament in 2008. “SuperSport previously held broadcast rights to the IPL. Following unsuccessful commercial discussions with the rights holder, we will therefore not broadcast the IPL as of this year’s edition,” SuperSport said in a statement on Thursday, a day before the commencement of the tournament. SuperSport lost a broadcasting rights bid of the IPL of Sub-Saharan Africa to Viacom18 last year. Viacom18 also won the rights to Australia, New Zealand and England. While Viacom18 does not have a presence in any of the countries, viewers in the aforementioned countries can watch the IPL via broadcasters who have subsequently made deals with Viacom18. SuperSport could initially not reach a similar agreement with Viacom18 until Friday 31 March, the day of the first match of the season — between last season’s champions Gujarat Titans and the most successful IPL team in history, Chennai Super Kings. South Africa’s cricket-watching market is not massive in comparison to the global audience who tune in to the IPL yearly. The IPL consistently reaches over 200 million television viewers while only around 1.3 million South Africans have access to SuperSport. India, however, has a vested interest in South African cricket after purchasing the franchise rights of all six SA20 teams. On the field, South Africa have 16 players (17 if dual international David Wiese is included) who have been purchased by various IPL teams. South Africa’s nationally contracted players Sisanda Magala, David Miller, Anrich Nortje, Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen, Lungi Ngidi, Kagiso Rabada, Heinrich Klaasen and Quinton de Kock will miss the start of the IPL due to their Proteas’ commitments in the ongoing One Day International series against the Netherlands in the country.

(Photo: SA20/Sportzpics/Gallo Images) Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis and Duan Jansen — twin brother of Marco — will all run out for Mumbai Indians. It will be Jansen’s first time participating in the IPL, having been in India last year as a net bowler. Jansen played four matches for MI Cape Town in the SA20, picking up four scalps at an economy rate of 8.57. While his numbers weren’t incredible, Jansen has all the tools to be an exceptional cricketer and he is still only 22 years old. Both Stubbs and Brevis played for Mumbai Indians last year for the first time. It was the tournament that put Brevis on the international map after launching massive “no-look” sixes off star international bowlers. Brevis played a total of seven matches and scored 161 runs, at an average of 23.00. Stubbs, meanwhile, joined the IPL late last year and played only two matches. He was run out without facing a ball in his first innings before being dismissed for single digits in his second hit-out. Stubbs’ form has not been in world-beating form in recent months, having scored a solid 190 runs in 11 innings in the SA20 at a strike rate of 133.80. The big-hitter has a high ceiling and an excellent showing in the IPL could push his case for being selected for South Africa’s 50-over World Cup squad in India later this year. Donovan Ferreira and Magala will both make their debuts in the IPL if they get a run out for Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings respectively. Ferreira is a jack-of-all-trades. A big-hitter that bowls on occasional off-breaks as well as being a wicketkeeper. Ferreira was the Joburg Super King’s fourth-highest run-scorer in the SA20 with 164 in 10 innings. He also picked up three wickets in the nine overs he bowled at a tidy economy rate of six. Magala, meanwhile, was a late replacement for the injured New Zealand all-rounder Kyle Jamieson for the Chennai Super Kings. Magala has been a consistent domestic performer for a long time. He was the tied fifth-highest wicket-taker in the SA20 with 14 scalps. Other South African participants at this year’s IPL include Faf du Plessis and Aiden Markram who will captain the Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sunrisers Hyderabad respectively.
