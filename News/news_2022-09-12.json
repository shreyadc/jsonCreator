Fast bowler Pramod Madushan (4-34) and Wanindu Hasaranga (3-27) shared seven wickets between them to bowl out Pakistan for 147 while chasing 171 in Dubai. Earlier the left-handed Rajapaksa put on a key 58-run stand for the sixth wicket with Hasaranga, who hit 36, to help Sri Lanka to 170-6 after being in trouble at 58-5. Sri Lanka, who had to abandon plans to host the competition due to political unrest, bounced back from an embarrassing opening defeat by Afghanistan to win the tournament, a curtain-raiser for next month's T20 World Cup in Australia. \"We always wanted to show the whole world (what we can do),\" said man of the match Rajapaksa. \"Some decades back we had some sort of aggression in our side and we wanted to create those moments again. As a unit we are doing fantastically well at the moment and we look forward to the World Cup.\" Rajapaksa said: \"As a nation it's a great win with all the crisis happening back home, these are tough times for Sri Lankans. We hope we brought some smiles on their faces.\" The Asia Cup success for the cricket-crazy nation comes after miserable months of severe economic crisis followed by blackouts, fuel shortages and protests. Sri Lanka, however, will have to play the qualifiers in Australia before getting a chance to meet the heavyweights in the main draw starting October 22 but skipper Dasun Shanaka said the momentum will help them sail through. Pakistan skipper Babar Azam won the toss, choosing to field first with nine of the previous 12 matches won by the teams chasing. - Bucked the trend - But Sri Lanka bucked the trend as the island nation overcame an inspired opening spell of bowling by Pakistan quicks Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf. \"I want to congratulate Sri Lanka. Outstanding cricket. The way we dominated them early, their partnership after that was outstanding,\" said Azam. Rajapaksa and Hasaranga rebuilt the innings and regularly found the boundary to up the scoring rate. Rauf dismissed Hasaranga, who hit five fours and one six in his 21-ball knock, caught behind for his 50th T20 wicket to break the dangerous stand. Rajapaksa kept up the attack and survived a dropped catch by Shadab Khan in the deep, soon reaching his third T20 half-century. Rajapaksa, who finished the innings with a four and six off Naseem in his 45-ball blitz, and Chamika Karunaratne put on 54 runs to further boost the total. \"Of course it is a wonderful moment and one of the best innings I played in a short period of time,\" Rajapaksa, who made his T20 debut in 2019, said. \"Hoping I could play some match-winning knocks in the future as well for the Sri Lanka side.\" Left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka bowled a shaky opening over, starting with a no-ball and four wides. Playing just his second T20, Madushan had Azam caught at short fine-leg for five and then bowled Fakhar Zaman for a first-ball duck the following delivery. Mohammad Rizwan (55) and Iftikhar Ahmed (32) put together a partnership of 71 but Madushan broke the stand with the wicket of Iftikhar. Rizwan, who surpassed India's Virat Kohli as the highest run-getter of the tournament with 282, reached his fifty with a six off Chamika Karunaratne but soon fell to Hasaranga's leg-spin and the wheels came off the chase. Karunaratne got Rauf out on the final ball to trigger Sri Lankan celebrations. \"We didn't finish the way we would've wanted to,\" said Azam. \"But there are lots of positives from the tournament.\"","pubDate":"2022-09-12 00:45:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"bangkokpost","country":["thailand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Bonkers decision’ enrages cricket world as Broad tops sacred Aussie mark","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/cricket-england-vs-south-africa-third-test-score-result-stuart-broad-passes-glenn-mcgrath-wickets-before-bad-light/news-story/76c1629c8b5b639def2fd56caf0bc94b","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Stuart Broad said he was proud to have surpassed the Test-wicket tally of boyhood hero Glenn McGrath as England closed in on a series win over South Africa at The Oval.","content":"Stuart Broad said he was proud to have surpassed the Test-wicket tally of boyhood hero Glenn McGrath as England closed in on a series win over South Africa at The Oval. Broad captured the prize scalp of South Africa captain Dean Elgar for 36 on Sunday for his 564th Test wicket, topping long-retired Australia great McGrath’s haul of 563. Elgar had been in good touch but the Proteas’ most experienced batsman surprisingly decided against a review, even though replays showed the ball would have missed leg stump. Watch South Africa’s Tour of England. Every ODI & T20 Live & On-Demand on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > South Africa had been 83-1 before Elgar’s dismissal, which precipitated another batting collapse as they slumped to 169 all out in the deciding Test of a three-match contest. When bad light brought a premature halt to the fourth day, England were 97-0, needing just 33 more runs on Monday to reach a target of 130 that would secure a 2-1 series win. The decision to stop play so soon to a result did not go down well with some, including former England captain Michael Vaughan who tweeted: “Cricket is a stupid sport at times! Common sense always goes out of the window.” Zak Crawley was 57 not at stumps, his first fifty in 17 Test innings, with Alex Lees unbeaten on 32. Broad is now among the top five in the all-time list of Test wicket-takers, with only England colleague and close friend James Anderson ahead of him among fast bowlers with 667 dismissals. But as Broad was the first to observe after equalling fellow seamer McGrath’s mark, he is in his 159th Test compared to the Australian’s total of 124 matches. Stuart Broad has topped long-retired Australia great Glenn McGrath’s Test wicket haul of 563. Source: Getty Images “I saw Jimmy got his 564th on September 11 four years ago so that was quite funny,” Broad told reporters after Sunday’s close. “Glenn McGrath’s a hero of mine and the reason I wanted to become a bowler, I used to imitate him in the garden. Obviously he’s a much finer bowler than I’ve ever been but it’s incredible to be up there in that sort of company.” Broad, the son of former England opening batsman Chris Broad, added: “It’s really special to have joined Jimmy as a one-two with him being a great mate and someone who I’ve shared a fantastic partnership with for a long time.” - ‘Incredible summer’ - The veteran duo of Broad and the 40-year-old Anderson show no sign of stopping anytime soon. Their international careers have been rejuvenated by new captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum after both pacemen were controversially omitted from a tour of the Caribbean earlier this year that marked the end of Joe Root’s reign as skipper. “It’s been an incredible summer to be a part of,” said Broad, with England now on the cusp of a sixth win in seven Tests. “I feel great. I’m 36. I feel like I’ve bowled really well. “But the mindset those two guys (Stokes and McCullum) have brought to our changing room and to Test cricket as a whole has been so refreshing and invigorating to play in actually. “That sort of no consequences, trying to play on the front foot the whole time, I feel it suits my mindset and how I like to play my cricket personally.” By going off when they did, even though the floodlights were on, the umpires denied England the chance to secure a win in just two days’ playing time after Thursday was washed out completely and Friday abandoned as a mark of respect following the death of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II. “We’re naturally disappointed,” said Broad. “I do understand the other side of it, that it would be unfair on South Africa if it rained all day (on Monday) and we’d carried on just to finish the game. But as a changing room we’re frustrated.”","pubDate":"2022-09-12 00:42:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India blown away by England in first T20","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/india-blown-away-by-england-in-first-t20-430819","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Chester-le-Street, September 11 The Indian women's cricket team failed to click with both the bat and ball to suffer a nine-wicket loss against England in the first T20I here. Sent in to bat by England skipper Amy Jones, the Indian batters came a cropper as leg-spinner Sarah Glenn's four-wicket haul restricted the visitors to 132/7. Glenn finished with excellent figures of 4/23. All-rounder Deepti Sharma top-scored for the tourists with a 29-ball 24, with opener Smriti Mandhana scoring 23 and captain Harmanpreet Kaur getting 20 off 16 balls. The big-hitting Shafali Verma gave away her wicket after making 14 off 13 balls. England chased down the target in just 13 overs, even as India endured a forgettable night on the field in wet conditions. England were off to a blistering start with openers Sophia Dunkley (61 off 44 balls) and Danielle Wyatt (24 off 16 balls) taking the hosts to 60 in only 6.2 overs. Dunkely survived a caught-behind courtesy of a no-ball from Renuka Singh. Shafali then fluffed a straightforward catch at mid-off when the opener was on 15. Renuka was the bowler again. Dunkley went on to record her highest score in the format. She shared a stand of 74 runs with Alice Capsey. We forcefully played in wet conditions: Harmanpreet India captain Harmanpreet said the side \"forcefully played\" in wet conditions. \"We were not able to get the runs we were expecting. I just feel we forcefully played because conditions were not 100 percent fit to play,\" Harmanpreet said. India ended up losing a key member of the side when Radha Yadav's diving effort resulted in a shoulder injury. The 23-year-old's sudden departure from the field meant that India were short of a bowler. \"I know the ground was too wet and there were so many chances to get injured and one of our players got injured also. She was our main bowler and that's why we were lacking,\" Harmanpreet added. — PTI Brief scores: India: 132/7 (Deepti 29*; Glenn 4/23); England: 134/1 in 13 overs (Dunkley 61*, Capsey 32*)","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-12 00:39:37","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/9/2022_9$largeimg_1603237347.jpg","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘If you knew more about rugby league’: Buzz, Clarkey in heated live radio spat over sin bin circus","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/nrl-2022-south-sydney-v-sydney-roosters-sin-binds-michael-clarke-phil-rothfield-clash-over-ashley-klein/news-story/ba7877f95e89acd1536cab6165200683","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke and veteran Daily Telegraph reporter Phil ‘Buzz’ Rothfield have clashed in a heated live radio discussion over the dramatic South Sydney vs Sydney Roosters finals clash.","content":"Former Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke and veteran Daily Telegraph reporter Phil ‘Buzz’ Rothfield have clashed in a heated live radio discussion over the dramatic South Sydney vs Sydney Roosters finals clash.

Forget winning, no one expected them to reach the finals. And after they lost their first match against Afghanistan, they were doubtful to reach the Super Four stage either.But 16 days and 13 matches later, the Lions have been crowned as the Asian champions – 6th time – after defeating Pakistan by 23 runs in the final at Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.After what the Sri Lankan people have been through in the last six-eight months, this win is going to bring them immense joy and the economic issues might seem to disappear for a few days for the cricket-loving nation.6th title ✅😉 https://t.co/5Mvot46Omm pic.twitter.com/uks6F2YTgw— Sri Lanka Cricket 🇱🇰 (@OfficialSLC) September 11, 2022Sri Lanka managed to post 170 runs on the board despite Babar Azam putting them in to bat first and the bowlers rattled them to 58/5 inside nine overs. Bhanuka Rajapaksa acted like a lone wolf blasting his way to 71 off 45 deliveries while Wanindu Hasaranga supported him with an amazing 21-ball 36 runs.Expert review: Sri Lanka rally like champions to send Pakistan packing in title matchPakistan, in response, could never get going as they scored 100 runs only in the 15th over, but had lost some crucial wickets and were left far behind in the run chase.The tournament also proved to be a redemption for Chris Silverwood who was criticised during his stint with the English team.There are many talking points at the end of every cricket match, and this match, though having a higher magnitude was no different. Here are top five points to talk about –Pakistan rattle SL with early wicketsPakistan rattled Sri Lanka early in the innings as Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf proved to be unplayable in the powerplay. Sri Lanka lost three wickets in the powerplay itself as Kusal Mendis and Danushka Gunathilaka’s stumps were destroyed with sheer pace.As if that was not sufficient, Pakistan dismissed Dhananjaya De Silva and Dasun Shanaka in successive overs, and half the side was sent back in the ninth over with only 58 runs on board.Bhanuka Rajapaksa leads Sri Lanka’s batting resurgenceRajapaksa saw himself coming in to bat in the powerplay – a rare happening. But that only made him more determined to play the innings he did on the night of the final.For once, Rajapaksa had to change his batting style and he couldn’t go bang bang right from the beginning. And he was successful in adopting a new role and anchoring an already depleted batting unit.He himself admitted to the fact during the post-match presentation that he had to change his approach considering the situation.Rajapaksa scored 71 off 45 deliveries (SR of 157.78) hitting six 4s and three maximums on the way.The southpaw was undoubtedly the star in the first innings, but if an award for the best supporting role was to be given after the first innings, it would go to Wanindu Hasaranga for a shining 36-run innings in 21 balls that included five 4s and one maximum.Earlier, Dhananjaya De Silva also ensured that the powerplay overs were not futile and scored 28 runs off 21 deliveries.Sri Lanka field their way to the cupSri Lanka batted well and bowled impeccably well to win the final, but if there was one thing they were outstanding in, it was their fielding. There were astounding dives inside the circle as well as at the boundary line. The catches as well were neatly taken unlike their opponent’s collision and consequential injury while taking a catch.Watch: Shadab Khan – Asif Ali collide, drop a catch to concede sixThe fielders threw themselves to all parts of the ground and saved crucial runs at crucial moments in the game. Unfortunately, the runs saved cannot be quantified.The fact that eight of the 10 Pakistan wickets to fall were caught – is a shred of good evidence to prove their brilliant fielding.Mohammad Rizwan’s lousy inningsMohammad Rizwan has been the batting mainstay for Pakistan throughout the tournament and one of the main batters who propelled them to the finals, especially in absence of his opening partner and skipper Babar Azam’s form.Rizwan stayed till the 16th over in the final and scored a half-century as well, but all in vain as he could never pick up the pace a T20 match would require especially in a chase of 171.Rizwan’s fifty came in 47 balls as he hit Chamika Karunaratne for a six over mid-wicket. And while he was required to shift gears at the death for Pakistan to have any chance to chase the total, he perished two balls later.Yes, Pakistan have a middle order issue. But there is another. You cannot be 55(49) in a 170 chase.— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) September 11, 2022Rizwan ended the tournament as the highest run-getter with 281 runs but failed to take his team over the victory line in the final.Wanindu Hasaranga and Pramod Madushan’s spellIf Pakistan were not able to free their arms with the bat, the reason behind the inability was the stupendous bowling of rookie Pramod Madushan and probably the only star in the Lankan lineup – Wanindu Hasaranga.Madushan disturbed Pakistan’s plans right at the start as he sent back Babar for five runs and then cleaned up Fakhar Zaman for a golden duck to bowl a hat-trick ball to Iftikhar Ahmed – all in the fourth over.He then came back in the 14th over and this time dismissed the settled Iftikhar Ahmed after other bowlers were not able to scalp wickets. Madushan had dismissed Pakistan’s top three batters and ensured their team was never out of the race.W 1 W 1 W 0 🤯Wanindu Hasaranga with a magical over 💫#AsiaCup2022 | Scorecard: https://t.co/xA1vz7dqLy pic.twitter.com/zcE0OSNVFW— ICC (@ICC) September 11, 2022All this while, Hasaranga was quiet, and had given 25 runs in his first three overs. But it was in the 17th over that he showed his prowess and dismissed three batters in six balls – starting with the lynchpin Rizwan. From 110/4 at the start of the over, Pakistan were rattled to 112/7 in a span of one over – Hasaranga the destroyer.Remember, Sri Lanka have to play the first round of the T20 World Cup in October, before they can qualify for the main round.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Pramod Madushan showed promising signs with the ball with four wickets while Wanindu Hasaranga too impressed with three wickets.Following the victory, Shanaka said that the last-ball six from Rajapaksa was the turning point, while also adding that Wanindu Hasaranga too had made a huge impact. “I want to thank the crowd; they have been supporting us massively. Hopefully we made them proud today. In IPL 2021, Chennai won the match batting first and that is what was in my mind. These youngsters know the conditions really well. Wanindu made a huge impact after losing five wickets. Chamika and DDS batted really well too. The last ball six was the turning point. 170 was mentally the difference, as 160 always feels chasable. As a youngster, we knew Madushanka would deliver, and as a captain we had to back him,” said Shanaka at the post-match presentation ceremony.Sri Lanka had opened their Asia Cup campaign with an eight-wicket defeat to Afghanistan in a group match, but remained unbeaten since then, winning five in a row. These victories included against India, Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Super Four stage. Shanaka said that there were serious discussions after the opening defeat.“(On the opening game against Afghanistan) It happened for a good reason. We had serious discussions after that game. Each and every individual did well for us and that is how we became champions. The fielding improved a lot in the finals. We had some mistakes in the league stages. We were 100 percent today, credit to the players and the coaching staff. I want to thank the Sri Lankan cricket board and the selectors as well,” the 31-year-old added.Pakistan skipper Babar Azam, meanwhile, admitted his team did not bat to their potential and the fielding was not upto the mark.Mohammad Rizwan (55) and Iftikhar Ahmed (32) were the only positives in Pakistan’s batting lineup, while Bhanuja Rajapaksa was also dropped twice during the Lankan innings.“Congratulations to Sri Lanka for playing outstanding cricket. We dominated them for the first eight overs, but the partnership that Rajapaska got was amazing. This was a true wicket and it is always nice playing in Dubai,” Babar said.“We didn’t bat according to our potential. We started well, but we gave away 15-20 extra runs and couldn’t finish well. A lot of positives for us to take. In a final, the margin for mistakes is lesser. Our fielding wasn’t up to the mark and the batting couldn’t finish it off well. But Rizwan, Naseem and Nawaz were positives. Ups and downs will be there, but it would be nicer if we made lesser mistakes,” the skipper asserted.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

England were in truth fairly diabolical from around the Tea break yesterday until shortly before lunch today – on Day Three they blundered from 84/2 to 154/7 by the close, and followed that up with the loss of their final three wickets for just four runs inside the first 15 minutes of Day Four. Then a sloppy start with the ball saw South Africa knock off the deficit of 40 runs with relative ease.Predictably it was Stokes who stepped up to change the direction of the match, removing Sarel Erwee before lunch and reinstalling that almost unearned sense of belief that this was a Test match that England were winning by the close.Ben Stokes takes our one wicket before lunch. pic.twitter.com/2jRe00prMQ— England Cricket (@englandcricket) September 11, 2022It always helps to have a slice of luck to go with your confidence and England were granted that after lunch, Dean Elgar’s curious decision not to review when given out LBW – to a ball later revealed to be missing the stumps considerably – certainly tipped things in England’s favour.However it was good fortune that they did very well to make the most of, Stuart Broad probably the standout – and seemingly never far from whipping up encouragement from the crowd – but ably supported by Ollie Robinson, James Anderson, and Stokes, as South Africa’s attempts to post any sort of meaningful target crumbled forlornly as the afternoon wore on.Broad’s three wickets took him past Glenn McGrath to outright ownership of the fifth place in the all-time Test wicket-takers list, Anderson of course the only other seamer ahead of him. Against that kind of experience perhaps it is no wonder South Africa’s callow batting card fared so badly.Fortunately, from their point of view, at least, when it came for England to bat again, they were much improved on the morning’s feeble effort – hoping to knock off the meagre target of 130 by the end of the day’s play.Alex Lees admittedly was fortunate to survive being dropped off the first ball of the innings and looked less than fluent throughout, but at the other end, Zak Crawley gave another glimpse of just why England are prepared to invest so much time in his Test match career.Before the close, he had his first 50 of the summer, received by a boisterous Oval crowd with a standing ovation no less, and scored off just 36 balls with a handsome elegance off both front and back foot.A 564th Test wicket for @StuartBroad8, the second highest ever for a seam bowler. pic.twitter.com/mu5XtmWGcR— England Cricket (@englandcricket) September 11, 2022England were cruising towards the finish line, and with the tantalising prospect of Broad padded up to come in next – in his long-awaited new ‘Nighthawk’ role – and then the umpires intervened, bad light arguably trumping common sense once more.So, they will return, as they must, for Day Five and England should wrap up their sixth win in seven home Tests this summer, a fairly remarkable transformation forged in the image of McCullum and Stokes.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Pakistan began like an express train but Sri Lanka came back in a fashion that became a nightmare for the rivals by the end of the match.The sheer poise and confidence the islanders got from the recovery in the batting, thanks to Bhanuka Rajapaksa’s most outstanding effort, also reflected in their bowling as they were on point for most of the match, fielded like tigers and caught everything.Their game plan, once they got through the Powerplay while batting, was almost perfect and Pakistan were left with no answers.Pramod Madhushan had a dream spell (4/34), while Wanindu Hasaranga (3/27) showed why he is rated so highly.One wonders where Pakistan would have been in Asia Cup 2022 without Mohammad Rizwan. The wicketkeeper-batter, coming in as opener, has been the mainstay of their batting in almost each match. Every time Pakistan have chased, he has been the lynchpin, especially since skipper Babar Azam has been seriously out of his depth.Congratulations Sri Lanka ! deserved to win the Asia cup ,After loosing to Afghanistan in the first game showed true character as a unit to win the tournament 🏟 #SLvsPAK #AsiaCup2022Final well done skipper @dasunshanaka1 🤛— Yuvraj Singh (@YUVSTRONG12) September 11, 2022@OfficialSLC @dasunshanaka1 @BhanukaRajapak3 amazing win and thoroughly deserved.

Pakistan’s over-dependence on him after they were really pegged back by the double-strike by Madhushan to remove Babar and Fakhar Zaman didn’t really materialise till really late in the inning. Even Rizwan struggled to get the bowlers off the square and 68/2 after 10 overs was just not good enough while chasing 170 runs.Iftikhar Ahmed was the only other batter who got some measure of the bowlers and his treatment of Hasaranga in the leggie’s third over was quite a significant affair. Or was till Hasaranga came back to snare Rizwan for a 55 which was possibly not scored at his best tilt. Then, for good measure, Hasaranga yorked Asif Ali for a duck and then had Khushdil Shah in the same over and that pretty much was it.One massive difference between the two sides was the fielding. Shadab Khan floored Rajapaksa once and another collision with a fellow-fielder saw the ball lob over the boundary for a six when the catch looked an easier option. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, dropped nothing.But in the sum total, Sri Lanka have come a long way indeed from the disastrous opening match with Afghanistan. Five straight wins over a span of just above a week was something else. But then, once they had entered the Super 4, they were a different team altogether.The Sri Lankan batting was in two distinct halves – pre-Bhanuka Rajapaksa and post his arrival.It was quite an amazing transformation for the Sri Lankans. They knew they were up for it once Pakistan won the toss with the fast-bowling battery coming at them with incredible hostility and skill.Naseem Shah was nearly unplayable at the top of the inning and Kushal Mendis possibly got the ball of the tournament, which swung in the air and blasted in through the batter’s defence. With Haris Rauf also delivering from the other end with two more wickets, post the Powerplay, Pakistan were all over their rivals.This is where Babar Azam possibly missed a trick. He went to Shadab Khan’s straight after the Powerplay when the fast bowlers were really nearly unplayable. Sri Lanka did not really make them pay for that mistake early on, especially when Dhananjaya de Silva, who had actually dealt with the fast stuff quite well, hit one straight back to Iftikhar Ahmed, a part-time bowler at the best of times.Dasun Shanaka had a brain fade but thereafter Sri Lanka seemed to get some poise back with Wanindu Hasaranga joining Rajapaksa.The spin didn’t bother him and even the fast stuff by and large was without much imagination from the middle of the second lot of 10 overs till the end, with Rajapaksa and Hasaranga to start with and then also Chamika Karunaratne found runs where it looked like Sri Lanka would struggle to get a total of 130.A stand of 58 for the sixth wicket and then another 54 for the unfinished seventh and Sri Lanka were back in business in no uncertain terms.Rajapaksa played one of the best knocks of career. A score of 71 not out off 45 balls, with six boundaries and three sixes revitalised Sri Lanka radically. One of the fours and a six came off the last over by Naseem Shah, and that really threw down the gauntlet.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

During the final match of Asia Cup 2022 between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Dubai, Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 23 runs to win the Asia Cup for the sixth time . Not the team expected to lift the title, Sri Lanka have surprised one and all on the back of an unbelievable run in this tournament. Having easily dominated all the crunch moments in the recent weeks, Sri Lanka have won a much-needed multi-team tournament amid a political turmoil in the country. Defending a 171-run target, Sri Lanka bundled out Pakistan for 147 in 20 overs. Pacer Pramod Madushan was the pick of the Sri Lankan bowlers with figures of 4-0-34-4. All-rounders Wanindu Hasaranga and Chamika Karunaratne also chipped in with three and two wickets respectively. Hasaranga, who had kick-started hitting boundaries after Sri Lanka had lost half their side in the first innings, lost out the Player of the Match award to batter Bhanuka Rajapaksa . Hasaranga, meanwhile, bagged the Player of the Series award for his all-round show throughout Asia Cup 2022 in the UAE. Third series award for Hasaranga’s in the shortest format, it is his fourth in international cricket. Second-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, Hasaranga picked nine wickets in six matches at an average of 18.88, an economy rate of 7.39 and a strike rate of 15.3. With the bat in hand, Hasaranga’s 66 runs came at an average and strike rate of 22 and 150 respectively. Congrats to the net ball team as well. Two trophies in one day. A day to remember and cherish. @OfficialSLC — Kumar Sangakkara (@KumarSanga2) September 11, 2022 “I love to bowl in subcontinent. I like to bowl on the stumps, I think that helps me successful. I try to bowl without boundaries so that’s why I got three wickets in the last over today,” Hasaranga told Star Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony.","pubDate":"2022-09-11 18:55:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Anderson says positive England have changed the face of test cricket","link":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/anderson-says-positive-england-have-changed-face-test-cricket-2932116","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"LONDON: James Anderson believes England's positive style of test cricket has changed the way people view the longest format of the game around the world as they stand on the brink of victory over South Africa in the third test at The Oval.

Pakistan failed to chase down a target of 171, with Pramod Madushan taking four wickets and playing a crucial role in the final.Earlier, having won the toss, Pakistan asked Sri Lanka to bat first. Sri Lanka, batting first, were off to a shaky start as they lost Kusal Mendis for a golden duck in the very first over. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals but Bhanuka Rajapaksa stood firm with an unbeaten 71 off 45 balls.Rajapaksa was the game-changer for Sri Lanka with the bat. He was involved in two 50-plus partnerships with Wanindu Hasaranga , and then Chamika Karunaratne, as he led Sri Lanka to 170/6.In Pakistan’s reply, only Mohammad Rizwan looked a stable batter as he scored 55 off 49 balls. Notably, he was involved in a 71-run stand with Iftikhar Ahmed (32) for the third wicket, but the Lankans were brilliant on the field, and good fielding from Lankans meant Pakistan continued losing wicket at the other end.Apart from Madushan, Wanindu Hasaranga (three), Chamika Karunaratne (two) and Maheesh Theekshana (one) were Sri Lanka’s wicket-takers in the final.Let’s now take a look at some interesting statistics from the Asia Cup final:—This is Sri Lanka’s sixth Asia Cup title. Only India (Seven titles) have more titles than Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka last won the Asia Cup in 2014.—This is for the first time since April 2014 that Sri Lanka have won five consecutive T20Is. The last time they had won five consecutive T20Is was during their T20 World Cup-winning campaign in Bangladesh in 2014.—Babar Azam managed just five runs in the final and it was his sixth consecutive T20I innings without a 50+ score for the Pakistan skipper.—Prior to the final, Sri Lanka had batted first on seven occasions in T20Is in 2022, and lost all of those matches.—Kusal Mendis was dismissed for a golden duck in the final. It was for the third time in six innings during Asia Cup 2022 that Kusal Mendis had been dismissed in the first over.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

You could hear a pin drop,” said Broad — before a bell was chimed once by a high-ranking member of the military.The anthems of both South Africa and England were then sung by English soprano Laura Wright. After seven decades of the English anthem “God Save the Queen,” now it was a rendition of “God Save the King” rippling around the ground. Hours earlier Saturday, King Charles III was officially announced as Britain’s monarch in a ceremony, having automatically become king following his mother’s death.There was a standing ovation as Wright left the field and the players got ready to start the match — two days after the toss was won by England.England’s seamers were excellent, with Ollie Robinson taking 5-49 and Broad weighing in with 4-41 to join former Australia pacer Glenn McGrath on 563 wickets for his test career — tied for fifth place on the all-time list.Read: Robinson picks five before Proteas fight back on emotional day as cricket returnsFor Robinson, it was a third five-wicket haul in tests after regaining his place in the team during this series following fitness issues.He took four of the first six wickets as the Proteas slumped to 36-6 before Khaya Zondo (23) and Marco Jansen (30) led in a mini-recovery.Robinson completed his five-fer before Broad took the final two wickets to wrap up the innings in 36.2 overs.England openers Alex Lees (13) and Zak Crawley (5) again fell cheaply, both to left-arm pacer Jansen, but Ollie Pope (67) helped push the hosts toward South Africa’s total.The Proteas fought back well in the final session, though, as Jansen removed Joe Root (23) and debutant Harry Brook (12) to finish with figures of 4-34.Some of England’s shot-making left a lot to be desired, even if the aggressive style followed the team’s new approach demanded by captain Ben Stokes.Stoke wafted behind for 6 and Broad fell for the same score, leaving Ben Foakes (11) and Robinson (3) in the middle when the players came off for bad light.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

It was a victory that was just not about cricket but way beyond that with much deeper historical and political importance. It was one for posterity as Sri Lanka first raised themselves from the dungeons to reach 170 for 6 from a hopeless 58 for 5 because of Bhanuka Rajapaksa's 45-ball-71, easily one of the best knocks under pressure in T20s in recent times. If that wasn't enough, Pakistan, who were cruising along at 93 for 2, were finally bowled out Pakistan for 147 as pacer Pramod Madushan (4/34 in 4 overs) and leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga (3/27 in 4 overs) ensured that the few thousands of Sri Lankan fans out cheered the 20,000 odd Pakistan fans. The 17th over by Hasaranga that served as Pakistan's death knell with three wickets falling in quick succession. It was Rajapaksa, who laid the foundation, Madushan, who built the structure and Hasaranga, who gave the finishing touches. Sri Lanka don't have prima donas like the 'Men in Blue' but a team of good cricketers who have understood how to win crunch matches from the dead. The whippy right-arm fast medium Madushan, who got Babar Azam (5) and Fakhar Zaman (0), gave Sri Lanka the upper-hand at the start of the chase. While Babar was guilty off flicking a wide long hop down leg side straight into short fine leg fielder's hands, Fakhar dragged an angular delivery back onto stumps. Rizwan (55 off 49 balls) as usual played the sheet anchor's role hitting the odd boundaries as Iftikhar Ahmed (32 of 31 balls) started hitting after 10 overs but Madushan coming back for his second spell had him holed out in the deep. If there was one difference between the sides, it was fielding. While Pakistan were poor on the field dropping catches, Sri Lankans took some smart catches and were outstanding in the deep mid-wicket bounary. At one point, even the spectators got frustrated with Rizwan's push and prod game which is good for totals in the 150 range but not the 170 plus ones. Finally when the pressure went above critical limit, Hasaranga had him caught at deep. It was a good toss to win for Babar as Pakistan pacers started with a bang before Rajapaksa's brilliance ensured a challenging total for the islanders. Rajapaksa's calculated assault at the death saw 50 runs being scored off last 4 overs. Young Naseem Shah (1/40 in 4 overs) and the uber cool Haris Rauf (3/29 in 4 overs) bowled with a lot of pace and fire extracting movement off the track as they broke the backbone of the Lankan batting within the Powerplay overs before Rajapaksa scored one of his finest fifties considering the situation that his team was in. Rajapaksa and Wanindu Hasaranga (36 off 21 balls) added 58 quick runs after Sri Lanka were left gasping for breath at 58 for 5. There was another 54 run stand with Chamika Karunaratne and Sri Lanka did cross the 160-run mark. Shah, the 19-year-old pace sensation bowled one of the most lethal off-cutters seen in this tournament as it pitched back of length but moved in sharply, giving no time to in-form Kusal Mendis (0) to bring his bat down. While Dhananjaya de Silva (28 off 21 balls) did hit some picturesque cover drives, there was no support literally from the other end. However Rajapaksa with his all-round strokeplay did give Sri Lankan total lot of respectability. He hit six fours and three sixes and the flick off Naseem for a maximum was a treat for the eyes. Equally good was was ramp flick off Naseem that went for four before a slashed six over cover point took Lanka to 170. Promoted When Shadab bowled a googly or Iftikhar managed an off-break, Rajapaksa played some deft late cuts as Babar was seen getting a bit restless.

Just when the country was searching for heroes, Bhanuka Rajapaksa ’s masterful unbeaten 71 off 45 and Wanindu Hasaranga ’s all-round show (36 off 21 & 3/27) demonstrated how one could turn adversity into opportunity as Sri Lanka walked away with the Asia Cup title by convincingly beating Pakistan by 23 runs. Sri Lanka 𝐖𝐈𝐍 the #AsiaCup2022 🏆Scorecard: https://t.co/xA1vz7cSW0 https://t.co/IL3DaXmwIs — ICC (@ICC) 1662918963000 The tournament was moved out of Sri Lanka to UAE because of the prevailing political and financial crisis. On Sunday, they at least managed to restore their cricketing identity as a powerhouse from the Indian subcontinent. Known as the Lions, they were roaring again when Chamika Karunaratne knocked over Haris Rauf’s stumps off the last ball of the match. As It Happened Rajapaksa came out to bat at 36/3 in the sixth over against a Pakistan pace attack that was breathing fire after Babar Azam won the toss and expectedly elected to bowl first. And when he deposited a Naseem Shah thunderbolt over the extra cover fence off the last ball of the innings, he ensured Sri Lankan bowlers had a decent total of 170/6 on the board to try the temperament of the Pakistani batting lineup. Take a bow, Sri Lanka! 🙌 🙌Men's #AsiaCup Champions for the 6️⃣th time! 🏆#RoaringForGlory #SLvPAK https://t.co/9xf2sjlIBX — Sri Lanka Cricket 🇱🇰 (@OfficialSLC) 1662919120000 Once they found momentum, they hounded the Pakistan batting lineup like a pack of wolves sniffing the kill, fielding with their hearts on their sleeves and bowling with immaculate planning. The moment Babar fell for five flicking the ball to short fine-leg, Mohammad Rizwan flung his bat in frustration at the other end. Pakistan never recovered from the pressure applied on them. Rizwan decided to take it upon himself to take the match deep with his 49-ball 55 but Hasaranga and Pramod Madushan (4/20), playing in his second game, chipped away with wickets to complete a convincing win. This match was of great importance for Sri Lanka given the crisis back home. At 58/5 with their captain Dasun Shanaka gone slogging leg-spinner Shadab Khan in the ninth over, it seemed the occasion was getting to them. Haris Rauf and Mohammad Hasnain complemented Naseem in bowling with brut pace. When Naseem’s deadly inswinger knocked over the in-form opener Kusal Mendis’ stumps for a duck in the first over, Pakistan looked like pushing the Lankan batting on the backfoot with their raw pace. Rajapaksa had claimed that this Sri Lankan team was playing to rebuild the brand of cricket that Sri Lanka played with a couple of decades ago. And he did exactly that. Fearlessness, calculative, exuberance and elegance—all blended in the right measure—Rajapaksa and Hasaranga started rebuilding the innings with aplomb. There was no chest-thumping in the middle from Rajapaksa even as each strike triggered fist pumps in the dugout throughout the innings. Rajapaksa was in a zone where nobody could gatecrash his party. While Rajapaksa kept one end safe with his measured approach, Hasaranga improvised and started using the extra pace of the Pakistan pacers. Hasaranga got captain Babar scratching his head as he started exploiting every gap from mid-off to third-man in his innings which had five boundaries and one six in it. When Hasaranga finally fell to become Rauf's third wicket and 50th in T20I career, he had created a flutter in the Pakistan camp. The 36-ball 58-run partnership had brought Sri Lanka back in the game. Rajapaksa, hitting gaps in front of the wicket while batting with Hasaranga, started moving around the crease with a steady head targeting all parts of the field. Muscling the ball wasn’t his way. He was timing it like he was batting on a concrete pitch. The wristy flicks sailed over fine-leg and the punch drives found the boundaries. The onslaught saw Shadab Khan drop two skiers at the back end of the innings. Clearly, Sri Lanka had to put the pressure back on Pakistan.","pubDate":"2022-09-11 18:04:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Nightmare tournament”: Shoaib Akhtar defines Asia Cup 2022 for Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-nightmare-tournament-shoaib-akhtar-defines-asia-cup-2022-for-babar-azam-and-fakhar-zaman/","keywords":["Cricket","asia cup","Asia Cup 2022","babar azam","Fakhar Zaman","Pakistan","Shoaib Akhtar","Sri Lanka"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Shoaib Akhtar defines Asia Cup 2022: The former Pakistani fast bowler defined Asia Cup 2022 for their top-order batters.

During the final match of Asia Cup 2022 between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Dubai, Pakistan top-order batters Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman failed for another time to hinder the team’s progress in a 171-run chase. Opening the batting with wicket-keeper batter Mohammad Rizwan, captain Azam scored 5 (6) before being a tad bit unlucky with respect to his dismissal tonight. Facing a wayward Pramod Madushan delivery, Azam looked to hit a ball down the leg-side towards the fine leg boundary but could only hit it straight to Dilshan Madushanka at short fine leg. Zaman, who dragged the following delivery back to his stumps, registered a first-ball duck as Pakistan lost two consecutive wickets in the fourth over. In what has been that kind of a tournament for both Azam and Zaman, Pakistan’s premier batters not being able to leave a mark especially in the final must have been quite disheartening for Pakistani fans. Quick to point out Azam and Zaman’s repeated Asia Cup 2022 failures, former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar took to social media platform Twitter to find faults with Azam and Zaman. Using words like “nightmare” and “disaster” for Azam and Zaman respectively, Akhtar tweeted right after their dismissals at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium tonight. That ends a nightmare tournament for Babar as a batter. Same disaster for Fakhar. — Shoaib Akhtar (@shoaib100mph) September 11, 2022 In six innings of this tournament, Azam has been able to contribute just 68 runs at an average and strike rate of 11.33 and 107.93 respectively. Zaman, on the other hand, scored 96 runs in six innings at an average and strike rate of 16 and 103.22 respectively as the 32-year old player continues to struggle at No. 3 position in the shortest format.","pubDate":"2022-09-11 17:45:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
