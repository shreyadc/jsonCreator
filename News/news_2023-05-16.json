In the ongoing , the two currently top the list of highest wicket-takers on the back of picking 23 wickets each in the 13 matches that they‚Äôve played till now. With IPL 2023 into its business end now, bowlers have managed to dominate batters on a regular basis especially due to the wear and tear of pitches across the country. Advertisement The most recent match of the season between Titans and registered a rare occasion of one bowler picking a five-wicket haul and two bowlers dismissing four batters each. While this happened at a Narendra Modi Stadium pitch where a batter even managed to score a century, pitches in cities such as Lucknow, Chennai, Delhi and Hyderabad have not remained conducive for stroke-making as the season has progressed. Set to be remembered for the respective comebacks of several veteran bowlers, IPL 2023 will also be known for spinners calling the shots on most occasions. Not a surprise by any means for a T20 competition being played in India, readers must note that four out of the Top Five bowlers with most wickets are spin bowlers. Furthermore, three of them are conventional right-arm leg-spinners. The balance, however, is maintained when the Top 10 wicket-takers are considered on the back of the presence of five pacers and spinners each at this point in time.

According to an official release from the ICC, the recommendations, which were proposed by the Men‚Äôs Cricket Committee led by former India captain Sourav Ganguly and endorsed by the Women‚Äôs Cricket Committee, were formally ratified by the Chief Executives Committee on Monday. The new rules state that umpires will no longer have to give a soft signal while referring decisions to the TV umpire. Umpires were, until now, required to give a soft signal when it came referring catches that were difficult to judge on field; the TV umpire would then rule in favour of the soft signal if replays weren‚Äôt conclusive enough. ‚ÄúSoft signals have been discussed at previous cricket committee meetings over the last couple of years. The committee deliberated this at length and concluded that soft signals were unnecessary and at times confusing since referrals of catches may seem inconclusive in replays,‚Äù Ganguly was quoted as saying in the release. Besides doing away with the soft signal rule, the ICC also made the use of helmets mandatory for batters facing fast bowlers and for wicketkeepers when standing close to the stumps ‚Äî which also extended to other fielders standing close to the batter such as silly point and short leg. ‚ÄúWe also discussed player safety, which is very important for us. The committee decided that it was best to make the use of helmets mandatory in certain positions to ensure the safety of players,‚Äù added Ganguly, who until recently had served as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president. The third change introduced in the rule had to do with runs scored off a Free Hit, wherein ‚Äúany runs scored off a Free Hit when the ball hits the stumps will count as runs scored, to be consistent with all other runs scored from a free hit.‚Äù The release further stated that the changes would come into effect from 1 June on the opening day of the one-off Test between England and Ireland at Lord‚Äôs.

According to an official release from the ICC, the recommendations, which were proposed by the Men‚Äôs Cricket Committee led by former India captain Sourav Ganguly and endorsed by the Women‚Äôs Cricket Committee, were formally ratified by the Chief Executives Committee on Monday. The new rules state that umpires will no longer have to give a soft signal while referring decisions to the TV umpire. Umpires were, until now, required to give a soft signal when it came referring catches that were difficult to judge on field; the TV umpire would then rule in favour of the soft signal if replays weren‚Äôt conclusive enough. ‚ÄúSoft signals have been discussed at previous cricket committee meetings over the last couple of years. The committee deliberated this at length and concluded that soft signals were unnecessary and at times confusing since referrals of catches may seem inconclusive in replays,‚Äù Ganguly was quoted as saying in the release. Besides doing away with the soft signal rule, the ICC also made the use of helmets mandatory for batters facing fast bowlers and for wicketkeepers when standing close to the stumps ‚Äî which also extended to other fielders standing close to the batter such as silly point and short leg. ‚ÄúWe also discussed player safety, which is very important for us. The committee decided that it was best to make the use of helmets mandatory in certain positions to ensure the safety of players,‚Äù added Ganguly, who until recently had served as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president. The third change introduced in the rule had to do with runs scored off a Free Hit, wherein ‚Äúany runs scored off a Free Hit when the ball hits the stumps will count as runs scored, to be consistent with all other runs scored from a free hit.‚Äù The release further stated that the changes would come into effect from 1 June on the opening day of the one-off Test between England and Ireland at Lord‚Äôs.

In the ongoing , the two currently top the list of highest wicket-takers on the back of picking 23 wickets each in the 13 matches that they‚Äôve played till now.

While this happened at a Narendra Modi Stadium pitch where a batter even managed to score a century, pitches in cities such as Lucknow, Chennai, Delhi and Hyderabad have not remained conducive for stroke-making as the season has progressed. Set to be remembered for the respective comebacks of several veteran bowlers, IPL 2023 will also be known for spinners calling the shots on most occasions. Not a surprise by any means for a T20 competition being played in India, readers must note that four out of the Top Five bowlers with most wickets are spin bowlers. Furthermore, three of them are conventional right-arm leg-spinners.

Brumbies chairman Matthew Nobbs said the ACT Rugby board had taken the unanimous view that the club should not take a position on the matter and hoped RA would do the same. ‚ÄúIt was agreed unanimously by our board that we don‚Äôt think politics should play a part in sport and it‚Äôs an individual‚Äôs preference,‚Äù Nobbs said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way in the world that we would muzzle our players, they will be free to express themselves as they wish, but we do not believe it is the Brumbies‚Äô role to support a position.‚Äù Rugby, along with cricket and netball, is one of the last major professional and participation sports not to have voiced its support for the yes campaign ahead of a referendum on the matter that will be held later this year.

The Brumbies want to stay out of the debate on the Indigenous Voice to parliament. Credit: Getty The organisation has sent correspondence to its member unions asking them for feedback and sent the following statement to this masthead: ‚ÄúRA is committed to the reconciliation process. We are discussing the matter internally and remain in the process of engaging with our stakeholders, including our First Nations Committee.‚Äù A ring-around of the Super Rugby clubs on Monday found four of the five professional teams had not yet raised the issue with their playing groups, despite its prominence on the national agenda. Queensland Rugby could not be reached for comment. Further discussions with club officials and administrators, who did not want to comment publicly, indicated some supported making a statement in support of the Voice, while a minority - including the Brumbies - felt strongly about steering clear of the matter. The Rugby Union Players‚Äô Association did not return this masthead‚Äôs calls. Nobbs said the Brumbies board had discussed the matter twice and was firm in its opinion, but emphasised that wanting to stay neutral as an organisation was not the same as supporting the no campaign. ‚ÄúWe have an extremely strong association with Indigenous people. We run out in an Indigenous jumper once or twice a year, our training gear is closely aligned to indigenous themes and [winger] Andy Muirhead is a great role model for Indigenous players and the community,‚Äù he said.

Most of these guys will come in a KKR jersey next time. They are trying to give me a farewell, so thanks a lot to the crowd,‚Äù Dhoni said after the game. Dhoni and Co have received tremendous support away from home this season, with venues such as Mumbai‚Äôs Wankhede Stadium, Bengaluru‚Äôs M Chinnaswamy Stadium and Kolkata‚Äôs Eden Gardens bathed in yellow rather than blue, red and purple respectively, the colours of their respective home teams. The 2023 season was also the first time in four years that CSK were playing at their home ground of Chepauk.

According to an official release from the ICC, the recommendations, which were proposed by the Men‚Äôs Cricket Committee led by former India captain Sourav Ganguly and endorsed by the Women‚Äôs Cricket Committee, were formally ratified by the Chief Executives Committee on Monday. The new rules state that umpires will no longer have to give a soft signal while referring decisions to the TV umpire. Umpires were, until now, required to give a soft signal when it came referring catches that were difficult to judge on field; the TV umpire would then rule in favour of the soft signal if replays weren‚Äôt conclusive enough. ‚ÄúSoft signals have been discussed at previous cricket committee meetings over the last couple of years. The committee deliberated this at length and concluded that soft signals were unnecessary and at times confusing since referrals of catches may seem inconclusive in replays,‚Äù Ganguly was quoted as saying in the release. Besides doing away with the soft signal rule, the ICC also made the use of helmets mandatory for batters facing fast bowlers and for wicketkeepers when standing close to the stumps ‚Äî which also extended to other fielders standing close to the batter such as silly point and short leg. ‚ÄúWe also discussed player safety, which is very important for us. The committee decided that it was best to make the use of helmets mandatory in certain positions to ensure the safety of players,‚Äù added Ganguly, who until recently had served as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president. The third change introduced in the rule had to do with runs scored off a Free Hit, wherein ‚Äúany runs scored off a Free Hit when the ball hits the stumps will count as runs scored, to be consistent with all other runs scored from a free hit.‚Äù The release further stated that the changes would come into effect from 1 June on the opening day of the one-off Test between England and Ireland at Lord‚Äôs.
