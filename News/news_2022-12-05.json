You have $2 million to spend on your team – seven batters, seven bowlers and two wicketkeepers.SCBBL PROMOWHO TO TARGETWhen picking your batting line-up, it’s best to choose players who bat high up the order. The last thing you want is someone who comes in at six or seven and arrives at the crease with only an over or two left in the innings – or misses out altogether. Glenn Maxwell is usually fourth or fifth in line for the Melbourne Stars, and that’s probably the lowest down the order you want to go.Wicketkeeper is another position where you only want players who bat high up the order – keepers generally score more points with the bat than behind the stumps. Josh Phillipe usually opens for the Sixers and has some time at the crease, so he has a chance to score KFC SuperCoach points while batting and also by playing as a wicketkeeper. It’s all about increasing your odds! Harry Nielsen at the Strikers is another top BBL keeper, but he doesn’t usually bat until sixth or seventh and relies on catches for the bulk of his score.Your bowling attack should be made up of bowlers who are guaranteed to bowl at least three or four overs in an innings, so they qualify for the eco-rate bonus. All-rounders who bat as well as bowl, therefore giving them more than one opportunity to score, are players to target, as well as opening bowlers and death bowlers. Bowlers who get the new ball or the final overs in an innings usually have the best chance at getting wickets, and a good economy rate.The BBL is unpredictable and wickets can fall at any time during the 20 overs, but early in the innings batters are still getting used to the pitch conditions, and at the death they are open to taking more risks.WATCH THE FIXTUREYour players score points based on how they perform in BBL games, and if they play twice in a round, both scores are added together for that round. That makes selecting players with a double-game round a great way to maximise your scoring potential.In round 1 of KFC SuperCoach BBL the Stars, Strikers and Thunder all have a double game round. So the best starting tactic would be to focus on getting Strikers and Thunders players into your team. I would be careful selecting too many Stars players because, if you look ahead, they have the bye in round 2, and you don’t want to be stuck with too many.The key to KFC SuperCoach BBL is having as many double game round players as possible, to get the most amount of points on your field.Here are some Stars, Strikers and Thunder players to consider for your starting line-up:Adam Zampa (Stars) $103,600 BWLRashid Khan (Strikers) $193,600 BWLAlex Hales (Thunder) $130,300 BATCameron Boyce (Strikers) $171,400 BWLMatthew Short (Strikers) $197,500 BATTrent Boult (Stars) $180,000 BWLNathan Coulter-Nile (Stars) $103,200 BWLDaniel Sams (Thunder) $179,300 BAT-BWLJason Sangha (Thunder) $177,200 BATMORE: READ DAMO AND AZZA’S FULL EXPERT BBL FIXTURE GUIDETRADESYou have three trades each round in a use-it-or-lose-it set up (if you don’t use all three they aren’t saved for the next found). If you need a fourth trade you can activate a Trade Boost which can be used at any point throughout the rolling lockout. You have three trade boosts for the season, so use them wisely!Keeping an eye on the fixture and keeping in mind who has the bye or the double game round coming up is a highly recommended part of your trade calculations.Perth Scorchers aren’t playing round 1, but they have the double in round 2, so you could start with cheap Scorchers players like Josh Inglis or Laurie Evans, stashing them on your bench in preparation for the next round. But don’t leave too much money on the pine. You don’t want to handicap yourself unnecessarily.Here are five Perth Scorchers to consider stashing in preparation for round 2:Andrew Tye $156,700 BWLJosh Inglis $87,000 BAT-WKPJason Behrendorff $122,400 BWLJhye Richardson $149,500 BWLAaron Hardie $99,600 BAT/BWLCAPTAIN AND VICE-CAPTAINPicking your captain won’t be too difficult. Select a player with the double game round who has two chances to score and deliver a monster total to revel in. Selecting an all-rounder as captain is also highly recommended as they can pile on the points with the bat or ball – effectively giving you four shots at a big score in a double game round. Glenn Maxwell, Rashid Khan, Matthew Short, Alex Hales and David Willey all present as popular captaincy options.Picking a pure batsman as captain is a risk because if they get out cheaply they can score poorly, but it can pay off big time if you get it right and they smash a quick-fire 50.Here are some other premium scorers who can score well even without the double game week:Sean Abbott (Sixers) $205,400 BWLJosh Phillipe (Sixers) $168,300 BAT-WKPKane Richardson (Renegades) $189,200 BWLBen McDermott (Hurricanes) $211,800 BAT-WKPUsman Khawaja (Heat) $155,200 BATColin Munro (Heat) $150,900 BATMichael Neser (Heat) $107,900 BAT-BWLSUPERCOACH INTEL: EVERY BBL TEAM’S PREDICTED XINAILING THE BENCHIdeally, you have picked a team with players well entrenched in the XI at their BBL side, or players who are at least filling a void of significance, but you still don’t want to be caught out if someone is a late out or doesn’t make the final team on game day.Here are some cheapies to consider to help you finish your team who should play and increase in value – a key to making trades throughout the season:Tim David (Hurricanes) $89,700 BATChris Tremain (Hurricanes) $70,100 BWLDaniel Hughes (Sixers) $84,600 BATThomas Kelly (Strikers) $80,500 BATCameron Green (Scorchers)* $62,500 BAT-BWL* Green won’t be available until the latter half of the BBL season, but at his price you could start him on the bench and use him for the vice-captain loophole until he plays.You have until the start of the BBL season to make as many changes to your team as needed.

Rahul has sporadically kept wickets and batted in middle-order back in 2021 and in the first ODI against Bangladesh, he did don the big gloves apart from scoring 73 runs. This was after Rishabh Pant was rested from the ODI series on medical team’s advice. Rahul dropped an aerial catch of Player of the Match Mehidy Hasan Miraj, which could have ensured victory for India rather than the one-wicket defeat. “We haven’t played a lot of ODIs in last 8-9 months but if you look at 2020-21, I have kept wickets, and I have batted at Nos 4 and 5. This is the role that team has asked me to be ready for in white ball cricket as I have done it before,” Rahul curtly replied when asked about Pant’s absence. Rahul, who by virtue of being vice-captain, is a part of the team management, however didn’t clarify whether Pant was rested because of workload management or due to some niggle. “When it comes to Rishabh, I am not sure to be honest, just found today, that he is going to be released. What the reasons are, medical team will be in a better situation to answer those questions.” Rahul didn’t feel that either batters or bowlers should be held responsible for this defeat. “That’s cricket right. You have to expect the unexpected. As long as cricket has been played, these kind of things keep happening. They fought very well till the end and the couple of dropped catches and that innings from Mehidy.” He was personally satisfied after scoring runs on a tricky wicket. “One of those days where it looked like I was timing the ball better (than others). The shots I picked fortunately went to boundary, every option that I picked went my way,” he said. “Such innings gives you joy as a batter as you are challenged and you put your hand up when team requires. Ideally, we should have got 40 runs more. I did fancy 230-240 if I batted till end or even if I could have batted till 40th over.”","pubDate":"2022-12-04 19:38:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenorthlines","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 leagues popping up faster than weeds, programme headed for implosion: Ian Chappell","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/12/05/t20-leagues-popping-up-faster-than-weeds-programme-headed-for-implosion-ian-chappell/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi: With T20 leagues “popping up faster than weeds in summer”, international cricket’s ambitious but “implausible” future programme is headed for a breakdown of epic proportions, feels former Australia captain Ian Chappell.

Hastening the process could be the absence of a healthy partnership between the game’s administrators and international players, he wrote in his column for ‘ESPNcricinfo’. Recently, yesteryear stars such as Steve Waugh has expressed about cricket’s crammed schedule, saying the public “has almost overdosed” on the game and the interest levels are on the wane. Chappell, known for his sharp cricketing mind, feels, “The whole cricket structure, especially the schedule, is in need of a thorough but positive inquisition with the game’s future in view. “There is also the glaring matter of the lack of partnership between players and administrators. Surely it shouldn’t be – as it is currently – a matter of the administrators deciding the programme without any input from international players. “If the international programme evolved as a result of consideration from such a partnership, then it would be much more palatable than the abomination that is the current schedule. “T20 leagues are popping up faster than weeds in summer and an already implausible programme is headed for an almighty implosion.” Amid the proliferation of T20 league, players are now required to choose which to play and which to skip, depriving some leagues of star power and affecting their ability to remain financially viable in the long run. “T20 leagues now clash with each other and star players are signing longer-term contracts with expanding IPL clubs. These contradictions mean there will be a growing problem of how to produce greater numbers of marketable cricketers,” Chappell wrote. “In the current environment some leagues won’t be able to sign the limited number of star players available and this could eventually damage the ability to remain financially viable. “These are all matters that need urgent attention but the big one is to ensure the players have a voice in the game’s future.” Speaking of Test cricket, he said the traditional game would be better off if it is limited to countries that have a strong first-class structure and “culture of the format”, which teams such as Afghanistan and Ireland lack. “Test cricket is a tough but rewarding game and players deserve the opportunity to participate in the format if that is their choice. However, Tests are also steeped in culture and that requires the countries involved to have a strong first-class infrastructure,” Chappell wrote. “Not many teams have or can afford to build such infrastructure, as it costs money rather than bringing a return on investment. T20 leagues, which produce a healthy return, are much more acceptable to administrators.” The former player added, “Consequently, it makes no sense to reward Afghanistan and Ireland, two recent recipients of Test status, neither of whom have the grounds or the infrastructure to reasonably expect that status. “Sadly, Test status is best confined to the eight nations who have had a long-standing culture of the format.” According to him, teams like Afghanistan and Ireland could have gained from playing a second-tier competition before entering the Test arena. “If there is still a desire to spread Test cricket’s reach, some thought could be given to eventually including combination teams composed of interested players who represent non-Test status teams. “Teams should still have to fulfil infrastructure and financial requirements to qualify for Test status. This would require a second-tier competition, where teams that perform well could state their case for Test status qualification.” Chappell lauded England captain Ben Stokes for the manner in which he not only “markedly lift his team’s performance but also raise the profile of Test cricket”. “Stokes has decreed that England players bat freely, but he also has fans anticipating something akin to a T20 run rate in the five-day format. This massive change of approach has come at a time when Test cricket, like the 50-over game, is suffering at the hands of the junior format. “Despite Stokes’ highly commendable approach, the game still requires answers to some difficult queries. “There are two big questions that appear to be overlooked by those in charge: How many teams should be playing Tests? And why aren’t administrators working with the players in a partnership to ensure the future of the game?” —PTI T20 leagues popping up faster than weeds, programme headed for implosion: Ian Chappell added by Press Trust of India on 12:41 am December 5, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-04 19:11:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Toothless Tiger: One thing missing in Aussie bowling attack","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-vs-west-indies-aussies-near-perfect-but-still-lack-killer-edge/news-story/0dd94ff9055841fd9effc0437e7f2fee","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"There are not many ways you could improve Australia’s magnificent bowling attack but there is one - by finding cricket’s version of the sabre-toothed tiger.","content":"You know … the nasty fastie whose very presence creates dressing room pandemonium with batsmen suffering sweaty palms and heart rates ticking over like the sound of someone knocking at your front door.Like Mitchell Johnson in 2013 when he had England in such a trembling state that Jonathan Trott flew home after the first Test and Kevin Pietersen later wrote that he was sitting in the Brisbane dressing room thinking “I could die today at the f------- Gabbatoir.’’ Australia is blessed to have an attack which has four bowlers (Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon) who have taken 200-plus Test wickets.They keep their collective nerve exceptionally well, hunt as a pack and normally get their prey.With the likes of Cameron Green and Travis Head they will ensure the same person does not have to be a hero each game and that Australia wins most matches they play.With Cummins injured and the wicket flat you can understand why it took Australia 111 overs to winkle out the admirable West Indies in the second innings in Perth.But as the West Indies resistance proceeded from one hour to the next it was clear that while the Windies had a great respect for the Australian attack the fear factor was not off the charts.Australia was not getting wickets with the force of their collective aura as they have against so many touring teams in the past when one wicket could mean four quick ones.Three decades ago Ian Healy faced a mighty West Indian side in Perth (admittedly at the old WACA ground) and wrote “feared for life’’ in his diary.It is a vibe that occasionally surfaced in recent decades when Brett Lee was bowling or when the Pakistani enigma Shoaib Akhtar was pushing the speedometer towards 160kph. You would see batsmen lose their nerve and often get out to a less threatening bowler at the other end. Teams have the greatest regard for this Australian attack but batsmen such as West Indian skipper Kraigg Brathwaite, Sri Lanka’s Dinesh Chandimal and Pakistan’s Babar Azam have done well at times this year to play the ball and not the reputation.India and England will have noted the West Indian resistance against Australia in Perth and be mildly encouraged by it.The blueprint for potential Australian victories in India and England is what happened on last summer’s tour of Pakistan when Australia learnt the most underestimated quality of professional sporting success … patience.After two draws Australia snatched victory on the last day of the last Test which was a spectacular reward for riding the rhythms of the first two matches without falling out the back door.There’s been eras when Australian pace attacks complimented by the spin brilliance of Shane Warne, would storm through matches for spectacular three day victories.The next year may be different for Australia may be forced to play the longer game, especially away from home, one which they are well equipped to do so.Cricket: Nathan Lyon was the star for Australia in closing out the first test against the West Indies in Perth.HEROIC HEAD PUTS ALL DOUBT TO BED—Ben HorneAfter drifting for several years as Australian cricket’s floating talent, there is a very specific task looming for Travis Head.The star batsman had a deceptively big Test match in Perth, not only for his impressive – yet heartbreaking 99 – but particularly for the two key wickets he picked up on the final day hunt for victory.Head’s 2-25 heroics with the ball were crucial contributions for a tiring and depleted Australian attack and came off the back of his 4-10 miracle against Sri Lanka earlier this year.Glenn Maxwell’s fractured leg has come as a blow to Australia’s plans for February’s Test tour of India, particularly because there were lingering doubts over Head’s batting in the subcontinent.But if selectors were hesitating even slightly on Head, his performance in Perth may have extinguished those question marks with the South Australian proving he may have turned into every bit the wicket-taking x-factor Maxwell is.Head revealed he has been working closely with Australian assistant Daniel Vettori, one of the greatest left-arm spinners in modern Test history, and reaped the benefits in a brilliant eight-over cameo against the Windies in Perth.“It’s nice. It’s the first time I’ve bowled this summer. I’ve bowled with Whiz (Vettori) a little bit the last couple of weeks but haven’t bowled much for SACAS this year so it’s nice to contribute,” said Head on Fox Cricket.Captain Pat Cummins admits he is now having to rethink his bowling plans and whether Head becomes a more regular attacking weapon.“He’s always been probably underused to be honest in that even when he first started playing ODI cricket, he was almost the fifth bowler and bowled a lot of overs,” said Cummins.“It’s probably reaffirmed to me that maybe I should bowl him a bit more. He’s off spin, so I think you kind of think whenever he’s bowling maybe sometimes he’s taking some of Nath’s overs, but he just brings something slightly different. I’m really impressed.”West Indian lower order hitter Alzarri Joseph was becoming more than a nuisance bombing boundaries off Nathan Lyon midway through the second session on day five, before captain Pat Cummins enacted a brilliant tactical change to bring back Head.Wicketkeeper Alex Carey couldn’t get a glove to a chance off the first ball of the over, before Head roared in second ball and cannoned through Joseph’s stumps.Earlier in the day, Head took the edge of Jason Holder, with Steve Smith taking a superbly athletic diving catch to his left at first-slip from an edge that was travelling and extremely fine.Adam Gilchrist declared Head had proven himself more than handy as a bowling go-to-man.“Terrific from Travis Head. He’s more than a part-timer. His shape was perfect,” Gilchrist said on Fox.Spin genius Kerry O’Keeffe said he had also noticed the improvement in Head’s work over the past 12 months.“He’s a much better off-spinner than he once was. He’s got better,” said O’Keeffe on Fox.","pubDate":"2022-12-04 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England vs Senegal LIVE SCORE: Gareth Southgate's men aim to book FIFA World Cup quarter-final spot","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/fifa-world-cup-2022-live-score-england-vs-senegal-football-match-latest-updates-11750061.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"England vs Senegal LIVE SCORE: Gareth Southgate's men aim to book FIFA World Cup quarter-final spot","content":"England vs Senegal LIVE SCORE: Gareth Southgate's men aim to book FIFA World Cup quarter-final spot England vs Senegal FIFA World Cup 2022 LIVE: Hello and welcome to our LIVE coverage of the FIFA World Cup 2022 Round of 16 match between England and Senegal.

Dec 04, 2022 - 23:24 (IST) Hello and welcome to our LIVE coverage of the FIFA World Cup 2022 Round of 16 match between England and Senegal. Defending champions France await the winner of this contest in one of the quarter-finals next week, with Les Bleus having beaten Poland in the previous match 3-1 to advance to the last eight. Stay tuned for more updates. Preview: Gareth Southgate-coached England on Sunday meet African champions Senegal in what will be a very interesting Round of 16 clash of the FIFA World Cup at the Al Bayt Stadium. The winners of this contest will play defending champions France in the quarter-finals. France defeated Poland 3-1 in an earlier pre-quarterfinal clash on Sunday, with Kylian Mbappe netting twice for Les Bleus. No other team picked up more than the seven points England recorded on its way to the knockout round and it is only one of three still undefeated. Yet the message from coach Gareth Southgate and captain Harry Kane this week has been about maintaining focus and standards. Belgium and Germany were high-profile departures from the group stage, while defending champion France, along with Argentina, Spain, Brazil and Portugal, have all been on the wrong end of upsets. And to think England’s 0-0 draw with the United States was considered enough of a shock that it prompted loud jeers from the fans. “I think it’s always difficult when you see big teams or big players in teams that don’t have the success that you want or don’t live up to the expectation of a nation or where they see themselves,” England defender John Stones said. “We don’t ever want to fall into that category. I think that is great motivation for us as a reminder — you never want to take anything for granted or who you are playing against.” England may be considered a major soccer nation, but its only tournament success came when it hosted and won the World Cup in 1966. The years since have been pitted with disappointment and underachievement. There has been an upturn under Southgate, who led the team to the semifinals of the World Cup in Russia in 2018 and to the final of last year’s European Championship, losing to Italy on penalties. The bond he has developed among the players is seen as a key factor in England’s improvement. Southgate is also meticulous about his planning, from psychological help to deal with the pressure of taking penalties to even the most minor details. At a team meeting this week, players were reminded about leaving their socks out the “right way” for the equipment manager to collect after training. “We get on each other for things like that because we have created those standards,” Stones said. “If you start getting sloppy with the little things, the bigger things start to get sloppy very easily. Any 1% or 2% of things that we can do to get better … obviously those are small things, but they matter to us.” So there should be no danger of England taking Senegal lightly. The African Cup of Nations champions finished second in Group A behind the Netherlands. That was despite the pre-tournament disappointment of losing striker Sadio Mane because of an injury. Senegal coach Aliou Cisse was unable to attend a news conference Saturday because of illness and also missed team training on Friday. But he is planning to be at the match on Sunday at Al Bayt Stadium.

FirstCricket Staff December 4th, 2022 22:35:56 IST Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mustafizur Rahman's valiant rearguard effort helped Bangladesh pip India in a low-scoring thriller and gain a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series. AP India and Bangladesh have produced a number of classics over the years, thanks primarily to the latter’s improvement as a side especially in the white-ball formats. From the one-sided matches in the 2000s, the Bangladeshis have come a long way and more often than not, ensure the Men in Blue are made to earn their victory. The first game of the three-match ODI series between the two sides that took place in Dhaka on Sunday was without a doubt the latest addition in the series of nerve-wracking encounters between the South Asian neighbours. And given the manner in which they fought back from a near-hopeless situation to collect a one-wicket win at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium, the Bangla Tigers could very well lay claim to this being one of their greatest victories of all time — right up there with their victory over Kenya in the ICC Trophy final in 1997 or against the Rahul Dravid-led India in the World Cup 10 years later. Not only did the win help Bangladesh go 1-0 up in the three-match series, it also reasserted their credentials as a team that can go the distance in the ODI World Cup that takes place in India next year where the conditions will not be too different from what the Tigers are used to in their own backyard. The Indians, meanwhile, continue with grapple with issues within their ranks that have plagued them since the T20 World Cup, where they suffered a humiliating exit with a 10-wicket loss at the hands of eventual champions England. Looking back at the events of the first one-dayer, we bring to you five talking points: Rahul shines with bat, not so much with gloves The game witnessed the return of the Rohit Sharma-Shikhar Dhawan opening combination, as a result of which KL Rahul moved down the order to the No 5 slot, between Shreyas Iyer and Washington Sundar. And while the India vice-captain wasn’t quite having the best of run at the top alongside Rohit in recent games, he showcased his skill as a middle-order bat with a 70-ball 73 against the Bangla Tigers on Sunday, scoring nearly half the runs that the visitors could muster in the opening game. Rahul also had to don the wicketkeeping gloves with the Indians releasing Rishabh Pant from the squad. And though the Lucknow Super Giants captain did well to collect a catch off Sundar’s bowling to get the key wicket of Litton Das, his dropping a sitter later in the game would prove decisive. Shakib continues to deliver Shakib Al Hasan remains a star performer and integral to Bangladesh’s cricketing fortunes at the age of 35. And on Sunday, he played a key role in setting up the victory for Bangladesh, breaking the backbone of the Indian batting order with a display of 5/36 that restricted the Men in Blue to a sub-par 186. Shakib removed skipper Rohit just when he was starting to get into his element, and the all-rounder accounted for Kohli’s wicket two balls later, with skipper Litton Das plucking an outstanding catch mid-air. Shakib was well supported by seamer Ebadot Hossain and the two accounted for nine of the 10 Indian wickets that fell, ensuring none other than Rahul could settle at the crease and take the side to a competitive total. Litton continuing from where he left off Top-order bat Litton Das has been handed the extra responsibility of leading the side in the absence of regular skipper and senior batter Tamim Iqbal, who has been ruled out of the series with injury. The burden of leadership though, doesn’t appear to have had any impact on his batting as Das got the Tigers off to a confident start in their chase of the 187-run target. Das, who also dabbles as a wicketkeeper from time to time, scored a patient 41 to rescue his side after they lost the wicket of Najmul Hossain Shanto off the very first delivery of the chase. It’s almost as if Litton’s taking a liking to India — he had smashed a 27-ball 60 against Rohit and Co that could’ve helped Bangladesh win a high-scoring game against India in the recent T20 World Cup had rain not interfered. Siraj makes up for Shami’s absence Mohammed Shami’s absence from the one-dayers due to a shoulder injury created a vacuum of sorts in the Indian bowling lineup, a void that appeared to have been filled by Mohammed Siraj on Sunday with his stellar performance of 3/32 in 10 overs. Siraj took the key wicket of Mushfiqur Rahim, the veteran wicketkeeper-batter who has won many a game on his own, right after Kuldeep Sen removed Mahmudullah. The back-to-back dismissals would trigger a batting collapse as Bangladesh would crumble from 128/4 to 136/9, leaving the Tigers staring at another heartbreak at India’s hands. Tigers’ never-say-die attitude The Indians perhaps would’ve assumed the game to be done and dusted by the time Siraj trapped Hasan Mahmud LBW to leave the Bangladeshis reeling on 136/9, needing another 51 runs to win with just one wicket at their disposal. All-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz, who has a Test century to his credit and is more than capable a batter besides his primary role of an off-spinner, was in no mood to give up just yet. All that he needed was support from the other end from No 11 bat Mustafizur Rahman. The two would then go on to produce one of the most memorable counterattacks in the game, with Mehidy playing the aggressor and Mustafizur protecting his wicket at all costs and ensuring the rotation of strike over after over. Mehidy’s collected four fours and two sixes during his unbeaten 38 off 39 deliveries and knock that would take Indians completely by surprise and helped the Sher-e-Bangla crowd rediscover their voice. In the end, it was only fitting that Miraz got to score the winning run. Read all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.

After this defeat, Indian team captain Rohit Sharma shared the reason for it. The Indian cricket team is touring Bangladesh in the ODI and Test cricket series. It is noteworthy that both the teams are currently playing in ODI cricket series. India scored 186 runs in the first ODI of this series. Bangladesh won by scoring 187 runs for the loss of 9 wickets at the end of 46 overs. “186 runs is not enough runs. But we bowled well. With that we took wickets at the right time. I think we should have scored 25 to 30 more runs. We didn’t bat well in today’s match. We are used to playing on these types of pitches. So no excuse can be made for this. We are looking forward to the next match,” said Rohit. One captain per series and one playing eleven for each match can only achieve such results. Fans are slamming the Indian team on social media for a stable team. It is noteworthy that KL Rahul, who acted as the wicket keeper in this match, dropped a catch in the 43rd over.","pubDate":"2022-12-04 16:37:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"\"We Need To Think About How To Bat Against...\": Rohit Sharma On Defeat Against Bangladesh In 1st ODI.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9iYW5nbGFkZXNoLXZzLWluZGlhLTIwMjItMjMvd2UtbmVlZC10by1sb29rLWF0LWhvdy10by1iYXQtYWdhaW5zdC1zcGlubmVycy1pbi10aGVzZS1jb25kaXRpb25zLXJvaGl0LTM1Nzc0NTLSAYoBaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC12cy1pbmRpYS0yMDIyLTIzL3dlLW5lZWQtdG8tbG9vay1hdC1ob3ctdG8tYmF0LWFnYWluc3Qtc3Bpbm5lcnMtaW4tdGhlc2UtY29uZGl0aW9ucy1yb2hpdC0zNTc3NDUyL2FtcC8x?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"\"We Need To Think About How To Bat Against...\": Rohit Sharma On Defeat Against Bangladesh In 1st ODI..  NDTV SportsHighlights IND Vs BAN 1st ODI, Dhaka: Mehidy Hasan's Heroics Lead Bangladesh To 1 Wicket Victory  Cricket Country NewsMohammad Siraj imitates Cristiano Ronaldo 'peace' celebration after taking Hasan Mahmud wicket, pic goes viral  DNA IndiaAfter KL Rahul And Washington Sundar's Fielding Lapses, Rohit Sharma Loses Cool.

FirstCricket Staff December 4th, 2022 20:55:27 IST Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan gestures during the first one day international cricket match between Bangladesh and India in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Sunday, Dec.4, 2022. (AP Photo Surjeet Yadav) Shakib Al Hasan and Mehidy Hasan Miraz helped Bangladesh script a sensational one-wicket win over India in the first ODI in Mirpur on Sunday, with the hosts thereby taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series. Bangladesh won the toss and opted to field in the first match of an ODI series that acts as a preparation for the 2023 ODI World Cup to be hosted by India. India kept losing wickets at regular intervals, and none of the Indian batters, barring KL Rahul (73) managed to convert starts to bog knocks. Shikhar Dhawan (7) was the first to depart in the sixth over, followed by skipper Rohit Sharma (27) in the 11 th , and Virat Kohli (9) too failed to make an impact being dismissed by Shakib, just two balls after the Bangladesh all-rounder had seen off Rohit. Shakib finished with figures of 5/36 as India were restricted to 186. In reply, Bangladesh lost Najmul Hossain and Anamul Haque inside the first 10 overs, but Shakib Al Hasan and Liton Das took them back on track with a 48-run stand for the third wicket. Following Liton’s dismissal, Bangladesh kept losing wickets at regular intervals, and were even restricted to 136/9 in the 40 th over. At that time, things seemed to go India’s way, but Mehidy Hasan played a gritty 39-ball knock of 38 to take the hosts over the finish line, with a wicket and four overs to spare. Let’s now take a look at some interesting stats from the match: The unbeaten 51-run stand between Mehidy Hasan and Mustafizur Rahman was the fourth-highest 10 th wicket stand in a successful ODI run-chase. Deryck Murray and Sir Andy Roberts of West Indies holds that record, having forged 64 runs for the final wicket during a World Cup clash against Pakistan in 1975. Rohit Sharma surpassed Mohammed Azharuddin to become India’s sixth highest run-getter in ODIs. Having scored just 27 runs, Rohit now has 9403 runs in the format, while Azharuddin finished his ODI career with 9378 runs. The defeat to Bangladesh on Sunday was India’s 435 th loss in ODI cricket, a world record. Only Sri Lanka have lost the same amount of matches in ODI cricket. Shakib Al Hasan broke Wasim Akram’s record of most ODI wickets in a calendar year. Wasim Akram had 45 scalps in a calendar year, whereas Shakib now has 46 wickets this year in ODIs.

FirstCricket Staff December 4th, 2022 20:29:16 IST Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mustafizur Rahman stitched an unbroken 51-run stand for the 10th wicket to guide Bangladesh to a dramatic one-wicket win over India. AP Bangladesh’s never-say-die attitude was on full display on Sunday as they fought back from a near-hopeless situation to defeat India in a low-scoring thriller and gain the lead in the three-match ODI series. The Tigers got off to a confident start after bowling their neighbours out for 186, but a middle-order batting collapse left them staring at defeat after they were reduced to 136/9 in the 40th over. The final-wicket pair of Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mustafizur Rahman however, refused to give up, and produced the fightback of a lifetime, stitching an unbroken 51-run that to script one of Bangladesh’s greatest victories in cricket . The hosts went 1-0 up in the three match series as a result, and will now fancy their chances of sealing the series with a game to spare when they lock horns again on Wednesday. The victory did set Cricket Twitter alight, leading to several emotional posts from the Bangladeshi side and a mix of admiration for their opponents and bewilderment for the Men in Blue from the Indians.

The defending champions had a somewhat smooth sail into the knockout stages by defeating Australia and Denmark early on in Group D. A minor blip did occur for the French team when their second-string starting XI lost to African minnows Tunisia. Poland, on the other hand, are pinning their hopes on their star striker Robert Lewandowski. Read the complete match preview below. France vs Poland preview: France, the reigning World Cup champions, have been warned by coach Didier Deschamps not to underestimate Poland and star Robert Lewandowski in the knockout round on Sunday. FIFA World Cup: Fixtures | Results | Points Table | Squads | Records Les Blues breezed through the group stage and clinched a spot in the round of 16 with a game to spare, which allowed Deschamps to rest his stars in France’s meaningless final first round game. Nine substitutes started in the 1-0 loss to Tunisia, and Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbappe, Ousmane Dembele and Antonie Griezmann all came off the bench late in the game. France, with fresh legs, are the overwhelming favorite to beat Poland and are the first defending World Cup champion to reach the round of 16 since Brazil in 2006. France are 5-0 in the first knockout round since the stage was introduced to the World Cup in 1986. Four years earlier, Poland tied its World Cup-best third-place finish with a 3-2 victory over … France. But Poland, which is in the knockout round for the first time in 36 years, has not beaten France since a win in a friendly 51 days after that victory. Poland has three losses and four draws in the seven meetings since, the last match in 2011.

AFP Former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Irfan lashed out at BCCI and PCB over the stir created following Asian Cricket Council president Jay Shah’s statement that Pakistan won’t be hosting the 2023 Asia Cup and the tournament will be played at a neutral venue. The remark by Shah, who is also BCCI secretary, made in October, led to a statement from PCB president Ramiz Raja, who said Pakistan won’t inform beforehand of the decision and threatened to pull out of the 2023 World Cup in India. Later the PCB chief added that they have no issue if India dont play Asia Cup but they will certainly pull out the tournament if ACC shifts the tournament. Irfan, who played 64 international games for Pakistan, urged not to go by such statements while adding that both countries should play in each other’s backyards. “Pakistan should go to India and India should come to Pakistan to play,” Irfan told ANI. “It increases love between people from both countries. Cricket should be separate from politics. Don’t go by statements that Pakistan won’t come to India, let the Board decide it.” Earlier on Friday, Raza said it’s their right to host the Asia Cup. “It’s not as if we don’t have hosting rights and we’re pleading to host it,” Ramiz had said on the sidelines of the ongoing Pakistan-England Test in Rawalpindi on Friday. “We won the rights fair and square. If India doesn’t come, they won’t come. If the Asia Cup gets taken away from Pakistan, maybe we’re the ones that pull out.” “We’ve shown we can host great teams,” Ramiz said. “I can understand issues relating to bilateral cricket, but the Asia Cup is a multi-nation tournament, almost as big as the World Cup for the Asian bloc. “Why give it to us in the first place and then make all those statements about India not travelling to Pakistan? I accept that India won’t come because the government won’t allow them to come – fine. But to take the Asia Cup away from the host on that basis isn’t right.” Read all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.

West Indies, who have been on the back foot for the major part of this Test match, now need 306 runs on the final day to win the match with seven wickets in hand. They were 192/3 off 62 overs at stumps on Day 4 with Kraigg Brathwaite (101) and Kyle Mayers (0) not out at the crease. Beginning the day, Marnus Labuschagne continued to hurt the West Indies. While David Warner (48) failed to score big, Labuschagne took on the West Indies attack and hit a flurry of boundaries to bring his century in quick time just before the lunch break. Australia declared their second innings at 182/2 off 37 overs at lunch with Labuschagne (104 not out) and Steven Smith (20) at the crease. With his ton, Labuschagne became just the third Australia batter after Greg Chappell and Doug Walters to score a double century and century in the same Test. Chasing a huge target of 498 to win, the West Indies made an excellent start with the bat. Tagenarine Chanderpaul showed plenty of composure and Brathwaite was at his best as well at the other end and they together frustrated the Australian attack. Australia introduced Nathan Lyon quite early to find a breakthrough but it wasn't his day either. Both Windies batters were well in control but the run rate was just hovering around 2. However, things slowly changed post-tea. Mitchell Starc finally clean-bowled Chanderpaul for 45 and Lyon got rid of Shamarh Brooks (11). At the other end, Brathwaite though looked unperturbed and went on a boundary spree at one point in time that boosted his strike rate. Eventually, he reached his top-class hundred but the visitors were jolted immediately in the same over when Jermaine Blackwood (24) was dismissed by Lyon. A score of 497 is usually defended for most of the time in Test cricket but with Brathwaite bringing the equation down to 306, one wicketless session might change the course of the contest on Day 5. Brief scores: Australia 598/4d & 182/2d in 37 overs (Marnus Labuschagne 104 not out; Kemar Roach 1-30) lead West Indies 283 & 192/3 in 62 overs (Kraigg Brathwaite 101 not out; Nathan Lyon 2-54) by 306 runs.

As Paramount, the parent company of Ten, continues to lead the bidding for Cricket Australia’s (CA) next broadcast deal, Foxtel could be forced to work with its former rival if it wishes to keep cricket in its summer suite for viewers. A meeting between Foxtel and Paramount executives last month generated fresh talk that the pay-TV company is considering an alternate reality to working with the cricket’s incumbent free-to-air television partner, Seven. Foxtel is weighing up options for a world without its free-to-air broadcast partner Seven. Credit: AP Foxtel was CA’s domestic rights holder when the BBL launched in 2011, and played a pivotal role in growing the profile of the tournament before the governing body sold the rights to Ten for around $20 million per season in 2013. That was then spun off into a huge rights uplift with Seven and Foxtel in 2018. While it is ultimately up to CA to decide on which company it partners with, Foxtel (and its streaming service Kayo Sports) face the risk of losing all broadcast rights unless they can convince an alternative free-to-air network that there is a benefit to sharing some matches. Nine Entertainment Co, the owner of this masthead, and Network Ten have both submitted bids for the rights for all the content being offered by Cricket Australia and do not need to work with Foxtel, given they own their own paywalled products - Stan and Paramount. Loading Seven is the only free-to-air network without a streaming service and has allowed Foxtel to complement its offering in previous deals. Seven, which is suing Cricket Australia for an alleged failure to deliver quality Big Bash League matches , has bid to retain its coverage of Test cricket but is already looking elsewhere. Seven boss James Warburton confirmed reports from this masthead last week, when he publicly announced he was actively engaging lower-tier sports as an alternative to summer cricket. And after two rounds of formal bidding, Paramount is near the front of the queue on a dollar basis. That leaves Foxtel in a tricky position. If Paramount ends up securing exclusivity on all rights, it leaves Foxtel - a long-term partner of the cricket - without a tier one summer sport.","pubDate":"2022-12-04 13:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Core has to play every single game': Sunil Gavaskar slams frequent breaks taken by senior Indian players","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/core-has-to-play-every-single-game-sunil-gavaskar-slams-frequent-breaks-taken-by-senior-indian-players-11749171.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"'Core has to play every single game': Sunil Gavaskar slams frequent breaks taken by senior Indian players","content":"Cricket 'Core has to play every single game': Sunil Gavaskar slams frequent breaks taken by senior Indian players Batting legend Gavaskar called for the core of the Indian team to play as many matches as possible in the build-up to the 2023 ODI World Cup at home. FirstCricket Staff December 4th, 2022 18:20:44 IST File image of Sunil Gavaskar. Sportzpics Sunil Gavaskar has come down heavily on the culture of taking frequent breaks from international duty, a trend that has become a fairly common occurrence in Indian cricket in recent years. A number of first-team players have opted to get their workloads managed in recent months with the cricketing calendars more cramped than ever, resulting in the BCCI selectors opting to rest senior players for certain tournaments from time to time. The likes of skipper Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul had been rested for India’s tour of New Zealand that took place right after the T20 World Cup, with Hardik Pandya and Shikhar Dhawan taking over captaincy duties for the T20Is and ODIs respectively. Batting icon Gavaskar, however called for the core of the Indian team to get as much game time as possible in the build-up to the ODI World Cup that India will host in the months of October and November next year. “I hope there is not too much chopping and changing. I also hope there is not too much of giving a break now. Then the combination takes a long time to gel when you come into the World Cup. And then in World Cup, there is no matches where you can afford to lose. “So it is very important that the core plays all matches. Yes there will be an odd player coming in somewhere when you need an extra bowler or a batter. But the core has to play every single one-day game. No rest. You are playing for India. No rest. You want to win the World Cup. And for that, you need that combination to be absolutely gelling every single game,” Gavaskar was quoted as saying. Following the New Zealand tour, which featured a number of reserve players and witnessed pacer Umran Malik make his ODI debut, the Indian team has travelled to Bangladesh where they are currently playing the first of three one-day internationals and will later face the Bangla Tigers in two Tests. While senior players Rohit, Kohli and Rahul are back in the side, with vice-captain Rahul donning the wicketkeeping gloves, the Men in Blue are without Mohammed Shami, who was ruled out in the build-up to the first ODI with a shoulder injury.

These are players who can be match-winners.\" Asked about how to counter the big-hitting batters, Ahmed said, “Wickets, that’s the key in a format like T10. Tabraiz Shamsi and Zahir Khan are examples. A few good deliveries will add pressure and keep you in the game and then you can get wickets. Basically, the player’s role needs to be very clear.\" Ahmed, who feels that T10 is the toughest format due to the lack of time, said “In T10 there is no time, and you can’t slow down at all.\" Would the dynamic Indian batter Virat Kohli do well in T10, a player who is technically correct, or does the format need more players who can improvise on the go? Ahmed explained, “Both types of players can succeed in T10 cricket. An example is Moeen Ali, who plays good cricketing shots. The roles should be clear. Nicholas Pooran hit a flurry of boundaries and then brought the momentum back. The most important thing is to have a clear idea of who has to do what.\" “This is a game of temperament. You’ve got to see as a coach who has the best temperament. Sometimes you need someone to bide their time, while sometimes you need players like Andre Russell, who can go and express themselves.\" Speaking about tackling the most dangerous bowlers like Rashid Khan, the Deccan Gladiators’ coach said, “Don’t play the bowler, in T10 or T20 cricket, you have to play the ball on the merit and not the bowler. You’re not playing Rashid, you’re facing the ball.

Root batted left-handed for a few overs after reaching his half-century against spinner Zahid Mahmood in the 23 rd over. Interestingly, he was dropped on the first ball he faced as a left-hander. Root tried to sweep Mahmood but the ball went straight to mid-wicket. Albeit, Naseem couldn’t take the catch as the ball brushed his fingers and left him. The ploy to bat as a left-hander was to counter the right-arm spinner bowling from round the wicket angle. Root, although, did not continue the antic for long and returned to bat right-handed again. Root scored 73 runs from 69 deliveries that included six boundaries.

In fact, South Africa spinner Tabraiz Shamsi too joined the discussion joking, “I can’t play the sweep shot even while batting right-handed, and here’s Joe Root casually playing it perfectly batting left-handed in a Test match!” I cant play the sweep shot even while batting right handed and here’s Joe Root casually playing it perfectly batting left handed… IN A TEST MATCH!
