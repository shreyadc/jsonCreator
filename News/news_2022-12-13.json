Now Captain Fantastic has doubled that tally in just two weeks, proof positive, if it was required, that something special is stirring in England’s red-ball team. Their second victory, by 26 runs in Multan, was closer in terms of defeat than the first – whose drama was heightened only because England nearly ran out of time – but it still came with a day and a session remaining. So quickly does this England team score that time appears added to the game, leaving nowhere to hide. For many a win is a win, though there will be those who say England ought to have beaten a weakened Pakistan team more decisively. But close-run games require character and this team appears to have it in abundance, winning just about every big moment during this and the previous match. The England team also has a captain, Stokes, who not only holds his nerve, but looks calm and in control, at least on the field. Whether he manages that because he and head coach, Brendon McCullum, have taken the shame out of losing, is not clear. But when the team is under pressure – as England were when Pakistan needed 65 runs to win with five wickets remaining just before lunch on day four – having a leader who exudes confidence helps to inspire players and Mark Wood was duly roused. Not that it takes much to motivate Wood, a fast bowler who has endured a stop-start career due to a slew of injuries. He only has one setting, maximum effort, which mostly proves highly effective, though I believe he would be an even better bowler had he managed to play even half the 70 Tests he missed through injury. Express pace is a formidable weapon even on docile pitches. Suddenly, from being in control, Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Nawaz, who had added 80 runs, looked shaky as Wood banged in short to mess with their minds and footwork. Getting both batsmen caught by the keeper down the leg-side is not a plan even ‘Bazball’ would claim credit for, but by fiddling with the leg-side field, Stokes put the batsmen in two minds as to which shot might be their best option against Wood’s raw aggression. As it turned out, the fend off the ribcage and the flap was not it and a diving Ollie Pope took two catches, the second one controversial after the third umpire, Joel Wilson, decided the ball had not been grounded when DRS replays appeared to show otherwise. Some blamed the ‘soft signal’ of ‘out’ given by on-field umpire Aleem Dar for the failure of Wilson not to overturn the decision against the left-handed Shakeel, who had made a fine 94. As I understand it the soft signal is only given in the event of the technology failing, not as a guide to the third umpire, who must judge matters solely from the evidence presented to him. Whether that was Wilson’s understanding only he knows, but he upheld Dar’s soft signal. Under Stokes and McCullum the England team’s mission is to make Test cricket more exciting and watchable, one they have undertaken with the unquestioning fervour of zealots. But winning also matters and there was more pragmatism shown towards that goal, especially in England’s second innings when both Stokes and Harry Brook reined in excess to build a telling stand of 101. At that point England could have put the match beyond Pakistan but the loss of their last five wickets for 25 runs gave the home side a chance to level the series. It seemed unnecessarily careless of the visitors but maybe, as in Rawalpindi, Stokes felt that dangling the carrot to Pakistan represented England’s best chance of winning even with two-and-a-half days remaining. A clean sweep now beckons for Stokes and his team when they reach Karachi for Saturday’s final Test, something no visiting team has ever achieved in Pakistan – not in a three-match series. But do they pay heed to the glory another win would bring, or do they rest tired bowlers and thrust others into the fray such as 18-year old wrist-spinner Rehan Ahmed? Spin appears to be a weak point in this England side though it may surprise some to learn that Jack Leach’s Test record is better than that of both Phil Tufnell and Ashley Giles, and about the same as Monty Panesar’s, at least for average runs per wicket taken. In Multan, Pakistan gave a debut to their mystery spinner, Abrar Ahmed, and were rewarded with 11 wickets, though whether England will do the same with Rehan, who has played just three first-class games and could potentially leak runs, remains to be seen. Wilton Sampaio - the ref for England vs France - could be given World Cup final Thomas Tuchel makes decision over England job if Gareth Southgate steps down Arsenal decide £40m transfer priority after Gabriel Jesus injury For those lauding the simplicity and clarity of ‘Bazball’ and its attacking intent, this control versus wickets debate will seem ponderous and irrelevant. Yet as Stokes acknowledged after England’s latest win, it was the pace bowlers who won the Test and they did that largely through the iron fist of control with the odd magic ball thrown in. Which shows that even the best constitutions can be tweaked to suit the moment.

They said they don’t want me feeling unsafe. And as I said, the same goes for the other families as well. The priority is that everyone feels safe,” she said.“I don’t want it to get to a point where we can’t go to a game anymore.“I’m saddened and disappointed that it has got to this and most people are generally very respectful.“It’s nice to know that if need be, there’s someone there to look after us.”Watch Australia v South Africa. Every test match live and ad-break in play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >The offer from Cricket Australia came soon after Candice, the wife of David Warner, appeared on Triple M radio with a disturbing story from her time at the Adelaide Oval.She told co-hosts Harley Breen and Tom Tilly on Triple M’s Summer Breakfast that she’s starting to feel cricket is an “unsafe place” after an experience that left her rattled.“Saturday afternoon at Adelaide Oval, just before the lunch break, the girls wanted to see their dad,” Candice said. “So we went from one area of Adelaide Oval to the other. It was probably about 200m.“In that time, I had two of my three daughters, my eight-year-old and my three-year-old, we were walking hand-in-hand, and as we’re walking past a huge group of people, it was a group of five or six men who just started throwing vile abuse at me.“I continued to walk and then I just stopped and I looked around at this group of men and it was one guy in particular. And they were laughing and they were pointing. And they thought what they did was okay.“So I decided to confront them. I didn’t have to, but with my girls in my hands, I thought it was really important to confront them because for us, my actions need to mirror the messages I give to my kids.“So I confronted them and like any group of men who have been drinking, they were weak, they were gutless, they didn’t own up to what they did and the man who was actual yelling this abuse was hiding behind his friend.“I said ‘Do you feel good about yourself, trying to intimidate me, to belittle me, embarrass me in front of my kids? You clearly don’t have kids yourself, it’s not okay. It’s not okay to bully someone, it’s not okay to make fun of other people.’“The thing that disappointed me was, one, the fact they thought it was funny, two, that they couldn’t own up to their mistake, but the fact that in a packed stadium, when they could see a mother with two kids clearly in distress, my girls were upset, not one single person came to my assistance. Not one.“The sad thing is that in a time when we’re trying to encourage more women, more girls to participate in sport, to attend sport, that I’m now starting to feel like it’s not safe for me and my kids to attend sport and support their father.”Candice said it was important for her to confront the men because she wants to “raise confident and fearless young girls that aren’t afraid to stand up for themselves and confront bullies head on”.Tilley said bullies often “cowered back” when confronted and Candice added the group of men were “as weak as they come”.She said the men didn’t apologise but that one had DMed her on Instagram, who said: “I didn’t say anything, but I also didn’t speak out so I’m very sorry about that and I’m sorry he said what he said.“I know this won’t make up for anything but I just wanted to say sorry.”Candice said due to David’s international schedule, she is “the mother and the father” for her girls and “won’t allow my girls to see their mum be bullied, intimidated. It’s not what I stand for.”Warner said her eldest daughter Ivy asked why she confronted the men.Candice replied: “Darling, you’ve got to understand, this is not okay. We won’t tolerate this, this is unacceptable no matter male, female, how big, you need to learn to stand up for yourself and this is why.“What I was so surprised about was not one person who could see me, visibly upset, distressed and my two daughters and people were happy to just watch this. I know if it was the other way around, I would definitely go and see what’s going on.“Now we go to the cricket and I’m starting to feel like it’s an unsafe place for me and my kids to be at.“The incident capped off a tough week for the Warner family after David decided not to contest his leadership ban following the new the independent process would also be public.David was banned from leadership positions after the 2018 Cape Town ball tampering scandal, which also saw him banned for a year.He released a furious message last week to announce he was withdrawing from the Cricket Australia process as he aimed to avoid the “public lynching” of re-airing the sandpaper-gate details in public.Candice, who as long called for David’s ban to be overturned, lashed out at CA, saying the family “had been through hell”.“To put our family, also his teammates, through everything again and the disappointing thing for David is this has been dragged out for so long,” she said.“Everything first kicked off in February (reviewing Warner’s leadership ban) and it’s now December and still no decision.“It’s still raw, we go to cricket so often watching David play and there’s always people yelling things out at the crowd.“My daughters proudly wear their dad’s T-shirt with their dad’s name on the back. The fact that my daughters have to cop abuse because of incidents that have happened in the past is not fair.“David always puts family first, he’s fiercely protective of myself and the three girls, and cricket is not everything, cricket is what he does, but cricket does not define him and the person he is.“The fact that there was a lack of player welfare (from Cricket Australia), and no welfare about David and our family speaks volumes.","pubDate":"2022-12-12 20:34:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Radical IPL-inspired shake up for world golf","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/golf/golf-news-new-iplinspired-teams-event-to-shake-up-world-golf/news-story/143f3695aeccb2f7e61b9e8bf04c1cd9","keywords":["Golf news","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia is set to be the launching pad for golf’s latest revolution as tour officials prepare to rubberstamp a T20-style tournament featuring some of the world’s best players.","content":"News Corp can reveal Australian Tour officials have been locked in talks with key players behind the Ultra Golf Championship, a unique short-form team tournament played over nine holes and designed to turbocharge the sport.The format is the brainchild of Deke Smith, who spent five years road-testing the concept before partnering with the PGA Tour of Australasia.The plan is to debut the format next year and Smith has ambitious plans to turn it into a global series of events featuring some of the biggest names in golf.Talks are already well advanced with high-profile players to captain the respective teams locked in for the inaugural event — Bangkok, Delhi, Dubai, London, Los Angeles, New York, Melbourne, Shanghai, Seoul and Tokyo.Several of the world’s top 10 players could be approached to be potential team captains including Australia’s world No. 3 Cameron Smith, USA’s world No. 2 Scottie Scheffler and No. 7 Will Zalatoris, Norway’s world No. 9 Victor Hovland, England’s world No. 10 Matt Fitzpatrick and Japan’s world No. 20 Hideki Matsuyama.“We have the financial backing,” Smith told News Corp.“We have some really high net worth (individuals) behind it. We are already in heads of agreement with five or six really key players from around the world.“The quality of players is unreal. I feel like we are 70 per cent of the way with the captains already. I am looking forward to when we announce the captains because everyone will stand up and go, ‘wow, this is real’.“Again, the feedback from these guys has been amazing. They love it, they see it is different. People around the world have seen what has happened with cricket and that short form game. To be perfectly honest, we have modelled it off IPL.“That business is incredible out of India, the way they have done that. It is a global product. Yes, it is built out of Australia but there is no reason we can’t run a tournament in New York.”The format features a unique scoring system designed to reward risk-taking, tactical acumen and unpredictability. A hole in one is worth 10 points. An albatross is worth eight points. Eagles are rewarded with six points.Points are awarded at four feature holes designated for the longest drive, a powerplay, alternate-shot and best-ball systems. The 10 teams are divided into pools of five with 60 matches to be played over three days. The two pool winners then meet in the final. The priority is to pack as much excitement into every day and every hole.“We do get a lot of ideas put to us and no doubt there have been some good ones over the years as well as a lot of average ones,” PGA Tour of Australasia tournaments director Nick Dastey said.“It has to be something that is different and exciting for us to grab it and want to work with it. This one, particularly once you have enjoyed playing it and playing it with some good people, really strikes you as something you are going to enjoy and the spectator will enjoy.“It is very rare for a match not to be able to swing one way or the other on the eighth or ninth hole. The thought of seeing high-level players playing it on TV is something any golfer or golf fan will love.“We have all played it against Deke. We have seen massive swings in momentum from one or two shots.“We have seen teams looking down and out on the eighth but they still have their powerplay, have a big final hole and win the match.”Smith is dreaming big. His background is in sales and sponsorship but golf has become his passion. He didn’t grow up with golf. He only started playing the sport five years ago but his concept is set for take-off at a time when golf is driven by conflict thanks to Greg Norman, Saudi-backed LIV golf and the bitter war with the US PGA Tour.Remarkably, another Australian may yet be the inspiration behind an idea that shakes up the sport, albeit in a positive way. “Why not revolutionise it?” Smith said.“Why not have a real positive impact on the sport? I never grew up with golf. I would love to get more kids playing the game but in a fun and exciting way.“Hopefully we can provide an avenue for that with this format. We love a contest — we love seeing a result. With golf you don’t really get a result until the 72nd hole after four days, which is a bloody long period.“I thought how do we shorten this down not too dissimilar with what cricket has done with the Big Bash. How do we keep people engaged? How do we keep them there?“How do we get the younger audience fixated on this sport that I love and am passionate about? That is where it all started.“This whole thing centred back to one thing the whole time -— what does the fan want? What is going to get them excited? I am just a general punter but you know what, all ideas need to start somewhere. “If I am the general punter that can help and assist and have a positive impact on a game I love, well good on me.”","pubDate":"2022-12-12 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"To qualify for WTC final, we have to play aggressive cricket: Stand-in skipper Rahul","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/12/13/to-qualify-for-wtc-final-we-have-to-play-aggressive-cricket-stand-in-skipper-rahul/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chattogram: A spot in the World Test Championship final at stake, a depleted Indian team has no option but to play an aggressive brand of cricket against Bangladesh in the two-match series starting Wednesday, stand-in skipper KL Rahul said on Monday.

The Indian team will be without three key players — Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja and regular skipper Rohit Sharma — due to injuries. Having already lost the ODI series, the Indian team will need to win its next six Test matches (two in Bangladesh and four vs Australia at home) to remain in contention for a top-two spot in the World Test Championship points table. As of now, Indian team is placed fourth in the table with 52.08 percentage points while Australia (75 percentage points) and South Africa (60 percentage points) are placed first and second. Sri Lanka, with 64 percentage points, is third in the list. “There is a Test championship (final) qualification so we will also have to be aggressive. We know where we stand and what we need to do to qualify for the final,” said Rahul during a media conference after the unveiling of the trophy. “Each day, each session we will assess what is required for the team in that particular moment and give our best.” The season-ending World Test Championship will be held in June, 2023 at the Oval in London. Flexibility in mindset is the order of the hour and a key recipe for success. “We won’t go in with any set mindset. Yes, there is a certain history of a venue, you look at the numbers and take some pointers from that. At least for us we will go there and try to be aggressive and brave, try and get a result. “The game is played over five days so it is important to break it down to smaller targets. In every session, the demands would be different but one thing is sure that you are going to see a lot of aggressive cricket from our side,” the skipper assured. A lot of this talk of aggressive intent has come watching England team’s radically different ultra-aggressive approach, which has caught the imagination of cricket fans. And skipper Rahul doesn’t think English style of batsmanship characterises “recklessness”. “As cricketers, I don’t think it is reckless cricket. They have certain mindset, they thought about it, they back their players and the players are doing the job for the team, so it doesn’t matter how you have done it. Cricket is changing, there is no set way of how this game needs to be played,” the stylish opener said. Rahul in fact immensely enjoyed England’s 2-0 series win in Pakistan with a Test match still to go. “To watch these two matches between England and Pakistan has really been interesting. I am really enjoying watching Test cricket being played like that, a very fearless, taking the game on. “But each team has its own way. All teams can learn a thing or two from the teams that are doing well. You can’t always have the same approach. You turn up according to the conditions,” he said, providing his take on English approach.

Shakeel battled gallantly for just over 5-1/2 hours in making 94 off 213 balls against the pace and spin before Mark Wood tangled the lefthander down the legside just before the lunch interval and Pope claimed a low two-handed catch to his right and reduced Pakistan to 291-7 by lunch. Television umpire Joel Wilson of the West Indies upheld onfield umpire Aleem Dar’s soft signal of out as he took several minutes and watched the replays from various angles. But cricket fans were convinced the ball touched the ground as Pope tried to snag the catch. Former England skipper Michael Atherton said in commentary: “In the third umpire’s view, he thinks Pope got his gloves underneath the ball. I think you could argue otherwise.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Ex-England quick Steve Finn added the home side were unlucky. “We could have this debate forever, but Ollie Pope to me doesn’t look convinced when he looks up to celebrate,” Finn told Sky Sports Cricket. “For me, you can just see the taped-up finger come out the back of the ball there slightly, which suggests it may have touched the ground.

Pakistan captain Babar Azam believed the catch cost his team the game. He felt the ball was grounded before it went into Pope’s gloves, but said the teams have to follow the umpires’ decisions. England, on its first test tour to Pakistan in 17 years, has been on a roll through its aggressive brand of cricket that started in the English summer when it won six of its seven test matches under the captaincy of Stokes and new coach Brendon McCullum. In the past England had won only two test matches in Pakistan – in 1959 and 2000 – but now has won back-to-back tests in just two weeks on challenging dry, flat and slow turning wickets at Rawalpindi and Multan. “I think it was another great game, completely different conditions to the first test match,” Stokes said. “We adapted to those conditions and stuck to the way that we wanted to operate. Last week obviously was a very flat wicket, whereas this one was a challenging one, but we still went out and applied ourselves the way that we wanted.” England showed plenty of aggression on a flat Rawalpindi wicket to win by 74 runs as its batters plundered four centuries in a world-record 506-4 on the opening day. Wood didn’t figure in the first test as he was still recovering from a hip injury, but the fast bowler bowled with plenty of pace and struck thrice once Stokes took the second new ball with Pakistan still needing 109 runs.

Shakeel and Mohammad Nawaz, who made 45 off 62 balls, had raised Pakistan’s hopes of its highest-ever successful run-chase at home with an 80-run sixth-wicket stand before Wood dismissed both batters with identical short balls down the legside. “I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t want to be facing bouncers at 145-150 kph with 20 minutes left (for lunch) even if I had faced as many balls as those two,” Stokes said. “That’s what we picked him (Wood) for, to come in, change the game and blow that wicket for us and it was an easy decision to make to bring him on.” The third and final test begins at Karachi from Saturday. - With news.com.au Save share Share this article facebook copy link twitter linkedin reddit email","pubDate":"2022-12-12 17:19:57","image_url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/F1aVZToM6k-S0eOJdmzBB69DLUU=/300x300/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/Z5W2DHR2PNEJPGXBMMJMZY2KMQ.JPG","source_id":"nzherald","country":["new zealand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Industrial Fan Zone: Una visita al fan zone secreto para trabajadores migrantes de Qatar","link":"https://www.sopitas.com/deportes/industrial-fan-zone-una-visita-al-fan-zone-secreto-para-trabajadores-migrantes-de-qatar/","keywords":["Deportes","Noticias","migración","Qatar 2022"],"creator":["Francisco Alanís"],"video_url":null,"description":"“Look who we are, we are the dreamers, we make it happen, ‘cause we believe it”. Es la primera frase de “Dreamers”, la pegajosa canción oficial... The post Industrial Fan Zone: Una visita al fan zone secreto para trabajadores migrantes de Qatar appeared first on Sopitas.com.","content":"“Look who we are, we are the dreamers, we make it happen, ‘cause we believe it”. Es la primera frase de “Dreamers”, la pegajosa canción oficial del mundial de Qatar 2022 que hemos escuchado hasta el cansancio en las últimas semanas. Pero ¿quiénes son esos “soñadores”? Una interpretación obvia, nos remitiría a las figuras y jugadores que están cumpliendo el sueño de disputar (y eventualmente ganar) un mundial. De la misma forma, la canción de Jung Kook de BTS, podría ser una oda a Qatar y el “sueño” de organizar por primera vez un Mundial en Medio Oriente. Es una canción, alegre, optimista y que apela a la creencia popular de “si lo sueñas, lo logras”. Pero al mismo tiempo, es imposible separar el término ‘Dreamers’ de la canción mundialista, de los DREAMers, el sinónimo que se le ha dado a los migrantes en los últimos años: aquellas personas que arriesgan y dejan absolutamente todo en su lugar de origen, para buscar el sueño de tener una vida digna. ¿Por qué Qatar creó un campamento para trabajadores migrantes? Labour City es un suburbio localizado en las afueras (muy afueras) de Doha y como su nombre lo dice, fue creado con el fin de concentrar (por no decir centralizar o segregar) a poco más de 70 mil trabajadores migrantes que llegaron a Qatar buscando una mejor calidad de vida. Pero, ¿por qué crear un municipio exclusivamente para trabajadores migrantes? Podríamos decir que esta fue la respuesta del gobierno de Qatar ante las críticas y señalamientos por los derechos de los trabajadores contratados para construir la infraestructura necesaria para albergar la Copa del Mundo. Así que en una muestra de “estamos cumpliendo con las reglas”, designaron algunas hectáreas para construir esta “ciudad”, para 70 mil habitantes en la que se puede encontrar una estación de policía, un cine, centro comercial, tiendas de autoservicios y hasta un estadio de cricket. Es precisamente en las inmediaciones de este estadio de cricket donde yace un Fan Zone mundialista, con grandes pantallas, canchas a escala para jugar futbol y algunas decoraciones alusivas a Qatar 2022, con la excepción de que este Fan Zone no es publicitado por la FIFA, ni aparece en las guías turísticas. A diferencia de los Fan Zones ubicados en las zonas más populares y céntricas de Qatar, en este tampoco se vende alcohol, souvenirs, ni se observan mujeres o niños. Los trabajadores disfrutan del Industrial Fan Zone montado sobre el estadio de Cricket en Labour City de Qatar. Foto: Sopitas Industrial Fan Zone, el Fan Zone “secreto” de Qatar Se trata del ‘Industrial Fan Zone’ creado para que aquellos obreros y trabajadores (seguridad, cocineros, carpinteros, albañiles, choferes, limpieza, etc.) que hacen posible esta Copa del Mundo, puedan disfrutar de la misma. “Look who we are, we are the dreamers, we make it happen….” ¿recuerdan? La ironía (o tal vez cinismo) de que los obreros que construyeron estadios y trabajan largos turnos diariamente para garantizar que el mundial ocurra sin contratiempos, solo puedan ver su obra a través de pantallas gigantes y en un espacio reservado (por no decir segregado) para ellos. En una de las entradas, se muestra una manta con un mensaje en árabe, inglés e hindi que dice “gracias por tu contribución para entregar la mejor Copa Mundial de la FIFA de todos los tiempos”. Un agradecimiento hueco, como ha sido el trasfondo político y social de este mundial de futbol. Foto: Una manta colgada en la entrada del Industrial Fan Zone de Qatar agradece el trabajo de los trabajadores migrantes. Foto: Sopitas El testimonio de los trabajadores migrantes en Qatar El gol de Portugal levanta los primeros festejos entre los asistentes a este Fan Zone. El 99% de ellos hombres, muchos de ellos provenientes de Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Filipinas, Botswana y otros países africanos vestidos con playeras apócrifas de Portugal con el nombre de Cristiano Ronaldo y de otras selecciones como Qatar, Ghana o Senegal. Los gritos de “¡siiiiiuuuuu!” se escuchan por doquier, aunque Cristiano Ronaldo inició el partido en la banca. Al platicar con ellos, todos coinciden en que les gustaría estar en el estadio y poder ver un partido, pero simplemente es algo que está fuera de su alcance. Trabajadores ven un partido del mundial de Qatar 2022 en el Industrial Fan Zone. / Foto: Sopitas Los boletos más baratos para asistir a un partido del mundial de Qatar 2022 Copa costaban 40 reales qatarís, algo así como $215 pesos. Pero el salario mensual de estos obreros, consta de apenas mil reales qatarís, algo así como 5 mil pesos mexicanos. “Todo lo que gano, lo tengo que mandar para mantener a mi esposa y mis hijos. Sólo duermo y trabajo, duermo y trabajo, duermo y trabajo” me cuenta Abdul, quién agradece que exista este Fan Zone, pues es la única forma en la que pueden ver los partidos, los cuales únicamente se transmiten por BeIn Sports en la televisión de paga; algo a lo que tampoco tienen acceso. Para darnos una idea de cómo es vivir ganando mil reales qatarís al mes, les diré que un litro de leche, cuesta 12 reales, 100 gramos de jamón 20 reales, un paquete de pan: 15 reales, un refresco 5 reales. Aquí ya van 50 reales y es apenas para armar sandwiches, con leche y refresco. Esta sencilla dieta por 30 días, nos costaría 1500 reales, es decir, ya vamos perdiendo. Biju trabaja como guardia de seguridad privada, gana 1,300 reales al mes. “Comprar boletos es un lujo para nosotros, muchos llegamos endeudados a Qatar, pidiendo dinero prestado a familiares y amigos para pagar los costos de las agencias de colocación que nos consiguieron estos trabajos“. Foto: Sopitas Biju comparte dormitorio con 4 compañeros más, y este ha sido su primer día de descanso en un mes. No recibe pago por horas extras, ni por los días de descanso trabajados. Sabe que es injusto, pero no se queja con sus superiores, por temor a meterse en problemas, quedarse sin trabajo o incluso que lo deporten de regreso a su país. Cuando me preguntó si había vuelos directos de México a Qatar, le expliqué que volé haciendo escala en París. “París, ¿te piden visa?, ¿qué te preguntan en migración cuando llegas en el aeropuerto?, ¿debo llevar mis estados bancarios?, ¿qué pasa si compro un boleto de avión y llegando no me dejan entrar?, ¿me regresan mi dinero?” Una de las escenas más recurrentes que me ha tocado ver en los estadios, ha sido precisamente ver a los guardias de seguridad, sacar fotografías de sus padres, hijos, esposas, hermanos y seres queridos, para tomarles (valga la redundancia) una foto con la cancha de fondo. Un gesto simbólico, para decirles a los suyos, a aquellos que dejaron a miles de kilómetros de distancia, en sus lugares de origen, que “los han llevado al mundial”, aunque sea a través de una fotografía en su teléfono celular. Un guardia, toma una foto, a una foto de su familia previo a un partido del mundial de Qatar 2022 / Foto: Sopitas ¿Segregados del mundial? Preparar, montar, construir y operar diariamente un Fan Fest para que los obreros migrantes puedan disfrutar del mundial, puede parecer un gesto noble a primera vista; sin embargo no deja de parecer extraño que este sea el ÚNICO Fan Fest al que pueden entrar, toda vez que aquellos publicitados por FIFA y el Comité Organizador requieren que los asistentes presenten la tarjeta Hayya, la cual, en principio, sólo se puede obtener si compraste boletos para algún partido del mundial. Así que sin boletos y sin Hayya card, Abdul, Biju y el resto de trabajadores que habitan en “Labour City” no pueden entrar a los Fan Zones desplegados para turistas y visitantes en las zonas más céntricas de Qatar. Con botes y tablas de madera se improvisaron algunas mesas para el Industrial Fan Zone de Qatar / Foto: Sopitas Portugal aplastó 6-1 a Suiza, Cristiano Ronaldo entró de cambio y los gritos de ¡”siiiiuuuu”! siguieron sonando en el ‘Industrial Fan Zone’; el cual también contó con un show de medio tiempo, en el que un DJ acompañado por dos bailarinas (una con la bandera de Suiza y otra con la bandera de Portugal) animaron a los trabajadores presentes. En medio de dicho baile es que Biju se anima y me pide tomarnos una foto juntos. “Mexico, nice people” me dice al despedirnos; no sin antes levantar su puño en alto, mientras grita “¡PORTUGAL!” Bailarinas amenizan el Industrial Fan Zone de Qatar / Foto: Sopitas Mientras camino hacia la salida, es imposible no pensar que este FanZone no sólo busca entretener a los trabajadores, sino de paso mantenerlos alejados de las zonas céntricas; lejos de las postales con rascacielos y de los pabellones turísticos por los que se pasean miles de turistas. Vaya, se siente de alguna forma, que los están “escondiendo” para que no “obstruyan” el paisaje de modernidad y belleza que Qatar quiere mostrar al mundo. El problema no es Qatar, se llama pobreza y migración Uno de los principales señalamientos contra el mundial de Qatar 2022 radica precisamente en el trato que ha dado a los trabajadores encargados de construir estadios y toda la infraestructura desarrollada durante más de una década para albergar la Copa del Mundo. Organizaciones como Human Rights Watch y Amnistia Internacional han denunciado en repetidas ocasiones las condiciones en las que miles de trabajadores migrantes fueron contratados. Algunos fueron traídos a base de engaños, otros tantos explotados en turnos laborales sin descanso o sin recibir paga durante meses; unos más viviendo en condiciones inaceptables y por supuesto, aquellos que perdieron la vida en diversos acontecimientos relacionados con el desarrollo de infraestructura mundialista; una cifra que se desconoce con exactitud, pues la opacidad del gobierno qatarí para manejar estos casos ha provocado que muchos certificados de defunción se emitieran sin especificar las causas de muerte. Esta imagen tomada en el 2015, muestra las condiciones en las que llegaron a vivir algunos trabajadores migrantes, contratados para construir la infraestructura requerida para el mundial de Qatar 2022. Foto: ILoveQatar.net Si bien los señalamientos se han enfocado en Qatar al ser el país sede de un evento que atrae los ojos del mundo, no podemos olvidar que los problemas, engaños, abusos y muertes que sortean diariamente los trabajadores migrantes es un mal generalizado en gran parte del planeta. Vaya, ocurren diariamente en nuestro país. Ha sido gracias al mundial que hemos podido conocer las condiciones en las que sobreviven los trabajadores migrantes de Qatar, y ha sido también gracias al mundial (y sobre todo a la presión internacional) que Qatar ha reformado sus leyes para derogar la Kafala, que es el sistema (aún vigente en muchos países de Medio Oriente) que permite que un patrón pueda retener los papeles de los trabajadores migrantes para que no puedan salir del país, explotarles, no pagarles y básicamente violar todos sus derechos amparados por la ley. Las reformas laborales implementadas en Qatar han sido reconocidas por Human Rights Watch, que al mismo tiempo señala que el problema ahora, será garantizar el cumplimiento de las nuevas reglas. Por lo pronto, el mundial se acaba, pero la migración, segregación explotación y falta de oportunidades seguirá ocurriendo en todo el mundo. ¿Qué podemos hacer para que historias como las de Abdul o Biju no se sigan repitiendo?

In this case, KL Rahul said in the press conference that you will definitely see the aggressive game of the Indian team. So now fans are trolling him. Indian cricket team is playing a cricket series in Bangladesh. With India losing the recently concluded ODI series 1-2, both teams are set to play a 2-match Test series. Rahul has said this in this context. “This aggressive attitude of the England cricket team has got me wet. It is interesting to see Test cricket played like this. They fearlessly and aggressively take on the challenge of the game and achieve results. That method is paying off for them. Every team plays differently. But there’s nothing wrong with learning a few things from teams that perform well. However, it changes according to the environment. Under my leadership, the Indian team will play in an aggressive style. Fans can definitely expect that,” he said. He is leading the Indian team as the captain in the first match of this series.

Led by southpaw Tanmay Agarwal, the Hyderabad team will miss key players – Mohammed Siraj, promising batter N Thakur Tilak Varma and CV Milind. While Siraj is on national duty in Bangladesh, Tilak Varma suffered an injury during India A match against Bangladesh A recently. Left-arm pacer Milind sustained a knee injury during the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament. Also Read Tanmay Agarwal to lead Hyderabad in Ranji Trophy However, Hyderabad are a confident outfit, according to their leader Tanmay and coach Milap Mewada. “Injuries to senior players mean opportunities for youngsters. We have a bunch of players who are very talented. The team is confident ahead of the new season and we are raring to go. We want to take one match at a time,” said captain Tanmay. With quite a lot of youngsters in the side, Hyderabad are short on experience. With Tanmay being the most experienced player, in K Rohit Rayudu, T Ravi Teja, Tanay Thyagarajan and Ajay Dev Goud, they have talent in abundance. Coach Mewada is of the opinion the exuberance in the side will compensate for lack of experience. “If you look at the Hyderabad team, it is a very young side. We are short on experience but we prepared the team in such a way they are ready for any situation. Of course, the absence of Siraj, Tilak Varma will make a difference on the paper, but it should not affect the team on the field,” he said. “We believe in the process. The goal is to do well in each session and do well. If we do the small things right, we can achieve results. As a coach, my job is to make every player ready for any situation. All we need is to play with the intent. These boys are very young and hungry for success,” added Mewada. The opponents Tamil Nadu are on a good run having broken several records in the recently-concluded Vijay Hazare Trophy . They raked up a record 506/2 in the match against Arunachal Pradesh, to become the first team to score over 500 in a List A match. N Jagadeesah is fresh from his world record individual score of 277 in List A cricket. He also scored a record fifth consecutive century. Led by Baba Indrajith, Tamil Nadu would fancy their chances. The weather is too set to have its say with the forecast for the next two days not so promising for the game.

In the first semi-final on Wednesday at 12:30am (Tuesday midnight), Argentina will face Croatia, who defeated Brazil. The next day, the French team and the Moroccan team, who have created great expectations and are waiting to create history, are playing. Argentina – Croatia As for the competition, both the teams are going to face each other for the 3rd time in the World Cup. But this is the first time they are facing each other in the knockout round. Argentina beat Croatia 1-0 in the 1998 World Cup. But this is a league round match. Croatia won 3-0 in 2018. Brazil were brilliantly shut down by Croatia that day. We also have to take into account that many Brazilian players are unable to play properly due to the threat of injury. But Croatia’s fighting spirit forced them to fear their opponents no matter how big they were. It must be assumed that the midfield trio Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic, and Marcelo Prozovic, who shut Brazil down that day, will have unique strategies for Messi, the ‘Lion’ of Argentina. On that day, Vinicius Junior, the unstoppable hero of Brazil, was paralyzed by the Croatian team. The Argentinian coach must now be aware that this trio has the tactics to deal with any threat from the opposition in midfield. Because this three-man midfield combination is difficult to break even with a lightning fast player like Messi. Eight of Croatia’s previous nine knockout matches have gone beyond 90 minutes to extra time. So having ‘energy’ capable players in full fitness is the first imperative in Argentina’s squad. The penalty shoot-out wins over Japan and Brazil in Qatar should also be taken into account. It’s worth noting that Croatia won the 2018 final against Denmark and Russia in a penalty shootout. If the creative, imaginative and fast Brazil team has been shut down and won, expect Argentina and Croatia to ask ‘what’s wrong’. But do you know why Argentina will advance to the final? – Although Croatia have great tactics in stopping the opposition, Modric and Perisic are the only strikers. Perisic is a goalscorer in big matches. Modric is experienced. However, it can be said that the Croatian team’s goal-striking ability is not as good as Argentina’s. Argentina has many talented players like Messi, Alvarez, Martinez. Especially Argentina’s goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez will be a big challenge for the Croatian team. Croatia should also note the rise of Emiliano Martinez in the penalty shootout that day against the Netherlands. Therefore, Croatia do not have the attacking options that Argentina have. Lionel Messi, at the age of 35, is a lightning-quick goal-scorer and a superstar in creating and assisting goals. Messi’s goals against Mexico and Australia are unforgettable. Nahuel Molina’s goal from Messi’s reverse pass against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals was one of many testaments to Messi’s talent. Just as India was driven to win the 2011 Cricket World Cup for Sachin Tendulkar, a World Cup led by Messi is Argentina’s dream. It is the last World Cup where a star player like Messi will play and the cup is a dream and prediction for Argentina. For Modric’s experience in the Croatian team, there is Leipzig. There is Jasco Guardiola, a 20-year-old who is being touted as Croatia’s star of the future. Just like Argentina’s Emiliano, Croatia’s goalkeeper Livakovic has proved that he is a fantastic goalkeeper, not only against Brazil that day but also throughout the series. If he stops Argentina’s goal attempts, there are expectations that there will be another shock. So an amazing game awaits. Fans may be biased as to who should win, but whoever wins or loses, football will win.","pubDate":"2022-12-12 14:48:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Did Rishabh Pant denigrate traditional Indian music? – Promotional video removal due to controversy","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/did-rishabh-pant-denigrate-traditional-indian-music-promotional-video-removal-due-to-controversy/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"An ad starring Indian cricketer Rishabh Pant has sparked controversy, forcing the video to be removed from social media handles.

The controversy has arisen as Rishabh Pant’s place in the Indian team has been questioned due to his lack of performance in ODI and T20 cricket. Rishabh Pant looks like an Indian classical musician in the Dream Eleven promotional video. He would come near the three microphones and sing like a Hindustani music fan. At the end of his speech he would say “Thank God, I followed my dream”. I mean, good luck, thank God, I followed my dream, he would have said in English. Dream Eleven made the ad as a sort of joke that he would have been a failed musician if he hadn’t continued to follow his dream of cricket. Rishabh Pant has removed the video from his social media handles today. This is due to the fact that many Indian classical music artists were strongly opposed to this promotional film in which he acted. Singer Kaushik Chakraborty commented on the ad, saying, “I practice Indian classical music. I don’t watch cricket. But never said it disrespectfully. Isn’t it polite to at least not insult something if you have no training in it? Isn’t mocking our own heritage an act of foolery? I have no words to express the disgust this ad made me feel. “I can’t stand that ad that says he made his fortune by disparaging Indian classical music,” he said. Singer Kaushik thanked Pant after he removed the promotional video from his social media pages and said, “I have no personal grudge against Rishabh Pant. I wish him all the best in life. Rishabh Pant should help whom to approach to remove this ad from other social media as well,” he expressed his gratitude. In his condemnation, sitar musician Purbhayan Chatterjee said, “The ad portrays Indian classical music in a negative light. I was shocked and saddened to see this ad. This is not the first time this has happened. Indian musical tradition has great value and respect all over the world. Cricket legends like Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar celebrate this art form,” he said. The Dream Eleven ad is the most famous. It is also worth noting that Rohit Sharma will be the cake maker and Hardik Pandya will be the hairstylist in the same Dream Eleven ad. This is a comedy promotional video. It is an inherent feature of comedy that any noble thing takes its course while the base matter also takes its course. In the commercial starring Rishabh Pant, he uses it as a stump and uses it as a stump to perform a pitched alabana and at the end he stretches out one hand to his right as if to catch. In a way, the ad seemed to make fun of cricket and wicket-keeping. But everyone’s perspective is different. In that way, Rishabh Pant has removed this advertisement from his social media page after realizing that this ad has caused pain to traditional musicians and music sellers. Rishabh Pant has returned to the Indian team for the India-Bangladesh Test series starting on Wednesday at Chattogram.

Ranji Trophy was held in a trimmed format – broken into two phases – last time around and the charm was missing as the number of matches were much fewer and the lack of continuity was not ideal.There is a slight tweak in the format this time around as the BCCI has grouped teams into Elite and Plate categories and there would be two titles up for grabs. The clubbing of newer states into the Elite set-up came under heavy criticism during the recently concluded Vijay Hazare Trophy, and a lot more competitive action is expected in the Plate group featuring the new teams.Read | Ishant Sharma likely to lose BCCI central contracts; Suryakumar, Gill set for promotionThe Elite category promises to be business as usual and quality cricket will be on offer starting December 13. The rise of Jammu and Kashmir and Assam in the white-ball circuit has only added more spice to the tournament.The big boys eye returnAjinkya Rahane for Mumbai, Ishant Sharma for Delhi, Mayank Agarwal for Karnataka and Hanuma Vihari for Andhra. Plenty of Indian players, out of the Test reckoning, for now, would look to put up a strong case when they turn up for their respective states. All of them featured in the white-ball competitions but didn’t really set the stage on fire. They now return to familiar territory and a format where they have enjoyed a lot of success in the Indian whites.Rahane is leading Mumbai and would look to be amongst the runs to regain his place back in the Indian middle order. It remains to be seen how much Ishant plays as whispers in the DDCA corridors suggest the veteran seamer is not likely to feature in all games for Delhi. For the likes of Mayank and Vihari, who are leading Karnataka and Andhra respectively, it would be about scoring those big runs and finding their way back into the Indian set-up.Ranji trophy! 🏏 can’t wait to get going with Andhra! pic.twitter.com/VVbraSaD7T— Hanuma vihari (@Hanumavihari) December 12, 2022 While Mayank lost his place to the consistent Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer has edged Vihari for the spot in the Indian middle order. For a little period, Vihari was tried at No.3 too but Cheteshwar Pujara’s brilliant run in England’s county circuit helped him regain the spot and the solid right-hander is now the vice-captain of the side for the upcoming Tests against Bangladesh.The young gunsA lot of focus will be on how the likes of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Prithvi Shaw, and Yash Dhull fare in the red-ball grind. Jaiswal has been very consistent for Mumbai at top of the order, across formats, and Shaw continues to do bully oppositions. For Dhull, who has been appointed captain of Delhi for the Ranji Trophy, it will be a very crucial season. He has enjoyed a lot of success in the First Class circuit, made it to India A side too, and would now look to continue with the brilliant run.For Assam and Riyan Parag, it was a dream List A season as the side, riding high on the right-hander’s brilliant run with the bat, made it to the semi-final stage of the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Riyan has promised a similar positive approach in red ball too and his outings in the Ranji Trophy will keep everyone interested.The white-ball beastsSuryakumar Yadav, who has set the T20I stage on fire, returns to a format where he has scored bucket loads for Mumbai. The innovative right-hander, due to his international commitments, last played a Ranji Trophy game back in 2020 and has now made himself available for Mumbai’s second league fixture.Similarly, the focus would be on the likes of Sanju Samson, who is leading Kerala, and Punjab seamer Arshdeep Singh. Right from his age-group days, Arshdeep has enjoyed success with the red ball in domestic competitions and would look to do more of the same if he turns out for a very formidable Punjab unit.Seamer Avesh Khan would too hope for encouraging returns as he has had a good run for Madhya Pradesh and has already taken 100 wickets in 27 First-Class games he has played so far. The 25-year-old played the Vijay Hazare Trophy and returned with 12 wickets from six games he played in the season. For the likes of Ruturaj Gaikwad and Rahul Tripathi, who had set the Vijay Hazare Trophy on fire with their consistent outings, it would be another long season of knocking on the selector’s doors.Financial boost for domestic veteransThere are plenty of veterans in the domestic circuit who don’t have lucrative IPL deals or even jobs to secure their non-playing days. For them, a long season, coupled with hiked match fees, will ensure some sort of financial security. As per the revised slabs, a senior domestic cricketer, who has played more than 40 matches, will be entitled to Rs 60,000 match fees per day. This makes it Rs 2,40,000 for a First Class fixture lasting four days.It’s that time of the year 😍Team Mumbai is ready for yet another thrilling Ranji Trophy Season 💙Let’s wish them luck by dropping a ❤️#MCA #Mumbai #Cricket #IndianCricket #Wankhede #BCCI pic.twitter.com/7tah7UNoGg— Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) (@MumbaiCricAssoc) December 12, 2022 Even the inexperienced lot is set to return with a fat paycheck as the Playing XI members would receive Rs 40,000 per day while the ones on the bench would take home Rs 20,000 per day. To get rid of the delays in the settlement of the match fees, the BCCI has now decided to introduce a digital portal to raise invoices, and the traditional mechanism, which involved a lot of paperwork and was mostly initiated after the culmination of a tournament, has been dropped.All eyes of Elite Group BThis group features some of the top sides and it could be anybody’s game here. The likes of Delhi, Mumbai, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Saurashtra, and Maharashtra make it a very competitive group.While Saurashtra have enjoyed a lot of success in the domestic circuit, Mumbai are slowly, but surely regaining their daddy status in the circuit. For Tamil Nadu and Delhi, it looks to be a challenging road ahead as the two sides haven’t had much success in the red-ball format.And, it will be difficult to ignore Assam this season. Especially after their inspiring show in the Vijay Hazare Trophy where they dominated a group featuring plenty of domestic giants.Quote Unquote“The first goal is to qualify this time around as we haven’t been the best red-ball side going around”– Tamil Nadu’s Baba Indrajith“We are very excited to play this complete season as after winning the title in 2019-20, we didn’t get Ranji Trophy next year and the 2021 season was a trimmed one. This year, our group is very challenging and we are up for it”– Saurashtra’s Arpit Vasavada“Different conditions, different pitches so approach could vary.

And one of his ardent followers was bending over to let his favourite icon sign his T-shirt in a viral video. The 5-second video, which surfaced online, saw the fan wearing a white t-shirt while bent over to let Dhoni sign on his back and turn back in enthusiasm to take the pen back once Dhoni was done penning his initials.

He was soon spotted at the Indian dressing room as the Men in Blue faced hosts England. While the cricketer is away from the cricket ground, Dhoni was also spotted dancing with Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya in a viral video . In videos that have gone viral on the internet, Dhoni can be seen singing with famous Indian rapper Badshah while shaking a leg with Hardik and Kishan, who were part of the Indian squad that recently won the T20I series against New Zealand. Dhoni will be returning to the ground next year when IPL 2023, in all likelihood, kicks off in April as the Chennai Super Kings loyal will captain the franchise once again with the aim to develop the team for the future.

The post Report: 10th richest man in the world would consider Arsenal bid but not Manchester United appeared first on HITC.","content":"Mukesh Ambani is unlikely to launch a move for Manchester United – because the club his family want is actually believed to be Arsenal. The Athletic claim that Ambani is being touted for a move into football very soon. Yet whilst Manchester United are seeking new ownership as the Glazers look to sell up, Ambani seemingly isn’t going to buy the Red Devils. It’s stated that Ambani’s son Akash is a huge Arsenal fan and it’s actually the Gunners that the Ambani family would want to purchase. Whether Stan Kroenke and co would sell Arsenal any time soon remains to be seen. Their commitment to Arsenal seems to have been strengthened ever since the rather ugly European Super League debacle. Spotify’s Daniel Ek was interested in buying the club but that came and went, so it’s hard to see Ambani and his family being able to pull off a deal. Photo by Sonu Mehta/Hindustan Times via Getty Images Who is Mukesh Ambani? Arsenal fans will at least enjoy that the family’s love for the Gunners will keep them away from pumping money into Manchester United. Ambani’s net worth stands at around £90billion, which puts him tenth on the Forbes rich list. Ambani’s wealth mostly comes from Reliance Industries, which is the largest company in India as measured by revenue. The 65-year-old started helping his father Dhirubhai run Reliance Industries way back in 1981, with petrochemicals a key part of their business. Now involved in gas, retail, telecommunications and so much more, Reliance Industries has become a huge conglomerate over the years. Ambani has taken a keen interest in sport and even owns the Indian Premier League cricket franchise the Mumbai Indians. The Mirror suggested in November that Ambani is interested in taking over Liverpool with the idea of pumping huge money into the Reds. That seemingly won’t be happening given the love for Arsenal and reluctance to get involved with other Premier League clubs. Ambani will now be a name for Arsenal fans to keep tabs on, no doubt hoping that his huge wealth ends up at the Emirates Stadium one day.

The 34-year-old has been again hitting the headlines with some impressive innings since the Asia Cup 2022.However, former Pakistan spinner Rashid Latif, speaking on his YouTube channel, said that it is irrelevant if India fail to win ICC events and took a subtle dig at the Indian Premier League as well.He came off the recently-concluded T20 World Cup as the leading run-scorer with 296 runs even though India endured a disappointing elimination. He was rested in the New Zealand tour next and then returned to action in the ODI series against Bangladesh.In the final game of the three-match series, Kohli ended the 1214-day-long century drought registering his 44th ton in the format. With the much-awaited hundred, he went quite close to surpassing the record of the great Sachin Tendulkar.The topic has become the talk of the town as Kohli needs only five more centuries to breach Tendulkar’s tally of 49 centuries in the 50-over format. On an overall basis, the former India skipper is just 28 behind the legendary batter who has 100 tons under his belt.While speaking about this topic, ex-Pakistan captain Rashid Latif denied hyping it, instead, he highlighted India’s poor show in the ICC tournaments in recent times. According to him, Indian fans are bothered about ICC trophies, not about individual records.“The time has not come to calculate the centuries, not yet. It is irrelevant. They should bring home a trophy. India hasn’t taken home a trophy in many years. What is important to Indian cricket and the fans is a title, not whether Kohli achieves 100 or 200 centuries,” he explained.Latif also took a subtle dig at the Indian Premier League (IPL) and stated that these type of competitions are only meant for branding and raising money. Thus, supporters are not worried about them at all. He also pointed out the massive disaster that Team India had faced in the just-finished Asia Cup and T20 World Cup.“IPL and Indian cricket are far ahead financially. But there is now pressure from the media and fans who demand a title. Although Kohli has the ability to score 100 hundreds, the scenario has changed. The Champions Trophy, the 2019 World Cup, the last two T20 World Cups, and the Asia Cup all are done. Yes, 100 centuries has a place in cricket, but India and the Indian cricket board need to bring home a title,” Latif added.Since the exit of MS Dhoni, no Indian captain has managed to bring a major title to the country. The last one came in 2013 when the Men in Blue lifted their maiden ICC Champions Trophy beating hosts England in the final.In the following competitions, the Indian side choked in the knockout stage even after pulling off a strong start.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

You are always the all-time great for me,” Kohli said. Ronaldo was benched as a substitute in the Round of 16 and the quarter-finals.

Aakash Biswas December 12th, 2022 16:44:20 IST Saurabh Kumar has replaced Ravindra Jadeja in Bangladesh Tests. Image: BCCI Back in the month of February, an all-rounder called Saurabh Kumar received his maiden call-up for the Sri Lanka Tests. For the unversed, it was an eye-popping selection as he was a lesser-known individual in the pool of big stars. Since the likes of Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, and Axar Patel were already there, the new entrant found himself down in the pecking order and eventually, ended up warming the bench in the 2-match series. Though Saurabh didn’t get a game, his selection in the squad had already put the focus-light on him. He returned to the basics – domestic cricket – and kept following the process until he carved his way back to the Indian side, and this time he’s set to replace Jadeja, who hasn’t recovered from the knee injury, for the Bangladesh tour. The selection committee has also added fast bowler Jaydev Unadkat to India’s squad for the Test series. More details here – https://t.co/LDfGOYmMkz #BANvIND https://t.co/beOdgO2SYX — BCCI (@BCCI) December 11, 2022 On Sunday, the BCCI confirmed that Saurabh will be sharing the dressing room with the likes of KL Rahul and Virat Kohli in the upcoming 2-match Test series. He is already in Bangladesh with the India A side and his performance has begun speaking about his caliber. Spinning a vicious web around the home batters, Saurabh ended the 2-match series as the highest wicket-taker with 15 scalps, including a couple of 5-wicket hauls. He even scored a half-century in the second game, putting a strong case for his selection as Jadeja’s replacement. Saurabh’s rapid rise in domestic cricket forced the selectors to have a look at him. He has 237 wickets and 1776 runs to his credit in just 56 first-class games. What impresses one and all is his knack for picking wickets in bulk. He has 11 four-wicket hauls, 17 five-wicket hauls and six 10-wicket hauls already the way he is currently bowling in Bangladesh, he will definitely push the Indian team management into a dilemma before picking the playing XI in the Test series. Former India international and ex-Uttar Pradesh coach Vijay Dahiya reserved huge praise for the 29-year-old. In an exclusive interaction with News18 Cricketnext, the former wicketkeeper-batter said Saurabh rightfully deserves to be there. “It’s a very good selection. How do you get selected? On the basis of performance, consistency, and all against a good side. If you look at his numbers, they have been phenomenal in the last couple of years and he’s getting rewarded for that. He has performed against the top sides. We often say this player has scored hundreds of runs or that player has taken these many wickets. But when it comes to selection and starting the comparison, you see against whom and where. When you see those things, Saurabh’s performance will always be top-class,” Dahiya told News18 Cricketnext. “He has taken wickets that have mattered the most. His performance, in that sense, is phenomenal. As a spinner, playing for a state which has quite a bit of fast bowlers, among them being so consistent for the last couple of years; he absolutely deserves this,” he added. #BANvIND pic.twitter.com/twDdM0nxpV — BCCI (@BCCI) December 12, 2022 Saurabh’s passion for cricket landed him a government job, that too, in the Indian Air Force. But his strong will to play for India someday required him to carve a separate way for himself. He parted ways with the Services team and toiled hard to get into the Uttar Pradesh dressing room. And now, getting an India Test cap is all he wants. But even if Saurabh gets a game in Bangladesh, what happens when Jadeja gains fitness and returns? Also, the team already has another terrific left-armer in Axar Patel whose figures in home Tests are simply astonishing. Well, the competition is indeed stiff but according to Dahiya, here’s how the all-rounder can manage to remain on the radar of the selectors. “The competition is getting tougher with every day. Not just getting into the Indian side but to India A side as well. So, you need to be absolutely on your game and whatever opportunity you get, you have to make them count. “The unfortunate part for some of the players is that there were no shadow tours due to Covid. So now, even if you are not able for India, hold on to your place in the India A side based on your performance. So, whenever a player is out of form in the Indian side and there is an opportunity, you should be ready to grab that,” Dahiya concluded.

The match was decided by playing the Super Over after the scores were tied at 187. India defeated Australia through Super Over in the second women’s T20 International to level five-match series 1-1 on Sunday. The match was decided through Super Over after the scores were tied at 187. Batted in, Australia posted 187 for 1 with openers Beth Mooney (82 not out) and Tahlia McGregor (70 not out) making 158 runs to complete an unbroken partnership for the second wicket. In their response, India also ended at 191-5 in just 20 overs. Smriti Mandhana led the way with 79 runs, and Shafali Verma scored 34. Australia won their first T20I with nine wickets in this match on Friday. Prior to it was the Super Over, 14 were required in the final one bowled by Megan Schutt. Also Read: IND VS BAN, 2nd ODI Highlights: Bangladesh Wins By 5 Runs Richa Ghosh (26 not out 13b 3×6) performed a stunning bowl to get the Indian chase back to the track following the demise from opening bowler Smriti Mandhana (79 49b 9×4 4×6). A backward point boundary by Devika Vaidya sent the match into a shootout. The stunning Smriti seemed to be on track to bring India home but she failed to steer Annabel Sutherland into fine-leg. She kept going. She scored 76 for the first wicket along with Shafali Verma (34, 23b, 3×4, 4×4 1×6) and 61 with captain Harmanpreet Kaur (21, 22b 2×4 1×6). Smriti and Richa returned to the middle of an exciting Super Over as the Women in Blue got 20 for one point off Heather Graham. Renuka Singh conceded only 16 points, giving India an incredible win. Then, it was Beth Mooney (82 not out, 54b, 13×4) and Tahlia McGregor (70 not out 51b 10×4 1×6) who troubled the Indian bowlers. They had both scored 100 to their score in the opening game, and added 150 for an unbroken second wicket, which is a record-breaking performance in Australia on any wicket. This record was not important at all on the night.","pubDate":"2022-12-12 09:49:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiaobservers","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
