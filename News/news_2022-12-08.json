We’ve lived with this pain, through this pain since 2018,” said Candice Warner.“And it gets to a point where enough is enough.“Dave’s statement was very powerful and it had to be.“I refer to his statement where he says family comes first. There’s more important things than cricket and (David) is fiercely protective of his family and he just couldn’t … there are more important things than cricket and that’s the bottom line.“We have been through hell.“To put our family, also his teammates through everything again and the disappointing thing for David is this has been dragged out for so long. “Everything first kicked off in February and it’s now December and still no decision.”The 37-year-old was clearly emotional as she reflected on the past year.“It has been an incredibly intense, not just 12 months, but since March 2018, we live it day to day, that pain doesn’t go away,” Warner said.“It is still raw, we go to the cricket so often to watch David play and there is always people yelling things out in the crowd, or at my daughters who proudly wear their dad’s T-shirt with their father’s name on the back.“The fact my daughters have to cop abuse because of incidents that happened in the past is not fair.“My husband David, he always puts family first, he’s fiercely protective of myself and our three girls.“Cricket is not everything, cricket is what he does, but cricket does not define him and the person he is, the fact there was a lack of player welfare and no welfare about David and our family speaks volumes.”Cricket Australia were on Warner’s side in not wanting the review to become public, but the process had been derailed by lawyers and counsel who wanted a public “cleansing” of the events of 2018.Candice Warner described the process as “a joke.”“The fact that it wanted to be public … And in whose best interests is it for this to become public?” she said.“Is it for David, for the team, or for the panel’s best interests? The fact they used words like cleansing, to me is a joke.“That’s not what he wanted and I don’t think it’s what Cricket Australia wanted either. But the panel was very adamant that they wanted it public.”Australia are preparing for a Test match in Adelaide Candice said fellow players were fed up with the distraction Cricket Australia have caused by running the process through the summer when there was months during the off-season when it could have been dealt with.“Enough is enough. David has had enough, the team has had enough and it’s just time to move on now and just to get on with playing cricket. We’ve all heard too much for too long,” she said.Candice said her husband was hurt by the way the prolonged process made it look like he was campaigning for captaincy, when for him, the review was more a matter of principle that he did not deserve to be banned for life.“He is getting on in age so there was never any expectation that he was going to captain but if there was an opportunity he would have loved to have taken it,” she said.“That’s the other thing, through this whole process it’s looked like, they’ve made it out like David was campaigning to be captain but that’s not the case at all.“He was asked a lot of questions because it just kept going on and on and he just answered the questions like he would. But there was definitely no campaigning to be captain from Dave’s end.”","pubDate":"2022-12-08 01:16:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘I thank him for saving cricket’ – Aussie greats disagree over Warner debate","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/i-thank-him-for-saving-cricket-aussie-greats-disagree-over-warner-debate/video/b45c6a89040df546efa224ebcaba491c","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: For Australian Test cricketers Ian Healy and Simon O'Donnell have weighed in on David Warner's latest statement regarding his leadership ban.

Every test match live and ad-break in play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >The former ironwoman, who’s been publicly calling for David’s reinstatement to the captaincy ranks for months, went on to describe the whole review process as a “joke”.Cricket Australia ratified a change to its Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel in November, seemingly opening the door for 36-year-old Warner to have his lifetime leadership ban overturned.It allowed for applications for bans such as Warner’s “to be considered by a three-person review panel, comprising independent code of conduct commissioners.”Cricket Australia explained that the commissioners “must be satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify modifying a sanction.”While that was a positive step for Australia’s star opening batsman, he was not prepared for the commissioners to demand for the whole process to be made public.“The fact that it wanted to be public … And in whose best interests is it for this to become public?” Candice said.“Is it for David, for the team, or for the panel’s best interests? The fact they used words like cleansing, to me is a joke.“That’s not what he wanted and I don’t think it’s what Cricket Australia wanted either. But the panel was very adamant that they wanted it public.”Cricket Australia backed the Warners in arguing for the review process to play out behind closed doors, however the independent panel refused.Candice also hit out at claims her husband had been working behind the scenes to return to the captaincy ranks.“He is getting on in age so there was never any expectation that he was going to captain but if there was an opportunity he would have loved to have taken it,” she said.“That’s the other thing, through this whole process it’s looked like, they’ve made it out like David was campaigning to be captain but that’s not the case at all.”Hours earlier David Warner released a furious statement on Instagram in which he outlined the reasons for withdrawing his bid to have his captaincy ban overturned.“Despite my opposition and that of Cricket Australia, on Tuesday last week Counsel Assisting the Review Panel and the Review Panel took it upon themselves to concoct an irregular procedure (overturning presumptions and previous practice) for the determination of my application and establish a novel approach that would negatively impact the health and welfare of my family and the interests of the Australian cricket team,” he said.“In his submissions, Counsel Assisting made offensive and unhelpful comments about me that had absolutely no substantive purpose under the Code of Conduct.“Regrettably, the Review Panel acted contrary to the submissions of Cricket Australia and my lawyer and appeared to adopt virtually entirely the position of Counsel Assisting.“In effect, Counsel Assisting, and, it appears, to some extent the Review Panel, want to conduct a public trial of me and what occurred during the Third Test at Newlylands. They want to conduct a public spectacle to, in the Panel’s words, have a “cleansing”. I am not prepared for my family to be the washing machine for cricket’s dirty laundry.“My family is more important to me than cricket.“Having had nearly a week to consider that proposal, today the Review Panel has decided to ignore the request in any meaningful way and has provided a dismissive rejection of the substantive matters.“It appears that the Panel has given no more than passing consideration to issues of player welfare and the interests of Australian cricket and is instead determined to conduct a public lynching.“Regrettably, I have no practical alternative at this point in time but to withdraw my application. I am not prepared to subject my family or my teammates to further trauma and disruption by accepting a departure from the way in which my application should be dealt with pursuant to the Code of Conduct.“Some things are more important than cricket.”There is no suggestion Warner will hang up the boots just yet, with the 36-year-old recently indicating that he intends to play international cricket until the 2024 T20 World Cup, suggesting he may retire from Tests after next year’s Ashes series in England.“Test cricket will probably be the first one to fall off,” he told Triple M’s Deadset Legends in November.“Because that’s how it will pan out. The T20 World Cup is in 2024, (one-day) World Cup next year.“Potentially it could be my last 12 months in Test cricket.“But I love the white-ball game; it’s amazing.”","pubDate":"2022-12-08 00:28:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Exclusive club: Will Starc silence critics for good?","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-v-west-indies-follow-all-the-action-from-the-daynight-test-in-adelaide/news-story/ccdbb38095d11cfe90df59ea0b2a1653","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mitchell Starc needs nine wickets to cross the threshold to what history often decrees as the absolute elite level of fast bowlers.","content":"The 300-wicket milestone is a mark that many Australian fast bowling giants failed to reach, like Craig McDermott, Jeff Thomson, Jason Gillespie and Merv Hughes and it’s now on the offing for Starc to achieve in Adelaide if he can replicate his best ever return from a pink ball Test.Stand-in Australian captain Steve Smith has played alongside Starc his entire career and believes the left-arm prince of the pink ball is actually a better bowler at 32 than he was as a young tearaway.FIRST BALL IS AT 3PM AEDTAus v Win fact boxTo get to 300 wickets, as a rule you would have had to play 70 Tests, and for any fast bowler that level of longevity in itself is a mighty effort.For that reason, 300 is often seen as the mark that separates the very good from the greats.Starc is on 291 wickets as he enters his 73rd Test, and he is now within touching distance of joining Glenn McGrath, Dennis Lilliee, Mitchell Johnson and Brett Lee as only the fifth Australian fast bowler to pass 300.After he passes the magic number, only 55 wickets will separate Starc from Lillee (355) and being Australia’s No.2 fast bowling wicket-taker after the untouchable McGrath (563).It will be an exceptional achievement, and one that hasn’t come by accident. Starc has sacrificed upwards of $10-15 million dollars to bypass the Indian Premier League’s riches for the past seven years in order to refresh and fortify his body for the format he values above all others – Test cricket.SCBBL PROMOStarc’s best ever match-figures in a pink ball match was nine wickets against New Zealand in Perth in 2019, but he took eight against England in Adelaide in 2017, seven in Brisbane against Pakistan in 2016 and two more six-wicket hauls in Adelaide, including last year’s Ashes, to prove beyond any doubt that big bags with the pink ball is very much the norm.From 10 pink ball Tests, Starc has a staggering 56 wickets at just 18.41.The irony being of course, Starc was originally one of the most vocal critics of the switch to day-night Test cricket.Smith indicated he would not be surprised if Starc reached 300 in one go in Adelaide, with more tricks up his sleeve than ever before.“I think he’s improved a lot last few years. He’s got some different balls up his sleeve now. He bowls that wobble seam across the right hander quite a bit and back into the leftie which has been beneficial on wickets that are offering a bit of seam movement,” said Smith.“And then with the new ball he’s got the ability to swing it back down the line to the right hander.“Anyone that bowls left arm and above 140km/h an hour they’re a pretty good asset to any team.“Starcy, his record in pink ball cricket is exceptional and hopefully he can have another good week this week.”Watch Australia v West Indies.

new head coach of Cricket Tasmania’s female program says it was a no-brainer to climb aboard the Cane and Tiger Train for the next three years as she prepares to lead the team with a demanding yet nurturing coaching style.","content":"Jude Coleman, who officially took the reins on Tuesday following the departure of interim coach Dan Marsh, will lead the state’s top tier female program with a wealth of experience having been an assistant coach for both South Australia and the Adelaide Strikers for the past three years following a stellar playing career with her home state of Queensland.In her first appearance as Tasmania’s new head coach, Coleman said it was an exciting time in her career after changing professions in pursuit of a head coaching role.“I’ve always wanted to be a head coach and I gave up a teaching career about six years ago now to go into coaching and this was always a goal of mine,” Coleman said.“I mentioned to ‘Sal’ [former coach and current General Manager of High Performance Salliann Beams] through the interview process that I’ve been watching Tassie from afar the last few years and I really enjoy the way they go about their cricket and I love the brand and style of cricket they play.“So when this job came up it was a bit of a no-brainer to have a go.”The 41-year-old Queenslander said she would set the bar high with her players and revealed her coaching style was a combination of an ‘old school’ approach of being a hard task master with that of a relationship focused ‘player’s coach.’“I would say I’m a mix of both of those things and I certainly feel like a player relationship is really crucial but I also like to think that players have standards and would do anything for the team to meet those standards.“I do come from an old school background but having that background in teaching as well has taught me that people are different nowadays so I think that [player and coach] relationship is still really key.“It’s about really being willing to do the hard work and really drive performance but I think there’s that nurturing component to that as well so it’s setting high standards but also supporting those.” Beams, who vacated the head coaching role in August after leading both the Tigers and Hurricanes female programs since 2018, said Coleman was a shining light in the application process and would continue to set high standards in the program. “Jude was incredible throughout the process and it really came across with her passion and her want to lead, which you need a lot of energy for, but also with her passion to continue the success we’ve built here,” Beams said.“The key thing that stood out for me is she really understands what a high performance environment is.“She’s been in different environments, whether it’s domestically with the SACA (South Australian Cricket Association), from the WBBL, from CA (Cricket Australia), she’s got strong values and she knows how she wants to lead.“When you’ve been in these environments you’re very well equipped to deal with everything that’s thrown at you, and then with the strive to want to continue and push the standards and expectations.”Both Coleman and Beams said their relationship had gotten off to a great start despite the admittedly unusual predicament of the incoming coach having her predecessor as her new boss.NED-7429 Mercury Bannerjarrod.lawler@news.com.au","pubDate":"2022-12-07

Virat Kohli opened the innings after a long haul of eight years. FirstCricket Staff December 8th, 2022 1:12:28 IST Indian captain Rohit Sharma, second right congratulates Bangladesh players who won the second ODI. AP Bangladesh defeated India in the 2nd ODI and won the second consecutive ODI series against Men in Blue, seven years apart. Mehidy Hasan was the star for Bangladesh scoring a fantastic century at number eight and salvaging Bangladesh’s innings after they were reeling at 69/6 in the 19th over. Mehidy Hasan stitched a brilliant 148-run partnership with Mahmudullah for the seventh wicket as Bangladesh posted a competitive score of 271. India sent in Virat Kohli to open the innings in response as Rohit Sharma had injured his thumb in the first innings. However, the star batter was not dismissed for five. Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel gave a glimmer of hope to fans – after India lost five early wickets – registering a century stand. However, both were dismissed consecutively in a span of five overs as India’s chase derailed. Highest score at tailend position (8-11) to win an ODI Batting first 100* – Mehidy Miraz🇧🇩 v IND, 2022 While chasing 81* – Mehidy Miraz🇧🇩 v AFG, 2022 #BANvIND — Kausthub Gudipati (@kaustats) December 7, 2022 Rohit ended the innings with a 28-ball half-century and gave a scar to the Bangla Tigers, but fell short by five runs as Mustafizur held his nerve. However, the match created some interesting records and broke some existing ones – – Bangladesh took an unassailable lead in the ODI series against India winning the first two games of the three-ODI series. This is their second consecutive ODI series win over India, the previous being in 2015 in Bangladesh. – Virat Kohli opened the innings in Rohit Sharma’s absence. He opened the innings almost after eight years. The last time he opened the innings was in 2014 against New Zealand. – Mehidy Hasan registered a century batting at number eight. His century is now the highest score by a lower-order batter (number eight to 11) in a winning cause in an ODI batting first. Interestingly, he also holds the record for having the highest score in a similar position while successfully chasing – 82* vs Afghanistan in 2022. Talking points | Where India lost the plot in 2nd ODI despite Rohit Sharma’s heroics – Rohit Sharma hit five sixes in the match and completed 500 sixes in international cricket. He became the first Indian to achieve this feat and only the second batter after Chris Gayle to do so. – Mehidy Hasan and Mahmudullah stitched a 148-run partnership for the seventh wicket. This was the highest partnership for the seventh wicket against India in ODIs. – While Mehidy Hasan grasped glory for his century, he also created a unique record – he bowled two no-balls in the same over for breaking the stumps in his run-up.

FirstCricket Staff December 8th, 2022 0:08:29 IST Rohit Sharma made a valiant effort but couldn't finish on a winning note. AP Team India’s struggle with the ball in middle and death overs and their shoddy batting display once again cost them the match as they suffered a five-run loss against Bangladesh in the second ODI at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium (SBNCS) on Wednesday. Just like the opening match of the series, the second ODI turned out to be a thriller but once again it was the visitors who fell short of the finishing line. On the other hand, the hosts took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series with the win and maintained their perfect record of not losing a series at home since October 2016. Also, with the series already in their pocket, Bangladesh have sent out a loud and clear warning ahead of the 2023 ODI World Cup, scheduled to take place in India, where the conditions will be pretty similar to what the Tigers are used to in their own backyard. We fought hard till the end, but it was Bangladesh who won the 2nd ODI by 5 runs and clinch the series 2-0. Scorecard – https://t.co/e77TiXcHlu #BANvIND pic.twitter.com/yjD9hu8m7I — BCCI (@BCCI) December 7, 2022 Meanwhile, the defeat means that the Men in Blue have now lost their second successive series in Bangladesh. Here we decode where India lost the plot in the second ODI: India failed to capitalise on the momentum Having reduced Bangladesh to 69/6 in 19 overs, India had the hosts by the scruff of their neck, but instead of capitalising on the momentum, the visitors displayed a laid-back attitude in middle and death overs, and were unable to land the killer blow as they let Bangladesh bounce back in the game and set a challenging 272-run target. Mehidy Hasan Miraz stole the show Off-spin all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz turned out to be India’s nemesis for the second time in as many matches by hitting his maiden ODI century and picking two wickets to help Bangladesh seal the series. Miraz rescued Bangladesh from a horrible situation by smashing an unbeaten 100 of 83 balls. In the process he stitched a crucial 148-run partnership with Mahmudullah, who played a crucial knock of 77 runs of 96 deliveries, to help the hosts set a big target. Top order flops, yet again! India’s top order has been a major cause for concern of late in white-ball cricket. So, it didn’t come as a surprise when the Men in Blue found themselves in troubled waters early in the game as Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan, Washington Sundar, and KL Rahul fell within the first 19 overs. Interestingly, Kohli opened the innings with Dhawan instead of Rohit Sharma as the Indian captain did not come out to open after injuring his hand while fielding in the slip cordon. However, neither Kohli (5) nor Dhawan (8) failed to live up to the expectations of the fans as both the batters departed inside the opening three overs of India’s innings. A few overs later, all-rounder Washington Sundar, who was promoted up the order given his recent robust performances with the bat in the last few innings, failed to make the most of the opportunity as he departed after scoring just 11 runs. Also, KL Rahul, who was last match’s top-scorer for India, couldn’t shine with the bat this time and was dismissed for mere 14 runs as India were reduced to 65/4 in 18.3 overs. Iyer and Axar resist but middle order exposed With top order falling like a deck of cards, Shreyas Iyer, who came to bat at number 3, held the fort at one end until Axar Patel arrived at the crease and shared the burden. The duo shared a 107-run stand with Iyer hitting 82, while Axar scored run-a-ball 56 to give India hope of making it through. However, with both the set batters departing in the span of four overs, India’s middle order was exposed with Shardul Thakur and Deepak Chahar failing to make an impact and missing out on the opportunity to throw in their hats for the all-rounder’s spot. Thakur (7) was stumped while Chahar (11) holed out to leave India in a tough situation as the Men in Blue were reduced to 213/8 in 45.1 overs. Rohit showed intent and courage but couldn’t save India After suffering a thumb injury early in the match, Rohit walked into bat at number nine with a heavily bandaged left thumb in an attempt to take India over the line and played an unbeaten blistering inning of 51(28). The India captain, who was dropped twice in the 49th over, smashed five monstrous sixes and three boundaries but fell short by a huge hit to see India home. Gets hit Comes back for the team Walks in at No.9 in a run-chase Scores 51*(28) to get us close to the target Take a bow captain! 🙌 🙌 #TeamIndia | #BANvIND | @ImRo45 pic.twitter.com/v47ykcbMce — BCCI (@BCCI) December 7, 2022 Sadly, it was the absence of a proper batter or an all-rounder which was felt on the crease when Rohit was single-handedly keeping India alive in the game with his ferocious batting as tail-ender Mohammed Siraj, who was at the other end of the pitch, was only trying to save his wicket in order to allow the India captain to take the game deep and score the winning runs. However, the plan backfired to some extent as Siraj failed to rotate the strike and in the meantime, Mahmudullah conceded just a solitary run in the 47th over, while Mustafizur bowled a maiden 48th over to keep Rohit on the non-striker end and India on backfoot. However, injured Rohit didn’t give up and fought until the very last ball, where India needed a six to win the game but Mustafizur Rahman’s yorker made sure that Rohit doesn’t succeed in emulating Dinesh Karthik, who had smashed a last-ball six against the Tigers to take India past the line in the Nidahas Trophy decider in 2018. P.S. Given India’s recent performance it won’t be wrong to say that their ‘Road to 2023’ didn’t quite kick-off as they would’ve liked as the Men in Blue lost an ODI series against New Zealand before suffering the defeat in Bangladesh. Can India learn from their mistakes and rectify them before the next year’s ODI World Cup? Well, only time will tell that.

Rohit, subsequently, had to go for scans after he took the hit. However, Rohit confirmed that his finger was not fractured. “Honestly, the thumb is not too great. Some dislocation on the finger, but not a fracture, which is why I could come and bat,” Rohit said at the post-match presentation . Rohit was subsequently confirmed to be ruled out of the remainder of the tour owing to the injury. Earlier, Mehidy Hasan Miraz hit his maiden one-day international century and took two key wickets as Bangladesh prevailed over India on Wednesday. Bangladesh took an unassailable 2-0 series lead going into Saturday’s final match. The all-rounder Miraz made an unbeaten 100 and put on 148 runs for the seventh wicket alongside Mahmudullah Riyad to pull Bangladesh out from a precarious 69-6 and post 271-7 in Dhaka. Bangladesh won their second successive series against India after they got past them in their previous meeting at home in 2015.

DHAKA, Bangladesh, Dec 7, (AP): Mehidy Hasan hit his maiden century as Bangladesh recovered from 69-6 to beat India by five runs in the second ODI and seal the three-match series on Wednesday. Mehidy helped Bangladesh to an unlikely victory in the first match by staring down a 51-run deficit with one wicket at hand. He followed that by striking for exactly 100 off 83 balls, with eight fours and four sixes, to help the side post 271-7. India then came up short despite a valiant 28-ball 51 from captain Rohit Sharma, who came in as the No. 9 batter after earlier injuring his left thumb. With his side at 207-7 and on verge of another defeat, Rohit batted through injury to hit three fours and five sixes to give Bangladesh a massive scare. Needing 20 runs from the final over, Rohit smashed Mustafizur Rahman for 14 runs but couldn’t connect for a six on the last ball. Before Rohit’s heroics, it was Mehidy who paved the way for Bangladesh’s second successive home-series win over India. India pacer Mohammad Siraj swung the ball admirably to dismiss Bangladesh openers Anamul Haque and captain Liton Das, who chose to bat first. Rohit was injured in the second over and went to the hospital for X-rays. He would then return to provide India with some late hope. With Bangladesh at 13-2 in the 10th over, Umran Malik, who replaced Kuldeep Sen as one of India’s two changes, intimidated the hosts with expressive pace. He clocked one over 151km to scatter the wicket of Najmul Hossain before Washington Sundar ripped through Bangladesh’s middle order to leave the side at 69-6. Mehidy got support from veteran Mahmudullah as the duo combined for a record 148-run seventh wicket to keep India at bay. Mahmudullah made 77 off 96, including seven boundaries, before Malik dismissed him. But Mehidy, who reached 50 off 55 balls, came down heavily on India bowlers as Bangladesh amassed 68 runs in the last five overs for just one wicket.

Indian captain Rohit Sharma batted well in the final overs of this match. But he could not get the runs needed for the team’s victory. The Indian cricket team led by Rohit Sharma is touring Bangladesh and playing a cricket series. Both teams are currently playing a 3-match ODI series. The second ODI was played today. In this, the Indian team chased away the target of victory if they score 272 runs. It is noteworthy that Bangladesh won the first match of this series. Kohli and Dhawan opened the innings with Rohit Sharma injured. Both returned to the pavilion in single digit runs. Washington Sundar and KL Rahul, who followed, were out for short runs. Shreyas Iyer then put on a partnership of 107 runs with Axar Patel who came into the field. Both of them were expected to play till the end and lead the Indian team to victory. But, Shreyas got out on 82 runs and Axar Patel on 56 runs. Later, Shardul got out for 7 runs and Deepak Sahar got out for 11 runs and returned to the pavilion. In that environment, captain Rohit Sharma came to bat regardless of the injury on his left hand. He has been in ball-striking mode since his arrival. The balls hitting his bat were going for boundaries. The Bangladesh players dropped the two catch chances he gave. India needed 20 runs off the last 6 balls to win. Rohit Sharma was on strike. The first ball of that over was a dot. Next two balls are boundaries. The fourth ball is a dot. Vlasi had a six off the fifth ball. The team needed a six off the last ball to win. But that ball was bowled as a yorker and Rohit did not score any runs. So, Bangladesh won. Rohit scored 51 runs off 28 balls. It included 5 sixes and 3 fours. In the end, the Indian team scored 266 runs for the loss of 9 wickets. The Indian team lost the series by accepting defeat in this match. Earlier, Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bat. The team stumbled with the loss of 6 wickets for 69 runs. Mehdi Hasan and Mahmudullah then put on a partnership of 148 runs for the 7th wicket. Both batted well. Mehdi Hasan scored 100 runs and Mahmudullah scored 77 runs. At the end of 50 overs, the team scored 271 runs for the loss of 7 wickets. Bangladesh team lost 6 wickets for 69 runs. Then Mehdi Hasan came to the field. He batted not out till the end and scored a century on the last ball of the innings. He scored this century in 83 balls. It was his first century in ODI cricket. It included 8 fours and 4 sixes. Washington Sundar took 3 wickets for the Indian team. He was amazing by capturing two wickets in successive balls. Umran Malik and Mohammad Siraj took 2 wickets each.","pubDate":"2022-12-07 15:50:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Bangladesh 2nd ODI: ‘Middle overs and back end is hurting us a lot,’ says Rohit Sharma after loss","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/india-vs-bangladesh-2nd-odi-middle-overs-and-back-end-is-hurting-us-a-lot-says-rohit-sharma-after-loss-11770001.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Bangladesh 2nd ODI: ‘Middle overs and back end is hurting us a lot,’ says Rohit Sharma after loss","content":"Cricket India vs Bangladesh 2nd ODI: ‘Middle overs and back end is hurting us a lot,’ says Rohit Sharma after loss India skipper Rohit Sharma rued the team's poor bowling in the middle and death overs after the loss against Bangladesh in the second ODI. FirstCricket Staff December 7th, 2022 21:19:34 IST Rohit Sharma rues poor bowling in middle and death overs in the second ODI vs Bangladesh. AFP Despite a late blitz by India skipper Rohit Sharma, Bangladesh registered a narrow five-run win in a thrilling second ODI to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match ODI series at the Shere Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. Playing with a heavily bandaged left thumb, the gallant half-century from the Indian captain, who came in to bat at number 8, could not save India from a consecutive ODI series defeat in Bangladesh as Mustafizur Rahman defended 20 runs from the last over to secure a win for his team. Gets hit Comes back for the team Walks in at No.9 in a run-chase Scores 51*(28) to get us close to the target Take a bow captain! 🙌 🙌 #TeamIndia | #BANvIND | @ImRo45 pic.twitter.com/v47ykcbMce — BCCI (@BCCI) December 7, 2022 Speaking at the post-match conference, Rohit said that India have been poor with the ball in the middle and death overs. “From being 69/6, allowing them to get to 270-odd wasn’t a great effect from our bowlers. We started well but the middle overs and the back end is what’s hurting us a lot. Happened in the last game as well. It’s something we need to work on. Not taking anything away from Mehidy and Mahmudullah, was a great partnership but we also need to find ways of breaking such partnerships,” Rohit said. “In One-Day cricket, it’s about partnerships and when you get those, you have to ensure that they are converted to match-winning partnerships. That’s what they did. If you get those 70-run stands, you need to convert them into 110-120 run partnerships for the team to win games, as it isn’t easy for the new batter,” he added. Notably, Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mahmudullah steadied Bangladesh after an early shock with a 148-run partnership for the seventh wicket to post a challenging 271/7 against India. Speaking about his thumb injury which he suffered while fielding, Rohit said, “It (thumb injury) isn’t too great. Some dislocation and some stitches. Fortunately, not a fracture and so, I was able to bat.” Meanwhile, Bangladesh captain Litton Das said that he was elated to win his first series as a skipper. “Very happy, to win in my first series as captain, it feels good. We felt that 240-250 was a good score. We were under pressure but they (Mahmudullah and Mehidy) were brilliant. Don’t know what their conversations were, but what they did was simply superb. I wanted to rotate my main bowlers around because it was a good pitch in the second half, so I couldn’t afford to bowl too many of my main bowlers early on. The focus for the next game will also be about winning,” Das said. Read all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.

Walking out to bat at No.9 after injuring his hand while in the field, Rohit put up a strong fight late in the run chase. He played a sensational knock (51 not out off 28 balls) with three fours and five sixes, to give India a chance but in the end, failed to get them over the line. Rohit's tally of 500 international sixes is bettered by only West Indies legend Chris Gayle, who has 533 sixes. No other Indian batter has more than 400 sixes. MS Dhoni with 359 sixes is the closest to Rohit among Indian players. The likes of Shahid Afridi (476), Brendon McCullum (398), Martin Guptill (383) are the third, fourth and fifth place respectively in the list of most number of six hitters in international cricket. Chasing a target of 272, India were 65/4 before Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel put on a century stand to resurrect India's innings. However, Iyer and Axar fell in quick succession and Shardul Thakur followed them too which brought Rohit to the middle. His half-century propelled India late in the run chase. The Indian skipper brought the equation down to 12 runs needed off two balls and hit a six from there, but couldn't find the boundary off the last ball as Bangladesh won by five runs.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-07 15:42:51","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/12/2022_12$largeimg_2112537549.jpg","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Fighter when his country needs': Rohit Sharma wins hearts, but Twitter slams India after ODI series loss","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/rohit-sharma-wins-hearts-but-twitter-slams-india-after-odi-series-loss-11769961.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"'Fighter when his country needs': Rohit Sharma wins hearts, but Twitter slams India after ODI series loss","content":"Cricket 'Fighter when his country needs': Rohit Sharma wins hearts, but Twitter slams India after ODI series loss Rohit Sharma scored a valiant 28-ball 51 despite a finger injury but failed to take his side across the winning line as India lost to Bangladesh by 5 runs. FirstCricket Staff December 7th, 2022 21:09:36 IST Rohit Sharma made a valiant effort but couldn't finish on a winning note. AP India lost yet another ODI series to Bangladesh , though seven years apart, leaving the fans dejected with a mediocre batting display in the first two ODIs of the series. If India were dismissed for 169 in the first ODI, they failed to chase a target of 272 in the second ODI despite boasting a star-studded batting lineup. On the other side of the coin, Mehidy Hasan has been a star for the Bangla tigers, assuming prime responsibility both with bat and ball to take his side to a fascinating victory. However, the series win shall not come as a surprise as Bangladesh have a stellar record in ODIs in recent times. Rohit Sharma, despite being injured in his left thumb, played a spectacular innings snatching the victory from the claws of the Bangla Tigers, but their grip was tight enough for Rohit to snatch. While the fans celebrated and praise Rohit Sharma’s efforts, they were not happy with India’s batting performance which failed to chase a customary target. There were some interesting and praising tweets, alongside hilarious memes – Opener on most days but a fighter when his country needs him the most.

Born and brought up in America, he has been a constant voice for the welfare of farmers, workers and Scheduled Tribes. The Indian cricket team is currently on tour in Bangladesh and playing a cricket series. The Indian team is stumbling like never before in the ODI series of this tour. In this context, he expressed this opinion recently. “Almost 70 percent of the players in the current Indian cricket team are from upper castes. Team performance will be improved by bringing reservation in the game of cricket. Those belonging to the Scheduled Category will have reservation in the team. In this regard we can take the South African Cricket Board as an example. There is a practice where non-white players must be included in the national team. Everyone knows how much cash flow there is in the Indian cricket team,” he said. His comment has received mixed reviews among netizens.","pubDate":"2022-12-07 14:49:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Unfazed by repeated snubs, consistent Baba Indrajith keeps his India dream alive","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/unfazed-by-repeated-snubs-consistent-baba-indrajith-keeps-his-india-dream-alive-11769691.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["Sahil Malhotra"],"video_url":null,"description":"Unfazed by repeated snubs, consistent Baba Indrajith keeps his India dream alive","content":"“I really hope and wish that I get to play for the Indian Test team this year…”There is a lot of hope and optimism in Baba Indrajith’s voice when he makes this statement even after a series of snubs by the national selectors. A consistent performer in the red ball circuit, Indrajith is still waiting for his India A break. The last time he came close to game time with India A was back in 2017 but it only saw him spend time on the bench against Australia.Since 2016, Indrajith is yet to put a foot wrong at the First Class level and continues to score runs season-after-season. He has averaged over 66 in red-ball competitions in the last six years and has been amongst the runs for Tamil Nadu in the middle-order. The classy right-hander scored three hundreds in last year’s Ranji Trophy season, followed it up with a positive hundred in the Duleep Trophy final but still hasn’t made the cut for India A.“I have been doing very well since 2016 at the First Class level but somehow I am not able to get the break. Every time I think I will be there this time around, I get disappointed in not seeing my name there. I don’t know the reason either,” says Indrajith in an exclusive conversation with Cricketnext.Has there been any communication from the men who matter? “No communication yet from anyone but when I scored hundred in the Duleep Trophy final, I spoke to Sunil Joshi sir and he told me you are on the radar and we are following you. ‘Maybe better things in future’, he said. But even after that A tour to Bangladesh happened and my name wasn’t there. It definitely is disheartening but it’s not in my hands so can’t do much on that front,” says Indrajith.‘Natural to get frustrated’There is a shade of frustration as he recalls the period but the 28-year-old wants to stick to the process of scoring runs at every opportunity he gets and hopes to not miss again.“It is very natural to get frustrated at some point of time. I wouldn’t say I don’t get frustrated at all. It’s frustrating after a certain point because it becomes stale and you start to think where you are in life and how to take the next step. Definitely these thoughts do come in but it’s just a phase. After all this, only thing you can do is perform at the domestic level and hope you do really well so that you don’t miss out,” says Indrajith.Ranji Trophy returns with a full-fledged season this time and back to the home and away format. Tamil Nadu have enjoyed a lot of white-ball success but have struggled in the red-ball competition.Indrajith was named skipper for the upcoming season and is relishing the opportunity, and responsibility, to turn things around.“It’s very very important this season. As you said we have not been the best team in red ball over the years and we haven’t been able to qualify as well. So I think it’s a responsibility in itself. From a personal point of view, I am not trying to change or do something differently because it adds a lot of pressure.“Ranji Trophy is not an easy place. It’s important to find a pattern and whenever you get your eye in, just try and make it count and make it big. I am not trying to do anything different or new to catch the selectors’ eye because that puts a lot of pressure on me. Whenever I keep things simple, they have fallen in place. I am trying to do the same thing and not put too much pressure on myself,” says Indrajith.Hundreds are in currency as far as Indrajith is concerned. There is a popular perception that if the hundreds don’t do the job for you, get them daddy hundreds.Indrajith partially agrees and emphasises on consistency.“It’s true. Sometimes small hundreds don’t get noticed. It’s important to score that big hundred – say a double hundred to get noticed. But I personally feel that if someone is getting those hundreds consistently, even that should be noticed. Consistency is also important but it’s also important that once you get your eye in, you should make it a big one to get noticed,” says Indrajith.Positive intentThe 2021-22 season saw Indrajith score three hundreds in the Ranji Trophy and make the Duleep Trophy opportunity count with a fluent hundred for South Zone in the final. The 100s were business as usual for the right-hander but his positive intent in the middle stood out.Known to be a batter who has the ability to grind out sessions at well, Indrajith is not restricting himself anymore.“Not a conscious effort but I feel, even in the last Ranji Trophy season, I got three hundreds and the strike-rate was slightly up. Overall the mindset has slightly evolved. I am not restrictive with my mindset. If there’s a shot to be played, I don’t restrict myself anymore. Whenever I am in a calm space of mind, and getting into good positions, I feel I can strike the ball better,” he says.It was a trimmed red-ball season last time and Tamil Nadu not qualifying for the knockouts meant very little game time for Indrajith. It’s not every day that a batter hits the patch which Indrajith did last year and a few more games, in the knockouts, could have definitely boosted his chances of making it to the next level.“Obviously when you are in good form, you want to play more games. Be it Ranji Trophy or the next level – India A. Last year, we had just three matches and we didn’t win the last match against Jharkhand else we would have qualified. That would have added more value to my hundred. I would have wished to play more – maybe a quarterfinal or a semifinal for Tamil Nadu and then get a hundred there. But I am happy that I got a hundred in the Duleep Trophy final but again if it would have been in a winning cause, things would have been slightly different,” says Indrajith.While the success and consistency has come in the longer formats, Indrajith is yet to establish his reputation in the shortest format. He was part of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad this year and thoroughly enjoyed his stint with the franchise and coaches Brendon McCullum and Abhishek Nayar.Indrajith wasn’t part of the Tamil Nadu’s Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy squad and feels it is a matter of time before perception around his white-ball game changes.“It was a great experience. This is my tenth year in domestic circuit and for any cricketer who has been in the domestic circuit for so long… wants to play the IPL. It was the same with me. I really want to play the IPL… wasn’t picked in the Tamil Nadu side for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy last year so went back and worked really hard on my white ball game. Yes, perception needs to change but I never felt that I was not a good white-ball player. I also understand that perceptions are different and you need to perform at that level for people to change their perceptions.“I worked on my game, did really well in the Vijay Hazare last year, at the trials for KKR, took up keeping. I am really proud of myself because I was nowhere and then suddenly things around. I had put it in the work for a very long time and got the rewards for that. Overall it was a good experience with KKR and I am pretty sure the perception about white-ball will change pretty soon. For example, KL Rahul was termed more of Test match player early on and now he is looked at more white ball. If the basics are right, things change for everybody.“Being in close quarters with Brendon McCullum and Abhishek Nayar, I got to learn a lot. More so with Abhishek because he is lot more close to the Indian players and I spent a lot of time earlier with him at the trials and have also played with him in the past. Brendon McCullum is a very chilled out character and he focuses more on bonding the players and making them more comfortable. I learnt a lot from them,” says Indrajith.Darkness, comebacks and inspirationDinesh Karthik is a source of inspiration for many late bloomers and his comeback to the Indian squad for the T20 World Cup at 37 has injected fresh hope in many. DK’s journey, which features many comebacks, continues to give a lot of confidence to close friend Indrajith, who is mighty proud of his senior teammate.“It’s a great inspiration because it’s a great comeback to come and play the World Cup and he has made so many comebacks. I am very proud of his journey. I have seen him from close quarters and when you see what he has done, it gives you the confidence to stay at it and keep doing and make it to the next level. Even if you are 30 or 31. Age is just a number if you are fit and performing well. Things could change very quickly. Even a Mike Hussey or Suryakumar Yadav, they made their debut very late. Dinesh Karthik has made a comeback at 37 and played the World Cup as the main wicketkeeper. Being a close friend, I am very proud and treat it as a great source of inspiration,” says Indrajith.Indrajith has gone under the knife on three occasions with two surgeries to his right shoulder and one to the left. Time away from the game was a very challenging period for the right-hander who not only lost out on crucial game time but had to get back into the groove after months away from the field.“It was very difficult. It was my third surgery and it gets very difficult to play. I was away for seven months and you have to then get into shape, fitness basically match fitness. Your batting form will be different, the continuation will not be there. It was a very dark time and I have not faced these situations for the first time and it made me learn a lot of things about life. During that period, you won’t be able to play and can only do rehab. Even if you have performed well in the domestic circuit before that, you can’t continue doing that. There will be a break and lack of continuation. So to again come back into form, get into match fitness and get noticed again is not an easy thing. Being an active cricketer from a young age and then no cricket for seven-eight months, multiple times, is not an easy thing. It plays on your mind a lot,” recalls Indrajith.The upcoming Ranji Trophy season holds a lot of importance for Indrajith both personally and from a team’s perspective. He is not looking too far ahead and wants to continue enjoying the game. The snubs are there at the back of his mind but his only focus is to make it very big whenever he gets his eye in.“One of my bigger goals in life is to win the Ranji Trophy, that’s always there. I have to be realistic and practical as well. The goal is to win but I think I need to focus on the present situation first and try to do well and maybe qualify this year. On the personal front, It’s important to keep things simple and continue enjoying the game. If I don’t enjoy the game, runs won’t come. Whenever I get my eye in, these snubs will come into picture and I will look to make it very big then,” Indrajith signs off.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
