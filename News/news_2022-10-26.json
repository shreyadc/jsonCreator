Rohit bhai ke saath selfie le liya, Kohli ka ek mil jaata,” the six feet six inch right arm pacer’s sadness was palpable while speaking to PTI. The Pakistan-born pacer, who has made Sydney his home for last three years, was one of the highlights of the Indian team’s net session ahead of its T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands. Bowling with a wrong-footed action, Irfan Jr. looked like a right-arm prototype of former international bowler Sohail Tanveer. Because of his height, the 27-year-old’s natural length was back of good length area and he effortlessly got the deliveries to rear up. Dinesh Karthik was troubled by the bounce but he earned praise from none other than skipper Rohit and the team’s numero uno batter Kohli. He, in fact, got Kohli to edge one and also beat his bat with deliveries that bounced away. “My natural length is a bit back from good length. So because of my height, I trouble all kinds of batters. When Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli praise you, what more do you need. Rohit bhai said, best of luck for your future,” Irfan said. He had a very interesting story to narrate when he bowled at the Australia nets some time back. “I dismissed Steve Smith twice at the nets and he was not in good form. Since he was unable to middle my bowling, he asked me to not bowl further as he wanted to get his rhythm back,” said Irfan. Irfan plays Grade Cricket for New South Wales’ Western Suburb District, and is waiting for his PR (Permanent Residency), which might ease his way into Australian first- class cricket (Sheffield Shield). “It’s a good experience but just to let you know, I have played 22 first-class games for Water And Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and three seasons of Quaid e Azam Trophy. I have played three editions of PSL for Lahore Qalandars, Multan Sultans and Quetta Gladiators. “Once I stopped getting chances in PSL, I migrated to Australia. Obviously I dreamt of playing for Pakistan. I had played for Pakistan A and alongside Babar Azam,” said the man, who now wants to earn a Big Bash League (BBL) contract. A Punjabi born in Nankana Sahib (birthplace of Guru Nanak ji), Irfan wants to bring his family to Australia once his earnings increase. “Yes, I get paid by my grade cricket team but it’s not great money. I don’t do any side jobs. I only play cricket. That’s why whenever international teams land in Sydney, I land up at the SCG to bowl. Next Monday, I would be bowling at Pakistan nets,” he concluded.

The Black Caps can cement their place at the top of Group 1 in the Super 12’s with a big win over the Afghans in Melbourne on Wednesday after ending an 11-year victory drought away to Australia. New Zealand fans and media have dined out on the stunning 89-run win at the Sydney Cricket Ground last Saturday, and Boult admitted it had been difficult to put it in the rearview mirror. “It is hard, but we quickly got on a plane the next day and moved into a new hotel and started preparing for a new game,” Boult told reporters at the MCG. “The boys spoke leading into this tournament, into that game, of what it means to be here and how exciting it is to be on this stage, and T20 cricket is about fun. It’s about showing your skills and going out there and having a good time.” Afghanistan lost a low-scoring game by five wickets to England in their first Super 12 match in Perth but their spinners, led by all-rounder Rashid Khan, proved a handful for Jos Buttler’s batsmen. “Their spinners in general, yeah, big players for their team,” said Boult. “Obviously, Rashid, Mujeeb, none of them need an introduction. “They’re very quality bowlers and as a batting unit I’m sure we’ve done our homework on how to best combat them.” New Zealand may be reluctant to change a winning side but Boult suggested all-rounder Daryl Mitchell would be available for selection after recovering from a broken finger. “I believe he’s trained the last couple of days,” added Boult. “I can speak on behalf of Daryl and his determination and hunger to want to be out there, especially in a World Cup stage, so he’ll be doing everything he can to … be out there tomorrow afternoon.” \\ —PTI New Zealand focus on Afghanistan after hammering Australia added by KR Desk on 1:33 am October 26, 2022 View all posts by KR Desk → KR Desk Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-10-25 20:03:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket fans in uproar over 'ridiculous' Aussie farce at T20 World Cup","link":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/t20-world-cup-2022-cricket-fans-fume-ridiculous-aussie-farce-195045734.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-25 19:50:45","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/cb28a2b0-549d-11ed-b5e5-895945f48b49","source_id":"yahoo","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stoinis smashes Aussies to win, Finch makes horrible history - Daily Telegraph","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvY3JpY2tldC90MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjItbGl2ZS1hdXN0cmFsaWEtdi1zcmktbGFua2Etc3RhcnQtdGltZS10ZWFtLWNoYW5nZXMtdHYtc3RyZWFtL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvZjI1ZWFlYTdmYmY3YTQxMGQwMWFjMmJiMmRlNTM4N2HSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Stoinis smashes Aussies to win, Finch makes horrible history  Daily TelegraphT20 World Cup live blog, Australia vs Sri Lanka score: Marcus Stoinis breaks fifty record, cricket news 2022 | news.com.au — Australia's leading news site  news.com.au'Astonishing' Stoinis belts record 50 | Instant World Cup Recap | Unplayable Podcast  cricket.com.auMarcus Stoinis sets Australian record as he smashes Sri Lanka and secures T20 World Cup match win  ABC NewsAdam Zampa tests positive to COVID-19  Mandurah MailView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-25 19:13:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ENG vs IRE Dream11 Team Prediction, Match Preview, Fantasy Cricket Hints: Captain, Probable Playing 11s, Team News; Injury Updates For Today’s ENG vs IRE T20 World Cup 2022 match No. 20 in Melbourne, 930 PM IST, October 26","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/eng-vs-ire-dream11-team-prediction-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-hints-captain-probable-playing-11s-team-news-injury-updates-for-today-s-eng-vs-ire-t20-world-cup-2022-match-no-20-in-melbourne-930-pm-ist-october-26-2526660.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England vs Ireland Dream11 Team Prediction England vs Ireland T20 World Cup 20522 Match No.20 Preview - Check My Dream11 Team, Best players list of ENG vs IRE, England Dream11 Team Player List, Ireland Dream11 Team Player List, Dream11 Guru Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Playing Tips.","content":"England take on Ireland in Group 1 of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 with net run rate already a talking point after the first round of matches. England have only played Ireland once in T20Is, way back in 2010, with rain ending what could have been quite an entertaining match given that England finished on 120/8 in their 20 overs. A dozen years and four T20 World Cups later, England's T20 batting has undergone a remarkable metamorphosis, so much so that they boast of one of the best batting line-ups in the tournament this time around. England's focus will not just be on the win, but also on the net run rate in a group where the dreaded decimal point metric could easily play spoilsport. Australia gave theirs a boost with Marcus Stoinis punctuating Aaron Finch's sluggish knock with sparkle from the other end. New Zealand are already quite a bit on top with their massive win margin against Australia.

Sri Lanka too have a win under their belt and are above Australia and below England at this point. Winning would be a priority as Buttler rightly pointed out in the pre-match press conference, and England would certainly not see Ireland as pushovers after their First Round performance. \"Anytime you take things for granted or you don't respect the opposition is when you can get hurt. I think in T20 cricket especially, there's the one format where it's as level a playing field as any,\" Buttler said ahead of the game. Ireland were on a high after the thumping win over West Indies to qualify for the Super 12, but have been brought back to the ground after a nine-wicket loss to Sri Lanka. Their promising batting line-up offers plenty of hope, but to beat England, Ireland will need the bowling to step up big time. At the MCG, with the big boundary dimensions, restricting England's big hitters will be the priority. The spinners, Simi Singh and Gareth Delany, have been on and off with the ball, but will have to step up to keep England quiet through the middle overs, where they tend to attack a lot more than other teams. With the bat, the Stirling-Balbirnie pair at the top packs quite a punch, but it's probably the likes of Campher, Delany and Tector that could give Ireland's fight a real push.

Although any Australia-England match is worthy of attention, this one will allure special focus due to the hosts’ current position on Group 1 points table (read ). Considering how sheepishly Australia began a 158-run chase against Sri Lanka in Perth tonight, Finch could’ve been easily dejected during the post-match presentation ceremony. A primary reason why the same didn’t happen is because Stoinis hammered a match-winning second T20I half-century. Batting at No. 5, Stoinis took care of a victory and an improvement in the Australian NRR on the back of hitting four fours and six sixes at a strike rate of 327.77 to win a maiden Player of the Match award in this format. “It was a pretty special innings,” Finch said of Stoinis during the presentation ceremony. “To come out with that intent is the main thing. When you walk out to bat and have that presence of the crease, that’s half the battle in T20 cricket. When you got the skill that he has got, it’s a good combo.” Finch, who hailed an overall fine batting approach leading to a clinical 7-wicket victory with 21 balls to go, admitted being at the helm of a faulty innings at the Optus Stadium on Tuesday. Opening the batting with David Warner (11), Finch laboured his way to 31* (42) with the help of a solitary six. Finch, who batted at a strike rate of 73.80, registered his slowest T20I innings whilst scoring more than 30 runs. Among Test Playing Nations, Finch became the third batter after Tillakaratne Dilshan (67.34) and Salman Butt (68.75) to bat this slowest in a successful T20I run-chase. Not mincing his words, Finch acknowledged not getting going at all on a “ “. Batting at 24* (35) at the time Stoinis joined him, all Finch scored in a 25-ball 69-run partnership were seven runs at a strike rate of 100 in spite of getting his eye in for over 12 overs. Aaron Finch to Richard Illingworth over stump mic: “Happy to take any ideas if you know how to hit that” — Matt Roller (@mroller98) “My innings was unusual, poor. I couldn’t hit the ball. Would have been nice if I had kicked on earlier. They bowled the hard length, it was tough. Such a big ground, hard to stand and deliver,” Finch provided reasons for a shambolic knock which could’ve costed his team a Super 12 match had the likes of Glenn Maxwell (23) and Stoinis not hit boundaries from the word go.","pubDate":"2022-10-25 17:54:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"NZ vs AFG pitch report: Melbourne Cricket Stadium pitch report for tomorrow match T20 World Cup 2022 Super 12","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-nz-vs-afg-pitch-report-melbourne-cricket-stadium-pitch-report-for-tomorrow-match-t20-world-cup-2022-super-12/","keywords":["Cricket","Afghanistan","ICC T20 World Cup 2022","MCG","Melbourne Cricket Ground","New Zealand"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"NZ vs AFG pitch report: The Melbourne Cricket Ground will host its second and third match of the T20 World Cup 2022 on Wednesday.

The Kiwis commenced their World Cup campaign with a bang, by annihilating defending T20 World Champions Australia by 89 runs in their opening match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). While Finn Allen (42 off 16) took the Aussies by surprise with a scintillating innings at the top, his partner Devon Conway (92* off 58) batted right till the end to take the score to 200/3 in their 20 Overs. In reply whole of the Kiwi bowling department hunted collectively to dismiss Aaron Finch’s men on a paltry 111 in 17.1 Overs. Afghanistan, on the other hand, did trouble the English batters with some disciplined bowling during their opening match of the tournament, but were let down by their batters earlier, who could only manage to post 112 runs on the board. The Mohammad Nabi-led side will yet again face the stiff challenge at the MCG, where their batters will have to play to their potential best to pose a threat, considering the bigger boundary dimensions at the venue. On the aforementioned match eve, Afghan skipper Mohammad Nabi expressed his surprise on the presence of grass on the MCG pitch, as opposed to the ones he had been playing on for Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League (BBL). As per him, the new pitch will provide swing with the new ball during both the innings, as was the case during the India versus Pakistan encounter at this venue a couple of days ago. “Yes, at that time in Big Bash, it (pitch) was drier. The ball swings early on for one or two overs, but after that it will be a little bit slower, [some] help for spinners, and the ball won’t swing that much. But here the pitch is new and also a little bit green. as well, and also the weather is cold,” remarked Nabi on Tuesday. Thus, expect the pacers to take early advantage of the swinging ball’s movement off the deck during Wednesday’s contest as well. Also, with around 80% chances of rain at the venue as well, the pacers will have an added advantage, with captains highly likely to field first post winning the Toss. As for the batters, with the pitch staying true to its nature, expect them to hit through the line of the delivery much easier during both the innings.","pubDate":"2022-10-25 17:53:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Hussey OK with swapping sides in Ashes","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/hussey-ok-with-swapping-sides-in-ashes-c-8660036","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Writers"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mike Hussey, Australia's 'Mr Cricket', has revealed he would be happy to work on England's side in next year's Ashes series.","content":"Former Australia batter Mike Hussey has insisted he would have no problems with crossing the Ashes divide in future after taking up a coaching position with England at the T20 World Cup. Hussey, widely viewed as one of the greatest batters of his era, averaged 59.27 with four hundreds in 15 Tests against England and was an instrumental part of the Australian side that won the 2006-07 Ashes. Since ending his international career in 2013, Hussey has had several coaching roles and is currently preparing England's T20 batters in Australia on a short-term consultancy deal. But, if overtures were made, he would be tempted to link up with Brendon McCullum's Test side. Known as 'Mr Cricket' due to his encyclopaedic knowledge of the sport, Hussey has watched in admiration at how McCullum has transformed England's Test fortunes with six wins in seven matches. And when asked if there would be any stumbling blocks with potentially working for England in an Ashes series, the 47-year-old said: \"No, I wouldn't have any issues whatsoever. \"I've loved watching how the England Test team has gone about their cricket over the past six months. Hussey added: \"I'm probably more of a conservative type of player than Brendon so maybe it would balance out quite nicely. I'm very passionate about coaching and I love it. \"But I don't want to get into something that's going to be full-time again and then you feel like you're going to be on the road 10 or 11 months a year especially with young families involved. \"It's about getting that balance right between feeding your passion of coaching and having plenty of time at home.\" England's white-ball head coach Matthew Mott has turned to two of his Australian compatriots as assistants, with Hussey joined by David Saker, who is mentoring the bowlers. Hussey admitted some of his former team-mates have had a say on his appointment while there was even a radio phone-in recently which asked whether him taking the position was 'un-Australian'. Hussey said: \"I must admit the first time I did pull on the England shirt it was a little bit strange. \"But after that you get to work and you get to work with the players and enjoy developing those individual relationships with the guys and you forget about what shirt you're wearing. \"It's more about just helping them try and be ready to play their best cricket on game day. It's a great opportunity to be involved with a new environment, a new team and a new country. \"It's great for me to be able to learn, but also hopefully I can impart some of my knowledge as well and help a few of the players. It's more about helping players get better. \"It doesn't matter whether they're Indian, Australian, New Zealand or English, it doesn't bother me whatsoever. So a little bit weird to start with. But after that, no, absolutely fine.\" England take on Australia at the MCG on Friday in what could be a crunch fixture which determines who progresses to the semi-final stage. Hussey added: \"It'll be a slightly weird feeling as an Australian to actually hope England's going to beat Australia but that's what I'll be hoping for on Friday.\"","pubDate":"2022-10-25 17:33:29","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-8660036/103d490f6ee2db07322b5ae06be1274d41066890-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup: Rohit Sharma's poor form India's only concern, says Sunil Gavaskar","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup-rohit-sharmas-poor-form-indias-only-concern-says-sunil-gavaskar-766708","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"Rohit Sharma scored just 4 runs against PakistanIndia won the game by 4 wickets at MCGIndia’s next game is against Netherlands in the T20 World Cup","content":"Sunil Gavaskar; Rohit Sharma India legend Sunil Gavaskar believes Rohit Sharma's struggling form is a concern for Team India ahead of their Super 12 clash with Netherlands in the T20 World Cup 2022. In his last nine T20 innings, including two warm-up games and seven T20Is, Rohit did not reach the 50-run mark even once. The Indian skipper scored just four runs off seven deliveries during India's successful chase against Pakistan at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Sunday. Ahead of India's upcoming game against Netherlands, Gavaskar has said Rohit's form is the only issue at the moment, which needs to be addressed immediately. \"The only concern really has been that Rohit Sharma of late has not quite scored with the same capability we know him to. I think if he gets going it really makes people's life really easy for people to follow,\" Gavaskar said in an interview with India Today. The former captain also suggested that India may need to go slow but approach steadily in the first six overs and ensure they form the required foundation for the coming batters and not just lose quick wickets. Rohit and Co were down to 31 for 4 in the first 10 overs, once again faltering against the Pakistan pace attack. \"A good platform is what everyone looks at. You give a good platform, a good start and it makes that much easier for somebody coming down at four or five to start hitting the ball from the first ball. They don't have to give themselves time to settle in, they don't have to give themselves time to steady the ship, like India had to do against Pakistan when they were four wickets down for 31. So, even if you get a slightly slower start, maybe get to about 40 after losing 1 wicket, that is a much better platform than 31 for 4,\" Gavaskar added in the same interview. T20 World Cup: Arshdeep has shown great temperament, says Anil Kumble Meanwhile, former India head coach Anil Kumble has heaped praise on young bowler Arshdeep Singh, saying the pacer can have the same impact as Zaheer Khan had on the Indian team. \"I was really impressed with Arshdeep, how he's come through. I worked with him for three years and I could see the kind of development that he has had in the T20 format, and last year's IPL was a classic example of how he handled the pressure. \"He perhaps bowled the tough overs for the team and yeah, you don't always look at the wickets column in the T20 game, you look at what moments the bowler comes up with. And the temperament that he's shown, it's wonderful. We saw that again in the India-Pakistan game. When you have 90,000 people at the MCG, it's always challenging. So yes, Arshdeep has certainly matured and I'd like to see him carry on.

But when he does speak to the press, he does have some good quips. In a clip, he speaks about how he watched every sports column hype a rookie LeBron James, and at that moment, he decided to make him his rival. Durant has managed to do it for someone who was just a teenager. For someone in the 9th grade, Durant had lofty expectations. The duo has had some scintillating battles over the years, and until Durant slithered out of OKC, he was humbled by the King. Those years were tough on Oklahoma, because even after having the talents of , (yes, there was a time he was loved and was a beast), and a young James Harden, they did not achieve much. akin to what the Clippers are right now. The Oklahoma City Thunder of the previous decade was the New York Knicks of the east. They had such a great team on paper, but they could not do much. If you are a cricket fan, you could say they are the “South Africa” of the basketball world. If you are a soccer fan, Belgium. Loaded but outstanding underachievers. Not even the likes of Kevin Durant could do anything. Bron ran the show. Durant knows what blowing a 3-1 lead tastes like, despite not playing on the Golden State team. It was the loss in the Western Conference finals that pushed him to relocate to the Bay Area and realize his full potential. Despite all his on an individual scale, LeBron James is arguably less effective than KD. The Slim Reaper spent a considerable amount of time on the treatment table, but when he returned, he looked like a fish in water. The Brooklyn man powered through to take his team deeper into the playoffs compared to Bron. James has been struggling to put a team together that is cohesive enough to win games, let alone championships. They’ve now played four times as many games as they have won in the last 45 they’ve played. That is G-league form, in whichever world you want to consider. Durant hasn’t hit MVP form yet, but whenever he’s played, he’s looked rock solid. The golden boy of the upcoming draft, , looks to be a taller, skinnier, French version of the Reaper, and even Durant is wary. There is a noticeable shift in NBA player build, and more and more Kevin Durant regens are entering the draft.

Finch's comments came after Marcus Stoinis' \"special innings\" turned the game for Australia, who went on to win it by seven wickets at Perth Stadium. After losing their opening Super 12 fixture to New Zealand, defending champions are off the mark. Stoinis came out to bat in the 13th over when Australia were 89 for 3 and still needed 69 runs off 46 deliveries. The all-rounder hammered the Sri Lankan bowlers as he struck six sixes and four fours in his knock of 18-ball 59. He remained unbeaten and scored the runs at an astounding strike-rate of 327.78. \"Very happy. My innings was unusual, poor. I couldn't hit the ball. The way we approached with the bat was fine. It was seaming a long way there, if we could get through that, it was important to set-up the back end of the innings. Would have been nicked if I had kicked on earlier. All in all, pretty clinical. They bowled the hard length, it was tough. Such a big ground, hard to stand and deliver. Nice to get the two points,\" Finch said at the post-match presentation. Finch also heaped praise on Stonis, who scored his only second T20I half-century. Talking about Stoinis' knock, Finch said,\"It was a pretty special innings. To come out with that intent is the main thing. When you walk out to bat and have that presence of the crease, that's half the battle in T20 cricket. When you got the skill that he has got, it's a good combo.\" Australia's next game in the Super 12 is against their arch-rivals England. \"Always a great event, any format, anywhere, looking forward to it,\" said Finch about his side's upcoming game. T20 World Cup: Looking forward to playing against England, says Marcus Stoinis Stonis, who is from Western Australia, admitted after the game that he was nervous to be playing at home in Perth. \"Ronnie (Andrew McDonald) actually said to have a look at the quicks as it was doing a bit and I feel comfortable, then to have a go at the spinners. Once I got in, the plan was to keep going. To be honest, I was really nervous today being at home in Perth, a lot of family and friends here. So, I was really nervous going into it, but really happy that we ended on putting up a clinic there. Mentally I was nice and fresh, I had a bit of time of looking after the side strain, it's been sort of plaguing me on and off for a while now, but so far so good. We played here the other day against England and it was a beautiful wicket. This did look like it was doing a bit more especially with the new ball, but it's a beautiful ground and probably the best ground in Australia if not the world with the technology and lighting going on here and my home crowd, it's a beautiful wicket. We wrapped this game up and look forward to playing England at the MCG (on Friday). They are obviously a very good team, so we will do our homework again, rest up get on the flight tomorrow go on from there,\" added Stonis. Australia are scheduled to take on England on Friday (Oct. 28) at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).","pubDate":"2022-10-25 15:46:35","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/10/25/500x300_1317836-aaron-finch.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ENG vs IRE Dream11 prediction: Fantasy cricket tips for England vs Ireland, T20 World Cup 2022, Match 20","link":"https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-eng-vs-ire-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-for-england-vs-ireland-t20-world-cup-2022-match-20-2995826","keywords":["Sports","Cricket"],"creator":["DNA Web Team"],"video_url":null,"description":"ENG vs IRE Dream11 prediction: Check My Dream11 Team, Best Player's list for ENG vs IRE, T20 World Cup 2022 match 20 at Perth.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-25 15:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"dnaindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Hulk Smash!

After being beaten by New Zealand in the opening match of the Super 12, Australia elected to field and restricted Sri Lanka to 157-6. They had to make do without the services of leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who was ruled out at the 11th hour after testing positive for COVID-19. The hosts replied with 158-3 in 16.3 overs, led by Stoinis who powerfully struck six sixes in his unbeaten 59 from 18 balls. \"It was good slogging,\" man-of-the-match Stoinis told reporters. \"I was actually quite nervous to be honest. The intention was to go and put an impact on the game and probably provide a bit of energy for the boys.\" The Perth Stadium deck could have been mistaken for a WACA pitch as Australia's seamers combined for three wickets with a barrage of pace and bounce which set Sri Lanka back. Top-order batsmen Pathum Nissanka (40) and Dhananjaya de Silva (26) found boundary-scoring difficult but showed urgency running between the wickets. An outstanding flick-back on the boundary by David Warner in the 11th over deprived de Silva of a six, and five balls later the batsman departed after lofting a catch to the same fielder at long-off. Mitchell Marsh ran out Nissanka and triggered a mini-collapse, only arrested by a late onslaught from Charith Asalanka (38 not out off 25 balls) in the final overs. Fast bowler Lahiru Kumara made good use of the surface when Sri Lanka had their turn in the field, repeatedly beating Aaron Finch (31 not out) for pace. It was off-spinner Maheesh Theekshana (1-23) who struck first though, inducing a false shot from Warner (11). Innovative strokeplay from Glenn Maxwell (23) injected impetus into Australia's response, but Stoinis delivered the knockout blow as spinner Wanindu Hasaranga, the third-ranked T20 bowler, conceded 53 runs in three wicketless overs.

This was the first ICC T20 World Cup 2022 match for India and Pakistan, and they delivered a memorable display. The match will be remembered for Virat Kohli’s masterclass, as he swung the game in India’s favour on his own. India were chasing 160 runs, and they required 28 runs in the last 8 balls of the match. The way Virat controlled and managed his innings was commendable. Even Virat said that it was one of his best-ever knocks, and Indian captain Rohit Sharma also had a lot of praise for him. If Virat can continue his form for the rest of the tournament, the Indian fans are in for a treat. India’s next match is against Netherlands on Thursday in Sydney. Former Indian head coach Ravi Shastri has said that he was not surprised at all about Virat Kohli’s excellent knock against Pakistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In an exclusive column in the Indian Express, Shastri said that he was assured about Virat’s success in the ICC T20 World Cup 2022. Shastri insists that he was waiting for the same to happen as the pitches in Australia suit Virat’s play and his record against Pakistan is excellent as well. He said that Virat is made for stages and occasions like these, and he was always going to perform in these games. “I wasn’t surprised and was waiting for this to happen. I knew this would happen in Australia. Just check his record here – the pitches suit him plus he loves playing on these grounds and in front of the fans here,” Ravi Shastri said in an exclusive column in Indian Express. “His record against Pakistan has always been good and it was a big situation: cometh the hour, cometh the stage, cometh the man.” Virat’s two sixes against Haris Rauf on the last two balls of the 19th over changed the course of the match. Shastri said that those two sixes of Virat against Rauf were the greatest shots played by any Indian batter. He said that only Sachin Tendulkar’s six to Shoaib Akhtar in the 2003 World Cup comes closer to it. “In all my years of playing and watching India vs Pakistan, those two sixes off Haris Rauf are two of the greatest shots played by an Indian batsman,” Ravi Shastri added.","pubDate":"2022-10-25 12:55:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup: Team India finds falafel and 'make your sandwich' menu inadequate - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQvdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1mcnVpdHMtZmFsYWZlbC1zYW5kd2ljaC1vbi1tZW51LWxlYXZlcy1pbmRpYW5zLWxpdmlkLWFmdGVyLXRyYWluaW5nLTgyMjk0OTcv0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"T20 World Cup: Team India finds falafel and 'make your sandwich' menu inadequate  The Indian ExpressT20 World Cup - Team India Nets: Exhausted Hardik Gets Recovery Break, Focus On KL Rahul  NDTV SportsT20 World Cup: Pakistani pacer impresses Kohli, Rohit in Team India net session  Hindustan TimesT20 World Cup 2022: Indian camp not happy with food served at Sydney Cricket Ground ahead of Netherhands game – Report  Circle of CricketT20 World Cup 2022: Rishabh Pant likely to replace Hardik Pandya as India look past Netherlands tie  SportskeedaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-25 12:55:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
