A disciplined bowling performance from the victors restricted Ireland to 106-7 after 20 overs before Lara Goodall starred with a quickfire half-century to ensure the finish line was reached with five overs still left to spare. Gaby Lewis – playing her 50th T20I – won the toss and chose to bat first as Ireland looked to replicate their winning formula from the opening T20I. Lewis looked in fine touch from the get-go, twice depositing Nonkululeko Mlaba over mid-off for four in the first over. While Leah Paul initially struggled to get going – she was on one off 10 – back-to-back leg-side boundaries off Nadine de Klerk saw her enter the contest. But there was no repeat of Paul and Lewis’’ momentous opening partnership from the first T20I, as the electric Shabnim Ismail had the former pinned lbw in the fourth over of the match. Lewis deposited de Klerk for six over deep midwicket the next over but South Africa began to wrestle back control; Lewis departed in the ninth over to Mlaba for 31 after she found Ismail at long-off. Mary Waldron unfurled sweeps to both sides of the wicket off the bowling of Chloe Tryon, but Ireland went more than seven overs without a boundary during the second half of the innings. Waldron battled to 24 but Rachel Delaney (12) was the only other Ireland batter to reach double figures. De Klerk and Tumi Sekhukhune each bagged a pair of scalps, while Ismail was the most economical operator, conceding just 13 runs from her four overs. South Africa immediately laid down a marker when the chase got underway. Goodall thumped Celeste Raack for a straight six from the third legitimate ball of the innings, and a four through deep midwicket followed immediately as South Africa raced to 13-0 after one over. Ireland, on the other hand, saw a no ball, misfield and overthrow feature in that first set of six as they endured a difficult time in the field. Tazmin Brits greeted Arlene Kelly with a boundary but the right-arm quick responded well in her first over, moving the ball back into the right-hander to rattle the stumps. But Goodall and Anneke Bosch built a match-winning partnership, combining for 72 runs off 11 overs. While Bosch played anchor, Goodall was more expansive, hitting seven fours and a six on her way to the first T20I half-century of her career. There was still time for Jane Maguire to celebrate her first T20I wicket – she bowled Goodall in the 14th over – but Bosch struck Raack for four down the ground to bring an end to the encounter.

After an outstanding season in IPL 2022, Umran got his maiden call up for Team India for the T20 series against South Africa at home starting from June 9. Meanwhile, in a recent interview, Malik revealed how his mother supported him throughout his journey in cricket and motivated the speedster to continue following his passion for bowling fast as she didn't even care about any physical damage to the house when Malik used to play with the plastic ball at home. “When I was young, I would play with a plastic ball at home and would get scolded for breaking glass windows. But even then, my mother would not stop me from playing and would say, ‘khel, tod!’ (Play, break!),” Malik told Indian Express. From to for @BhuviOfficial and Umran, to get ready for the series against the Proteas #OrangeArmy #INDvSA pic.twitter.com/bOkAEloDK0 — SunRisers Hyderabad (@SunRisers) June 6, 2022 Notably, Malik's father has been selling fruits for many years and has been running a small business in Jammu. However, the 22-year-old pacer said that he won't force his father to stop working or shut down his business even if he plays for India. “My grandfather, father, and uncle have been working on it. It is not that if I am playing for India, my father will stop working. My father always tells me that we will remain where we have risen from. I come from an average family. I feel very happy that I have made my father proud.” Many young Indian bowlers impressed the experts and fans with their sheer pace in the recently concluded IPL 2022 but Malik was the standout performer because of his raw pace. The Sunrisers Hyderabad pacer had a breakout season as he picked 22 wickets in 14 matches and often clocked speeds in excess of 150 kmph. The 22-year-old seamer consistently produced quick deliveries in the IPL 2022. He bowled the second fastest delivery of the season 157 kph after Lockie Ferguson (157.3 kph) surpassed him in the final. Interestingly, in the 14 IPL 2022 games that Malik played, he won the award for the ‘Fastest Delivery’ in all SRH's matches, therefore clinching the award 14 times throughout the season. For his impressive performance in IPL 2022, the SRH pacer got the Emerging Player award at the end of the tournament.","pubDate":"2022-06-06 15:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England vs New Zealand live stream and team news: Ben Stokes takes side to Trent Bridge after Joe Root heroics give fantastic start to new era at Lord’s against Black Caps","link":"https://talksport.com/sport/cricket/1124400/england-vs-new-zealand-live-stream-team-news-start-time-how-to-follow-tv-channel-ben-stokes-kane-williamson-joe-root/","keywords":["Cricket","Sport","Ben Foakes","Brendon McCullum","England Cricket","Kane Williamson","New Zealand Cricket"],"creator":["Jack Cunningham"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Ben Stokes era of English Test match cricket couldn’t have gotten off to a better start after a gritty win over New Zealand at Lord’s.

Stokes showed energy throughout and made plenty of clever decisions with his field and bowling choices, and he wasn’t afraid to use Matt Potts or Matt Parkinson on their Test debuts. Stokes got everything bang on in his first Test as full-time captainAFP However, even though Potts was an exceptionally bright spark after taking seven wickets, including Kane Williamson twice, the returning Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad did most of the damage with the ball. With the bat, Stokes scored a good 50 before Joe Root converted his 26th Test match century and made it to 10,000 Test runs and helped England win the game after being set a target of 277 on a tricky wicket. The visitors looked to be in command after Tom Blundell and Daryl Mitchell put on 195 for the fifth wicket, but they collapsed from 251-5 to 285 all out. England got off to a shaky start, but Stokes and Root put on 90 for the fifth wicket before the Yorkshireman and Ben Foakes guided the hosts home to a huge win. It was the perfect beginning for Stokes, Rob Key and Brendon McCullum, and they need to carry that form into the Test at Trent Bridge. Root was revitalised without the pressure of the captaincyGetty England v New Zealand second Test: Date and start time The second Test between England and New Zealand will start on Friday, June 10 and it’s due to run until Tuesday, June 14.

The spinner desperately tried to stop a boundary and landed on his head. He was replaced in the field by substitute fielder Harry Brook, but after a long check, the medical team withdrew Leach from the Test. Parkinson replaced him and could keep his place even if Leach is passed fit. Apart from that, the hosts have no other injury concerns, while you would expect Potts to keep his place after a glorious debut. Meanwhile, the away side have worries about Colin de Grandhomme after he pulled up during one of his overs in England’s second innings. However, Henry Nicholls should be fit and will most likely come into the side for De Grandhomme, who is unlikely to make it to Trent Bridge. England v New Zealand: What has been said? England Test captain Ben Stokes: “It’s not an overnight thing. “This is what me and Brendon are trying to work towards and we know that, but a great start to win.: Stokes was also full of praise for Root: “There is never any doubt about Joe stepping up on the big occasions. We are very close: we’re not just work colleagues. “To see the emotion of pure joy and happiness in his first game after stepping down was amazing. As emotional as it was for him, it was fantastic for me to see a very close friend walk off after leading England to victory. It was a great day.” Joe Root said: “I’m proud of the way I did the role. I’ll do anything I can to help England win Test matches and be a side people enjoy watching and can be proud of. It got to the stage where it was time for someone else to lead that but I can try and influence it in a different way.  “It was very special to get the hundred and reach 10,000 runs, I can’t pretend it wasn’t, but nothing replicates winning games of cricket. “Of course it meant a huge amount to me, when you walk through the dressing room or through the Long Room and you’re high-fiving the rest of the group and you can see the genuine joy and elation on their faces.  “That’s the one thing that I’ve missed the most, I suppose, over the last year and a bit. And one thing I’m really looking forward to seeing a lot more of hopefully this summer.” New Zealand captain Kane Williamson: “Credit to England, it was a game that was on a bit of a knife-edge, it was finely balanced and we knew coming into this morning that if we could pick up a wicket early then we know things can happen quickly here in England. “It wasn’t to be. We struggled to get the assistance that we hoped for and an exceptional knock from Joe there, that he’s done so often and he does it again.” Offer Of The Day 888Sport – Get 11/1 Germany to win OR 18/1 England to win (£5 max stake)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply 18+ begambleaware.org","pubDate":"2022-06-06 15:30:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Walker is not Younis … Bumra, Shami, Earth is my role model” – Umran Malik","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/walker-is-not-younis-bumra-shami-earth-is-my-role-model-umran-malik/","keywords":["Sports","BOWLER","Cricket","India"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai: Young fast bowler Umran Malik has threatened the opposing batsmen by throwing high balls in the 15th IPL season which has just ended.

Many people have questioned how it is on the social media page. Former England captain Joe Root became the last player to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket yesterday. He became the 14th player to reach this milestone in Test cricket worldwide. He recorded 26 percent and 53 half-centuries in this format. He also holds the record of being the first player to cross 17000 runs in all format cricket for the England team. He reached this milestone in the Lord’s Test match against New Zealand. He had scored a hundred in this match. In this case, the root of the non-striker video has gone viral. There is no magic in it. Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look. That’s the video. The magic took place in the second innings of the England team. New Zealand’s Jameson bowled the 72nd over of the innings. Root stood on the non-striker end throughout that over. Root did not like the handle of his bat when Jamison threw the fourth ball. He did not even catch the hood for almost five seconds. That scene is currently in the spotlight. The bat stood still for a few seconds without any restraint as it stood still and held straight. Root then gracefully catches the bat.

Australia batter Steven Smith admits that his previous role refrained him from being “aggressive” and “free flowing” in the shortest format at the highest level. Known to play the “anchor role” in T20Is lately, Smith hasn’t tasted a lot of success in the format scoring 205 runs in 12 innings at an average and strike rate of 18.63 and 110.21 respectively in the last two years. “When I’m playing the role that I was picked to play previously, you’re not as aggressive or free flowing as you could be,” Smith told cricket.com.au ahead of the first T20I against Sri Lanka in Colombo tomorrow. “Then you see guys like Maxi [Glenn Maxwell] and Stoin [Marcus Stoinis] behind you and you suddenly feel pressure to turn the switch on straightaway. That’s not the way I’d generally play the game.” Part of Australia’s T20 World Cup-winning campaign in the UAE last year, there is no hiding to the fact that Smith’s T20I spot is receiving stiff competition from several batters. Set to play the first T20I at the R Premdasa Stadium on Tuesday, Smith expressed excitement at the team management volunteering to get rid of the “Mr. Fix-it” tag. Smith, who turned 33 last week, revealed a discussion with former Australia batter and stand-in head coach Michael di Venuto (promoted from assistant coach after head coach Andrew McDonald tested positive for COVID-19) with the latter asking him to “play freely”. “Diva [Michael di Venuto] actually told me the other day, he said ‘we’re getting rid of that tag, that’s gone. Just go out and play freely. If you want to smack your first or second ball for six, go for it’. “So now it’s just about going out and playing freely and trusting my instincts, which I think I’ve done well over any format for a long time, instead of being a bit more reserved and trying not to get out, which I don’t think the right way to play T20 cricket,” Smith added.","pubDate":"2022-06-06 12:10:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Getting out of bio-bubble is really very satisfying: Rishabh Pant","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/south-africa-in-india/getting-out-of-bio-bubble-is-really-very-satisfying-rishabh-pant/articleshow/92039706.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Star Indian cricketer Rishabh Pant is feeling relaxed after the Board of Control for Cricket in India decided to remove restrictions imposed on players and decided to conduct the upcoming series between India and South Africa without bio-bubbles.","content":"NEW DELHI: Star Indian cricketer Rishabh Pant is feeling relaxed after the Board of Control for Cricket in India decided to remove restrictions imposed on players and decided to conduct the upcoming series between India and South Africa without bio-bubbles.

Lara, all of 25 with a 16-match experience in Test cricket at the time, had become the ninth batter to score a quadruple century in first-class cricket.

They are a good team and they have some match winners,\" Australia captain Aaron Finch said. \"If you take someone like Wanindu Hasaranga during the IPL, he was quite handful even on flat wickets.\" In the Indian Premier League, Hasaranga went to Royal Challengers Bangalore for USD 1.3 million and he finished the competition as the second-highest wicket taker. Sri Lanka was expected to finalise its lineup after a training session under lights. \"We had a close series against Australia earlier this year and it was in their conditions — we're pretty confident that we would be able to turn things around in our conditions,\" Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka said. \"Our bowling is quite formidable but our batting needs to fire.\" Sri Lanka will be without injured top-order batters Kusal Perera and Avishka Fernando. Lineups: Sri Lanka: Dasun Shanaka (captain), Pathum Nissanka, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Charith Asalanka, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Nuwanindu Fernando, Lahiru Madushanka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Kasun Rajitha, Nuwan Thushara, Matheesha Pathirana, Ramesh Mendis, Praveen Jayawickrama and Lakshan Sandakan. Australia: Aaron Finch (captain), David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Steve Smith, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, Ashton Agar, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson and Josh Hazlewood.","pubDate":"2022-06-06 10:36:25","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/6/2022_6$largeimg_1620878706.jpg","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"UAE’s ILT20 to be held from Jan 6 to Feb 12, 2023","link":"https://www.orissapost.com/uaes-ilt20-to-be-held-from-jan-6-to-feb-12-2023/","keywords":["Sports","ILT20","IPL franchises","Six-team league","uae"],"creator":["Post News Network"],"video_url":null,"description":"Dubai: The Emirates Cricket Board will conduct the inaugural International League T20 from January 6 to February 12, 2023, with three IPL franchises owning outfits in the six-team league.

While a large majority of overseas cricketers who took part in the recently concluded 15th season of the Indian Premier League have returned home or to other countries for subsequent assignments, South African cricketers will be once again seen in action in India later this week. Part of India’s bumper home season 2021-22 , a five-match T20I series against South Africa will be the first time when an Indian home season (international cricket) will be played on both sides of an IPL season. Overall, it will be only for the second time in the history of cricket when India will be playing international cricket at home in the month of June. With the first T20I to be played in Delhi amid a heat wave on June 9, players from both the sides would be relieved at the prospect of playing only night matches in this Indian weather. India, the highlight of whose 18-member squad lies in the maiden call-ups for Arshdeep Singh and Umran Malik and comebacks for Dinesh Karthik and Hardik Pandya, will be playing without the likes of captain Rohit Sharma, former captain Virat Kohli and fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah (all rested). KL Rahul, who had led India in a Test and three ODIs in South Africa earlier this year, will be leading them for the first time in the shortest format this month. South Africa, on the other hand, will be playing with a full-strength squad with the likes of Quinton de Kock, David Miller, Aiden Markram, Rassie van der Dussen, Dwaine Pretorius, Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen, Anrich Nortje and Lungi Ngidi expected to take advantage of their respective IPL 2022 stints.

The successful completion of an extravaganza of cricket in Indian Premier League 2022 will witness India returning to international cricket after 86 days. Having played three Tests and as many ODIs against South Africa away from home earlier this year, India will now host the Proteas for a five-match T20I series. While multiple teams would’ve started playing different formats of international cricket by the time India will take on South Africa in the first T20I in Delhi on June 9, the match will resume the T20I rivalry between both these teams after almost 33 months. Readers must note that the last time when India and South Africa had played a T20I series against each other was also in India in 2019 when a three-match series was drawn 1-1. KL Rahul, who had captained India for the first time in a Test and three ODIs in South Africa this year, will be leading them for the first time in the shortest format in this series as both current and former captains in Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have been rested for this series. The iconic Feroz Shah Kotla ground, which had last hosted an India vs Bangladesh T20I in 2019, will be hosting the first India-South Africa T20I on Thursday. Been devoid of hosting cricket in IPL 2022 as well due to COVID-19 restrictions, Feroz Shah Kotla is highly likely to generate a lot of interest among fans in and around the national capital.
