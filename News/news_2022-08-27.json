Sri Lanka is set to face-off against Afghanistan in the first ‚ÄòGroup B‚Äô match of Asia Cup 2022 at the Dubai International Stadium today. As for the recent T20 format form, Afghanistan have arrived UAE with a on the back of a better form compared to Sri Lanka. Despite losing 3-2 against Ireland in the five-match T20I series around a week ago, they did manage to defeat Afghanistan (3-0), and draw Bangladesh (1-1) in the other two shortest format series this year. Having said that, it remains to be seen how they perform against top-ranked sides in the battle for the continental supremacy. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have managed to win just a couple of T20Is off the eleven they have played this year. In fact, they have managed to win just one T20I series since the year 2020, against a second string Indian side. The Dasun Shanaka-led side has lost twice against Australia and once against India in the shortest format series this year. All in all, Sri Lanka will surely start as favourites on the back of a comparatively stronger batting line-up than Afghanistan, on the basis of T20 skill-sets. Both the teams will play only their second T20I today, having last played during the 2016 T20 World Cup in India. The Countdown has begun!‚è≥ Just 24 hours left for the #AsiaCup2022 curtain raiser! ü§© üá±üá∞ ‚öîÔ∏è üá¶üá´ | August 27th | 07:30PM (SLST) #RoaringForGlory pic.twitter.com/LfdcvAwrv1 ‚Äî Sri Lanka Cricket üá±üá∞ (@OfficialSLC) August 26, 2022 The Dubai international Stadium is set to host its first T20I since the grand finale of the 2021 T20I World Cup in November between Australia and New Zealand. While the presence of dew during the World Cup here last year did play a huge role, the past few nights at this venue has not experienced much dew, which makes the case for an balanced contest between bat and the ball. For record, the chasing teams have won 13 off the 14 T20Is at this venue since 2019, with the pitch assisting the bowlers for large parts of these contests. Since last year, not once has the team total breached the 200-run mark. In fact, the average score across the 75 T20Is at this venue since 2009 is 144.6. Thus, all in all, the bowlers, especially the spinners, are likely to have much of a say during the first match of Asia Cup 2022 today.","pubDate":"2022-08-26 19:04:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England in strong position to level South Africa series after incredible Ben Stokes and Ben Foakes centuries on day two","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/19630536/england-south-africa-ben-stokes-foakes/","keywords":["Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["John Etheridge"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"BEN STOKES scripted another new scene in his dramatic life story by scoring his first century as England captain.

And it‚Äôs a great film as well. The way he played was pretty special.‚Äù It must be said that South Africa skipper Elgar had a tactical shocker to follow his erroneous decision on day one to bat first in overcast conditions. In particular, Elgar strangely under bowled speedster Anrich Njorte at the key moments. Stokes struck three sixes, the biggest of which was a mighty blow off spinner Simon Harmer over long-on that took him to his half-century. His hundred arrived with a drive back to Kasigo Rabada, who ended up inadvertently kicking the ball to square leg and allowing Stokes to run a single. Soon after, Stokes attempted a big hit and skied a catch to mid-off. Foakes‚Äô batting was almost as neat and polished as his wicketkeeping, which is saying something. He has endured setbacks ‚Äì such as a torn hamstring last summer when he slipped in the Surrey dressing room and a debilitating dose of Covid this summer. And he has been under pressure for a lack of runs at No.7 but his second Test century ‚Äì his first was on debut in Sri Lanka nearly four years ago ‚Äì will silence those comments. Foakes hardly ever missed with his favourite shots through mid-wicket and was certainly happy when Elgar seemed so reluctant to utilise Nortje‚Äôs 94mph thunderbolts after lunch. Foakes now has as many Test hundreds in 30 innings as Jos Buttler has made in 100 innings. Batting was tricky at the start and Nortje dismissed both Jonny Bairstow and Zak Crawley before England, resuming on 111-3, were level with South Africa‚Äôs first innings total of 151 all out. But those blokes, Stokes and Foakes, put England miles ahead in the match with a sixth-wicket stand of 173. Stokes was given out lbw to Lungi Ngidi on 72 but replays showed an inside edge. And he was dropped on 92 by Aiden Markram leaping to his right at cover, a difficult chance. Foakes was given out lbw to Keshav Maharaj on 28 but replays showed the ball pitched outside legside and was also missing off. Otherwise, they were in almost complete control. In fact, Stokes was caused most discomfort when his left knee suddenly locked up early in his innings and he needed treatment, not for the first time this summer.

He made his debut in Round 6 of the 2015 AFL season, helping the Dockers secure a win over Essendon in front of a crowd of 37,500 at Domain Stadium (also known as Subiaco Oval). Pearce quickly captured the attention of fans and earned himself a reputation as one of the team‚Äôs most promising youngsters.As 2016 kicked off, Pearce was considered a shining light for the Dockers in an otherwise dour season that was peppered with a string of losses.However, Pearce broke his right shinbone (tibia) during an on-field clash in a game against Richmond in Round 9, which resulted in him missing the remainder of that season and all of the 2017 season as well. His recovery was delayed as he suffered a partial fracture to the same leg during the 2017 pre-season.Pearce underwent surgery and began rehabilitation, including a stint in Los Angeles.Seeing Pearce‚Äôs potential, his club showed unwavering support throughout his recovery and Pearce made his comeback in 2018, seemingly in fine form, despite 672 days having lapsed between his 21st and 22nd AFL matches.However, disaster struck again in 2019 when Pearce fractured his left ankle in a Round 11 match against Collingwood at the MCG, forcing him out for the rest of the season and for the entire 2020 season ‚Äì resulting in a further 658 days on the sidelines.It was a devastating blow for Pearce, who was again left contemplating whether his football career was at an end. ‚ÄúObviously plenty of thoughts went through my head during that period ‚Ä¶ that career that I‚Äôve dreamt of and wanted might not be there and it might not be my choice, I might have no say in things,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce recalls of that time. ‚ÄúIt was really challenging to confront my football mortality in a way.‚Äô‚ÄôHe says when he suffered the initial tibia injury, he was disappointed but was initially confident he could recover and return quickly.‚ÄúThe first (injury) I was sort of really young and just generally excited about everything and just took it in my stride a bit and was just ready to get to rehab and come back the next year and be all good,‚Äô‚Äô he says.He didn‚Äôt anticipate he‚Äôd miss the rest of the season as well as the entire season after that.Suffering the ankle injury was a further blow, but Pearce says despite the ‚Äúincredibly difficult‚Äù time and the multiple surgeries and extensive rehab, his passion for playing football never wavered. ‚ÄúI guess during that time you have a lot of time to think about what you really want and whether I‚Äôm really committed to come back and do it all again,‚Äô‚Äô he says of recovering from injury.‚ÄúAnd during that time I realised that yep, I‚Äôm still really committed, and I‚Äôm willing to train and willing to rehab and willing to come back and still believe that I could get to a level where I could be a really successful player, in a really successful team, and that‚Äôs what sort of drove me through that period.‚Äô‚ÄôHe says the fact that the team that stuck by him throughout his injuries is enjoying success this year was made sweeter because of the hurdles he had to overcome to get where he is today.‚ÄúYeah, it has definitely been nice,‚Äô‚Äô he says of the successful 2022 season. ‚ÄúFrom a personal point of view, to be able play the majority of the games, I‚Äôve had a couple of little injuries along the way, I‚Äôve missed three games this year, but all in all I‚Äôve been able to stay out there, which has been really nice.‚ÄúFrom the middle of last year I‚Äôve been able to play some consistent footy and probably the most consistent footy I‚Äôve ever played.‚ÄúCombining that with a little bit of team success this year, that‚Äôs obviously been great. We‚Äôve spent a few years struggling a bit; last year we had a few wins and we were sort of challenging for that top eight. And then this year to be able to start the season well, and be hovering around that top four (after last weekend‚Äôs games, the club finished fifth on the AFL ladder, going into finals) ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs definitely nice. It gives this time of year a bit more meaning and to be a part of that and embrace the passion of our fans and everything, it has just been fantastic.‚Äô‚Äô Not one to get carried away by the hype, Pearce remains true to his initial goal when he made his AFL debut, which was to work on being a strong, reliable player.‚ÄúI guess that first thing is to just be a consistent player that is picked every week and that is a part of the team,‚Äô Pearce says.‚ÄúIt was probably 2016 where I was at that stage where I was playing and my spot was reasonably assured. I was starting to build towards really being one of best defenders in the comp, and that was my goal ‚Äì I wanted to be the best defender in the competition.‚ÄúAnd from that time in 2016 to now I‚Äôve had a lot of setbacks, obviously, and spent more time off the field in rehab than what I have on it.‚ÄúBut I feel like I‚Äôm performing reasonably well ‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôve still got more to give.‚ÄúThis will be nearly the most games I‚Äôve played in a season in over an 18-month stretch so I feel like I‚Äôve got plenty more improvement in me ‚Ä¶ from a personal point of view, I‚Äôve been happy with how things have been able to go.‚Äô‚ÄôHe says it has been nice to get some momentum, which he hopes will continue well into the future.‚ÄúI guess the biggest thing for me is just being able to train consistently and play consistently,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce says.‚ÄúEven though I‚Äôve played a lot this season, due to soreness and little injuries I‚Äôve been quite hampered in my training this year, so I feel like if I can maintain my fitness over the off-season and the pre-season, that will help build a bit more resilience and I‚Äôll be able to be a bit more unrestricted in my training next season.‚Äô‚ÄôHe also finds it rewarding to act as a mentor for younger players coming through the ranks.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still a relatively young team,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce says of the current Dockers line-up.‚ÄúI‚Äôm more of a senior player and leader now so to keep trying to grow the players around me, particularly our defensive group, we‚Äôre really tight and I really love playing with those eight or nine guys who I spend a lot of time with each day, so to keep making them the best they can be is a real driver.‚Äô‚ÄôHowever, he admits he‚Äôs not getting too comfortable, despite the success of this season.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just my personality that I don‚Äôt allow myself to get too comfortable or too content with things,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce says.‚ÄúThe football cycle is so quick, and one week to another you can be flying on top of the world and the next week you come crashing down.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a challenge and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve tried to learn, I guess, to try and stay a bit level-headed throughout all of these ups and downs. ‚ÄúI think particularly the role I‚Äôve had of being a leader and being captain for a lot of times this year I can often feel a bit more pressure and it‚Äôs harder to stay a bit more level and a bit more balanced ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs all part of the learning experience.‚Äô‚ÄôPearce is thankful his club stuck by him, and invested heavily in him in terms of his rehab, recovery and support.‚ÄúI‚Äôve been incredibly fortunate I guess that there‚Äôs been multiple times when I‚Äôve been negotiating a contract and I haven‚Äôt played much footy and I‚Äôve been injured and the club has continued to back me in and has shown a lot of trust me in,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce says.‚ÄúI‚Äôve just signed a contract this year for another three years, which again was another sign of faith, and I hope that I‚Äôve been able to give back a little bit and repay that faith and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be trying to do over the next few years. ‚ÄúTo be a part of our leadership group for the last four or five years and to captain the club this year was probably one of my proudest moments. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm currently doing that at the moment with Nathan (Fyfe) out, it‚Äôs an experience that I certainly don‚Äôt take for granted and it‚Äôs probably one of the most special things I‚Äôve been able to do in my career so far.‚Äô‚ÄôPearce, who grew up in Ulverstone, says sport was a huge part of his childhood ‚Äì most of his early memories relate to sport in some way.‚ÄúI grew up playing sport from when I could walk, pretty much,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce says.‚ÄúMy dad played bit of footy at Ulverstone but mainly he played a lot of cricket. My mum was quite sporty, she played soccer for Ulverstone and a few other sports.‚ÄúSo my upbringing was watching my parents play sport. I used to spend my summer weekends down at the cricket watching dad from pretty much when I could walk and they were my earliest memories. And then during the winter I‚Äôd spend all day watching the footy ‚Ä¶ watching the Robins (Ulverstone Football Club) play. So yeah, sport has always been a huge part of my life, particularly sport around Ulverstone.‚Äô‚ÄôPearce enjoyed playing footy and cricket the most ‚Äì he continued playing cricket until he was drafted. But he also played golf ‚Äì he won a national golfing title in grade nine ‚Äì and he was also a talented long-distance runner. Pearce laughs as he recalls running against ‚Äì and losing to ‚Äì Stewart McSweyn at high school, who went on to compete at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.The turning point came for Pearce at 17, when a football opportunity unexpectedly came knocking.‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt a part of the Under-16 Tasmanian team; I was happy playing footy at Ulverstone at the time, and played cricket in the summer,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce recalls.‚ÄúAnd then there was an injury in the Under-16 team, and I got a late call up and got the opportunity to play as a 17-year-old, so I was an over-age player, and that was right towards the end of the footy season. So I just parachuted in pretty much and went to one training session and went over to Sydney, I think it was, and played in the Under-16 carnival and played really well and from there that was when I started getting a bit of attention.‚ÄùHe recalls getting a letter from an AFL player manager, which was a ‚Äúsurreal‚Äù experience.‚ÄúIt was like ‚ÄòOK, people are actually taking notice‚Äô,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce says.‚ÄúNext season I was part of the Under-18 Tassie Mariners, so I had to move clubs and play at Devonport for that year. That season, being able to play some good footy for Devonport and being able to play OK in the national carnivals was, I guess, what got me drafted and that was a pretty exciting experience. That whole season, knowing that every time I went out there, there was a chance there were AFL clubs watching and that I was going to have an opportunity to get myself drafted. And lucky enough I did.‚Äô‚ÄôPearce had been considering moving to Melbourne after finishing school to study physiotherapy at university and hopefully play in the VFL if he didn‚Äôt get drafted. ‚ÄúI think I always dreamt of playing sport,‚Äô‚Äô he says.‚ÄúI always wanted to play test cricket for Australia, that was my No 1 thing.‚Äô‚ÄôBut he was also savvy enough to understand that he needed to have a back-up plan.‚ÄúI always dreamt of being a professional athlete, a footballer or cricketer, but I feel like I had enough awareness to know that even if you do play sport full-time, you need to have another career because sporting careers don‚Äôt last that long,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce says.Getting drafted obviously changed these plans, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped Pearce from furthering his education.A couple of years ago, he started a bachelor of arts majoring is psychology and politics and says it has been good to have another interest besides football.‚ÄúAt this stage it‚Äôs a really nice outlet to be able to have something that I‚Äôm invested in and it helps take my mind off football, and it takes a lot of mental capacity to keep up with everything, it keeps me quite busy,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce says of studying.‚ÄúI guess I learnt going through my injuries that it‚Äôs really hard to deal with setback and disappointment when your whole life revolves around football and at the moment I feel like I‚Äôve got a lot more balance in my life.‚ÄúIf I have a bad week of football or if something goes wrong, I‚Äôve got more to keep my mind active, and more sense of fulfilment and happiness in other things.‚Äô‚ÄôPearce does miss Tassie, and while moving to the other side of the country to play football posed some challenges, he feels like he has found his feet in Western Australia. ‚ÄúWhen I initially got drafted, I knew I was gonna have to move regardless and I was no certainty to get drafted at all, so to get drafted anywhere I was just super excited,‚Äô‚Äô he says.‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôve always been a pretty independent person, so I haven‚Äôt had too much homesickness. And moving into a football club environment I was lucky to find a lot of mates within the club and most of the guys are sort of my age and have got similar interests so that made the transition pretty easy.‚ÄúProbably the Covid years were the hardest couple, just knowing there was a period I couldn‚Äôt get back, even if I wanted to ‚Ä¶ that was probably where I felt a little bit of homesickness.‚ÄúTowards the end of the Covid period when Tassie and WA had that little travel bubble, I was able to get back and forth quite a bit, I was really lucky compared to some of my Victorian teammates.‚ÄúI‚Äôve always come back (to Tassie) at least a couple of times a year. Most recently we had our mid-season bye and I came back for about four days and caught up with a few people and just enjoyed some time in Tassie, which I always love to do.‚Äô‚ÄôThe basketball enthusiast is an avid Tasmania JackJumpers fan. Due to his footy commitments and being based in Perth, Pearce hasn‚Äôt managed to attend a live game yet, but he‚Äôs an inaugural member and follows the team‚Äôs progress online, proudly donning his JackJumpers jersey whenever Tassie gets a win.Pearce says it has been great to see the support Tasmanians have shown the JackJumpers and he‚Äôd love to see the same support for a Tasmanian AFL side.‚ÄúThe enthusiasm that (basketball) has created around the state can easily be matched and outdone by a Tasmanian footy team,‚Äô‚Äô he says.He says it‚Äôs an exciting prospect that his home state appears to be getting closer to having its own AFL team.‚ÄúI‚Äôm super excited for the possibility,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce says.‚ÄúI still very much identify as a Tasmanian and a lot of my teammates and coaches are sick of me going on about the JackJumpers and every Tasmanian sporting team there is. I grew up being sports crazy, and I think young kids in Tassie deserve the opportunity to dream about one day representing their state in the AFL.‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve got a really rich history of contributions from players and coaches, we‚Äôve given a lot to the game of football, and I feel like the Tassie community in general would really embrace a team. ‚ÄúObviously I‚Äôm a huge supporter and hopefully this push feels a bit different and it feels like we‚Äôve got some real momentum behind us so hopefully it can get off the ground sooner rather than later.‚Äô‚ÄôSo how would Pearce feel about playing against his home state in the AFL?‚ÄúWho knows ‚Ä¶ it would be a nice problem to have,‚Äô‚Äô he says.For now, of course, his sights are set on the 2022 AFL premiership. The Fremantle Dockers have made it to finals before, but since joining the league in 1994 the club has never managed to win a premiership.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt shy away, we want to be the first to win a premiership for Freo, and it would be incredibly special, obviously, to do that,‚Äô‚Äô Pearce says. ‚ÄúI feel really connected to Fremantle ‚Äì the place and our playing group and our fans. And it would mean a lot, not just to myself and my teammates, but for everyone who has represented Freo and has supported us along the way.‚Äô‚Äô‚Ä¢Following the pre-finals‚Äô bye, Fremantle will play an elimination final against the Western Bulldogs at Optus Stadium, in Perth, on September 3, kicking off at 8.10pm Tasmanian time..","pubDate":"2022-08-26 18:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄúIf he would have played‚Ä¶‚Äù: KL Rahul reckons Shaheen Afridi‚Äôs presence would have been a good experience for Indian batters during Asia Cup 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-if-he-would-have-played-kl-rahul-reckons-shaheen-afridis-presence-would-have-been-a-good-experience-for-indian-batters-during-asia-cup-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","Asia Cup 2022","KL Rahul","Shaheen Afridi"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"KL Rahul reckons Shaheen Afridi‚Äôs presence would have mattered for the Indian team as has been the case with left-arm pacers lately.

India‚Äôs wicket-keeper batter KL Rahul did not rule out the highly likely Shaheen Shah Afridi threat, as team India are set to take on Pakistan in their opening match of the Asia Cup 2022 on August 28, at the Dubai International Stadium. Pakistan fans were handed a huge blow last week when their 22-year-old champion fast bowler was rule out due to a right knee ligament injury, which he had picked up during the first Test of Pakistan‚Äôs tour of Sri Lanka last month. While some Cricket experts blame the Pakistani skipper and the team management for their careless approach in handling Afridi‚Äôs injury, the current crop of players do believe that the other pacers in their squad are match-winners as well, and can take on any side in the tournament. As for the Indian side, questions were also raised on KL Rahul‚Äôs inclusion in the team‚Äôs squad for the Asia Cup, while star batter Virat Kohli is set to garner the maximum spotlights during the high-octane clash between the arch-rivals, for not the positive of reasons. KL Rahul reckons Shaheen Afridi‚Äôs presence would have mattered Pakistan fans and some of the former cricketers have explicitly expressed their fear regarding the absence of a left-arm pacer in their team squad, as they have proved to be a cause of worry, especially for the Indian top-order during the recent T20I bilateral series against West Indies and England. Without beating around the bush or shying away from expressing his vulnerability on the same, KL Rahul did admit that the left-arm seamers around the world are indeed causing troubles for the batters, and that it would have been a great experience for his team to take on someone of the caliber of Shaheen Afridi, who is unarguably one of the best at the moment in International Cricket. ‚ÄúShaheen Shah Afridi is a world-class bowler, he is a quality bowler.

During ‚ÄòDay 2‚Äô of the second Test of South Africa‚Äôs ongoing tour of England at the Old Trafford in Manchester, England wicket-keper batter Ben Foakes has smashed his second Test century, and his first against the visitors, to take his team‚Äôs lead to 264 runs in the first innings, as the hosts declare their innings at 415/9 in 106.4 Overs. Coming into bat post with England having lost half their side, Foakes, alongside his skipper Ben Stokes, stitched together a scintillating 173-run stand for the 6th wicket, which ended after Stokes‚Äô departure off pacer Kagiso Rabada. While Stokes brought up his first Test ton as England‚Äôs Test captain, Foakes smashed his first Test match century at home, having scored his previous Test ton in Galle during his first International appearance for England in 2018. Moreover, the aforementioned partnership between the duo was the second-highest stand ever for the sixth wicket in Tests at The Emirates Old Trafford. While Stokes departed after a well compiled 103 (163) on a day when his documentary is to be released, Foakes remained unbeaten on 113* (217), as South Africa are now left to play the arduous catch-up game in a bid to Draw the Test. Ben Foakes smashes his first Test century in England The wicket-keeper batter‚Äôs century moment arrived during the 102nd Over of the innings being bowled post the Tea Break, as he cut a short and wide delivery bowled by Anrich Nortje for a boundary at the Third Man region. He brought up his second Test match ton off his 206th delivery, and has put his side on the brink of victory. Social media went abuzz in praises for the 29-year-old Surrey batter, as he hit his ton after a three-year gap.

The fall of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in July, which followed months of protests, was greeted with joy by many in Sri Lanka. However, now, even as the country tries to retain a semblance of normalcy, the remnants of an unprecedented economic crisis continue to linger. Meanwhile, it‚Äôs been more than a year since the Taliban entered Kabul unchallenged and took control of Afghanistan, which has now endured more than four decades of war. So, there is perhaps no denying the fact that cricket will be a great distractor for both teams over the next week. Afghanistan‚Äôs rise as a cricketing nation has been one of the most genuine feelgood stories of the sport. The one big positive for it is that it no longer has to go into tournaments like the Asia Cup through the qualifying rounds. Afghanistan‚Äôs cricket has improved to the extent where it is directly seeded in the main event. At the last T20 World Cup (2021), also played in the UAE, Afghanistan qualified directly by being in the top eight of the T20I rankings at the cut-off date. This marks a real departure for a team that has, in recent years, evolved from an associate nation to an embodiment of what can be achieved when ambition meets skill in sport. It helps that their fans are also likable. Like 32-year-old Kaleem Khan, a cab driver from Afghanistan, who has a poignant take on the state of affairs back home and why cricket is important. ‚ÄúI laugh when people say that sport and politics do not mix. Look at us, Afghans, and our struggles. We promote brotherhood and build relationships through playing. Aren‚Äôt these political goals as well? Sports and politics were never apart.‚Äù Speaking of politics, Afghanistan‚Äôs opponent on Saturday, Sri Lanka, is grappling with a crisis of its own. But cricket proved to be a solace. Recently, Australia‚Äôs tour of Sri Lanka took place under the shadow of a crippling economic upheaval. On day two of the second Test, large protests broke out on the fort overlooking the ground, and at the central intersection at Galle. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got protests around the ground, it really hits home how lucky we are to be travelling the world but also in some ways it‚Äôs more than just being here to play cricket, you can see the impact it can have. It hasn‚Äôt been lost on our group, something we speak about quite a bit,‚Äù Australia‚Äôs Test captain Pat Cummins had said. During the fifth ODI of the white-ball leg, the Sri Lankan fans wore yellow jerseys to thank the Australian team for touring the country. The gesture once again highlighted the beauty of sport and the power it wields. Sri Lanka has won the Asia Cup five times ‚Äî 1986, 1997, 2004, 2008, 2014 ‚Äî in the ODI format and the official host of this year‚Äôs Asia Cup will be eager to add to its tally. Afghanistan, on the other hand, will aim to give fans, reared on generations of heartache, a slice of unbridled joy and pride.

Jaiveer Shergill‚Äôs resignation from the post of the party spokesperson, is the third this month.Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma put in his papers as the chairman of the party‚Äôs steering committee for Himachal Pradesh, months ahead of the Assembly polls, citing differences with the top leadership and the way the party was functioning.Ghulam Nabi Azad‚Äôs resignation on Friday, although it had been in the offing for a while, has dealt a blow to the already crumbling party and divided senior Congress leaders in their opinion with a few Congress loyalists questioning the former Union minister and his timing while a section of others subtly indicating that his letter pointed out exactly what was wrong with the party.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The side will be high on confidence as they defeated India by 10 wickets at the very same ground in the T20 World Cup last year. However, the injury to their star pacer Shaheen Afridi is a bit of concern. The Pakistani players are habitual of playing in the UAE conditions, and they will enjoy their time out there. Pakistan failed to reach the finals of Asia Cup 2018, and the side will be eager to improve their performance this time around. It is interesting to note that India have won all the Asia Cups that have been played in UAE. Shadab Khan backs bowlers to do well in Shaheen Afridi‚Äôs absence Pakistan‚Äôs all-rounder Shadab Khan said that the injury to Shaheen Afridi is a blow for the side, but he insists that cricket is not an individual game. He showed his faith in the pacers of the side and said that the rest of the bowlers will step in Afridi‚Äôs absence. Afridi has been ruled out of the tournament with a knee injury. Although, Mohammad Wasim Jr. is also facing an injury scare, and it can be a worrying sign for Pakistan ahead of the tournament. Mohammad Hasnain has replaced the injured Shaheen Afridi in the team. ‚ÄúShaheen Shah Afridi‚Äôs absence is a blow as he is our main strike bowler. But the beauty of cricket is that it‚Äôs not an individual but a team game.

Shadab had a brilliant PSL 2022 for Islamabad United with both bat and ball. He scalped 19 wickets in 9 matches, whereas he scored 268 runs at a brilliant S/R of 162.42.

During the second day of the second Test of South Africa‚Äôs tour of England 2022 in Manchester, England captain Ben Stokes played some eye-catching shots to not let his team get affected by the dismissals of two overnight batters. Coming in to bat at No. 6 in the 34th over, Stokes hit his first boundary of the innings off South Africa pacer Kagiso Rabada in the 39th over.

However, Stokes played the shot of the morning in Ngidi‚Äôs next over dancing down the track to drive the right-arm bowler down the ground with a stamp of authority. ‚ÄúWow! That‚Äôs fantastic.

A run rate of 3.6 in the first session on Day 2 has resulted in England building a 61-run first innings lead. With five more wickets and adequate time remaining in the match, it is upon England if they are able to bat South Africa out of this match or not. The Proteas, on the other hand, would be wanting to pick quick wickets in the afternoon session for no team is comfortable with the idea of conceding a mammoth lead in the first innings. Having picked a second spinner in place of a left-arm fast bowler, South Africa should be under pressure to deliver and justify their selection tactics which comprised of tinkering with a winning combination.

India had suffered a group stage exit in the T20 World Cup last year, but will look to go all the way Down Under, having last won the tournament back in 2007.As a captain, Rohit enjoys a win percentage of 80 in T20Is, and India are yet to lose a bilateral series under him. Incidentally, Rohit was India skipper when he led his team to Asia Cup glory in 2018, beating Bangladesh in the final. However, times have changed and this time it will be a different challenge altogether for the Men in Blue.Rohit can achieve a few milestones in the Asia Cup, including surpassing Virat Kohli as India‚Äôs second-most successful skipper. Rohit needs just two wins to surpass Virat Kohli as India‚Äôs second-most successful skipper, with MS Dhoni leading that chart with 41 victories.Rohit also needs 117 runs to register 1000 runs in the Asia Cup.

The former Pakistan cricketer has 26 sixes in the continental tournament.New Zealand‚Äôs Martin Guptill (3497 runs) leads the all-time leading run-scorers list in T20Is, and Rohit Sharma (3497) requires only another 11 runs to reclaim that No 1 spot.India take on arch-rivals Pakistan on 28 August in their first match of the Asia Cup, before facing Hong Kong in their second group match on 31 August.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

During the second day of the second Test of South Africa‚Äôs tour of England 2022 in Manchester, England captain Ben Stokes welcomed South Africa spinner Simon Harmer with a six to nullify early possibility of a left-handed batter facing trouble against an off-spinner. Harmer, who bowled a solitary over on Day 1, was introduced into the attack by South Africa captain Dean Elgar in the 40th over. A loopy full-toss, Harmer‚Äôs first delivery of the day, was hit by England wicket-keeper batter Ben Foakes through the covers for a four. With Foakes running a single on the third delivery, an exciting contest between Stokes and Harmer commenced with the batter putting on display first signs of aggression. Stokes, who sat on one knee, dispatched a pretty ordinary delivery for a six through the mid-wicket region. ‚ÄúWhat a response from [Ben] Stokes. Sweet-timer, into the stands for six. Wondered whether his approach against spin would be an aggressive one. First signs of aggression from Stokes,‚Äù former England captain Michael Atherton said while calling the match for Sky Sports. Ben Stokes welcoming Simon Harmer with a six at Old Trafford First maximum of the innings! Scorecard/clips: https://t.co/e4go7z2x78 #ENGvSA pic.twitter.com/GdpsjWpitg ‚Äî England Cricket (@englandcricket) August 26, 2022 Resuming Day 2 from 111/3, England lost both their overnight batters within the first hour. Continuing his wicket-taking form, South Africa fast bowler Anrich Nortje dismissed Jonny Bairstow (49) and Zac Crawley (38) in successive overs to keep the hosts in control at Old Trafford. Readers must note that Nortje had picked wickets in back-to-back overs in the first Test at Lord‚Äôs as well. Having just completed a 50-run partnership for the sixth wicket, Stokes and Foakes hitting six fours and a six between them has powered England‚Äôs first innings lead to be in vicinity of 50 runs. England, who have ample time with them, would be looking to gain a gargantuan lead to put the visitors under pressure in the second innings and push for another early finish to a Test match.
