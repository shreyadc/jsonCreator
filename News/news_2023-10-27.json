The rug trodden by the Gypsy King and his cage-wrestler opponent in tomorrow’s crossover boxing match, Francis Ngannou , was Middle East purple rather western red. That was one of few glimpses of Arabia in the ceremony at Boulevard Hall, an arena which is the latest addition to an entertainment district in Riyadh which clearly takes its neon inspiration from New York’s Times Square. Here, why not call it The Times They Are A-Changin’? The ancient Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is being dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. And who better to help accelerate that than the most galvanising salesman in sport since Muhammad Ali ? Even though Fury is by no means the most important arrival this week, or next... Riyadh is playing host to a succession of captains of industry, global corporation heads, major bankers and construction giants. Tyson Fury is set to take on Francis Ngannou in a crossover bout on Saturday in Saudi Arabia Times are changing in Saudi under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman The lure is lucre way beyond Fury’s £50million pay night, jaw-dropping though that may be. Contracts are being commissioned for whole new cities, railways and massive sports-cum-entertaining complexes, for the creation of a new Saudi airline and the manufacture of super-jetliners to fly its routes. Oh, and the tallest building on earth while they’re at it. The wars in Israel, Ukraine or Yemen, the murder of a dissident journalist in exile, the lengthy imprisonment of social media activists including a British student, nothing will stop the most monumental development project of modern times. Perhaps in world history. Not when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman brings untold fortunes and driving force to the negotiations. Nor, let it be acknowledged, when he legislates reforms for women’s rights and in the whole way of life here which seemed impossible five years ago. Certainly not when the long term future of this land is at stake. Not even when this requires an unveiling of centuries cloaked under the strictest observance of Islam. The Gypsy King with his colourful rantings is the public face for Saturday's opening of the Riyadh Season, a three-month celebrity entertainment festival across the capital. On Monday Elon Musk and Bill Gates will be among financial giants here to talk business with he who has this much cash to play with: $1trillion for his Vision 2030 construction programme, $800bn for tourism, $700bn in Saudi Arabia’s Investment Fund. And that’s just for starters. Then there’s the star athletes. That investment has been labelled sports-washing. True, bin Salman wants the biggest and best. He already stages a grand prix, combat sports championships, golf and tennis tournaments. Then there’s the football. Cristiano Ronaldo has paved the way for the recruitment of big-name players on mind-boggling salaries to the previously invisible Saudi League. Bin Salman also expects to land the biggest fish of all. The 2034 World Cup. Don’t doubt he will. FIFA has always had its price. Cynical? Maybe. Bin Salman knows how to package just about everything. He has confirmed to the president of Palestine that he stands with him but he has only paused, not cancelled, his economic ties with Israel. However, behind all this, there is a new generation of young Saudi sports fans. Take a drive around the suburbs and you will see families gathered to watch their kids play on perfect football and cricket pitches expensively risen from the sands. The cricket World Cup sooner rather than later? Don’t bet against that either. Restaurants with names familiar to western society are everywhere: Nobu, San Carlo, PF Chang’s and all the major steak houses. There are family restaurants such as Nando’s, TGI Friday’s, Five Guys and McDonald’s. Tourism is the real name of this phenomenal game. The Israel-Hamas war has driven oil prices higher than ever but even the deepest wells run dry in the end. Bin Salman is using this freak surge in billions to transform Saudi Arabia into a major holiday destination: a different future from one which threatens boom turning to dust. Some of the world's star athletes are linked to Saudi Arabia including Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo who plays for Al-Nassr in the previously invisible Saudi Pro League The ancient monuments are here. The fascination of the desert. The mass religious pilgrimages too. Some westerners are drawn by the mirages. But bin Salman needs millions more tourists. The one hurdle is opposition of his religious elders to alcohol. Who wants a holiday without being able to enjoy a drink? Will the rich want to eat dinner without having a glass of wine or two? Thus there are whispers that one of the largest of the proposed new cities will be built on the outskirts of Riyadh as an enclave for overseas visitors where the Qatar and Dubai principle of allowing foreigners to drink in hotel bars and Michelin star restaurants is in place. In awareness of how football lovers and fight fans like their beers, future stadiums would be built with proximity access to this city. Meanwhile Fury — no idiot he — has researched the expendable wealth available here and gauged how far he can push that bulging envelope. Rome wasn’t built in a day. If the Gypsy King can help charm the protectors of Islam into letting him down one of his Jagermeisters when he returns here in December to fight Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed world heavyweight championship, then the Crown Prince might finish his empire sooner than we think. Fury v Ngannou will be televised live tomorrow night on TNT Sports Box Office.

After choosing to bat first, they were skittled for a meagre 156 in 33.2 overs, then watched as their opponents cantered home by eight wickets in Bangalore with almost half of the innings unused. The thrashing, which followed heavy losses to New Zealand, Afghanistan and South Africa, left the reigning champions ninth in the standings with an eye-watering net run-rate. With four games to go – including table-topping India and bitter rivals Australia – they are being kept off bottom spot by the only associate nation at the competition, the Netherlands. Remarkably, England are not yet mathematically out with four games to play, but the route is fanciful in the extreme and Buttler acknowledged the game was up. “It certainly looks that way and that’s incredibly disappointing. It would need a few miracles,” he said, glassy-eyed after another draining day. Sri Lanka win by 8️⃣ wickets in Bangalore. | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) “You get on the plane with high hopes and a lot of confidence and belief that we can challenge for the title, so to be sat here now with the three weeks we’ve had is a shock. It’s a shock to everyone. “I’ll walk back in the dressing room after this, look at the players sat there and think ‘how have we found ourselves in this position with the talent and the skill that’s in the room’? “But it is the position we’re in, it’s the reality of what’s happened over the last three weeks and that’s a huge low point.” Pressed on his own status in charge of the side Buttler indicated a desire to continue but a realisation that the verdict may not be his to make. In reality, England do not have an obvious successor lined up and Buttler is relatively new in the role, having inherited the mantle following Eoin Morgan’s retirement last summer. He also has a T20 World Cup win in the bank and there has been no indication that managing director of the men’s cricket, Rob Key, has an itchy trigger finger. “I think you’re always questioning as captain how you can get the best out of players, how you can get the team moving in the right direction,” Buttler admitted. “I certainly have a lot of confidence and belief in myself as a leader and captain and first and foremost as a player, but if you’re asking if I should still be captaining the team, that’s a question for the guys above me. “The tournament’s gone nowhere near the way we wanted it to…that much is obvious. As a leader, you want to lead through your own performance and I’ve not been able to do that.” Head coach Matthew Mott joined Buttler in writing off the chances of sneaking through to the last four, telling BBC Sport: “Yeah, it’s over now, I think. “I’m not a mathematician, but with our net run-rate and too many teams who are going to take games off each other, we have to come to terms with that. From now we’re playing for a lot of pride. “We feel like we’ve let our fans down, our families and supporters and everyone in that dressing room, we haven’t put our best foot forward and in professional sport, that’s what you’re judged on.”","pubDate":"2023-10-26 20:49:25","image_url":"https://www.bordercountiesadvertizer.co.uk/resources/images/17373825/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"bordercountiesadvertiser","source_priority":98087,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1d3e1da3aa8d37f0d0822a366a1547b5","title":"Defiant Jos Buttler wants to STAY as captain of one-day side despite World Cup horror show... with England all-but out after dismal defeat against Sri Lanka","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12677531/Defiant-Jos-Buttler-wants-STAY-captain-one-day-despite-World-Cup-horror-England-dismal-defeat-against-Sri-Lanka.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAWRENCE BOOTH IN BANGALORE: England need a mathematical miracle to reach the last four, but Buttler conceded his team's hopes had all but vanished before they take on hosts India.","content":"Defiant Jos Buttler wants to STAY as captain of one-day side despite World Cup horror show... with England all-but out after dismal defeat against Sri Lanka LAWRENCE BOOTH: Shambolic England are as good as out of Cricket World Cup Jos Buttler has captained this side during its miserable title defence in India He is adamant that he remains the right man to lead England's one-man side By Lawrence Booth for the Daily Mail Published: 21:10 BST, 26 October 2023 | Updated: 21:13 BST, 26 October 2023 e-mail 47 shares 24 View comments A shell-shocked Jos Buttler insisted he was the right man to continue leading England's one-day side after his team were all but knocked out of the World Cup by Sri Lanka . England need a mathematical miracle to reach the last four, but Buttler conceded his team's hopes had all but vanished ahead of the game against tournament favourites India in Lucknow on Sunday. 'It certainly looks that way, and that's incredibly disappointing,' he said. 'You get on the plane to India and we're in a really good position as a team, with everything looking like it's going to plan - and it's just not worked at all.' Jos Buttler claims he still believes he is the right man to captain England's one-day side Asked whether England's performance over the past three weeks - which has left them ninth in the 10-team table, above only the Netherlands - had left him questioning his position, Buttler replied: 'I think you're always questioning as captain how you can get the best out of players, how you can get the team moving in the right direction. 'I certainly have a lot of confidence and belief in myself as a leader and captain, and first and foremost as a player, but if you're asking if I should still be captaining the team, that's a question for the guys above me.' Buttler said there was 'no golden bullet' that could solve England's problems, but said the players - himself included - had to take responsibility. 'There's no one else who can score your runs or take your wickets. That comes from the start, from the captain at the front. I've been a long way short of my best. 'As a leader, you want to lead through your own performance, and I've not been able to do that.'

They changed their tactics and side again in making three more changes and batting after winning the toss but, really, what’s most important is having players at the top of their games when you arrive at a World Cup. And if you walked in that dressing room after this and asked the England players, hand on heart, whether they are in good nick only one or two could possibly say yes. England’s form has deserted them at the worst possible time and compare that with, say, South Africa and India , whose batsmen all seem to be in great form, and someone like Glenn Maxwell who can hit a 40-ball century for Australia . It’s easy to be wise after the event and say ‘it’s an old side, we should have picked Phil Salt or Will Jacks or Ben Duckett.’ But I would not have swapped any of the players England brought here for anyone else. England suffered another dismal defeat in the Cricket World Cup to Sri Lanka on Thursday England's form has deserted them at the worst possible time and it feels like an end of an era We are talking about some of the greatest players in our white-ball history but this has just turned out to be a bridge too far for some of them. I wouldn’t have changed the side before this tournament but I would definitely be thinking about changing it now because It does feel like the end of an era. That doesn’t take anything away from what this England side have achieved. We can be all doom and gloom and say ‘get rid of the lot of them’ but they have given us six or seven years of absolutely brilliant white-ball cricket. What they have done is magical and all round the world franchises want England’s white ball players but what they have done in the last three weeks has not reflected the type of players they are and what Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler have created. Instead they have been a sad reflection of what they have been over the last few years. What I don’t like to do is give players a cop out. We say how great they are when they win two World Cups but when the wheels come off some blame the structure of English cricket. I’ve heard people at home are doing that but this is not the fault of the Hundred or the Blast or the fact England’s best players do not play much 50-over cricket. They are just lame excuses. England have given us six or seven years of great white-ball cricket but the last three weeks have not reflected the type of players they are How much 50-over cricket do Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli play? Or Heinrich Klaasen? Players around the world learn from T20 franchise cricket and ours learn from a domestic structure that helped make them the best white-ball side in the world. The players must take the responsibility for this. I’m not a great one for cliches like playing for the badge but that’s what England have got to do now.

Perhaps they too saw what the rest of us could. England's World Cup defence was dying and, like Sri Lanka, they were ready to go in for the kill. England facing early World Cup exit after sorry Sri Lanka defeat Buttler determined to remain as England captain World Cup Daily podcast: Woeful England humiliated by Sri Lanka This situation is not new to England fans. Their Test team of the early 2010s, first captained by Andrew Strauss and taken on by Alastair Cook, was the best team in the world, but fell apart in the space of one Ashes tour in 2013-14. This white-ball outfit was a similarly great team - one that became the first men's side to hold both the 50-over and T20 World Cups - but now also lies in ruin. These things take years to build, only to unexpectedly fall apart in front of our eyes before we can quite comprehend why. And why, is the question English cricket will now be tasked with answering. Yes, the schedule has left them underprepared. Eoin Morgan's England achieved 50-over glory in 2019 after four years of meticulous planning. Then they had 88 matches of fine-tuning. Leading up to this tournament, with the focus on Test and T20 cricket, England had just 42. That number includes three matches immediately against Ireland last month when the World Cup squad was rested, three in Bangladesh without the Test players who were playing a series in New Zealand, and three more last year against the Netherlands, again when the Test players were playing the Black Caps at home. Joe Root had two 12-month spells without playing a one-day international. Ben Stokes retired for a year because of the schedule and came back again. England have not played often in 50-over cricket, and when they have it has not been with their best team. But to put the blame solely on the schedule would let a tournament that has been muddled from the outset off the hook. So too would pointing the finger only at The Hundred. England's players had long stopped playing domestic 50-over cricket before it took prime position in the cricketing calendar. Stokes has not played such a match in England since 2014, while captain Jos Buttler has not since 2016. If it did not prevent them winning at Lord's in 2019 - it cannot take all of the blame now. Instead, England should regret how their tournament has been a shambles from its very start. On 16 August selector Luke Wright pronounced the 15 players to face New Zealand in a series in September would travel to India for the World Cup. A week later Buttler said the door was not closed on the standout omission Harry Brook - a view which was repeated by coach Matthew Mott soon after. The result was their one series of meaningful preparation, four matches at home against New Zealand, became all about Brook and eventually he was added and Jason Roy omitted last minute. Next there was the curious case of bowler Jofra Archer. Hope was built up when he was named as a travelling reserve despite his elbow injury, only for him to fly to India three games in. He joined the team in Mumbai and trained for two days before being sent home when it was deemed he would not be fit after all. Such jumbled thinking has been a theme throughout. For the first game against New Zealand England stuck to a familiar formula - an XI packed with all-rounders to give batting depth and bowling options. After the defeat by Afghanistan in Delhi, with Stokes now available after his badly timed hip injury, that plan was jettisoned as six specialist batters and five specialist bowlers were selected to play South Africa. The result was the heaviest defeat in terms of runs in England's ODI history, and five days later in Bengaluru it was back to Plan A(ll-rounder). Mistakes have also been been made at the toss. Against Afghanistan, spooked by the dew which aided the Black Caps chase in Ahmedabad, England opted to bat second on a turning pitch against a batch of world-class spinners. A week later in Mumbai, Buttler made the same call against South Africa in the stifling heat, conditions Root later described as \"like eating the air\". As the bowlers cramped, England conceded more runs than ever before in an ODI. All of this has gone on with the issue of landmark, multi-year central contracts being negotiated in the background, before being announced two days before a crucial match in a World Cup. Whether that distracted players or not, it resulted in David Willey wandering around the team hotel with his young children on the day he was confirmed as the one player in the squad without a contract going forward. On Thursday he was still asked to open the bowling against Sri Lanka. A day after the announcement, Moeen Ali gave an interview to the BBC. Given a gentle opening question - \"How are you feeling going into this one, Moeen?\" - he replied: \"Obviously a bit anxious.\" Honest or not, they were hardly the words of defending champions who used to puff out their chests and dominate with bat and ball. When it came to the crunch, those worries showed as Dawid Malan's wicket sparked a sorry slide from 45-0 to 156 all out. At that point England's World Cup was done. Throughout this tournament the talk has been which of these players will want to stick around for the next edition in 2027, given the pull of franchise leagues. After the 2013-14 Ashes, two England greats Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann never played again. Jonathan Trott and Matt Prior's retirements were not too far behind. So shambolic has this showing been, some may not have that decision in their own hands. In his post-match media conference, Buttler became the latest England captain to be asked whether he is the right man for the job. The pause before answering suggested someone who could not quite believe how quickly things have fallen. From the joy of Melbourne to the misery of Bengaluru in less than 12 months. Buttler should be given the chance to stay, firstly because there is little time before another T20 World Cup in eight months. Secondly, he remains the best candidate. Cook led a rebuild after that Ashes defeat and won back the urn two and a half years later. Buttler could lead a new generation. But for now, like those Ashes series, the moment hope is lost is only the beginning on tours that provide no mercy. Sixteen days remain until England play their final game, all while the vultures circle over a once-great team. Is a new mafia getting rich on our waste?

The rug trodden by the Gypsy King and his cage-wrestler opponent in tomorrow’s crossover boxing match, Francis Ngannou , was Middle East purple rather western red. That was one of few glimpses of Arabia in the ceremony at Boulevard Hall, an arena which is the latest addition to an entertainment district in Riyadh which clearly takes its neon inspiration from New York’s Times Square. Here, why not call it The Times They Are A-Changin’? The ancient Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is being dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. And who better to help accelerate that than the most galvanising salesman in sport since Muhammad Ali ? Even though Fury is by no means the most important arrival this week, or next... Riyadh is playing host to a succession of captains of industry, global corporation heads, major bankers and construction giants. Tyson Fury is set to take on Francis Ngannou in a crossover bout on Saturday in Saudi Arabia Times are changing in Saudi under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman The lure is lucre way beyond Fury’s £50million pay night, jaw-dropping though that may be. Contracts are being commissioned for whole new cities, railways and massive sports-cum-entertaining complexes, for the creation of a new Saudi airline and the manufacture of super-jetliners to fly its routes. Oh, and the tallest building on earth while they’re at it. The wars in Israel, Ukraine or Yemen, the murder of a dissident journalist in exile, the lengthy imprisonment of social media activists including a British student, nothing will stop the most monumental development project of modern times. Perhaps in world history. Not when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman brings untold fortunes and driving force to the negotiations. Nor, let it be acknowledged, when he legislates reforms for women’s rights and in the whole way of life here which seemed impossible five years ago. Certainly not when the long term future of this land is at stake. Not even when this requires an unveiling of centuries cloaked under the strictest observance of Islam. The Gypsy King with his colourful rantings is the public face for Saturday's opening of the Riyadh Season, a three-month celebrity entertainment festival across the capital. On Monday Elon Musk and Bill Gates will be among financial giants here to talk business with he who has this much cash to play with: $1trillion for his Vision 2030 construction programme, $800bn for tourism, $700bn in Saudi Arabia’s Investment Fund. And that’s just for starters. Then there’s the star athletes. That investment has been labelled sports-washing. True, bin Salman wants the biggest and best. He already stages a grand prix, combat sports championships, golf and tennis tournaments. Then there’s the football. Cristiano Ronaldo has paved the way for the recruitment of big-name players on mind-boggling salaries to the previously invisible Saudi League. Bin Salman also expects to land the biggest fish of all. The 2034 World Cup. Don’t doubt he will. FIFA has always had its price. Cynical? Maybe. Bin Salman knows how to package just about everything. He has confirmed to the president of Palestine that he stands with him but he has only paused, not cancelled, his economic ties with Israel. However, behind all this, there is a new generation of young Saudi sports fans. Take a drive around the suburbs and you will see families gathered to watch their kids play on perfect football and cricket pitches expensively risen from the sands. The cricket World Cup sooner rather than later? Don’t bet against that either. Restaurants with names familiar to western society are everywhere: Nobu, San Carlo, PF Chang’s and all the major steak houses. There are family restaurants such as Nando’s, TGI Friday’s, Five Guys and McDonald’s. Tourism is the real name of this phenomenal game. The Israel-Hamas war has driven oil prices higher than ever but even the deepest wells run dry in the end. Bin Salman is using this freak surge in billions to transform Saudi Arabia into a major holiday destination: a different future from one which threatens boom turning to dust. Some of the world's star athletes are linked to Saudi Arabia including Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo who plays for Al-Nassr in the previously invisible Saudi Pro League The ancient monuments are here. The fascination of the desert. The mass religious pilgrimages too. Some westerners are drawn by the mirages. But bin Salman needs millions more tourists. The one hurdle is opposition of his religious elders to alcohol. Who wants a holiday without being able to enjoy a drink? Will the rich want to eat dinner without having a glass of wine or two? Thus there are whispers that one of the largest of the proposed new cities will be built on the outskirts of Riyadh as an enclave for overseas visitors where the Qatar and Dubai principle of allowing foreigners to drink in hotel bars and Michelin star restaurants is in place. In awareness of how football lovers and fight fans like their beers, future stadiums would be built with proximity access to this city. Meanwhile Fury — no idiot he — has researched the expendable wealth available here and gauged how far he can push that bulging envelope. Rome wasn’t built in a day. If the Gypsy King can help charm the protectors of Islam into letting him down one of his Jagermeisters when he returns here in December to fight Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed world heavyweight championship, then the Crown Prince might finish his empire sooner than we think. Fury v Ngannou will be televised live tomorrow night on TNT Sports Box Office.

After choosing to bat first, they were skittled for a meagre 156 in 33.2 overs, then watched as their opponents cantered home by eight wickets in Bangalore with almost half of the innings unused. The thrashing, which followed heavy losses to New Zealand, Afghanistan and South Africa, left the reigning champions ninth in the standings with an eye-watering net run-rate. With four games to go – including table-topping India and bitter rivals Australia – they are being kept off bottom spot by the only associate nation at the competition, the Netherlands. Remarkably, England are not yet mathematically out with four games to play, but the route is fanciful in the extreme and Buttler acknowledged the game was up. “It certainly looks that way and that’s incredibly disappointing. It would need a few miracles,” he said, glassy-eyed after another draining day. Sri Lanka win by 8️⃣ wickets in Bangalore. | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) “You get on the plane with high hopes and a lot of confidence and belief that we can challenge for the title, so to be sat here now with the three weeks we’ve had is a shock. It’s a shock to everyone. “I’ll walk back in the dressing room after this, look at the players sat there and think ‘how have we found ourselves in this position with the talent and the skill that’s in the room’? “But it is the position we’re in, it’s the reality of what’s happened over the last three weeks and that’s a huge low point.” Pressed on his own status in charge of the side Buttler indicated a desire to continue but a realisation that the verdict may not be his to make. In reality, England do not have an obvious successor lined up and Buttler is relatively new in the role, having inherited the mantle following Eoin Morgan’s retirement last summer. He also has a T20 World Cup win in the bank and there has been no indication that managing director of the men’s cricket, Rob Key, has an itchy trigger finger. “I think you’re always questioning as captain how you can get the best out of players, how you can get the team moving in the right direction,” Buttler admitted. “I certainly have a lot of confidence and belief in myself as a leader and captain and first and foremost as a player, but if you’re asking if I should still be captaining the team, that’s a question for the guys above me. “The tournament’s gone nowhere near the way we wanted it to…that much is obvious. As a leader, you want to lead through your own performance and I’ve not been able to do that.” Head coach Matthew Mott joined Buttler in writing off the chances of sneaking through to the last four, telling BBC Sport: “Yeah, it’s over now, I think. “I’m not a mathematician, but with our net run-rate and too many teams who are going to take games off each other, we have to come to terms with that. From now we’re playing for a lot of pride. “We feel like we’ve let our fans down, our families and supporters and everyone in that dressing room, we haven’t put our best foot forward and in professional sport, that’s what you’re judged on.”","pubDate":"2023-10-26 20:49:25","image_url":"https://www.bordercountiesadvertizer.co.uk/resources/images/17373825/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"bordercountiesadvertiser","source_priority":98087,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1d3e1da3aa8d37f0d0822a366a1547b5","title":"Defiant Jos Buttler wants to STAY as captain of one-day side despite World Cup horror show... with England all-but out after dismal defeat against Sri Lanka","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12677531/Defiant-Jos-Buttler-wants-STAY-captain-one-day-despite-World-Cup-horror-England-dismal-defeat-against-Sri-Lanka.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAWRENCE BOOTH IN BANGALORE: England need a mathematical miracle to reach the last four, but Buttler conceded his team's hopes had all but vanished before they take on hosts India.","content":"Defiant Jos Buttler wants to STAY as captain of one-day side despite World Cup horror show... with England all-but out after dismal defeat against Sri Lanka LAWRENCE BOOTH: Shambolic England are as good as out of Cricket World Cup Jos Buttler has captained this side during its miserable title defence in India He is adamant that he remains the right man to lead England's one-man side By Lawrence Booth for the Daily Mail Published: 21:10 BST, 26 October 2023 | Updated: 21:13 BST, 26 October 2023 e-mail 47 shares 24 View comments A shell-shocked Jos Buttler insisted he was the right man to continue leading England's one-day side after his team were all but knocked out of the World Cup by Sri Lanka . England need a mathematical miracle to reach the last four, but Buttler conceded his team's hopes had all but vanished ahead of the game against tournament favourites India in Lucknow on Sunday. 'It certainly looks that way, and that's incredibly disappointing,' he said. 'You get on the plane to India and we're in a really good position as a team, with everything looking like it's going to plan - and it's just not worked at all.' Jos Buttler claims he still believes he is the right man to captain England's one-day side Asked whether England's performance over the past three weeks - which has left them ninth in the 10-team table, above only the Netherlands - had left him questioning his position, Buttler replied: 'I think you're always questioning as captain how you can get the best out of players, how you can get the team moving in the right direction. 'I certainly have a lot of confidence and belief in myself as a leader and captain, and first and foremost as a player, but if you're asking if I should still be captaining the team, that's a question for the guys above me.' Buttler said there was 'no golden bullet' that could solve England's problems, but said the players - himself included - had to take responsibility. 'There's no one else who can score your runs or take your wickets. That comes from the start, from the captain at the front. I've been a long way short of my best.

They changed their tactics and side again in making three more changes and batting after winning the toss but, really, what’s most important is having players at the top of their games when you arrive at a World Cup. And if you walked in that dressing room after this and asked the England players, hand on heart, whether they are in good nick only one or two could possibly say yes. England’s form has deserted them at the worst possible time and compare that with, say, South Africa and India , whose batsmen all seem to be in great form, and someone like Glenn Maxwell who can hit a 40-ball century for Australia . It’s easy to be wise after the event and say ‘it’s an old side, we should have picked Phil Salt or Will Jacks or Ben Duckett.’ But I would not have swapped any of the players England brought here for anyone else. England suffered another dismal defeat in the Cricket World Cup to Sri Lanka on Thursday England's form has deserted them at the worst possible time and it feels like an end of an era We are talking about some of the greatest players in our white-ball history but this has just turned out to be a bridge too far for some of them. I wouldn’t have changed the side before this tournament but I would definitely be thinking about changing it now because It does feel like the end of an era. That doesn’t take anything away from what this England side have achieved. We can be all doom and gloom and say ‘get rid of the lot of them’ but they have given us six or seven years of absolutely brilliant white-ball cricket. What they have done is magical and all round the world franchises want England’s white ball players but what they have done in the last three weeks has not reflected the type of players they are and what Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler have created. Instead they have been a sad reflection of what they have been over the last few years. What I don’t like to do is give players a cop out. We say how great they are when they win two World Cups but when the wheels come off some blame the structure of English cricket. I’ve heard people at home are doing that but this is not the fault of the Hundred or the Blast or the fact England’s best players do not play much 50-over cricket. They are just lame excuses. England have given us six or seven years of great white-ball cricket but the last three weeks have not reflected the type of players they are How much 50-over cricket do Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli play? Or Heinrich Klaasen? Players around the world learn from T20 franchise cricket and ours learn from a domestic structure that helped make them the best white-ball side in the world. The players must take the responsibility for this. I’m not a great one for cliches like playing for the badge but that’s what England have got to do now. They have to go to Lucknow on Sunday and spoil India’s party. They must remind India and the world just how great cricketers they have been – and still are.

Perhaps they too saw what the rest of us could. England's World Cup defence was dying and, like Sri Lanka, they were ready to go in for the kill. England facing early World Cup exit after sorry Sri Lanka defeat Buttler determined to remain as England captain World Cup Daily podcast: Woeful England humiliated by Sri Lanka This situation is not new to England fans. Their Test team of the early 2010s, first captained by Andrew Strauss and taken on by Alastair Cook, was the best team in the world, but fell apart in the space of one Ashes tour in 2013-14. This white-ball outfit was a similarly great team - one that became the first men's side to hold both the 50-over and T20 World Cups - but now also lies in ruin. These things take years to build, only to unexpectedly fall apart in front of our eyes before we can quite comprehend why. And why, is the question English cricket will now be tasked with answering. Yes, the schedule has left them underprepared. Eoin Morgan's England achieved 50-over glory in 2019 after four years of meticulous planning. Then they had 88 matches of fine-tuning. Leading up to this tournament, with the focus on Test and T20 cricket, England had just 42. That number includes three matches immediately against Ireland last month when the World Cup squad was rested, three in Bangladesh without the Test players who were playing a series in New Zealand, and three more last year against the Netherlands, again when the Test players were playing the Black Caps at home. Joe Root had two 12-month spells without playing a one-day international. Ben Stokes retired for a year because of the schedule and came back again. England have not played often in 50-over cricket, and when they have it has not been with their best team. But to put the blame solely on the schedule would let a tournament that has been muddled from the outset off the hook. So too would pointing the finger only at The Hundred. England's players had long stopped playing domestic 50-over cricket before it took prime position in the cricketing calendar. Stokes has not played such a match in England since 2014, while captain Jos Buttler has not since 2016. If it did not prevent them winning at Lord's in 2019 - it cannot take all of the blame now. Instead, England should regret how their tournament has been a shambles from its very start. On 16 August selector Luke Wright pronounced the 15 players to face New Zealand in a series in September would travel to India for the World Cup. A week later Buttler said the door was not closed on the standout omission Harry Brook - a view which was repeated by coach Matthew Mott soon after. The result was their one series of meaningful preparation, four matches at home against New Zealand, became all about Brook and eventually he was added and Jason Roy omitted last minute. Next there was the curious case of bowler Jofra Archer. Hope was built up when he was named as a travelling reserve despite his elbow injury, only for him to fly to India three games in. He joined the team in Mumbai and trained for two days before being sent home when it was deemed he would not be fit after all. Such jumbled thinking has been a theme throughout. For the first game against New Zealand England stuck to a familiar formula - an XI packed with all-rounders to give batting depth and bowling options. After the defeat by Afghanistan in Delhi, with Stokes now available after his badly timed hip injury, that plan was jettisoned as six specialist batters and five specialist bowlers were selected to play South Africa. The result was the heaviest defeat in terms of runs in England's ODI history, and five days later in Bengaluru it was back to Plan A(ll-rounder). Mistakes have also been been made at the toss. Against Afghanistan, spooked by the dew which aided the Black Caps chase in Ahmedabad, England opted to bat second on a turning pitch against a batch of world-class spinners. A week later in Mumbai, Buttler made the same call against South Africa in the stifling heat, conditions Root later described as \"like eating the air\". As the bowlers cramped, England conceded more runs than ever before in an ODI. All of this has gone on with the issue of landmark, multi-year central contracts being negotiated in the background, before being announced two days before a crucial match in a World Cup. Whether that distracted players or not, it resulted in David Willey wandering around the team hotel with his young children on the day he was confirmed as the one player in the squad without a contract going forward. On Thursday he was still asked to open the bowling against Sri Lanka. A day after the announcement, Moeen Ali gave an interview to the BBC. Given a gentle opening question - \"How are you feeling going into this one, Moeen?\" - he replied: \"Obviously a bit anxious.\" Honest or not, they were hardly the words of defending champions who used to puff out their chests and dominate with bat and ball. When it came to the crunch, those worries showed as Dawid Malan's wicket sparked a sorry slide from 45-0 to 156 all out. At that point England's World Cup was done. Throughout this tournament the talk has been which of these players will want to stick around for the next edition in 2027, given the pull of franchise leagues. After the 2013-14 Ashes, two England greats Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann never played again. Jonathan Trott and Matt Prior's retirements were not too far behind. So shambolic has this showing been, some may not have that decision in their own hands. In his post-match media conference, Buttler became the latest England captain to be asked whether he is the right man for the job. The pause before answering suggested someone who could not quite believe how quickly things have fallen. From the joy of Melbourne to the misery of Bengaluru in less than 12 months. Buttler should be given the chance to stay, firstly because there is little time before another T20 World Cup in eight months. Secondly, he remains the best candidate. Cook led a rebuild after that Ashes defeat and won back the urn two and a half years later. Buttler could lead a new generation. But for now, like those Ashes series, the moment hope is lost is only the beginning on tours that provide no mercy. Sixteen days remain until England play their final game, all while the vultures circle over a once-great team. Is a new mafia getting rich on our waste?

The rug trodden by the Gypsy King and his cage-wrestler opponent in tomorrow’s crossover boxing match, Francis Ngannou , was Middle East purple rather western red. That was one of few glimpses of Arabia in the ceremony at Boulevard Hall, an arena which is the latest addition to an entertainment district in Riyadh which clearly takes its neon inspiration from New York’s Times Square. Here, why not call it The Times They Are A-Changin’? The ancient Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is being dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. And who better to help accelerate that than the most galvanising salesman in sport since Muhammad Ali ? Even though Fury is by no means the most important arrival this week, or next... Riyadh is playing host to a succession of captains of industry, global corporation heads, major bankers and construction giants. Tyson Fury is set to take on Francis Ngannou in a crossover bout on Saturday in Saudi Arabia Times are changing in Saudi under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman The lure is lucre way beyond Fury’s £50million pay night, jaw-dropping though that may be. Contracts are being commissioned for whole new cities, railways and massive sports-cum-entertaining complexes, for the creation of a new Saudi airline and the manufacture of super-jetliners to fly its routes. Oh, and the tallest building on earth while they’re at it. The wars in Israel, Ukraine or Yemen, the murder of a dissident journalist in exile, the lengthy imprisonment of social media activists including a British student, nothing will stop the most monumental development project of modern times. Perhaps in world history. Not when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman brings untold fortunes and driving force to the negotiations. Nor, let it be acknowledged, when he legislates reforms for women’s rights and in the whole way of life here which seemed impossible five years ago. Certainly not when the long term future of this land is at stake. Not even when this requires an unveiling of centuries cloaked under the strictest observance of Islam. The Gypsy King with his colourful rantings is the public face for Saturday's opening of the Riyadh Season, a three-month celebrity entertainment festival across the capital. On Monday Elon Musk and Bill Gates will be among financial giants here to talk business with he who has this much cash to play with: $1trillion for his Vision 2030 construction programme, $800bn for tourism, $700bn in Saudi Arabia’s Investment Fund. And that’s just for starters. Then there’s the star athletes. That investment has been labelled sports-washing. True, bin Salman wants the biggest and best. He already stages a grand prix, combat sports championships, golf and tennis tournaments. Then there’s the football. Cristiano Ronaldo has paved the way for the recruitment of big-name players on mind-boggling salaries to the previously invisible Saudi League. Bin Salman also expects to land the biggest fish of all. The 2034 World Cup. Don’t doubt he will. FIFA has always had its price. Cynical? Maybe. Bin Salman knows how to package just about everything. He has confirmed to the president of Palestine that he stands with him but he has only paused, not cancelled, his economic ties with Israel. However, behind all this, there is a new generation of young Saudi sports fans. Take a drive around the suburbs and you will see families gathered to watch their kids play on perfect football and cricket pitches expensively risen from the sands. The cricket World Cup sooner rather than later? Don’t bet against that either. Restaurants with names familiar to western society are everywhere: Nobu, San Carlo, PF Chang’s and all the major steak houses. There are family restaurants such as Nando’s, TGI Friday’s, Five Guys and McDonald’s. Tourism is the real name of this phenomenal game. The Israel-Hamas war has driven oil prices higher than ever but even the deepest wells run dry in the end. Bin Salman is using this freak surge in billions to transform Saudi Arabia into a major holiday destination: a different future from one which threatens boom turning to dust. Some of the world's star athletes are linked to Saudi Arabia including Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo who plays for Al-Nassr in the previously invisible Saudi Pro League The ancient monuments are here. The fascination of the desert. The mass religious pilgrimages too. Some westerners are drawn by the mirages. But bin Salman needs millions more tourists. The one hurdle is opposition of his religious elders to alcohol. Who wants a holiday without being able to enjoy a drink? Will the rich want to eat dinner without having a glass of wine or two? Thus there are whispers that one of the largest of the proposed new cities will be built on the outskirts of Riyadh as an enclave for overseas visitors where the Qatar and Dubai principle of allowing foreigners to drink in hotel bars and Michelin star restaurants is in place. In awareness of how football lovers and fight fans like their beers, future stadiums would be built with proximity access to this city. Meanwhile Fury — no idiot he — has researched the expendable wealth available here and gauged how far he can push that bulging envelope. Rome wasn’t built in a day. If the Gypsy King can help charm the protectors of Islam into letting him down one of his Jagermeisters when he returns here in December to fight Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed world heavyweight championship, then the Crown Prince might finish his empire sooner than we think. Fury v Ngannou will be televised live tomorrow night on TNT Sports Box Office.

After choosing to bat first, they were skittled for a meagre 156 in 33.2 overs, then watched as their opponents cantered home by eight wickets in Bangalore with almost half of the innings unused. The thrashing, which followed heavy losses to New Zealand, Afghanistan and South Africa, left the reigning champions ninth in the standings with an eye-watering net run-rate. With four games to go – including table-topping India and bitter rivals Australia – they are being kept off bottom spot by the only associate nation at the competition, the Netherlands. Remarkably, England are not yet mathematically out with four games to play, but the route is fanciful in the extreme and Buttler acknowledged the game was up. “It certainly looks that way and that’s incredibly disappointing. It would need a few miracles,” he said, glassy-eyed after another draining day. Sri Lanka win by 8️⃣ wickets in Bangalore. | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) “You get on the plane with high hopes and a lot of confidence and belief that we can challenge for the title, so to be sat here now with the three weeks we’ve had is a shock. It’s a shock to everyone. “I’ll walk back in the dressing room after this, look at the players sat there and think ‘how have we found ourselves in this position with the talent and the skill that’s in the room’? “But it is the position we’re in, it’s the reality of what’s happened over the last three weeks and that’s a huge low point.” Pressed on his own status in charge of the side Buttler indicated a desire to continue but a realisation that the verdict may not be his to make. In reality, England do not have an obvious successor lined up and Buttler is relatively new in the role, having inherited the mantle following Eoin Morgan’s retirement last summer. He also has a T20 World Cup win in the bank and there has been no indication that managing director of the men’s cricket, Rob Key, has an itchy trigger finger. “I think you’re always questioning as captain how you can get the best out of players, how you can get the team moving in the right direction,” Buttler admitted. “I certainly have a lot of confidence and belief in myself as a leader and captain and first and foremost as a player, but if you’re asking if I should still be captaining the team, that’s a question for the guys above me. “The tournament’s gone nowhere near the way we wanted it to…that much is obvious. As a leader, you want to lead through your own performance and I’ve not been able to do that.” Head coach Matthew Mott joined Buttler in writing off the chances of sneaking through to the last four, telling BBC Sport: “Yeah, it’s over now, I think. “I’m not a mathematician, but with our net run-rate and too many teams who are going to take games off each other, we have to come to terms with that. From now we’re playing for a lot of pride. “We feel like we’ve let our fans down, our families and supporters and everyone in that dressing room, we haven’t put our best foot forward and in professional sport, that’s what you’re judged on.”","pubDate":"2023-10-26 20:49:25","image_url":"https://www.bordercountiesadvertizer.co.uk/resources/images/17373825/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"bordercountiesadvertiser","source_priority":98087,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1d3e1da3aa8d37f0d0822a366a1547b5","title":"Defiant Jos Buttler wants to STAY as captain of one-day side despite World Cup horror show... with England all-but out after dismal defeat against Sri Lanka","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12677531/Defiant-Jos-Buttler-wants-STAY-captain-one-day-despite-World-Cup-horror-England-dismal-defeat-against-Sri-Lanka.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAWRENCE BOOTH IN BANGALORE: England need a mathematical miracle to reach the last four, but Buttler conceded his team's hopes had all but vanished before they take on hosts India.","content":"Defiant Jos Buttler wants to STAY as captain of one-day side despite World Cup horror show... with England all-but out after dismal defeat against Sri Lanka LAWRENCE BOOTH: Shambolic England are as good as out of Cricket World Cup Jos Buttler has captained this side during its miserable title defence in India He is adamant that he remains the right man to lead England's one-man side By Lawrence Booth for the Daily Mail Published: 21:10 BST, 26 October 2023 | Updated: 21:13 BST, 26 October 2023 e-mail 47 shares 24 View comments A shell-shocked Jos Buttler insisted he was the right man to continue leading England's one-day side after his team were all but knocked out of the World Cup by Sri Lanka . England need a mathematical miracle to reach the last four, but Buttler conceded his team's hopes had all but vanished ahead of the game against tournament favourites India in Lucknow on Sunday. 'It certainly looks that way, and that's incredibly disappointing,' he said. 'You get on the plane to India and we're in a really good position as a team, with everything looking like it's going to plan - and it's just not worked at all.' Jos Buttler claims he still believes he is the right man to captain England's one-day side Asked whether England's performance over the past three weeks - which has left them ninth in the 10-team table, above only the Netherlands - had left him questioning his position, Buttler replied: 'I think you're always questioning as captain how you can get the best out of players, how you can get the team moving in the right direction. 'I certainly have a lot of confidence and belief in myself as a leader and captain, and first and foremost as a player, but if you're asking if I should still be captaining the team, that's a question for the guys above me.' Buttler said there was 'no golden bullet' that could solve England's problems, but said the players - himself included - had to take responsibility. 'There's no one else who can score your runs or take your wickets. That comes from the start, from the captain at the front. I've been a long way short of my best.

They changed their tactics and side again in making three more changes and batting after winning the toss but, really, what’s most important is having players at the top of their games when you arrive at a World Cup. And if you walked in that dressing room after this and asked the England players, hand on heart, whether they are in good nick only one or two could possibly say yes. England’s form has deserted them at the worst possible time and compare that with, say, South Africa and India , whose batsmen all seem to be in great form, and someone like Glenn Maxwell who can hit a 40-ball century for Australia . It’s easy to be wise after the event and say ‘it’s an old side, we should have picked Phil Salt or Will Jacks or Ben Duckett.’ But I would not have swapped any of the players England brought here for anyone else. England suffered another dismal defeat in the Cricket World Cup to Sri Lanka on Thursday England's form has deserted them at the worst possible time and it feels like an end of an era We are talking about some of the greatest players in our white-ball history but this has just turned out to be a bridge too far for some of them. I wouldn’t have changed the side before this tournament but I would definitely be thinking about changing it now because It does feel like the end of an era. That doesn’t take anything away from what this England side have achieved. We can be all doom and gloom and say ‘get rid of the lot of them’ but they have given us six or seven years of absolutely brilliant white-ball cricket. What they have done is magical and all round the world franchises want England’s white ball players but what they have done in the last three weeks has not reflected the type of players they are and what Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler have created. Instead they have been a sad reflection of what they have been over the last few years. What I don’t like to do is give players a cop out. We say how great they are when they win two World Cups but when the wheels come off some blame the structure of English cricket. I’ve heard people at home are doing that but this is not the fault of the Hundred or the Blast or the fact England’s best players do not play much 50-over cricket. They are just lame excuses. England have given us six or seven years of great white-ball cricket but the last three weeks have not reflected the type of players they are How much 50-over cricket do Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli play? Or Heinrich Klaasen? Players around the world learn from T20 franchise cricket and ours learn from a domestic structure that helped make them the best white-ball side in the world. The players must take the responsibility for this. I’m not a great one for cliches like playing for the badge but that’s what England have got to do now. They have to go to Lucknow on Sunday and spoil India’s party. They must remind India and the world just how great cricketers they have been – and still are.

Perhaps they too saw what the rest of us could. England's World Cup defence was dying and, like Sri Lanka, they were ready to go in for the kill. England facing early World Cup exit after sorry Sri Lanka defeat Buttler determined to remain as England captain World Cup Daily podcast: Woeful England humiliated by Sri Lanka This situation is not new to England fans. Their Test team of the early 2010s, first captained by Andrew Strauss and taken on by Alastair Cook, was the best team in the world, but fell apart in the space of one Ashes tour in 2013-14. This white-ball outfit was a similarly great team - one that became the first men's side to hold both the 50-over and T20 World Cups - but now also lies in ruin. These things take years to build, only to unexpectedly fall apart in front of our eyes before we can quite comprehend why. And why, is the question English cricket will now be tasked with answering. Yes, the schedule has left them underprepared. Eoin Morgan's England achieved 50-over glory in 2019 after four years of meticulous planning. Then they had 88 matches of fine-tuning. Leading up to this tournament, with the focus on Test and T20 cricket, England had just 42. That number includes three matches immediately against Ireland last month when the World Cup squad was rested, three in Bangladesh without the Test players who were playing a series in New Zealand, and three more last year against the Netherlands, again when the Test players were playing the Black Caps at home. Joe Root had two 12-month spells without playing a one-day international. Ben Stokes retired for a year because of the schedule and came back again. England have not played often in 50-over cricket, and when they have it has not been with their best team. But to put the blame solely on the schedule would let a tournament that has been muddled from the outset off the hook. So too would pointing the finger only at The Hundred. England's players had long stopped playing domestic 50-over cricket before it took prime position in the cricketing calendar. Stokes has not played such a match in England since 2014, while captain Jos Buttler has not since 2016. If it did not prevent them winning at Lord's in 2019 - it cannot take all of the blame now. Instead, England should regret how their tournament has been a shambles from its very start. On 16 August selector Luke Wright pronounced the 15 players to face New Zealand in a series in September would travel to India for the World Cup. A week later Buttler said the door was not closed on the standout omission Harry Brook - a view which was repeated by coach Matthew Mott soon after. The result was their one series of meaningful preparation, four matches at home against New Zealand, became all about Brook and eventually he was added and Jason Roy omitted last minute. Next there was the curious case of bowler Jofra Archer. Hope was built up when he was named as a travelling reserve despite his elbow injury, only for him to fly to India three games in. He joined the team in Mumbai and trained for two days before being sent home when it was deemed he would not be fit after all. Such jumbled thinking has been a theme throughout. For the first game against New Zealand England stuck to a familiar formula - an XI packed with all-rounders to give batting depth and bowling options. After the defeat by Afghanistan in Delhi, with Stokes now available after his badly timed hip injury, that plan was jettisoned as six specialist batters and five specialist bowlers were selected to play South Africa. The result was the heaviest defeat in terms of runs in England's ODI history, and five days later in Bengaluru it was back to Plan A(ll-rounder). Mistakes have also been been made at the toss. Against Afghanistan, spooked by the dew which aided the Black Caps chase in Ahmedabad, England opted to bat second on a turning pitch against a batch of world-class spinners. A week later in Mumbai, Buttler made the same call against South Africa in the stifling heat, conditions Root later described as \"like eating the air\". As the bowlers cramped, England conceded more runs than ever before in an ODI. All of this has gone on with the issue of landmark, multi-year central contracts being negotiated in the background, before being announced two days before a crucial match in a World Cup. Whether that distracted players or not, it resulted in David Willey wandering around the team hotel with his young children on the day he was confirmed as the one player in the squad without a contract going forward. On Thursday he was still asked to open the bowling against Sri Lanka. A day after the announcement, Moeen Ali gave an interview to the BBC. Given a gentle opening question - \"How are you feeling going into this one, Moeen?\" - he replied: \"Obviously a bit anxious.\" Honest or not, they were hardly the words of defending champions who used to puff out their chests and dominate with bat and ball. When it came to the crunch, those worries showed as Dawid Malan's wicket sparked a sorry slide from 45-0 to 156 all out. At that point England's World Cup was done. Throughout this tournament the talk has been which of these players will want to stick around for the next edition in 2027, given the pull of franchise leagues. After the 2013-14 Ashes, two England greats Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann never played again. Jonathan Trott and Matt Prior's retirements were not too far behind. So shambolic has this showing been, some may not have that decision in their own hands. In his post-match media conference, Buttler became the latest England captain to be asked whether he is the right man for the job. The pause before answering suggested someone who could not quite believe how quickly things have fallen. From the joy of Melbourne to the misery of Bengaluru in less than 12 months. Buttler should be given the chance to stay, firstly because there is little time before another T20 World Cup in eight months. Secondly, he remains the best candidate. Cook led a rebuild after that Ashes defeat and won back the urn two and a half years later. Buttler could lead a new generation. But for now, like those Ashes series, the moment hope is lost is only the beginning on tours that provide no mercy. Sixteen days remain until England play their final game, all while the vultures circle over a once-great team. Is a new mafia getting rich on our waste?
