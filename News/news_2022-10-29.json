There is a ground owned by the Puducherry Cricket Association at Tuthipat. Following allegations of encroachment on water bodies here, former Governor Kiranbedi ordered the ground to be sealed. These restrictions have been lifted and sports are now being held at the stadium. However, when the Tuthipatt ground was closed, cricket training was conducted at the Elangovadi government school ground. At that time, coach Thamaraikannan was allegedly sexually harassing a 16-year-old girl who was studying in class 12 in a private school. In this complaint, a case was registered under the POCSO Act against 5 persons including coach Thamaraikannan, another coach Jayakumar, cricket association president Damodaran, secretary Venkat and cricket team captain Rohit. In this cricket club president Damodaran’s son Rohit is the son-in-law of famous film director Shankar. Rohit and director Shankar’s daughter Aishwarya got married in 2021. Thus the case gained attention. After a long time, Rohit shared about this incident in public. In his Instagram post, he said, “I have taken a decision after thinking very deeply and enough. Cricket has been my best partner in life by giving me identity and recognition and expressing who I am. I am committed to being honest and true to cricket which is the main part of my life. But because of what happened a few days ago, I am losing my respect and peace of mind in the field of cricket. I am very depressed now. I am thinking of taking a temporary break from cricket to recover from this. To those who stood by me in moments of scandal, my thanks. I will be back at the right time.”","pubDate":"2022-10-28 20:07:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Fifa deserves all the flak it gets over Qatar 2022 call but it’s too late now to address horrified activists’ complaints","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/20257686/fifa-flak-world-cup-qatar-karren-brady/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Fifa","Sport Columnists","World Cup"],"creator":["Joshua Mbu"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"IT was as inevitable as Erling Haaland scoring lots of goals that there would be demands for action against the World Cup in Qatar.

There was plenty to campaign about, too. Russian sport is riddled with drugs crime and Vladimir Putin’s policies are accelerating towards tyranny. After questions about where exactly Qatar is, it also became clear oil money was its lifeblood and that its rulers cared as much about stadium workers’ welfare as women’s rights. So, not much at all.

RON LAST HURRAH Oldest XI of stars set to play at World Cup revealed with Ronaldo aged 37 And although worldwide protests have helped improve pay and conditions, we still have the feeling foreign brickies in the Arab state were ranked just above slaves. With the World Cup three weeks away, it is probably too late to do much about the latest challenges — but it is surely right to air them. Such is the anger at Putin’s war on Ukraine, that a side issue concerning Iran’s sale of bomb-charged drones to Russia has angered protesters to the point of demanding the replacement of the Islamic republic’s team with Ukraine. For all sorts of reasons, this isn’t going to happen. Most read in Football GLOVES ARE OFF De Gea ‘sacked Mendes after Utd contract offer demands were perfectly met’ ROO ARE YA?

The idea of a World Cup of the Innocents might be fun for those nations without fault, although my guess is such total purity does not exist anywhere or in anyone. Iceland might edge in on the basis of lowest crime rate, although not judging by the number of wicked whodunits on TV recently. An Iceland v Tonga final may not be a big attraction… Sadly, Ukraine will have to concentrate on matters closer to home. I have more sympathy with the bid to oust Iran, through the shocking treatment of protesters who refuse to accept their government’s refusal to do anything about the brutal murder, in police custody, of Mahsa Amini for taking off her hijab. Many since — including women and children — have been killed demanding women’s rights. Again, barring the Iran team would be widely applauded. But I am far from sure that it would further those demands. There is a scant record of boycott success in sport. Olympic boycotts haven’t worked and, realistically, the only one that did was against apartheid, which was started by England’s cancellation of the 1968-69 cricket Test series against South Africa. One promise we can make is that boycott campaigns will continue to flourish. Protesters have found it hard to impress themselves on football but I fear it won’t be too long before the green movement, for one, concentrates on the biggest sport there is. We should be careful how we treat people who want change for the better. Improving human rights has to be one of those.

Shadab picked 3/23 with the ball while adding valuable 52-run stand for the fourth wicket with Shan Masood. Their partnership put Pakistan in a good position to take the game after a top-order collapse. However, Khan’s departure in the 14th over led to another batting collapse as Pak eventually fell short by a run.Pakistan captain Babar Azam admitted that Shadab’s wicket was turning point in the game.“When Shadab and Shan were building partnership, unfortunately Shadab got out and then back-to-back wickets that pushed us into pressure situation. First 6 overs, we haven’t used the new ball well but we finished well with the ball. We will sit out, discuss our mistakes and we will train hard and come back strong in our next game,” Pakistan capain Babar said after the match.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

In this case, the fans who are upset after seeing this are criticizing the International Cricket Council through social media. A total of four matches have been abandoned so far in the Super 12 round alone. The result of a match was announced by the Duckworth-Lewis method due to rain. The match between England and Australia which was considered to be the most important match was abandoned without even the toss being thrown. It is like a door for the teams who have a chance to advance to the next round of the series. ICC said that there is no reserve day for canceled matches mainly in the Super 12 round. At the same time, it is also reported that there is a reserve day for the knock-out matches. Fan reaction \r We appeal to ICC to host every upcoming World Cup series in Rajasthan. There is no rain here. \r The ICC must consider the weather conditions of the host country before preparing the schedule for the series. \r All this is because of ICC. Interested in holding the series at a location where the weather is not favourable. \r Instead of the sixer rain, the sky rain is falling. \r \r There is an appeal to the @ICC to organize every upcoming World Cup in Rajasthan because we do not have rain here and the upcoming matches of the World Cup which is going on in Australia, should also be organized here in Rajasthan. #rain #T20WorldCup @BCCI pic.twitter.com/lx02ncEQSC — Satish Kumar (@SatishChhimpa5) October 28, 2022 \r #rain @T20WorldCup Another match goes down.ICC is responsible for organizing world cup with no favorable weather condition, why did you decide to conduct matches in Australia this time of the year? @ICC — Khan T.

Cricket fans can expect unexpected results in this type of format. The Zimbabwean team is doing such a strange thing in the world of cricket. This is not just about Pakistan winning. It was the same team that beat Australia on Australian soil before that. Zimbabwe are set to upset many more teams in the coming days. Usually, the world of cricket is dominated by financially rich teams. Starting with sponsorship for the players, the teams get a lot of perks. But not so for a team like Zimbabwe. Exactly one year ago in May 2021, the team’s player Ryan Burl had tweeted. It gained worldwide attention. A very warm tweet too. “Is there any chance of us getting a sponsor? “If that happens, we won’t have to patch our shoes after every series,” he said. The team played cricket wearing shoes that were torn to such an extent. Many people had given their opinions. Some also said that the ICC should help the struggling Zimbabwe team without financial resources. It was in that context that Puma company tweeted saying ‘this situation will not continue’. \r Time to put the glue away, I got you covered @ryanburl3 https://t.co/FUd7U0w3U7 — PUMA Cricket (@pumacricket) May 23, 2021 Since then, till date, they have played a total of 32 T20 matches and won 17 matches. Similarly, they have played 21 ODI matches and won 5 matches. One of these 5 wins was against Australia on Australian soil. The competition was held at the beginning of last September. Pakistan fans have been roasting the Zimbabwean team whenever they play in the series between the two countries. After all those humiliations, Zimbabwe got rewarded by defeating Pakistan in the T20 World Cup arena. Playing first in yesterday’s match at Perth Stadium, Zimbabwe scored 130 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in 20 overs. Pakistan then played only 129 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in 20 overs. Pakistan needed 11 runs off the last over to win. But it is noteworthy that Pakistan lost by one run as Pakistan scored only 9 runs in the 4th and 5th balls of the 20th over. அன்பு வாசகர்களே.... இந்த ஊரடங்கு காலத்தில் வீட்டை விட்டு வெளியே வராமல் நமக்கு நாமே சமூக விலகல் ( Social Distancing) செய்து கொள்வோம். செய்தி ஊடகங்களின் வழியே உலகுடன் தொடர்பில் இருப்போம். பொதுவெளியில் இருந்து தனிமைப்படுத்திக் கொண்டு கரோனா பரவலைத் தடுப்பதில் நம் பங்கை முழுமையாக இந்த சமூகத்துக்கு அளிப்போம்.

Bumrah missed out on the T20 World Cup 2022 due to a back injury. In his absence, fast bowling duo of Bhuvneshwar and young Arshdeep has been doing well for India in the tournament. Arshdeep, who is playing his career's maiden World Cup, has picked up five wickets in two games, while Bhuvi has bagged three wickets in two matches. \"The kind of bowler Bumrah is, certainly its a big loss for the team. It's not as if we would have to do something extra that Bumrah isn't around. Even if Bumrah would have been around, and if needed, we would have done those extra things. We are doing exactly what our strengths are,\" Bhuvneshwar told reporters in mixed zone after India's comprehensive win over the Netherlands. After kickstarting their T20 World Cup campaign with a memorable four-wicket victory over Pakistan, India continued their winning momentum as they defeated Netherlands by 56 runs at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Thursday. Bhuvneshwar, who has represented India over 200 times across formats, has also said that he was not affected by the criticisms he received at the death in the Asia Cup as he always cuts himself off social media during big tournaments like the World Cup. \"Itni saalon mein ek baar ho gayi cheezein kharab. So ho gayi. Baat khatm. (In all these years, I have had this one off tournament. It's happened. It's done and dusted). Media and commentators can say a lot of things [about death bowling], but as a team we knew that we will have our share of ups and downs. \"T20 is a format where it could be tough for bowlers and even for batters if the track is difficult one. But since Asia Cup is a big event people do tend to assess you that much more,\" the 32-year-old fast bowler added further. Arshdeep has been amazing since his debut, says Bhuvneshwar Kumar Bhuvi was exceptional against the Dutch side in Sydney as he finished with figures of 2 for 9 in three overs. While his opening partner Arshdeep also bagged two scalps, the youngster was a tad expensive as he gave away 37 runs in his quota of four overs. Bhuvi also said that he has been surprised by the swing the two said bowlers have been able to generate in the ongoing tournament Down Under. \"I never expected that my deliveries would swing so much. Whether me or Arshdeep, who got two wickets, me and Arshdeep complimented each other. So you can say I was happy. \"He [Arshdeep] has been amazing since his debut. He was always asking about what kind of track will there be on offer and what kind of shots the batters will play on this track. He asks me and also Rohit and Virat. Considering his first T20 WC, he is doing really well,\" added Bhuvi, who has picked up 88 wickets in 81 T20Is for India. Bhuvi also confirmed that there are no assigned death bowlers. \"There are no assigned death bowler as such. You can't plan like that in cricket, where even before a tourney starts, you know who your death bowlers are. \"A lot of things are instinctive and the captain takes a call on how he assesses the situation at that very moment,\" said Bhuvi. ✈️ Team India, where you go, we go… 😎 x 👳‍♂️ with The Bharat Army on the way to Perth! #BharatArmy #TeamIndia #T20WorldCup #India #COTI 🇮🇳 @surya_14kumar @arshdeepsinghh pic.twitter.com/2tzzPAsXBI Having won both their opening games of the T20 World Cup 2022, India will look to carry the same momentum into their upcoming match, which is on Sunday (Oct. 30) against South Africa in Perth. The fact that India spent a week in the Western Australian city ahead of the tournament could perhaps work in Rohit Sharma and Co's favour. \"The first phase of preparation when we touched down here in Perth was the most crucial one. The strategy changes with each team as batters change. We discussed and trained on the execution of plans. \"If you lose a match first up in a tournament and that too against a tough team like Pakistan, it would have been difficult to make a comeback,\" the Indian pacer added further.","pubDate":"2022-10-28 13:49:02","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/10/28/500x300_1318253-jasprit-bumrah.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL franchises approach Australian cricketers for year-round contracts","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/ipl-franchises-approach-australian-cricketers-for-year-round-contracts-620671","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Franchises in the Indian Premier League (IPL) have reportedly approached Australian cricketers for signing year-round contracts to represent them in various franchise T20 leagues where they have their teams.","content":"SYDNEY: Franchises in the Indian Premier League (IPL) have reportedly approached Australian cricketers for signing year-round contracts to represent them in various franchise T20 leagues where they have their teams. A report in The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald says IPL franchise representatives have held informal talks with the players through their management to know how much money would be required for them to commit to playing for them in various T20 leagues instead of playing international cricket. \"A source familiar with the issue said a sum of $5 million had been discussed to lure a big-name Australian player. This would be more than double what Test and one-day international captain Pat Cummins is paid as the highest-ranked player on CA's contracts list.\" \"Contracted Australian stars such as Cummins, David Warner and Glenn Maxwell would be eagerly sought by IPL franchises that own teams in other domestic Twenty20 leagues,\" said the report. The report further said that there has been little interest from players to sign up for the year-long contracts. But a source quoted in the report feels that might change when the players are nearing the end of their international careers and will take only 18 months to two years for Australian players to commit to year-long franchise cricket contracts. \"It would be a fundamental shift from the game's conventional pay model for international cricketers, which is rare in world sport in that as a player's major source of income has traditionally come from their country instead of their club. Players would still require no objection certificates from their home board to take part in foreign T20 leagues,\" added the report. The development comes at a time when all six teams in the inaugural SA20 league where acquired by IPL franchises while some of them, like Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Mumbai Indians (MI) have acquired teams in UAE's ILT20 tournament. KKR also runs the Trinbago side in the Caribbean Premier League and are also in the running to acquire a side in the yet-to-be-launched Major League Cricket in the USA.

England lost to Ireland by five runs under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method on Wednesday and the Aussie washout still means they must beat New Zealand and Sri Lanka in their final two Super 12s matches to have a chance of reaching the semi-finals. The integrity of the tournament has already been compromised and it is perhaps no coincidence that only six international cricket matches had ever previously been scheduled outdoors in Australia before the start of November. Of course, nobody can predict rain and organisers have been unlucky but wet weather patterns created by La Nina have been anticipated in Australia for months.

It is frequently used for Big Bash T20 games. October is on average the second-wettest month of the year in Melbourne and, as we know, the greed of administrators packing in tournament after tournament normally outweighs common sense. Don’t forget, the previous T20 World Cup was in the UAE less than a year ago. Apart from the India v Pakistan match, crowds have been disappointing, too, because there is no tradition of cricket being played in Australia in October.

Afghanistan have had two games washed out in a tournament where you potentially play only five matches. “It’s frustrating for all of us. Is there something you could look at – I don’t know if you could elongate the tournament, for example? “I’m not sure what the perfect format is. It’s quite a ruthless format as it stands, which we know and accept. But if multiple games are affected by the weather, it doesn’t give a true reflection of how you’d hope the tournament would play out.” Buttler added: “The umpires had some big concerns about the conditions and rightly so. The outfield was very wet and there were some areas inside the 30-yard circle that weren’t fit to play. “We all want to play cricket but it has to be safe and it certainly wasn’t. The right call was made. We play an open-air sport and the elements are a huge part of what makes it unique. AFPIt’s New Zealand up next for Jos Buttler and England[/caption] “It’s a shame for everyone. Australia v England at the MCG in a must-win match is as big as it gets in your career. You don’t know how often those opportunities will come around.” Afghanistan’s last two matches have been abandoned without a ball bowled and team coach Jonathan Trott – England’s Ashes-winning former run machine – is baffled why matches are not being switched indoors. Trott said: “This is what happens at this time of year and the beginning of summers. “The frustrating thing is there’s a stadium down the road that has a roof so you can play cricket there. We could have had lots of cricket. But it does mean the tournament is unpredictable with lots of must-win games coming up.” England next face New Zealand in Brisbane on Tuesday and play the final match in Group One against Sri Lanka in Sydney next Saturday. That could give Buttler’s team an advantage because they might know exactly what they have to do in terms of net run-rate to reach the semi-finals. But first they must beat New Zealand.","pubDate":"2022-10-28 13:10:10","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Babar Azam has to be more intelligent, this is not a gully cricket team: Wasim Akram lashes out at Pak selection policy","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/babar-azam-has-to-be-more-intelligent-this-is-not-a-gully-cricket-team-wasim-akram-lashes-out-at-pak-management-over-selection-policy-8235630/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-28 13:00:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup: 'Tees Maar Khan nahi hai', Shoaib Akhtar predicts India to bow out from semi-finals","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/t20-world-cup-tees-maar-khan-nahi-hai-shoaib-akhtar-predicts-india-to-bow-out-from-semi-finals-11531171.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"T20 World Cup: 'Tees Maar Khan nahi hai', Shoaib Akhtar predicts India to bow out from semi-finals","content":"Babar Azam-led Pakistan suffered a huge blow to their T20 World Cup semi-final hopes on Thursday after their one-run defeat to Zimbabwe in their Super 12 Group 2 contest, and that was met with huge criticism from many, including former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar.Soon after the game, Shoaib on his official Twitter account on Thursday, had launched a scathing attack on Pakistan team and its management, terming the defeat as ‘embarrassing’.And later on Thursday night, Akhtar seemed to even take a dig on the Indian team, predicting that India would bow out from the semi-final stage next week.“I had already told Pakistan that they will come back this week. And India will come back next week after playing in the semi-final. Voh bhi koi Tees Maar Khan nahi hai (India are also not some unbeatable side) and we are even worse,” Akhtar said on his official YouTube channel.With two wins in two matches, India already have four points, and will all but secure a place in the semi-finals if they beat South Africa in their third match on Sunday.Meanwhile, Akhtar went onto blame the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for selecting ‘unworthy players’.“Your performances are average. Enjoy, and keep selecting unworthy players. Don’t let in good people. I’m not talking about myself. The job can go to hell. I’m just worried that the country suffers because of this. Don’t bring cut-for-role people, who are disciplined and know how things work. You’ve ruined everything,” said Akhtar.Pakistan will hope for a quick turnaround in the tournament when they face Netherlands on Sunday (30 October). That will be followed by games against South Africa (3 November) and Bangladesh (6 November). All their next three games are must-win matches, and Pakistan will hope to avoid any more further slip-ups.","pubDate":"2022-10-28 12:58:06","image_url":"https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/380x285/fixed/jpg/2022/10/Shoaib-Akhtar-Twitter-screengrab-1.jpg","source_id":"firstpost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif reverts in strong words after Zimbabwe president's 'Mr Bean' dig tweet","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/pakistan-pm-shehbaz-sharif-reverts-in-strong-words-after-zimbabwe-presidents-mr-bean-dig-tweet-11530691.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif reverts in strong words after Zimbabwe president's 'Mr Bean' dig tweet","content":"Following Zimbabwe president Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa’s ‘Real Mr Bean’ dig at Pakistan after his nation’s cricket team shocked Men in Green at the T20 World Cup on Thursday, Pak prime minister Shehbaz Sharif reverted in a couple of hours.T20 World Cup Home | Schedule | Results | Points Table | T20 World Cup News | PhotosThe Zimbabwean president tweeted moments after Zimbabwe stunned Pakistan by a run in the T20 World Cup Super 12 match in Perth in response to a fake Mr Bean incident from 2016 when a Pakistani comedian Asif Muhammad tried to fool the residents of Harare by enacting British actor Rowan Atkinson’s famous character Mr Bean.“What a win for Zimbabwe!

Sri Lanka as well can move up the ladder if they can win two of their next three games and flame up the already heated group. Sri Lanka, however, will not start as favourites in their tie against New Zealand and England.The group has been left wide open for permutations and combinations as all six teams have a mathematical possibility of qualifying. Afghanistan have the lowest probability of qualifying in the current scenario.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

His strike rate only goes up and he becomes a very dangerous player after playing 15-16 balls. Babar Azam needs to do the same thing because we have often seen Babar’s strike rate go down after the first six overs. For a match-winning innings, you need to do it like Virat.”Shoaib Malik“The difference between both of the class batters is Virat Kohli knows how to play in pockets. It’s a big difference, Virat only plays his shot where there are no fielders, he won’t look to hit a six where a fielder is standing. It shows he has trained a lot and worked on his shot to execute it to perfection. That’s why his success rate is so high.”Waqar YounisWaqar Younis concurred with Shoaib Malik and said that playing in pockets makes Virat safer from losing wickets.“Playing in the pocket shows that he knows how to play the safe shots. And the biggest difference between them in T20s is Virat is not afraid to use his bottom hand. He is not afraid of going over the top.“Babar is a classic batsman and looks very elegant while batting but in T20 cricket you need to take the game to the bowler by going over the top. If you are batting at No. 1 or No. 2, you have to take the risk by going over the top and finding the gap otherwise you will play too many dots and put pressure on yourself.”Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

About 8.50pm, Australia's match against England at the MCG was abandoned without a ball being bowled﻿, with officials deeming the sodden outfield unsafe for play. Australia and England, in a battle to be the second team to advance in group one with the pool-topping New Zealand well positioned, received one point each. READ MORE: 'Red flag' moment that forced Barty retirement READ MORE: Commentator 'sorry' for inflammatory Wallam call READ MORE: Legend's widow makes urgent plea to AFL boss﻿ As Taylor took into account Australia's remaining pool matches, against Ireland at the Gabba and Afghanistan at Adelaide Oval, the former Test captain﻿ remained optimistic about the hosts' title defence. \"Obviously getting on and winning would have been ideal, but the fact that we've got Ireland and Afghanistan to go means that if we play well enough and win both of those games and win them well enough we may well still go through,\" Taylor told Wide World of Sports. \"Obviously it's going to depend on other results ... but bear in mind that England are in the same boat as us and they've got New Zealand and Sri Lanka to go. \"So, from that point of view it's not disastrous, although, as I said, a win would have been a lot better.\" Despite pinpointing the clashes with Ireland and Afghanistan as prime opportunities to secure healthy wins, Taylor warned against being complacent. Ireland sprung a World Cup shock when it defeated ﻿England on Wednesday night , scraping home against the gun outfit by five runs under the Duckworth-Lewis method. \"They've got to be a little bit mindful because we saw what Ireland can do to England,\" Taylor said. \"So, first and foremost, concentrate on winning the game, and if you get an opportunity ... to improve your run-rate, go about it. But as we saw with England, if you take one of these, dare I say it, less-fancied nations — if you take them lightly you end up getting hurt.\" Taylor, who was at the MCG for his Nine commentary duties, was among those annoyed by the rain. In fact, the 104-Test icon was also irked by the officials' handling of the situation. \"I'd have liked to seen them get on today or, in a way, call it earlier,\" Taylor said. \"We were sitting there at probably eight o'clock, quarter past eight, when they had an inspection, and I thought then that they had to either start then or call the game off. The pitch or the surrounds, which were obviously the concern, weren't going to dry out. It's about 12 degrees here in Melbourne at night with little wind. It's not going to dry out any more. So, I think at eight o'clock they could have said, 'All right, it's suitable to play or it's not'. So I think they could have been more decisive with that decision. \"And I think, as I've always thought, particularly with these T20 games, you've just got to try to get them on, get people out there playing. I think once you start it's amazing how you stay on. \"So I would have liked to see a little more expedience around that decision that was made around quarter past eight.\" Former England captain Michael Vaughan﻿ took to Twitter to vent his frustration, ripping the decision to schedule the game at the MCG instead of Marvel Stadium, which has a roof. But Taylor doesn't share Vaughan's view.﻿ \"I think the MCG is a much better cricket ground than Marvel Stadium, to be totally honest,\" Taylor said. \"Yes, you're always a chance of rain, but you can't organise your calendar around what might happen. \"If you go back to the Olympics 20 years ago in Sydney, about the same time of year it (the weather) was magnificent. \"You can't hold the ICC (International Cricket Council) or anyone responsible for La Niña. It's an unfortunate time of the year. \"Marvel Stadium — yes, it's got a roof. But I prefer to see games in Melbourne at the MCG.\" The MCG match between Afghanistan and Ireland, which had been scheduled to begin﻿ at 3pm, was also abandoned due to rain. ﻿ For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here !","pubDate":"2022-10-28 11:32:03","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2022/10/463150/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup: 'Some loopholes were visible', Kapil Dev highlights Team India's areas of concern despite winning start","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/t20-world-cup-some-loopholes-were-visible-kapil-dev-highlights-team-indias-areas-of-concern-despite-winning-start-11530101.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"T20 World Cup: 'Some loopholes were visible', Kapil Dev highlights Team India's areas of concern despite winning start","content":"Legendary India cricketer Kapil Dev has said that loopholes were still visible in the Rohit Sharma-led Indian team, despite victories over Pakistan and Netherlands in the 2022 T20 World Cup Super 12 contest in Australia.T20 World Cup: Full coverage | Schedule | Results | Points Table | News | PhotosIndia had begun their T20 World Cup campaign with an inspired four-wicket win over rivals Pakistan in Melbourne, before the bowlers stepped up in helping the Men in Blue restrict Netherlands to 123 in the second game, registering a 56-run win.The two victories have put India frontrunners to seal a semi-final spot, but Kapil Dev seemed to give a stern warning to Rohit Sharma and Co about the loopholes within the team, especially as far as their bowling is concerned, and without the services of injured Jasprit Bumrah.Against Netherlands, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Shami, Axar Patel and R Ashwin were all among the wicket-takers for India, but Kapil Dev called for ‘proper planning’.“The bowling has gotten better. In batting, I felt India could have scored more runs but in the last 10 overs, made up for it by scoring over 100 runs. See, the grounds are big and hence, the spinners gain a little bit of advantage. I would still say that in patches we are still lacking in bowling,” Kapil was quoted as saying by ABP News.“Against a team like Netherlands, you should have proper planning as to where to bowl in terms of line and length. The biggest thing is that in such matches, there should not be no-balls or wides because you are practicing and need to win the match as well. So overall, I would say, the bowling was good but still some loopholes were visible,” the 50-over World Cup-winning skipper added.Kapil Dev hailed the in-form Suryakumar Yadav, but desired to see KL Rahul back scoring runs for India.“Suryakumar Yadav has really grabbed his chances well in this team. To score runs so quickly, he should be praised more. India would still want their captain Rohit Sharma to be a little more compact, and want Rahul to score some runs,” Kapil said.The 63-year-old called for Virat Kohli to play the anchor role. Kohli has so far registered scores of 82* and 62* against Pakistan and Netherlands respectively.“Virat Kohli should play anchor because he can accelerate, but if he gets the chance to play through the entire 20 overs, this team can chase down any total. In the last 1-2 years, he was the player we were struggling to find – who is going to bat for us at No.4? There were players but not the kind of contenders we have found in Suryakumar,” Kapil explained.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Pakistan required 3 runs on the last ball when Mohammad Wasim Jr standing at the non-striker’s end left the crease early before Zimbabwe pacer Brad Evans released the ball. However, the move went unnoticed by Evans and other Zimbabwe players. Now, Hogg has taken to his Twitter handle and shared a couple of stills which clearly show that Williams had a fair chance to run-out Wasim Jr.Why severe penalty needs to be brought in for leaving the crease before the ball is delivered! Last ball of the game last night!#ZIMvPAK #T20WorldCup2022 pic.twitter.com/lHpaMr3Oqr— Brad Hogg (@Brad_Hogg) October 28, 2022 Referring to the occurrence, Hogg explained in the caption, “Why a severe penalty needs to be brought in for leaving the crease before the ball is delivered! Last ball of the game last night!” Since Deepti Sharma “mankaded” Charlie Dean during a One Day International match against England, the event has generated a lot of discussions. Many former and current cricketers expressed their opinion that the action still violates the ‘spirit of cricket’, despite the fact that it is now considered legal because it is classified as a ‘run-out’ under the new ICC rules and regulations.Hogg’s post also grabbed the eyeballs of global cricket enthusiasts. Since being surfaced on the internet, the Twitter exchange has received over 18,000 likes so far. Numerous users agreed with Hogg and asked for some strict laws against the non-striker batters who leave their mark early.A user said, “So right you are. Why should they get that unfair advantage,(the batter at the non-striking end)? Where is that spirit of cricket(most talked about these days)?!!”So right you are.

Then, the Aussie legend wrote on his Twitter handle, “Chahar is praised for a good gesture, yet no disappointment about the batter’s action. “Spirit of cricket” has become redundant.”Chahar is praised for a good gesture, yet no dissapointment about the batters action.

Chahar halted his run-up and alerted the batter for leaving his crease. After the incident, the Indian seamer grinned and it appeared that the batter did not repeat his error for the remainder of the innings.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

This includes the captain and chief selector (Mohammad Wasim). You included all-rounder Aamir Jamal for England series but you didn’t take him to Australia.”Aamir was one of the finds of the England vs Pakistan seven-match T20 series as his death bowling abilities came to light on debut when he stopped England from scoring 15 runs in the final over in the fifth T20 at Lahore’s Gaddafi stadium. The right-arm pace bowling all-rounder bowled four overs in two matches during the series while picking a wicket for 43 runs.Nerves of steel! 🤩Debutant Aamir Jamal stars with a remarkable last over 👏#PAKvENG | #UKSePK pic.twitter.com/tsZ1KQtg9v— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) September 28, 2022The 56-year-old legend continued to vent his anger on Azam for lacking leadership qualities that included preparing for Australian conditions while mocking the team to take Gaddafi’s pitch to the World Cup if they are finding it too hard to adjust.“This is the captain’s job, it should be his vision on how to build a team for the World Cup keeping in mind the pitches. (Pointing at the anchor) As you said the pitches were difficult and if they are difficult then take Gaddafi’s pitch to World Cup and play on it.“There is a lot of planning that goes into the World Cup, you needed an all-rounder who can bowl as the fifth bowler and you had Faheem Ashraf and Aamir Jamal for it. You had a year to prepare them. You had a mystery spinner in Abrar (Ahmed), who has been doing amazingly well at the first-class level and was included in the squad for England series but wasn’t played at all over seven games,” said Akram, who took 916 international wickets between 1984 and 2003.4️⃣th five-wicket haul in his last six innings 💥Abrar Ahmed continues his outstanding form ✨Watch Live: https://t.co/JeVhgehfc8#QeAT | #BALvSINDH pic.twitter.com/Q9TlwORkrN— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) October 24, 2022The former Pakistan pacer further felt that senior Pakistan players were so eager to play cricket that they didn’t give enough opportunities to youngsters to have a stronger squad for the World Cup and the onus for the same falls on Babar again.“I don’t understand why main players are so eager to play all the matches. Often you rest the senior players and use the youngsters to have options for the World Cup. All this is the captain’s job, coaches are there to help the captain and you have to lead them by picking players of your choice but now we are down to prayers and ifs and buts again to stay alive in the World Cup.
