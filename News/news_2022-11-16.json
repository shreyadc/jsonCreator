Every ODI live and ad-break free in play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >At tea on the fourth day, with South Africa’s Aiden Markram and Quinton de Kock batting to save the Test, Warner started hurling a volley of abuse at de Kock in the players’ tunnel.The already dismissed du Plessis emerged from the home dressing room clad only in a towel wrapped around his waist and helped cool tempers.Australia won the match by 118 runs.But it was South Africa who would take the series 3-1, which would see Warner, Australia captain Steve Smith and batsman Cameron Bancroft all banned for their roles in the ‘Sandpapergate’ ball-tampering controversy in the third Test, in a highlight of du Plessis’s four-year tenure as skipper.“Australia wanted to bully us,” du Plessis, 38, told the BBC as he reflected on the Durban match.“We had to stand up for ourselves. They abused us that whole game but the way we fought back turned the series around.” And while he had some sympathy for the impressionable Bancroft and admiration for the talented Smith, there was no such goodwill towards Warner.“He was a bully,” said du Plessis. “I don’t have time for bullies.” But du Plessis, who scored over 4,000 runs, including 10 hundreds, in 69 Tests at an average of 40, before calling time on his red-ball international career last year, made no attempt to shy away from his role in other controversial incidents.There was ‘Zipgate’, when he was found guilty of rubbing the ball on the zipper of his trousers against Pakistan in 2013 and ‘Mintgate’ — an incident in 2016 against Australia where he was seen applying saliva from a mint onto the ball.“I’m not perfect,” he said. “I’ve never claimed to be. I’ve never been the most talented player.“Yes, I have talent, but it’s hard work and mental toughness that got me to where I am.” But the batsman insisted his was a “story about failure”, adding: “I wanted to write a book about leadership, about relationships, about struggle … I was a person who was filled with self-doubt and insecurity. And that’s OK.”","pubDate":"2022-11-15 21:05:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"1-464: The schools that made every male Test cricketer","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/revealed-the-top-schools-to-produce-best-australian-test-cricketers-of-all-time/news-story/7b8d58926163342e98031ada0bb20c35","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"From Charles Bannerman in 1877 to Mitchell Swepson in March of this year, 464 men have worn the fabled baggy green as an Australian Test cricketer.","content":"Modern greats Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh share the record for most Tests for Australia with 168 – an incredible feat of longevity and sustained excellence – while for some, their careers lasted just one innings. Regardless, only a select few have the privilege to pull on the baggy green; their names and cap numbers forever entered into the annals of Australian cricket history. But it all has to start somewhere. Even Ponting, who made his first grade debut in Tasmania as a 12 year old, wasn’t born seeing them like beach balls - Shane Warne’s talents may have been a gift from the cricket gods, but he had to hone that gift somewhere.For many, particularly in the private sector, their cricket prowess can be traced back to their schooling roots. A News Corp investigation has unearthed the top-ranked schools across the country for producing Test-level Australian cricketers. Some are legacy schools whose cricket programs flourished in the early 1900s, while others have shot up the ranks in recent years to produce household names that will don the baggy green again this summer. Read on to learn which schools from across Australia have been the most successful breeding grounds for cricketing talent in the country. SCOTCH COLLEGE (VICTORIA)12: George Alexander #18 (1880-84), William Bruce #32 (1885-95), Harry Musgrove #36 (1885), Jack McIlwraith #43 (1886), Bob McLeod #67 (1892-93), Joseph Darling #64 (1894-1905), Charles McLeod #67 (1894-1905), Gervys Hazlitt (1907-12), Albert Hartkopf #120 (1925), Col McDonald #191 (1952-61), Robert Cowper #229 (1964-68) The only school on this list able to field a full team of its own. Australia’s top cricket nursery has produced 12 of the 464 players to pull on a baggy green for their country – but none in more than half a century. Since Robert Cowper’s final Test match in 1968, no Scotch College graduate has played an over in the baggy green.Joe Darling became the 10th man to captain Australia at Test level when he took over from Harry Trott in 1899. He led Australia in 21 Tests between 1899 and 1905, and totalled 34 matches for 1657 runs at 28.56. Other notable names to be borne out of the Hawthorn school include Col McDonald and Cowper. McDonald played 47 Tests between 1952 and 1961, amassing 3107 runs at 39.32 to sit 37th on the all-time Australian Test run scorers list. Cowper’s 307 against England at the MCG in 1966 remains the highest-ever Test score on the hallowed turf. The left-hander retired in 1968 with 2016 runs to his name at an impressive 46.84.SEE AUSTRALIA’S TOP CRICKET SCHOOLS THIS CENTURYSYDNEY GRAMMAR (NSW)10: Frederick Spofforth #14 (1877-87), Samuel Percy Jones #30 (1882-88), Reginald Allen #47 (1887), Sammy Woods #54 (1888), Percie Charlton #57 (1890), Henry Donnan #61 (1892-96), Franke Iredale #65 (1894-99), Albert Cotter #85 (1904-12), Hunter Hendry #116 (1921-26), James Burke #187 (1951-59) Sydney Grammar is another traditional Australian Test cricket nursery that has slowed in its production line in modern times. It’s been an even longer wait between baggy greens for the Darlinghurst school, whose last Test cricketer was James Burke way back in 1959. Burke was also Sydney Grammar’s most successful Test cricketer, playing 24 matches between 1951 and 1959 for 1280 runs at 34.59. The right-hander scored a century in his Test debut against England in Adelaide. When he was dropped for the 1953 Ashes tour, Burke took his axing to heart and completely rewired his game.A torrid 28 not out over 250 minutes during a 1958 Test in Brisbane sticks in the minds of many who remember Burke as a man who refused to take risks. Tibby Cotter took 89 wickets in 21 matches in the baggy green, including 17 at 21.47 in Australia’s successful 1909 Ashes tour of England. WESLEY COLLEGE (VICTORIA) EIGHT: Henry ‘Tup’ Scott #31 (1884-86), John Edwards #52 (1888), John Barrett #55 (1890), Roy Park #113 (1921), Keith Rigg #136 (1931-37), Ross Gregory #159 (1937), Ian Johnson #164 (1946-56), Sam Loxton #180 (1948-51) Wesley College’s greatest cricket exponent is former Australian Test captain, Ian Johnson. Johnson captained Australia in 17 of his 45 Tests, though his stewardship is remembered for a 2-4 record in nine Ashes Tests as captain. He is also the last Wesley cricketer to pull on the baggy green; his retirement coming in 1956. Johnson’s father-in-law, Roy Park, also attended Wesley and played for Australia – briefly. Park’s claim to fame is a golden duck in his first and only Test, against England in 1920.Ross Gregory was 21 when he debuted against England in 1937 and looked a batsman of the future. He played in two Tests, averaging 51, before leaving for the war. He died while on air operations in India aged 26. PRINCE ALFRED COLLEGE (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) EIGHT: Joseph Darling #64 (1894-1905), Clement Hill #74 (1896-1912), Ian Chappell #311 (1964-80), Greg Chappell #251 (1970-84), Ashley Woodcock #270 (1974), Trevor Chappell #311 (1981), Tim May #342 (1987-95), Greg Blewett #363 (1995-2000)Three future Australian Test captains spent their formative years at Prince Alfred College. Given there have been just 47 such men in history, it’s a remarkable achievement. Before Joe Darling moved to Victoria and attended Scotch College he was a Prince Alfred boy. In 1894 he became the school’s first Test cricketer and by 1899, its first Test captain. The other two names are more easily recognisable to modern cricket fans. Ian and Greg Chappell combined to captain their country in 78 Test matches between 1970 and 1983. Ian played 75 Tests for 5345 runs, good for 18th all-time among Australian Test cricketers, and after his retirement became one of the most beloved and respected commentators the sport has known. Greg debuted in 1970, six years after his older brother, and retired in 1984 as Australia’s highest Test run scorer with 7110, surpassing the great Donald Bradman. He currently sits 12th on the all-time list and his Test average of 53.86 is the third-highest among those in the top-50, behind only Bradman and Steve Smith.Clem Hill also features on that list, at number 32, having amassed 3412 runs in his 49 Tests spanning 1896-1912. So does Greg Blewett, another Prince Alfred alum, who checks in at number 46 with 2552 runs to his name between 1995 and 2000. Right-arm spinner Tim May appeared in 24 Tests for Australia between 1987 and 1995, claiming 75 wickets. He formed a brutal partnership with Shane Warne in the 1993 Ashes tour, when the pair combined for 55 wickets. BRISBANE GRAMMAR SCHOOL (QUEENSLAND) SIX: Otto Nothling #127 (1928), Alexander Hurwood #135 (1930-31), Hugh ‘Pud’ Thurlow #141 (1932), John Ross Duncan #252 (1971), Alan Ogilvie #286 (1977-78), Matthew Renshaw #449 (2016-Current) Matt Renshaw’s 11 Tests for Australia better the combined total of the five Brisbane Grammar alums who came before him. The Queenslander became the youngest player to score a Sheffield Shield century for Queensland when he made 170 off 395 for the Bulls in Mackay, aged just 19. He made his Test debut by the age of 20 and in his fourth Test scored his maiden century in the baggy green at the SCG. Still just 26, Renshaw has fallen out of favour with Australian selectors and has not played a Test since early 2018. Before Renshaw, the red hair of David Ogilvie represented Brisbane Grammar’s most successful Test cricketer. The right-hand bat debuted in the three-Test series against India in 1977 and flew to the Caribbean to play the West Indies the following year. Ogilvie averaged 17.8 with the bat and was out of the Test team after just two years.Before Otto Nothling’s short-but-sweet Test cricket career, he represented NSW and toured New Zealand in rugby. Five years after that rugby tour, Nothling pulled on the baggy green and produced scores of 44 and 8 in his one and only Test against England in Sydney in December 1928. ‘Pud’ Thurlow and Ross Duncan joined Nothling as one-and-done Australian Test cricketers. BRISBANE STATE HIGH SCHOOL (QUEENSLAND) FIVE: Peter Allen #236 (1965), John Maclean #298 (1978-79), Ian Healy #344 (1988-99), Michael Kasprowicz #369 (1996-2006), Marnus Labuschagne #455 (2018-Current) Queensland and Australia’s largest secondary school is also the former home to past and present Test superstars, Ian Healy and Marnus Labuschagne Healy moulded himself into one of the world’s great wicketkeepers, playing 119 Tests between 1988 and 1999, and beat out a stacked field to be named in the Australian team of the 20th century. In 224 innings Healy recorded 395 dismissals, while going at a respectable 27.39 with the bat. His combination with Shane Warne became legendary and Healy will forever be one of Australia’s favourite Test cricketers. Labuschagne meanwhile has established himself as one of the best modern Test batsmen in the world, rising to 47th on Australia’s all-time Test run scorers list after just 48 innings at the crease. He averages 54.02 and already boasts seven Test centuries to his name.Michael ‘Kasper’ Kasprowicz took 113 wickets at 3.12 in 38 Tests between 1996 and 2006; his most notable stint at the crease coming in the famous 2005 Ashes when he and Brett Lee compiled a 59-run partnership that ended three agonising runs short of victory at Edgbaston.SHORE SCHOOL (NEW SOUTH WALES)FIVE: Albert Hopkins #82 (1902-09), Herbert Hordern #97 (1911-12), Roy Minnett #98 (1911-12), Jack Gegory #107 (1920-28), Phillip Emery #362 (1994) Phil Emery’s sole Test match in 1994 broke a 66-year baggy green drought for Sydney Church of England Grammar (Shore). He likely would have played many more if not for the presence of a man named Ian Healy taking ownership behind the stumps. Slink filled in for an injured Healy in the third Test against Pakistan at Lahore and made five dismissals. His only trip to the crease ended 8 not-out and he never saw the Test side again. Jack Gregory meanwhile holds the incredible record for fastest Test century of all time, when he raced to the ton in just 70 minutes against South Africa at Johannesburg in 1921. A powerful all-rounder, Gregory played 24 Tests for Australia. He made 1146 runs at 36.96 and took 85 wickets at 2.84.Both Herbert ‘Ranji’ Hordern and Roy Minnett were doctors first and cricketers second, and shared brief stints in the Australian Test team in 1911-12. Hordern took eight wickets on debut against South Africa and bagged 32 in the 1911-12 Test series against England, including 12-135 in the first Test in Sydney. Minnett played just nine Tests before retiring to focus on his career as a doctor. He finished with 391 runs at 26.06, including three 50s. AQUINAS COLLEGE (WESTERN AUSTRALIA)FIVE: Ernest Bromley #146 (1933-34), Terry Alderman #310 (1981-91), Justin Langer #354 (1993-2007), Brad Hogg #367 (1996-2008), Cameron Bancroft #451 (2017-19) Terry Alderman, Cameron Bancroft, Ernest Bromley, Brad Hogg, Justin Langer In Ernest Bromley, Aquinas produced the first-ever West Australian to play Test cricket for Australia. ‘Slogger’ debuted in the fourth Bodyline Test and made just one more appearance in the baggy green, in Australia’s 1934 tour of England. It would be another 47 years before a second Aquinas alum, Terry Alderman, represented Australia at Test level. The right-arm fast bowler would have much more success, playing in 41 Tests and amassing 170 wickets. Alderman did the bulk of his damage in England, TAKING more than 40 wickets on both the 1981 and 1989 tours. Two years after Alderman’s final Test cap it was Justin Langer’s turn to fly the flag for Aquinas. ‘JL’ debuted against the West Indies in 1993 and would go on to play 105 Tests for Australia over 15 years, amassing 7696 runs at 45.27 to establish himself as one of our all-time greatest opening batsmen.Brad Hogg holds the unenviable title of longest wait between his first and second Tests. The left-arm wrist spinner debuted against India in 1996 in Delhi but would have to wait another seven years to play another in the baggy green. That of course was in large part to the presence of arguably the greatest spin bowler of all time, Shane Warne. As for Cameron Bancroft, he will forever be remembered for his role in the Cape Town sandpaper incident that derailed a promising career as an opener for Australia. The soon-to-be 30 year old has not played a Test since 2019 and whether he sees another look in the baggy green remains to be seen. TRINITY COLLEGE (WESTERN AUSTRALIA)FIVE: Craig Serjeant #279 (1977-78), Michael Malone #282 (1977), Timothy Zoehrer #337 (1986-87), Simon Katich #384 (2001-10), Beau Casson #401 (2008)Michael Malone, Simon Katich, Beau Casson, Craig Serjeant, Timothy Zoehrer In one of the best form redemption stories in Australian cricket, Simon Katich went from Test team outsider to scoring six centuries in 16 matches batting out of position as an opener. The Trinity College alum enjoyed a Test career spanning a decade between 2001 and 2010, playing in 56 matches for 4188 runs at an impressive 45.03. He was also a more than serviceable wrist spinner, as evidenced by a 6-65 against Zimbabwe in 2003, though he was handed the ball in just 25 of his 99 Test innings. Another wrist spinner to come out of Trinity was Beau Casson, who played his sole Test against the West Indies in 2008 but found himself behind the likes of MacGill, Hogg and Cullen in the pecking order.Tim Zoehrer is one of many promising Australian wicketkeepers consigned to watching from the sidelines as Ian Healy took sole ownership of the role in the Test team. He was also, surprisingly, a competent legspinner, though was never handed the ball in his 10 Tests for Australia between 1986 and 87.

One of the greatest batsmen the world has ever seen is entering the twilight of his career.","content":"Steve Smith isn’t trying to alarm anyone, but he may only have a couple more years left in Test cricket. And that means a fairly major crossroads nears for the national team. “No, I don’t have a plan, but I’m 33 now,” Smith says.“I’ve been playing international cricket for 13 years. It’s a long time. I’m still enjoying it, but I’m certainly closer to the end than the start, that’s for sure.” Unless injury or illness robs him of a game, Smith is on track to bring up his 100th Test match for Australia during next year’s Ashes at Old Trafford — the scene of his extraordinary urn-clinching double-century in 2019. Smith’s current Test batting average of 60 is just a breath away from sitting as the second greatest of all time after Sir Donald Bradman’s 99.94.Another four Test centuries would bring him to 32 career tons — second only to Ricky Ponting (41) in the pantheon of Australian batting giants. Another 1800-odd runs would also see Smith join Ponting, Allan Border and Steve Waugh as the only Australians with 10,000 Test runs. And he could well beat Brian Lara to become the fastest man in cricket history to reach that rare, golden milestone. These numbers may not be relevant to when Smith does ultimately decide to call time. But they do illustrate the fact he has achieved just about all there is to conquer in the game of cricket, at least from an individual point of view. Smith threatened to almost single-handedly engineer a historic away win for Australia in India back in 2017, a team tilt he can throw all his weight into again in the new year.Winning an Ashes series in the UK can also be ticked off the bucket list in 2023, as well as a shot at adding a third World Cup trophy to the cabinet at the end of the year. It seems almost hard to believe that Smith could be preparing for his final chapter because even at 33, it still feels like he’s in the middle of his journey. But the double whammy of his 12-month Sandpapergate ban, followed by the lost years of Covid, has cruelly robbed Smith – and fans – of some of his prime cricketing years. “I really don’t know. I’d like to play for as long as I can while I’m still enjoying it and while I like working hard to get better,” Smith says.“When that stops, you know it’s the right time to finish up. We’ll see what the future holds. The major tournaments and series are the ones you want to be involved in and have an impact in as well, so there’s a few ones coming up over the next 12 to 18 months. “We’ll see how we go.” Smith’s Bradman-style explosion between 2014-17, where he piled on well over 1000 runs a year for four consecutive years, has slowed, with only two Test centuries made in the past three years. It’s been a frustrating slog as opposition attacks have executed plans that have nullified Smith’s ability to score. But there is another potential factor at play that Smith admits he still isn’t sure how to quantify.SCBBL PROMOPart of the magic of Smith’s golden period was that his avalanche of runs came at a time when Australia lived or died by whether Smith and David Warner succeeded or failed. There was a cutthroat pressure to so many of Smith’s great knocks, where he would somehow lift the Titanic after arriving at the crease with Australia in crisis. That extreme pressure to deliver in every innings is no longer there thanks in particular to the rise of Marnus Labuschagne, but also the mature-age bond of Warner and Usman Khawaja and the emergence of Travis Head and Cameron Green. It’s a double-edged sword for Smith, who is enjoying the less stressful existence these days, but at the same time still yearns for the rush it brought him to be Mr All Or Nothing. Smith also concedes he doesn’t know how much of a toll he might have paid for those years of high-octane pressure, and what that now means for the final chapter. “Maybe. It’s hard to get a gauge on it,” Smith says.“I liked the added pressure and responsibility. I probably thrived under it.“I’m not sure whether down towards the back end of my career whether that has taken a toll. I think there’s probably a bit less pressure than there potentially used to be. “There’s guys making valuable contributions all around with the bat. “You’d expect a couple of us to come off each innings almost in a way, which is really good for the team. We’ve got a good squad of batters together, and guys are playing some good cricket.”Smith denies he felt a weight lift from his shoulders when he broke a 10-innings century drought in Sri Lanka this year (the previous longest wait for a Smith century was his first 11 innings). However, he has embraced the fact he has entered a new phase of his career where the days of teams not being able to bowl to him are gone — and he now has to really earn every run he scores. “Potentially I guess I’m just facing a lot more balls to score my runs now a lot of the time,” Smith says.“Teams are setting a lot more defensive fields, so it’s going to take me longer to score bigger runs.“It’s absorbing a lot of pressure and wearing the bowlers down, and whilst I may not be getting the big scores, it helps others as well. It’s a team mentality. “I don’t think I have to change anything. I don’t have to change my strokeplay much. I would like to potentially put a bit more pressure back on at times and make them change some things. But particularly in Test cricket, it’s just getting the miles into the bowler’s legs as much as possible. And if you do that, someone is going to benefit at some point when the bowlers are tired.” Smith enters this Test summer having gone through the experience of being left out of a first-choice Australian XI. What impact may this have had on the inner workings of the quirky batting genius?Not selected for Australia until the final game of the Twenty20 World Cup, Smith’s predicament might be easily explained as “part of cricket”. But it’s not so straightforward to mentally process being dropped when you’re an immortal. Former Test selector Mark Waugh warned early in the warm-up games that Australia needed to be careful about Smith’s psyche and ego, given the unfamiliar territory he was cast into as a spare player. Waugh didn’t disagree with the decision to promote big-hitter Tim David over Smith in the T20 format, but felt Smith would not have liked the fact captain Aaron Finch pushed himself down to take Smith’s No.4 role in warm-up games. “It was a bit tough on Steve Smith. He was given no time to really play an innings in those warm-up games and prove his worth, even though everyone knows he’s a very good player,” Waugh said. “It wouldn’t have sat well with Steve Smith. He’s been No.4 all his career. Then Aaron Finch has popped down and taken that spot to facilitate Cameron Green at the top. I can understand the selectors going that way with David. But Smith would be hurting because he wants to play. It’s the World Cup and he still thinks he’s good enough. But he’s got to be professional enough, and he’s experienced enough to know that that sort of comes with the territory.”","pubDate":"2022-11-15 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Only teams with big talent pool can have different players for white and red ball cricket: Williamson","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/11/16/only-teams-with-big-talent-pool-can-have-different-players-for-white-and-red-ball-cricket-williamson/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Wellington: England’s phenomenal success in white-ball cricket has forced rivals to consider different set of players and coaches for the limited overs game and Tests but New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson feels only a team with a big talent pool can afford to take that route.

Williamson was referring to the vast reserve of players that a side like India possesses and a smaller nation like New Zealand doesn’t. At the moment, England is the only major cricket team to have different coaches with Brendon McCullum in charge of the Test side and Matthew Mott guiding the white-ball cricketers. “With the volume of cricket happening, that is definitely a challenge not just for the players but for the support staff too,” Williamson said in a virtual media interaction ahead of the limited overs series against India beginning here on Friday. “You are playing games every two or three days and that absolutely has its challenges and you see more and more around the world where formats are split and once again there is a balance to strike. “Some nations with larger player pools have more of an opportunity to do that and other sides have other challenges. You are always trying to balance that out and make sure guys are fresh.” Williamson, whose team lost in the T20 World Cup semis last week, was also asked if tournament champions England have set the template on how the shortest format should be played. “There are so many strong T20 sides and we saw it in this tournament more so than any other. There were a number of upsets. The English team plays a strong brand of cricket which is aggressive and suits the balance of their side and every team is always trying to work around its strength and play according to those to put out its best performance. “The game is evolving all the time but you also see it kind of go in circles where it goes in one direction and comes back to another. At the end, you are trying to understand what works for the team with the resources that you have,” Williamson said. The six match series against India, including three ODIs and as many T20Is, will start the team’s preparation for the 50-over World Cup in India next year, he said. India will be playing the series without their senior players but considering the ‘incredible depth’ they have, Williamson reckons the ones getting the opportunity will post a tough challenge for the team. ‘New Zealand tour will help Umran in his journey’ With India hitting the reset mode after yet another disappointing World Cup campaign, the likes of Umran Malik have a chance to prove themselves on the big stage. Besides a drastic change in powerplay batting approach, India also need an express pace bowler like Malik to support an injury-prone Jasprit Bumrah. Having worked with Malik in the IPL, Williamson backed him to do well in New Zealand. “Umran is a super exciting talent. Spent time with him last year and his raw pace was a real asset. Seeing him in the Indian international scene is an amazing rise. “When you have the ability to bowl 150 plus, it is very exciting. By being in the squad, clearly there are high hopes of his involvement with Indian cricket for a long time and coming on the tours like these will help him in his journey.” ‘Boult and Guptill remain big part of NZ set-up Finn Allen’s rise as an opener meant veteran Martin Guptill had to sit on the sidelines in the T20 World Cup. He is also not part of the squad for India series and neither is senior pacer Trent Boult, who recently opted out of a New Zealand central contract. Williamson said Guptill was not picked for the India series as the squad in a home series is not as big as an away series while they hope to unearth more pace bowling options in Boult’s absence. “With the moving landscape we are presented with, players have made a number of decisions and Trent being big part of our team has done that and although still available he has got a few other things to focus on. “There is an opportunity at the moment with other guys on the fringe to get some opportunity and for us building a team and growing as a team is really important. “But Trent is certainly a big part of New Zealand cricket and has been for a long time, it is going to be important to learn and get an understanding on how it looks over the next period,” said the skipper. On Guptill, he added: “You could argue that he has been our best white-ball cricketer ever, he is right up there. He brings good qualities to the team and was outstanding through out the World Cup and passed on his knowledge with the young ones. So full credit to him.” It is for the second time in as many years that India and New Zealand find themselves playing a bilateral T20 series less than a week after the World Cup final. Williamson said, as players, they have little control over the schedule. “Not just the World Cup, the schedule prior has been busy and has been the case for everybody. After a major event, there is an opportunity and sometimes a risk to have a few days off and come back together as a group but as you know the schedule is pretty full. “Any opportunity to play India is a special one. With India resting few of their players and bring in other players you see the challenges being faced with tight scheduling. That is being the nature of the beast.” India’s tour of New Zealand will be aired on Prime Video. —PTI Only teams with big talent pool can have different players for white and red ball cricket: Williamson added by Press Trust of India on 12:21 am November 16, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-11-15 18:51:04","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: Kane Williamson released by Indian Premier League side","link":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/sport/cricket-kane-williamson-released-by-indian-premier-league-side/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Black Caps skipper Kane Williamson will be a free agent in the Indian Premier League after being released by the Sunrisers Hyderabad franchise, according to reports.

Tuesday was the last date to announce the full list of players retained and released by the teams ahead of the mini auction, scheduled to be held on December 23 in Kochi. The day started with Mumbai Indians’ longstanding West Indian all-rounder Kieron Pollard announcing his retirement from the IPL, only to be drafted as the five-time champions’ batting coach. Mumbai Indians have released as many as 13 players. In other big movements, Punjab Kings have released their last edition’s captain Mayank Agarwal, while West Indies skipper Nicholas Pooran was released by Sunrisers Hyderabad. Besides Bravo, CSK have also decided to let go of England’s death-overs specialist Chris Jordan, a move that might surprise some. CSK chief executive officer Kasi Viswanathan said, “It’s a very tough call. As far as retention is concerned and releasing of players, you know that CSK has always been very passionate with the players, and they have also been contributing to the franchise. It becomes very difficult for us to decide while releasing the players. “The contribution they have made to CSK will always be cherished and we know that if there is an opportunity for any of them to come back, they will be back in CSK colours.” As far as CSK’s captaincy is concerned, Kasi made it clear that their talisman Mahendra Singh Dhoni will lead the side. “Everybody knows that Thalaiva (Dhoni) will lead the side and he will do his best and the team will do well,” he said. Meanwhile, Delhi Capitals have released four players which include Indians Mandeep Singh, KS Bharat and Ashwin Hebbar and New Zealand wicketkeeper-batter Tim Seifert. The Delhi Capitals have also traded all-rounder Shardul Thakur to Kolkata Knight Riders and brought all-rounder Aman Khan in his place. Inaugural edition winners Rajasthan Royals have released nine players in total comprising four Indians and five overseas players, leaving them with a purse of Rs 13.2 crore. The players released include James Neesham, Nathan Coulter-Nile, and Rassie van der Dussen among others. RR’s director of cricket, Kumar Sangakkara said it was tough to make some decisions after the Royals finished as runners-up in the last edition. “… As a high performance team, you have to keep evolving and looking for squad enhancing opportunities in order to stay at the top. “Our ambition is to go that extra mile in IPL 2023, and hence some decisions have been made which give us greater flexibility in the auction to compete with other teams and go for players who we feel can add value to this squad,” Sangakkara said. While Sunrisers Hyderabad will have the highest remaining purse of Rs 42.25 crore heading into the auction, Punjab Kings and Lucknow Super Giants will have Rs 32.2 crore and 23.35 crore, respectively, in their hands. This time the teams will also receive an extra Rs 5 crore to spend at the auction. Jason Behrendorff, Aneeshwar Gautam, Chama Milind, Luvnith Sisodia, Sherfane Rutherford were the players released by Royal Challengers Bangalore, leaving them with a purse of Rs 8.75 crore. Lockie Ferguson, Dominic Drakes, Gurkeerat Singh and Jason Roy were among the six players released by reigning champions Gujarat Titans. As far as SRH are concerned, Williamson was their most expensive player (Rs 14 crore). While spending eight years with them, the Kiwi scored 2101 runs at an average of 36.22 and a strike rate of 126.03. He played 76 matches for Sunrisers and captained them 46 times. However, SRH had an underwhelming season under his rein as out of 14 games, Hyderabad won only six last year. In addition to Williamson, Pooran’s departure will free up Rs 10.75 crore, making SRH the team with the biggest purse going into the mini auction. At Rs 12 crore, Agarwal was the first player Punjab retained ahead of the mega auction last year. Agarwal, who appointed captain for the 2022 season, finished with only 196 runs in 12 innings at an average of 16.33 and a strike rate of 122.50.

With that, the team holds the ODI and T20 World Cup at the same time. One of the players who is fully responsible for that is all-rounder Ben Stokes. The 31-year-old announced his retirement from ODI cricket last July. In this context, there is a request from the England Cricket Board, coach, ex-player etc. to reconsider the ODI retirement decision as their team needs such a match winner. Which team would want to miss out on a player who can shine as a match-winner in major tournaments like the 2019 ODI World Cup final and the final of the ongoing T20 World Cup series. In addition, the ODI World Cup series will be held next year. Keeping that in mind, this request has been made. “Ben Stokes can you play in the ODI World Cup series next year? I am asking this for the country,” said former England captain Michael Vaughan in a tweet. It is noteworthy that Stokes had said during the one-day cricket break that he could not give 100 percent in this format. “When he told me about retirement from ODI cricket, I used to say the word ‘retirement’ to him. He took that decision voluntarily. Here begins the 50-over World Cup year. At this stage we are not going to play much T20 cricket. So he can reconsider his decision,” England coach Matthew Mott said. Earlier, it was Stokes who made his comeback to the field by saying that he would take an indefinite break from cricket.","pubDate":"2022-11-15 15:00:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2023 Player Retention: Full list of retained players","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/ipl-2023-retention-list-check-team-wise-retained-players-list-csk-mi-rcb-rr-dc-pbks-kkr-srh-gt-lsg-11634131.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2023 Player Retention: Full list of retained players","content":"Cricket IPL 2023 Player Retention: Full list of retained players One of the biggest headlines was West Indian Kieron Pollard bidding adieu to the Indian Premier League (IPL) after spending 13 years with Mumbai Indians (MI) FirstCricket Staff November 15th, 2022 19:51:46 IST File image of IPL trophy. iplt20.com The deadline of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 player retention ended at 5 pm IST on Tuesday (15 November), and while there were some surprises, there were a few expected moves as well.

We have no shortage.","content":"Here we name our KFC T20 Max women’s Sci-Fleet Motors Men’s First Grade Two Day competition Team of the Week and reveal the best youngsters from Lord’s Taverners action.The best performance of the weekend was taken out by Marist College Ashgrove Old Boy Tom Collier and it was not even close. The right handed batsmen who tends to score better after a big night, scorched his way to 194 runs as Valley second grade piled on 5-441 against Toombul.The 19-year-old played four years in the First XI at Ashgrove and it is a knock of this calibre that the Ashgrove supporters were itching for in his time fighting for a premiership. On Saturday, the best of young Collier was on show at Yoku road and perhaps it is a sign of more to come from the second grade battler sure to get a run in first grade soon enough.See below for the rundown.THE PREMIER WRAPA string of remarkable batting partnerships saw records tumble in the KFC Queensland Premier Cricket, resulting in some tough choices for the Team of the Week. Valley captain Justin O’Neill and rising batsman Dylan McLachlan produced a stand-out performance against Toombul, with their stand of 324 breaking the record for the highest third wicket partnership of 249 previously held by Test great Matthew Hayden and Queensland allrounder Brett Henschell in 1992-93.Opener O’Neill finished 140 not out while McLachlan, who has represented the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander team along with brother Brock, hit a superb 188 as Valley powered to 3-365 declared.It was one of four match-defining partnerships in the Sci-Fleet Motors First Grade competition.Regional Queensland products Mitchell Doolan (Mackay) and Sam Neale (Toowoomba) produced a stirring eighth wicket stand that rescued Norths against Ipswich.The Vikings were 7-102 before Doolan (129) and Neale (137) combined for a 260-run partnership that saw them each register their maiden first grade centuries.Norths finished with a sizable total of 424.The prolific Wests duo of Sam Truloff and Steve McGiffin put on 213 for the third wicket against Gold Coast, with Bulls batsman Truloff hitting 109 and allrounder McGiffin producing 110 as Wests finished with 366.Year 12 student Matthew Love, the son of Queensland great Martin, made the most of an elevation to the top grade as he and leg-spinner James Roseware produced a 170-run partnership for the seventh wicket to give the Magpies the upper hand against Wynnum-Manly.Love made a patient 76 while Rosewarne finished with 101 against a Wynnum attack that included Queensland left-armer Liam Guthrie and new signing Jehan Daniel, a former Sri Lankan Under-19 allrounder with first class experience in Sri Lanka.And while there wasn’t a big partnership, James Grady continued the run glut around the grounds with a neat hundred for University of Queensland against Sunshine Coast.Redlands bucked the trend though, as ball dominated for them on the way to bundling out Sandgate-Redcliffe for just 67 at Peter Burge Oval.Queensland and Brisbane Heat allrounder James Bazley was the destroyer with 4-11 while evergreen paceman Jon Stimpson claimed 3-12. There were big efforts in the lower grades as well, with Valley Second grader Tom Collier claiming the highest score of the round, hitting 194 as his team piled on 5-441 against Toombul.Elsewhere, there some notable bowling, with the pick of the grades being 7-19 for Hayden Guse in Fifth grade for Norths, while Wests stalwart Nic Purser closed in on 600 wickets for the club with 5-41 from 34 overs in Sixth gradeThe women’s KFC T20 Max competition will move into its Finals phase next week, with Valley, University of Queensland, Sunshine Coast and Sandgate-Redcliffe to compete for the title.Sandgate-Redcliffe’s Tess Cooper produced a superb match-winning 92 against Wests, which challenged hard with Olivia Steel (72) leading the counter-attack. It wasn’t all plain sailing for Sandgate-Redcliffe though with University of Queensland comfortably defeating them in the afternoon round of games.Valley, the defending one-day Katherine Raymont Shield champions were comfortable winners in their two matches, with Holly Hogan producing a tidy pair of 40s and rising allrounder Sienna Ginger delivering figures of 3-6 against the Gold Coast.Sunshine Coast wicket-keeper Mikayla Wrigley produced two significant innings for the Scorchers, including a 75 not out against fifth-placed Wynnum-Manly.Wynnum-Manly enjoyed a decent win over Gold Coast, with Amy Riddell (56) producing the first of two half centuries for the day. She also collected 51 not out as she and promising batter Grace Collins 53 not out batted solidly against the Sunshine Coast.TEAM OF THE WEEKJustin O’Neill (Valley, 140no, 1st grade)Tom Collier (Valley, 194, 2nd grade)Sam Truloff (Wests, 109, 1st grade)Dylan McLachlan (Valley,188, 1st grade)Tess Cooper (Sandgate-Redcliffe, 92, 1st grade) T20James Rosewarne (Souths, 101, 1st grade)Sam Neale (Norths, 137, 1st grade)Sienna Ginger (Valley, 3-6, 1st grade T20)James Bazley (Redlands, 4-11, 1st grade)Ashton Gumm (Gold Coast, 6-82, 2nd grade)Hayden Guse (Norths, 7-19, 5th grade)Nic Purser (Wests, 5-41, 6th grade)Mikayla Wrigley (Sunshine Coast, 75no, 1st grade T20)LORD’S TAVERNERS TEAM OF THE WEEKRyan Summers (South Brisbane)Summers had a day out with the red, bowling a whopping seven maidens on his way to a brilliant three wicket haul. He only leaked eight runs in his 10 overs. Does it get better than that?Talon Reichert (Sunshine Coast)Reichert put in his all to defend his side’s 75 runs. He picked up three but after 22 overs South Brisbane got there. Both openers and the No.4 batsmen were all Reicherts.Lachlan Bragger (Wynnum-Manly)The tail doesn’t stop wagging especially with Bragger batting. This guy hit 24 important runs at No.10 to help his team post a defendable 112. If he’d got 30 UQ may have fallen short. But, a cracking cameo to finish the innings regardless.Brayden Meegama (UQ)4/9 off 10. Yes you read that right. Meegama had it on a string and the Wynnum-Manly batters had no answers, all they could do was block him out. He had five maidens, building all the pressure.Abhimanyu Yadav, Hayden Entriken and Sree Bachu (UQ)The first three batsmen for UQ did their job and a little more. 112 sounds like an easy target but are chases ever really that easy? It wouldn’t have been had these three not clicked into gear to begin the innings. Yadav hit 18, Entriken 35 and Bachu 27, before the following four batters fell cheaply for a combined 7 runs. It came down to the wire but UQ got there with a wicket to spare, tail-ender Tom Gillett playing his part with 11 off 4.Ryan Hines and Luke Harper (Ipswich)Hines had a lovely knock, hurrying his way 29 off just 31. Meanwhile, Harper took his time with a 27 off 57. It is worth noting Harper was doing the right thing—making sure to bat all the overs and extract as many runs as possible. And, it almost worked.Rowan Grant and Luke Franks (Redlands)Harper’s plan was running accordingly before Grant and Franks set foot on the pitch. A partnership of dreams from the No.7 and No.8 batsmen allowed Redlands to scrape their way to the required 155. With only an over to spare, Grant’s 43 and Franks 36 steered the team home. Ipswich’s Luke Harper and Ayaan Latif didn’t make it easy for them, each collecting two scalps early before these two steadied the shift.Harry Frost (Valley)Harry was the opposite of Frost on Sunday, the kid was on fire. Seeing them like balloons he was, dispatching the Sandgate-Redcliffe bowlers to the fence with ease. He was dismissed, 126 balls and 114 brilliant runs later.Luke Ward (Valley)Ward was on fire with Frost. He scored quickly, smacking nine 4s on his way to a classy 65. This damaging duo could not have started things off better for the homeside. Only the Sandgate-Redcliffe boys know how they successfully chased 262.Mathew Fielding and Kane Neilsen (Sandgate-Redcliffe)Openers Fielding and Neilson could not out-do Ward and Frost but boy they were close. With 43 and 41 respectively, the consistent run-scorers could not have begun the chase any better. Fielding especially, scoring 43 off 24, with two 6s.Steven Hogan and Bailey Todd (Sandgate-Redcliffe)What Fielding and Neilson did was good but not enough. Luckily Hogan had his cape on, the first change batsmen putting on a clinic to 96 of the best. And if that wasn’t enough to make the Valley bowlers rethink their strategies, Todd was chipping away with a cool 41 off 45. How about that for a team effort.Bailey Garnham, Griffith Williams, Gabriel Leitch and Harry Smith (Gold Coast)Garnham and Williams set the foundation with 49 and 62, before 33 from Leitch and 40 from Smith said “try chase this” to their Toombul rivals. Garnham and Williams kept the scoreboard ticking over, but even more impressive was No.6 Leitch and No.7 Smith, who both scored at over a run-a-ball.Jack Balkin (Toombul)Balkin batted his guts out at first drop but it wasn’t enough to tackle 215. But, high praise to the youngster who hit 60 off 80.Ned Hanrahan (Gold Coast)Hanrahan just takes wickets. He dismissed the key man Balkin and another two which were crucial to ensure they defended their total. And, that’s exactly what they did, bowling Toombul out for 187.Daniel Skipwith and Jack Sonter (Western Suburbs)Well these boys just keep delivering. It’s like every week they get a score. This time around, opener Skipwith surged to 91 off 122. And of course Sonter wanted to join the party, climbing to 61 runs off 84.Dominic Black (Darling Downs & SW Queensland)262 runs is no easy task, with the Western Suburbs winning by 72 runs. Charlie Bignell had his game face on with a valiant 40 opening, as did Black scoring an unbeaten 51 off 74. But, Black just needed his teammates to score a bit quicker and a nail biting game would’ve been on the cards. Lachlan Heycox (Wide Bay)Heycox has a way of bumping up his average. On Sunday, the No.7 scored an unbeaten 46 off 60, running between the wickets like a man on a mission.Oscar Bodimeade and Alexander Procopis (Northern Suburbs)Bodimeade had one idea in mind when opening the batting and that was being there for his team. And indeed he was, setting sail with a neat 42 before a Procopis takeover put the nail in the coffin. Once again Procopis was a man possessed, smacking 67 off 61 to get the win comfortably.","pubDate":"2022-11-15 14:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Dhoni Re-Entry in Indian Cricket: How?","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/dhoni-re-entry-in-indian-cricket-how/","keywords":["Sports","Cricket","Dhoni","India","online special","T20","T20 WC"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Last Updated : 15 Nov, 2022 05:51 PM Published : 15 Nov 2022 05:51 PM Last Updated : 15 Nov 2022 05:51 PM Dhoni | file It has been reported that the former captain of the Indian cricket team, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, is going to re-enter the team.

Let’s see how it is possible.. The Indian cricket team was eliminated in the semi-finals of the recently concluded T20 World Cup series against the England team. Since then fans have been praising the fame of former captain Dhoni. Dhoni is one of the best captains in international cricket. In this context, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) seems to have come up with a strong plan to avoid the team’s relegation in the major matches of the ICC series. It is said that they have decided to do it with Dhoni, who has won ICC trophies for the country. An urgent call is to be made to him from the board for that. It seems that this call will be made so that Dhoni’s role in T20 cricket will be more. It is also called permanent roll. BCCI project? – The board wants to use Dhoni in T20 cricket as the workload of head coach Rahul Dravid has increased due to three formats of cricket. It is believed that this will improve the quality of the team. This will be discussed in the BCCI Council meeting. Dhoni: Director of T20 cricket? – After retiring from international cricket, Dhoni worked with the team during the 2021 T20 World Cup. But it was a temporary task. As the task was only for a few days, the expected results did not come. So, BCCI wants to give him a big responsibility this time depending on the T20 cricket team set-up. It is reported that Dhoni will retire from all forms of cricket after the IPL season next year. After that he will be given this responsibility. Moreover, he has a plan to lead a group of special players and make it an Indian T20 team. It seems that this team will be built entirely according to Dhoni’s ability and will. This is a move with the 2024 T20 World Cup in mind.

It does not make good reading. But out of every crisis there comes opportunity, and so it could be here.As we report today, disability advocates say that fixing Brisbane’s woeful lack of accessibility will take every second of the nine years and nine months we have left before the 2032 Paralympics.Beyond a serious problem with disability access to those Paralympic venues that already exist, the city itself is a mess when it comes to accessibility – with even our biggest magnets for people like the shopping precinct in the Queen Street Mall or the party district in Fortitude Valley a massive challenge to get around if you are in a wheelchair, like Todd Winther. He says Brisbane’s narrow pathways are filled with potholes and that public transport is “risky” – and he asks: “If places like the Valley and the City still aren’t accessible by then, what does that say about our city? But if they want to fix it for the Paralympic Games, time is really running out.”Hosting the Games in Brisbane now would “cause mayhem”, according to Youngcare. The Premier cannot ignore this reality.But the good news is that experts say Brisbane is in a better position than most cities to become a world leader in accessibility. On the venues, experts believe retro-fitting existing facilities ahead of the Games will be considerably easier than in cities like Paris, because Brisbane is relatively modern and small by international standards. But it will still be a challenge, because as anyone who has renovated a home knows, sometimes it’s easier to rebuild.Of the 37 competition venues required for hosting the 2032 Games, only six new ones will be built specifically. Of the remaining 31, eight will involve the upgrading of existing facilities and 23 will involve either existing facilities or ones temporarily built for the Games. Now, the Queensland government has already done the right thing and adopted inclusive design principles for new facilities, but it will still need to substantially modify existing facilities to reach the rigorous standards required by the International Olympic Committee. We suggest that those standards also be applied to anything built via a state government contract.But this challenge is far bigger than venues, and the government should listen carefully to those who live this challenge every day – to advocates such as Paralympic medallist Karni Liddell, who suggests that a person in a wheelchair be involved in every single Games decision: “Everything from now until then has to have someone with an electric wheelchair involved. Don’t follow architects, don’t follow the standards – you need to have someone in a wheelchair at all times.” We agree. That is an idea that just seems like common sense. Over to you, Premier.PLENTY OF ACTION AHEAD FOR CRICKET FANSAustralia’s international cricket season has just had the best entree possible, with the T20 World Cup capturing the imagination of fans from all over the globe.The only problem was, Aussie fans were left cold following a rather insipid performance on the big stage.But as we report in our 16-page season liftout today, there is plenty more for cricket fans to look forward to, with men’s Test series against the West Indies and South Africa, women’s one-dayers against Pakistan and T20s against India, plus the Big Bash and plenty of other action. And of course there’s Big Bash SuperCoach so everyone can be part of the action.For the men’s Test team under Pat Cummins, there will be a battle to win back the fans after the T20 World Cup flop, and lingering bitterness at the departure of former coach Justin Langer at the end of last summer.But there’s one sure way to get the fans back – to win. And then to take that form to England for the Ashes series that starts on June 16.","pubDate":"2022-11-15 12:40:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"On This Day: Sachin Tendulkar made his Test debut in 1989, walked out for final innings in 2013","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/on-this-day-sachin-tendulkar-made-his-test-debut-in-1989-walked-out-for-final-innings-in-2013-11630561.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"On This Day: Sachin Tendulkar made his Test debut in 1989, walked out for final innings in 2013","content":"On this day in 2013, Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, widely regarded as the ‘God of Cricket’, stepped onto the 22-yard pitch at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium to bat for one final time in international cricket, when India took on West Indies in the second Test.It was Day two of the Test match in Mumbai, and West Indies had been bowled out for 182 after Pragyan Ojha’s five-wicket haul helped hosts restrict the visitors.Openers Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan helped India off to a strong start in their first innings, forging a 77-run stand before the hosts lost Dhawan in the 14th over. It was not long before they lost Vijay too, who was dismissed just two deliveries after Dhawan.In came at No 4, Sachin Tendulkar to bat for one final time in international cricket. He received a rousing reception from the crowd at Wankhede Stadium, and impressed once again, scoring 74 off 118 balls. His 15-minute knock consisted of 12 fours. Tendulkar was eventually dismissed by Narsingh Deonarine in the 48th over, having forged a 144-run stand with Cheteshwar Pujara.India eventually went on to win the match by an innings and 126 runs, as well as the series 2-0. Tendulkar ended the Test series with 84 runs from two matches.Coincidentally, 15 November was the same day Tendulkar made his debut against Pakistan back in 1989. As Tendulkar has played a pivotal role in the development of Indian cricket, to mark the special day, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has shared a post celebrating the cricketer on their official Twitter handle. 🗓️ #OnThisDay1989 ➡️ 2013The legendary @sachin_rt made his #TeamIndia debut and 2️⃣4️⃣ years later, walked out to bat for one final time in international cricket 🇮🇳👏🏻🙌🏻 pic.twitter.com/ITnVtHKKA8— BCCI (@BCCI) November 15, 2022 The post read, “On this day, 1989-2013, The legendary Sachin Tendulkar made his Team India debut and 24 years later, walked out to bat for one final time in international cricket.”The chant “Sachin…Sachin”, that arose from the Wankhede during Sachin’s playing days, found its place in the comments section in no time. A lot of Indian fans showered their love on the great batter. Since being shared, the BCCI’s post has garnered as many as 6,500 likes on Twitter.A fan could not resist saying, “On this day, 1989, people saw GOD physically.”On this day, 1989, people saw GOD physically❤ pic.twitter.com/Xn97coCpIN— Smp Santoshhh mohann Phukannn (@SmpPhukan) November 15, 2022 A user explained, “Debut as a kid and retired as God.

He left for the pavilion in the first innings for just 15 runs off 24 balls and did not get an opportunity to bat in the second innings. However, it was just the beginning of his legacy. The India legend concluded his final knock with a half-century registering 74 runs off 118 deliveries.The little master holds nearly every major batting record including the most runs in Test and ODI cricket, the most hundreds in both formats, and the mind-numbing 100 international centuries in total.Looking at his ODI career, he had to face some hurdles at the beginning of his career. But after being assigned to open against New Zealand in 1994 and smashing 82 runs in 49 balls, he established his place at the top of the order and went on to become one of the greatest openers of all time.Additionally, during his six World Cup appearances between 1992 and 2011, Tendulkar appeared two times in the final in 2003 and 2011. On that magical night on 2 April 2011, the most-awaited day finally came as he lifted the prestigious ICC World Cup trophy, offering him the perfect farewell in front of his home crowd at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium.","pubDate":"2022-11-15 11:47:22","image_url":"https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/380x285/fixed/jpg/2021/11/Sachin-Tendulkar-final-innings-Wankhede-BCCI-640.jpg","source_id":"firstpost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New Aussie cricket captain revealed","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/alyssa-healy-to-be-locked-in-as-australian-captain-as-meg-lanning-hiatus-continues/news-story/55efc166f79080c81356e6a37757ef90","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries","Womens Cricket"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Alyssa Healy is set to be locked in as Australian captain this week, as Meg Lanning continues her extended break away from the game.","content":"Cricket Australia is expected announce its side to tour India, and News Corp understands Lanning is still on an extended break from the game and will not be named.Watch the Weber WBBL.

Start your free trial now >Healy will be announced Australian captain in Lanning’s absence, a tremendous honour for one of the game’s most successful international cricketers.Already vice-captain of the national side, Healy will lead Australia for as long as Lanning remains on an indefinite leave of absence.While Healy would not be drawn on her role for the Indian tour with the squad not named until later this week, she does believe the clash with Australia’s greatest recent white-ball rivals presents the chance to reset goals after an incredibly successful international cycle over the past four years.“It’s just an amazing group of women at the moment that have done some really amazing things over the last … four years,” Healy said.“It’s almost an opportunity with Rachael Haynes leaving and Meg’s status a little bit up in the air, it’s a nice little opportunity for us to reset and go, what are our challenges coming next and where do we want to place ourselves moving forward and how we want to play.“We still don’t know quite what Meg’s doing just yet, so for me, I’m still vice-captain and I’ll play my role, whatever that might be, over in India.“If the opportunity comes about to lead, then I’ll grab it with both hands and really enjoy that opportunity.”Australia and India have built an incredible rivalry in the women’s game recently, most notably in T20 cricket, with the two nations facing off in both the 2020 T20 World Cup final and this year’s Commonwealth Games decider, with the Aussies coming out on top on both occasions.“They’re probably one of the strongest white ball teams going around and we seem to come up against one another quite a lot in – whether it be in ICC events or even the Comm Games final earlier this year as well.“It is becoming one of the big rivalries in the sport, which is really cool and we seem to manage to get over the top of them in the big moments but I’ve got no doubt that that’ll change at some point.”With five games planned for next month, there’s likely to be plenty of ebb and flow, especially among players that know each other’s games so well having played together in the WBBL and England’s The Hundred, with the inaugural women’s IPL rumoured to be on the cards early next year.“They’re a really good side. I hesitate to use the words up-and-coming because I think everyone knows how good they are, although I’m not sure if they quite know how good they are yet - which is kind of scary for everybody else in the world,” Healy said.“But I think with a five-match series, especially the T20 format, I’ve got no doubt that there’ll be five tough games, five really good contests and obviously with the next 50-over World Cup in India, in 2025, it’s a great opportunity for us to get over there and play in those conditions and potentially take some young kids over there to get some experience as well.”India has been a happy hunting ground for Healy, who posted her first international century there and has thrived in the conditions.And she believes it can be a galvanising tour for an Australian group that is starting to undergo some generational change.“A tour of the subcontinent is actually a really cool one to be involved with simply because the team really enjoy one another’s company and in places like that, you generally spend a bit more time together as a team and they’re the really cool, fun trips that you want to be a part of because they’re some of the memories that will stick with you.“It’s always a great place to go on tour, they look after you beautifully and you always get access to some great facilities, so all the girls are really excited to get out there.”","pubDate":"2022-11-15 11:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Glaring problem with World Cup celebration","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/englands-t20-world-cup-champagne-celebrations-spark-debate/news-story/b36e73611b195f070865e0c7d618bc20","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries","World Twenty20"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Footage from the T20 World Cup final has sparked debate after two Muslim players were briefly excluded from England’s post-match celebrations on Sunday evening.","content":"England defeated Pakistan by five wickets in front of 80,462 spectators at the MCG to become the first men’s team to simultaneously possess the ODI and T20 World Cup trophies.Watch Australia v England.

The 35-year-old wanted to carry on playing for a few more years but decided to retire from IPL after discussion with the five-time champions. Pollard, who has 3412 IPL runs in 189 matches, had made his MI debut back in 2010. However, his strong association with the franchise remains as he will be the team’s new batting coach. “It hasn’t been the easiest decision to make as I intend to keep playing for a few more years, but following discussions with Mumbai Indians have decided to call time on my IPL career,” said Pollard in a statement. “I understand that this incredible franchise which has achieved so much needs to transition and if I’m no longer to play for MI then I cannot see myself playing against MI either.’Once an MI always an MI”. Pollard, however, will be playing for MI-owned franchise in the inaugural International League T20 in the United Arab Emirates. “This is not an emotional goodbye to MI however as I have agreed to take up the role of batting coach in the IPL as well as play with MI Emirates. “This next chapter of my career is genuinely exciting and allows me to transition myself too from playing to coaching. I am immensely proud, honoured and blessed to have represented the biggest and most successful team in the IPL for the past 13 seasons. “It was always an aspiration to play for this fantastic team and although I will miss the buzz of the IPL you get as a player, I take comfort in knowing that I have been fortunate enough to have played with some of the best players in the world in front of our passionate fans.” Besides five IPL titles, Pollard also helped MI win two Champions League titles in 2011 and 2013. At MI, he will replace Robin Singh as batting coach. “I must give big thanks to the Coaches, Managers and other backroom support staff we have had at Mumbai Indians and who I now join. “We would not have achieved the success over the years without their continuing hard work, dedication and commitment to creating the best environment and look forward to emulating their successful approach.” “In particular I would like to pay special tribute to my good friend Robin Singh for his sound advice and guidance over the years and whose very shoes I now fill,” said Pollard, who also thanked the Ambani family for their tremendous “love, support and respect”. “Today I make this step with hope and excitement towards the future knowing that I will be playing a role in an institution, whose values align so closely to mine, where ‘We are family’,” added Pollard. The other IPL stars who have represented one franchise include Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah, Sunil Narine and Lasith Malinga. As MI finished last earlier this year, it became clear that the most successful IPL franchise needed a change in direction. Pollard too had an ordinary season, managing 144 runs in 11 games.
