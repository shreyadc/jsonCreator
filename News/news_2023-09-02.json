After winning the toss and opting to bat, Bairstow finished with an unbeaten 86 off 60 balls and Brook impressed with 67 from 36 as England finished on 198 runs for four. Atkinson made an immediate impression by taking the wickets of Devon Conway, Tim Seifert, Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson. Already named in England's preliminary squad for the World Cup in India, which begins in October, Atkinson was given his chance to prove his worth and wasted no time taking it. England started slowly but once Bairstow and Brook got going there was no stopping them as they combined for 131 runs. \"In recent times I've tried to play the ball on merit as much as possible. If I feel I can take an option on, I'll take it,\" Brook said. \"I try and move around in the crease as much as possible, I'm just trying to hit the ball where it's meant to be hit.\" To the disappointment of the Old Trafford crowd, Brook was finally taken out in the 17th over. After hitting five fours and five sixes he attempted another big shot but did not quite get hold of it and Finn Allen had a simple catch. New Zealand made a faster start than England had but wickets continued to fall at a steady pace. Adil Rashid claimed two to reach 97 T20I wickets, taking over from Chris Jordan as England's leading T20 wicket-taker. It was debutant Atkinson, however, who stole the show. He finished off proceedings in style, taking three wickets in the 13th over to finish off New Zealand. \"They just told me to do what I've been doing and that's what I tried to do and it went great,\" Atkinson said. \"I try to keep as cool as possible and whatever happens, happens, thankfully it went well.\" The third T20 of the series will be at Edgbaston on Sunday.

Debutant Gus Atkinson then took a superb four for 20 as the Kiwis slumped to 103 all out in a dismal reply. Two games. Two wins! Well played, lads 👊 | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) The victory gave England a 2-0 lead in the four-match series coming after a similarly comfortable win in the opening game at Durham on Wednesday. The platform was laid by Bairstow and Brook as the pair put on 131 for the third wicket in a blistering 65 balls. Bairstow batted throughout the innings, hitting eight fours and four sixes from 60 deliveries while Brook, making another point following his World Cup omission, smashed five maximums in his 36-ball 67. New Zealand captain Tim Southee bore the brunt of their big-hitting, conceding 23 in one over on his way to figures of one for 48. Bairstow actually had a nervy start as he played and missed, survived a leg before appeal and scampered a tight single in a good first over from the lively Adam Milne. Yet he was soon into his stride, driving Tim Southee over the top in the next and following up with further boundaries off Milne and Mitchell Santner. Will Jacks also attacked and hit two fours and a six in one Lockie Ferguson over but he fell for 19 when he miscued a pull off Southee to midwicket. Dawid Malan quickly followed for a duck as he was bowled by Santner. That brought Bairstow and Brook together and the Yorkshire duo went on the offensive. Bairstow slog-swept Santner for six and Brook smashed two straight maximums off Ish Sodhi. Bairstow then brought up his half-century in 40 balls with successive fours off Santner before the acceleration really began with 23 from one Southee over. The boundaries kept coming and Brook reached a 31-ball 50 in another expensive Southee over in which he hit two sixes and a four. The entertaining partnership eventually ended when Brook, after slog-sweeping Sodhi for another four, holed out to Finn Allen at long on. Moeen Ali despatched his first ball off Sodhi over the legside boundary but then found Milne in the deep attempting the same shot. Bairstow saw little of the strike in the closing overs as Milne, particularly, brought some discipline back to the attack but Jos Buttler took the hosts close to 200 with 13 from eight balls. New Zealand’s reply got off to a bad start as Devon Conway chipped to Liam Livingstone at deep square leg to hand Atkinson his first international wicket in the second over.

Glenn Phillips began a recovery but Adil Rashid had him caught on the boundary by Brook for 22 and Mark Chapman, after launching Liam Livingstone for a straight six, then picked out the same fielder. Daryl Mitchell was caught behind off Brydon Carse, Santner clean bowled by Jacks and Milne reversed swept Rashid into the hands of Ali at slip. Tim Seifert offered the greatest resistance but he fell for 39 when he sliced Atkinson high into the air and Buttler claimed a steepling catch. Southee and Ferguson then fell in the same Atkinson over as the Surrey seamer wrapped the game in style.","pubDate":"2023-09-01 20:30:56","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17182304/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8f1bb2705739212b39343a06bb1c8c69","title":"Mitchell Marsh and Matt Short crack fifties as Australia cruise towards series victory over South Africa","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/mitchell-marsh-and-matt-short-crack-fifties-as-australia-cruise-towards-series-victory-over-south-africa/news-story/2c1352da0a6fa2bc6eb2070e5310cfb6","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia has cruised towards an unassailable 2-0 lead in their T20 series against South Africa after thumping the Proteas by eight wickets in Durban on Friday evening.","content":"Australia has cruised towards an unassailable 2-0 lead in their T20 series against South Africa after thumping the Proteas by eight wickets in Durban on Friday evening. Opener Matthew Short (66 from 30 balls) and captain Mitchell Marsh (79* from 39 balls) combined for a century stand as Australia chased the under-par 165-run target with 31 balls to spare. Marsh, who also top-scored for Australia during Wednesday’s series opener , cleared the boundary rope six times in another brutal batting performance. The West Australian has now scored 137 in the series without being dismissed. “It’s quite hard to keep your nerve when you’ve got two big boys trying to smoke you out of the ground the whole time,” Proteas captain Aiden Markram confessed in the post-match presentation. “We certainly got challenged tonight, but there are lessons we can take forward.” MATCH CENTRE: South Africa vs Australia second T20 scorecard Earlier, Australian quicks Sean Abbott and Nathan Ellis each snared three wickets, helping restrict South Africa to 8-164 from their 20 overs. Australia made two changes to its starting XI, with Adam Zampa and Jason Behrendorff replacing Tanveer Sangha and Spencer Johnson. Proteas opener Temba Bavuma got off to a blistering start after Marsh won the toss and elected to field first, cracking seven boundaries in the opening three overs, including a hook shot against Jason Behrendorff that flew over fine leg for six. Abbott only needed one delivery to end Bavuma’s onslaught, with the right-hander departing for 35 (17) after Australian wicketkeeper Josh Inglis settled underneath a leading edge.

Ellis was introduced to the attack in the sixth over and ended the Powerplay with a double-wicket maiden. After removing South African opener Reeza Hendricks LBW for 3 (9), the Tasmanian seamer knocked over the dangerous Dewald Brevis the following delivery, edging behind for a golden duck. The hat-trick delivery narrowly evaded Tristan Stubbs’ outside edge. South Africa had lost 4-10 in a chaotic 16-ball passage of play, leaving the hosts in a spot of bother at 4-46 after six overs. However, Stubbs and Markram steadied the ship with a 51-run partnership for the fifth wicket. Stubbs nailed a lap shot against West Australian all-rounder Aaron Hardie that flew over the wicketkeeper’s head for six before botching a reverse scoop against Behrendorff, bowled by a slower ball for 27 (20). Bjorn Fortuin became Abbott’s second victim in the 14th over after top-edging a cut stoke towards Hardie at point, exposing South Africa’s tail. The dismissal forced Markram to counter-attack, smacking a handful of elegant boundaries to ensure the Proteas registered a defendable total. Ellis snared his third dismissal with a back-of-the-hand slower ball that Gerald Coetzee spooned towards Marsh at cover, gone for 11 (11). Markham fell agonisingly short of a half-century, slapping a low full toss from Abbott towards the point boundary rider for 49 (38) in the penultimate over. Lungi Ngidi provided some valuable late runs, while Abbott finished with career-best figures of 3-22, later named player of the match. Sean Abbott of Australia.

Australian opener Travis Head wasn’t as lucky, charging at Proteas seamer Lizaad Williams and chipping a regulation catch towards mid-on for 18 (17). Short blasted 20 runs from the final over of the Powerplay, delivered by Lungi Ngidi, before combining with Marsh for a 100-run partnership for the second wicket. Bavuma put down a tough chance at deep mid-wicket in the tenth over, gifting the Australian skipper an extra life on 32. The Victorian reached his maiden international fifty in just 25 deliveries, scoring five consecutive boundaries during a wayward over from Coetzee. He brought up a century partnership with Marsh in the 12th over, but returned to the sheds the next delivery, with Proteas spinner Tabraiz Shamsi unearthing the much-needed breakthrough. Marsh continued on his merry way, reaching his half-century in 28 deliveries before slapping back-to-back sixes against Shamsi over square leg. The Australians cruised towards the target in the 15th over, with Inglis finishing unbeaten on 2. “In my time playing in South Africa, a series win is very hard to come by,” Marsh said at the post-match presentation. “I’m rapt for our young guys who have come in and played the way they have, and I thought tonight the game was set up by our bowlers, for sure.” The third T20 between South Africa and Australia gets underway at the same venue on Sunday, with the first ball scheduled for 10pm AEST.

The home side were sent in to bat in Durban and posted 164 for eight in their 20 overs, a total that never looked enough with the small boundaries at Kingsmead. Australia had little trouble knocking off their target in 14.5 overs as Marsh followed up his unbeaten 92 in the 111-run victory in the first match on Wednesday with 79 not out from 39 deliveries, including eight fours and six sixes. He put on 100 in 45 balls for the second wicket with impressive opener Matthew Short, who was both elegant and brutal in equal measure for his 66 from 30 balls. It was a maiden international half century for Short after he debuted in the first game of the series. \"It's great, I’m proud of the boys because a series win in South Africa is hard to come by,\" Marsh said at the post-match presentation. \"Tonight the game was set up by the bowlers, they were all fantastic.\" Home skipper Aiden Markram was the top scorer in South Africa’s innings with 49 from 38 balls after opener Temba Bavuma was fast out of the blocks with 35 off 17. But Australia picked up wickets at regular intervals with some clever changes of pace and swing on a helpful wicket. Seamers Shaun Abbott (3-22) and Nathan Ellis (3-25) were the pick of their bowlers, with Jason Behrendorff chipping in with a handy 2-25. \"Temba got us off to a great start but the loss of (regular) wickets made it challenging,\" Markram said. \"We wanted to take it deep. When they came on to bat it can be hard when there are two batters trying to muscle it out of the ground.\" The final match in the series is at the same venue on Sunday before the teams switch formats for a five-game One-Day International series ahead of the World Cup that starts in India next month.

The clash of titans is poised to be a historic showdown that will be etched in cricket­ing annals for years to come. Both the teams are primed to unleash their finest talents in pursuit of glory. The electrifying atmosphere surround­ing this match extends far beyond the boundaries of the cricket field, as it car­ries the weight of history, pride, and the insatiable thirst for victory that charac­terizes this fierce rivalry. In last year’s T20 World Cup, the relentless Shaheen Afridi repeatedly troubled the Indian batting order. The anticipated rematch between these two forces promises to be a tantalizing con­test, adding an extra layer of intrigue to an already monumental clash. For Pakistan, the spotlight is on their captain, Babar Azam, who is in scintillat­ing form, following his sensational 151 against Nepal in the tournament opener. However, concerns loom over Fakhar Za­man’s lean run of form since his remark­able three successive centuries, including an unbeaten 180 against New Zealand. Yet, both Pakistan and India are acutely aware of Fakhar’s destructive capabilities. Fur­thermore, Pakistan boast a formidable bat­ting lineup, a strength that India may envy. The was set to mark the re­turn of Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, with Iyer declared fit. However, Rahul is still striving for full fitness, paving the way for Ishan Kishan to make his mark. Kis­han’s recent string of three consecutive half-centuries in the West Indies is im­pressive, but with Rohit Sharma’s return, Kishan may need to adapt to a new role. India’s key player, Jasprit Bumrah, made a triumphant comeback during the Ire­land T20Is, expressing readiness to bowl ten overs, a positive sign for the team. As the match unfolds on a fresh pitch, reminiscent of the one in the Sri Lanka- Bangladesh encounter with assistance for both seamers and spinners, batsmen will face a daunting challenge. Addition­ally, the forecast of rain from early morn­ing till mid-afternoon could potentially delay the start, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to this high-stakes clash. In their storied history in the , Pakistan and India have squared off 13 times. Pakistan have secured vic­tory in 5 of those encounters, while India haveemerged victorious in 7 matches, with one ending in a no-result. Both teams have expressed their de­termination and respect for their oppo­nents. Shaheen Shah, speaking on behalf of Pakistan, said, “Pakistan will win the , we have prepared very well. We always do our best to make the country proud and happy.” Meanwhile, India’s Rohit Sharma acknowledged Pakistan’s prowess, saying, “No team becomes No. 1 just like that. Pakistan has worked hard a lot to get there; they look like a unit. It will be a good challenge to play against them.” PAKISTAN SQUAD: Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam (c), Moham­mad Rizwan (wk), Salman Agha, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan (vc), Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah.

Pakistan will enter the field against India with the same squad as the one that played against Nepal in the first Asia Cup match on Wednesday in Multan resulting in a thumping victory for the home side. The national squad reached Kandy on Thursday after the first clash. Addressing a press conference there, Pakistan skipper Babar Azam on Friday said that the Men in Green have a home advantage against India in Sri Lanka as they have recently played a lot of cricket in the country. It may be noted that Pakistan have enough familiarity with the conditions in Sri Lanka as almost all the cricket they have played in the last more than two months has been in the island country. They played a Test series against the host team in Sri Lanka, then they played an ODI series against Afghanistan, while some players also participated in the Lanka Premier League (LPL) there. “There is no pressure on us; instead, we have the [winning] momentum and we will try to maintain this momentum,” Babar said. He said that all the players in the squad are pumped up as everyone knows that the Pakistan-India match is a great match. “Everyone in the world waits for this match and we are hopeful that it will be a good match,” he added. The skipper further stated that they will try to keep the best playing XI and perform well in the matches of continental cricketing event. Babar also said that sometimes the performances vary but the team has been doing well for a while. “We were in a bit of trouble regarding the middle order but the middle order has a good response now,” he said.

Given India and Pakistan’s cricketing prowess, experts are speculating that the cricket gold medal at the Asian Games could likely be decided between these two cricket giants. Moreover, according to Gwadar Pro, shortly after the Asian Games concludes, the International Olympic Committee will convene a meeting in Mumbai to determine whether cricket, after a 128-year absence, will make a comeback to the “Olympic family.” The cricket matches of this edition of the Asian Games are also being seen by insiders as the ultimate litmus test for cricket’s potential re-entry into the Olympics. In ensuring the smooth execution of these events, the host city Hangzhou in China is in its final stages of preparation. Officials from Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus cricket venue, where the Asian Games cricket matches are set to unfold, emphasized the critical role of pitch quality. “The key to successful cricket matches lies in the quality of the playing surface. Thus, professional upkeep such as grass trimming and compaction needs to be carried out a month prior to the event. Currently, the Asian Games Organizing Committee has collaborated with the Asian Cricket Council and brought in experts from Bangladesh to oversee the final maintenance,” they shared during a media interview. The group stage and final matches of the cricket event at the Hangzhou Asian Games are scheduled at Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus. This cricket field stands as China’s largest, with a construction area of approximately 49,400 square meters and a total built-up area of around 12,689 square meters. It boasts an elliptical playing field measuring 150 meters along its longer axis and 120 meters along its shorter axis, accompanied by seating for 1,347 spectators and an all-encompassing pavilion. The indoor pavilion’s brick-red exterior façade complements the surrounding landscape, resembling a picturesque vista naturally unfurling from the northern mountains. The outdoor playing field takes on a boxy circular shape, housing four competition pitches and boasting a playing area roughly equivalent to that of two football fields. “In meeting the exacting demands of cricket pitches for clay, we embarked on a 13-month-long quest across a vast expanse of 9.6 million square kilometers of land to locate suitable soil sources. After subjecting 27 soil samples to 162 rounds of rigorous testing, we finally pinpointed the most suitable soil source in Liulie Village, Yancheng, Jiangsu,” officials from Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus cricket venue shared during an interview. Prior to this, Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus cricket arena hosted Asian Games test matches, earning high praise from both the Chinese national team and international participants like Hong Kong and Japan for the quality of the playing field.

After winning the toss and opting to bat, Bairstow finished with an unbeaten 86 off 60 balls and Brook impressed with 67 from 36 as England finished on 198 runs for four. Atkinson made an immediate impression by taking the wickets of Devon Conway, Tim Seifert, Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson. Already named in England's preliminary squad for the World Cup in India, which begins in October, Atkinson was given his chance to prove his worth and wasted no time taking it. England started slowly but once Bairstow and Brook got going there was no stopping them as they combined for 131 runs. \"In recent times I've tried to play the ball on merit as much as possible. If I feel I can take an option on, I'll take it,\" Brook said. \"I try and move around in the crease as much as possible, I'm just trying to hit the ball where it's meant to be hit.\" To the disappointment of the Old Trafford crowd, Brook was finally taken out in the 17th over. After hitting five fours and five sixes he attempted another big shot but did not quite get hold of it and Finn Allen had a simple catch. New Zealand made a faster start than England had but wickets continued to fall at a steady pace. Adil Rashid claimed two to reach 97 T20I wickets, taking over from Chris Jordan as England's leading T20 wicket-taker. It was debutant Atkinson, however, who stole the show. He finished off proceedings in style, taking three wickets in the 13th over to finish off New Zealand. \"They just told me to do what I've been doing and that's what I tried to do and it went great,\" Atkinson said. \"I try to keep as cool as possible and whatever happens, happens, thankfully it went well.\" The third T20 of the series will be at Edgbaston on Sunday.

Debutant Gus Atkinson then took a superb four for 20 as the Kiwis slumped to 103 all out in a dismal reply. Two games. Two wins! Well played, lads 👊 | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) The victory gave England a 2-0 lead in the four-match series coming after a similarly comfortable win in the opening game at Durham on Wednesday. The platform was laid by Bairstow and Brook as the pair put on 131 for the third wicket in a blistering 65 balls. Bairstow batted throughout the innings, hitting eight fours and four sixes from 60 deliveries while Brook, making another point following his World Cup omission, smashed five maximums in his 36-ball 67. New Zealand captain Tim Southee bore the brunt of their big-hitting, conceding 23 in one over on his way to figures of one for 48. Bairstow actually had a nervy start as he played and missed, survived a leg before appeal and scampered a tight single in a good first over from the lively Adam Milne. Yet he was soon into his stride, driving Tim Southee over the top in the next and following up with further boundaries off Milne and Mitchell Santner. Will Jacks also attacked and hit two fours and a six in one Lockie Ferguson over but he fell for 19 when he miscued a pull off Southee to midwicket. Dawid Malan quickly followed for a duck as he was bowled by Santner. That brought Bairstow and Brook together and the Yorkshire duo went on the offensive. Bairstow slog-swept Santner for six and Brook smashed two straight maximums off Ish Sodhi. Bairstow then brought up his half-century in 40 balls with successive fours off Santner before the acceleration really began with 23 from one Southee over. The boundaries kept coming and Brook reached a 31-ball 50 in another expensive Southee over in which he hit two sixes and a four. The entertaining partnership eventually ended when Brook, after slog-sweeping Sodhi for another four, holed out to Finn Allen at long on. Moeen Ali despatched his first ball off Sodhi over the legside boundary but then found Milne in the deep attempting the same shot. Bairstow saw little of the strike in the closing overs as Milne, particularly, brought some discipline back to the attack but Jos Buttler took the hosts close to 200 with 13 from eight balls. New Zealand’s reply got off to a bad start as Devon Conway chipped to Liam Livingstone at deep square leg to hand Atkinson his first international wicket in the second over.

Glenn Phillips began a recovery but Adil Rashid had him caught on the boundary by Brook for 22 and Mark Chapman, after launching Liam Livingstone for a straight six, then picked out the same fielder. Daryl Mitchell was caught behind off Brydon Carse, Santner clean bowled by Jacks and Milne reversed swept Rashid into the hands of Ali at slip. Tim Seifert offered the greatest resistance but he fell for 39 when he sliced Atkinson high into the air and Buttler claimed a steepling catch.

Opener Matthew Short (66 from 30 balls) and captain Mitchell Marsh (79* from 39 balls) combined for a century stand as Australia chased the under-par 165-run target with 31 balls to spare. Marsh, who also top-scored for Australia during Wednesday’s series opener , cleared the boundary rope six times in another brutal batting performance. The West Australian has now scored 137 in the series without being dismissed. “It’s quite hard to keep your nerve when you’ve got two big boys trying to smoke you out of the ground the whole time,” Proteas captain Aiden Markram confessed in the post-match presentation. “We certainly got challenged tonight, but there are lessons we can take forward.” MATCH CENTRE: South Africa vs Australia second T20 scorecard Earlier, Australian quicks Sean Abbott and Nathan Ellis each snared three wickets, helping restrict South Africa to 8-164 from their 20 overs. Australia made two changes to its starting XI, with Adam Zampa and Jason Behrendorff replacing Tanveer Sangha and Spencer Johnson. Proteas opener Temba Bavuma got off to a blistering start after Marsh won the toss and elected to field first, cracking seven boundaries in the opening three overs, including a hook shot against Jason Behrendorff that flew over fine leg for six. Abbott only needed one delivery to end Bavuma’s onslaught, with the right-hander departing for 35 (17) after Australian wicketkeeper Josh Inglis settled underneath a leading edge.

Ellis was introduced to the attack in the sixth over and ended the Powerplay with a double-wicket maiden. After removing South African opener Reeza Hendricks LBW for 3 (9), the Tasmanian seamer knocked over the dangerous Dewald Brevis the following delivery, edging behind for a golden duck. The hat-trick delivery narrowly evaded Tristan Stubbs’ outside edge. South Africa had lost 4-10 in a chaotic 16-ball passage of play, leaving the hosts in a spot of bother at 4-46 after six overs. However, Stubbs and Markram steadied the ship with a 51-run partnership for the fifth wicket. Stubbs nailed a lap shot against West Australian all-rounder Aaron Hardie that flew over the wicketkeeper’s head for six before botching a reverse scoop against Behrendorff, bowled by a slower ball for 27 (20). Bjorn Fortuin became Abbott’s second victim in the 14th over after top-edging a cut stoke towards Hardie at point, exposing South Africa’s tail. The dismissal forced Markram to counter-attack, smacking a handful of elegant boundaries to ensure the Proteas registered a defendable total. Ellis snared his third dismissal with a back-of-the-hand slower ball that Gerald Coetzee spooned towards Marsh at cover, gone for 11 (11). Markham fell agonisingly short of a half-century, slapping a low full toss from Abbott towards the point boundary rider for 49 (38) in the penultimate over. Lungi Ngidi provided some valuable late runs, while Abbott finished with career-best figures of 3-22, later named player of the match. Sean Abbott of Australia.

Australian opener Travis Head wasn’t as lucky, charging at Proteas seamer Lizaad Williams and chipping a regulation catch towards mid-on for 18 (17). Short blasted 20 runs from the final over of the Powerplay, delivered by Lungi Ngidi, before combining with Marsh for a 100-run partnership for the second wicket. Bavuma put down a tough chance at deep mid-wicket in the tenth over, gifting the Australian skipper an extra life on 32. The Victorian reached his maiden international fifty in just 25 deliveries, scoring five consecutive boundaries during a wayward over from Coetzee. He brought up a century partnership with Marsh in the 12th over, but returned to the sheds the next delivery, with Proteas spinner Tabraiz Shamsi unearthing the much-needed breakthrough. Marsh continued on his merry way, reaching his half-century in 28 deliveries before slapping back-to-back sixes against Shamsi over square leg. The Australians cruised towards the target in the 15th over, with Inglis finishing unbeaten on 2. “In my time playing in South Africa, a series win is very hard to come by,” Marsh said at the post-match presentation. “I’m rapt for our young guys who have come in and played the way they have, and I thought tonight the game was set up by our bowlers, for sure.” The third T20 between South Africa and Australia gets underway at the same venue on Sunday, with the first ball scheduled for 10pm AEST.

He put on 100 in 45 balls for the second wicket with impressive opener Matthew Short, who was both elegant and brutal in equal measure for his 66 from 30 balls. It was a maiden international half century for Short after he debuted in the first game of the series. \"It's great, I’m proud of the boys because a series win in South Africa is hard to come by,\" Marsh said at the post-match presentation. \"Tonight the game was set up by the bowlers, they were all fantastic.\" Home skipper Aiden Markram was the top scorer in South Africa’s innings with 49 from 38 balls after opener Temba Bavuma was fast out of the blocks with 35 off 17. But Australia picked up wickets at regular intervals with some clever changes of pace and swing on a helpful wicket. Seamers Shaun Abbott (3-22) and Nathan Ellis (3-25) were the pick of their bowlers, with Jason Behrendorff chipping in with a handy 2-25. \"Temba got us off to a great start but the loss of (regular) wickets made it challenging,\" Markram said. \"We wanted to take it deep. When they came on to bat it can be hard when there are two batters trying to muscle it out of the ground.\" The final match in the series is at the same venue on Sunday before the teams switch formats for a five-game One-Day International series ahead of the World Cup that starts in India next month.

The clash of titans is poised to be a historic showdown that will be etched in cricket­ing annals for years to come. Both the teams are primed to unleash their finest talents in pursuit of glory. The electrifying atmosphere surround­ing this match extends far beyond the boundaries of the cricket field, as it car­ries the weight of history, pride, and the insatiable thirst for victory that charac­terizes this fierce rivalry. In last year’s T20 World Cup, the relentless Shaheen Afridi repeatedly troubled the Indian batting order. The anticipated rematch between these two forces promises to be a tantalizing con­test, adding an extra layer of intrigue to an already monumental clash. For Pakistan, the spotlight is on their captain, Babar Azam, who is in scintillat­ing form, following his sensational 151 against Nepal in the tournament opener. However, concerns loom over Fakhar Za­man’s lean run of form since his remark­able three successive centuries, including an unbeaten 180 against New Zealand. Yet, both Pakistan and India are acutely aware of Fakhar’s destructive capabilities. Fur­thermore, Pakistan boast a formidable bat­ting lineup, a strength that India may envy. The was set to mark the re­turn of Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, with Iyer declared fit. However, Rahul is still striving for full fitness, paving the way for Ishan Kishan to make his mark. Kis­han’s recent string of three consecutive half-centuries in the West Indies is im­pressive, but with Rohit Sharma’s return, Kishan may need to adapt to a new role. India’s key player, Jasprit Bumrah, made a triumphant comeback during the Ire­land T20Is, expressing readiness to bowl ten overs, a positive sign for the team. As the match unfolds on a fresh pitch, reminiscent of the one in the Sri Lanka- Bangladesh encounter with assistance for both seamers and spinners, batsmen will face a daunting challenge. Addition­ally, the forecast of rain from early morn­ing till mid-afternoon could potentially delay the start, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to this high-stakes clash. In their storied history in the , Pakistan and India have squared off 13 times. Pakistan have secured vic­tory in 5 of those encounters, while India haveemerged victorious in 7 matches, with one ending in a no-result. Both teams have expressed their de­termination and respect for their oppo­nents. Shaheen Shah, speaking on behalf of Pakistan, said, “Pakistan will win the , we have prepared very well. We always do our best to make the country proud and happy.” Meanwhile, India’s Rohit Sharma acknowledged Pakistan’s prowess, saying, “No team becomes No. 1 just like that. Pakistan has worked hard a lot to get there; they look like a unit. It will be a good challenge to play against them.” PAKISTAN SQUAD: Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam (c), Moham­mad Rizwan (wk), Salman Agha, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan (vc), Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah.

Pakistan will enter the field against India with the same squad as the one that played against Nepal in the first Asia Cup match on Wednesday in Multan resulting in a thumping victory for the home side. The national squad reached Kandy on Thursday after the first clash. Addressing a press conference there, Pakistan skipper Babar Azam on Friday said that the Men in Green have a home advantage against India in Sri Lanka as they have recently played a lot of cricket in the country. It may be noted that Pakistan have enough familiarity with the conditions in Sri Lanka as almost all the cricket they have played in the last more than two months has been in the island country. They played a Test series against the host team in Sri Lanka, then they played an ODI series against Afghanistan, while some players also participated in the Lanka Premier League (LPL) there. “There is no pressure on us; instead, we have the [winning] momentum and we will try to maintain this momentum,” Babar said. He said that all the players in the squad are pumped up as everyone knows that the Pakistan-India match is a great match. “Everyone in the world waits for this match and we are hopeful that it will be a good match,” he added. The skipper further stated that they will try to keep the best playing XI and perform well in the matches of continental cricketing event. Babar also said that sometimes the performances vary but the team has been doing well for a while. “We were in a bit of trouble regarding the middle order but the middle order has a good response now,” he said.

Sha­heen was able to take early wickets,” Hayden told Star Sports. “We’ll never forget that ball that he bowled to Rohit Sharma, so a little bit of caution against Shaheen Afri­di. If it’s swinging, look to play out those first three overs,” he added. The former Australian opener also lauded Pakistan’s other pacers in the shape of Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf. “India is playing against Paki­stan’s pace trio. This is one of the spiciest competitions on the planet. We’ve got Sha­heen Afridi, Haris Rauf, and Naseem [Shah]. Three very different types of bowlers and unique bowlers, which require unique plans from Team India,” he said.","pubDate":"2023-09-01 19:49:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"nation_pk","source_priority":353644,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"ff7571fa418ff5f4270f52b5393a58bd","title":"Pakistani men’s and women’s cricket teams set to compete in Hangzhou Asian Games","link":"https://dailymailnews.pk/pakistani-mens-and-womens-cricket-teams-set-to-compete-in-hangzhou-china-asian-games/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["DM NEWS"],"video_url":null,"description":"ISLAMABAD: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have recently revealed the player rosters for their men’s and women’s cricket teams, set to compete in the Hangzhou Asian Games.

Given India and Pakistan’s cricketing prowess, experts are speculating that the cricket gold medal at the Asian Games could likely be decided between these two cricket giants. Moreover, according to Gwadar Pro, shortly after the Asian Games concludes, the International Olympic Committee will convene a meeting in Mumbai to determine whether cricket, after a 128-year absence, will make a comeback to the “Olympic family.” The cricket matches of this edition of the Asian Games are also being seen by insiders as the ultimate litmus test for cricket’s potential re-entry into the Olympics. In ensuring the smooth execution of these events, the host city Hangzhou in China is in its final stages of preparation. Officials from Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus cricket venue, where the Asian Games cricket matches are set to unfold, emphasized the critical role of pitch quality. “The key to successful cricket matches lies in the quality of the playing surface. Thus, professional upkeep such as grass trimming and compaction needs to be carried out a month prior to the event. Currently, the Asian Games Organizing Committee has collaborated with the Asian Cricket Council and brought in experts from Bangladesh to oversee the final maintenance,” they shared during a media interview. The group stage and final matches of the cricket event at the Hangzhou Asian Games are scheduled at Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus. This cricket field stands as China’s largest, with a construction area of approximately 49,400 square meters and a total built-up area of around 12,689 square meters. It boasts an elliptical playing field measuring 150 meters along its longer axis and 120 meters along its shorter axis, accompanied by seating for 1,347 spectators and an all-encompassing pavilion. The indoor pavilion’s brick-red exterior façade complements the surrounding landscape, resembling a picturesque vista naturally unfurling from the northern mountains. The outdoor playing field takes on a boxy circular shape, housing four competition pitches and boasting a playing area roughly equivalent to that of two football fields. “In meeting the exacting demands of cricket pitches for clay, we embarked on a 13-month-long quest across a vast expanse of 9.6 million square kilometers of land to locate suitable soil sources. After subjecting 27 soil samples to 162 rounds of rigorous testing, we finally pinpointed the most suitable soil source in Liulie Village, Yancheng, Jiangsu,” officials from Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus cricket venue shared during an interview. Prior to this, Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus cricket arena hosted Asian Games test matches, earning high praise from both the Chinese national team and international participants like Hong Kong and Japan for the quality of the playing field. The spokesperson is confident that following the final month of preparations, the cricket arena will spring forth with delightful surprises for all participating teams. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that all-rounder Qasim Akram has been selected to lead the Pakistan Shaheens at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. The T20 format event is scheduled to take place from September 28th to October 7th. –INP","pubDate":"2023-09-01 19:20:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailymailnews","source_priority":24862659,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"94eb9cf94a6b9f28f8e6704d50ae64a0","title":"Asia Cup 2023: भारत-पाकिस्तान मुकाबले से पहले मैथ्यू हेडेन ने दी रोहित शर्मा को यह बहुमूल्य सलाह","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/hindi/cricket/asia-cup-2023-its-that-precious-advice-matthew-hayden-gives-to-rohit-sharma-before-the-match-against-pakistan-4348990#publisher=newsstand","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan vs India, 3rd Match: पाकिस्तान के खिलाफ शनिवार को मेगा मुकाबले का समूचा विश्व बेसब्री से इंतजार कर रहा है","content":"ऑस्ट्रेलिया के पूर्व दिग्गज मैथ्यू हेडेन ने Asia Cup 2023 में शनिवार को पाकिस्तान के खिलाफ मेगा मुकाबले से पहले टीम इंडिया को बहुत ही अहम सलाह दी है. यह सलाह बताने के लिए काफी है कि साल 2021 T20 World Cup का वाकया करोड़ों भारतीय प्रशंसकों के ही नहीं, बल्कि देशी-विदेशी दिग्गजों के मनोपटल पर अभी भी अंकित है. पाकिस्तान के साथ मुकाबले से पहले फैंस के बीच ज्यादा जर्चा हो रही है. फैंस को अभी भी याद है कि पाकिस्तानी लेफ्टी पेसर शाहीन आफरीदी के प्रहार ने कैसे पारी की शुरुआत में ही भारत को ऐसे पटरी से उतारा कि फिर बात बन ही नहीं सकी. यही वजह है कि अब हेडेन ने भारतीय कप्तान रोहित शर्मा को सलाह देते हुए कहा है कि यूएई 2021 टी20 विश्व कप जैसे हालात से बचने के लिए पाकिस्तान के तेज गेंदबाज शाहीन शाह अफरीदी के पहले तीन ओवरों में सावधानी बरतें. तब भारत को इस ग्रुप मैच में 10 विकेट से शर्मनाक हार का सामना करना पड़ा और टीम इस टूर्नामेंट में हार के सदमे से उबरने में नाकाम रही. हेडेन का मानना है कि पाकिस्तान के इस लंबे कद के तेज गेंदबाज से निपटने का यही सही तरीका है. हेडेन ने स्टार स्पोर्ट्स से कहा, ‘आपको शाहीन आफरीदी के खिलाफ शुरू में सतर्कता बरतनी होगी. हाल ही में (टी20) विश्व कप (2021 में यूएई में) को याद करिए. शाहीन शुरुआती ओवरों में विकेट लेने में सक्षम थे.' पूर्व लेफ्टी दिग्गज बोले, ‘हम उस गेंद को कभी नहीं भूलेंगे जो उन्होंने रोहित शर्मा को फेंकी थी, इसलिए उसके खिलाफ थोड़ी सावधानी बरतें. अगर यह स्विंग हो रही है, तो पहले तीन ओवर खेलने पर ध्यान दें.' कोहली ने मैच में 49 गेंद में 57 रन बनाकर भारतीय पारी को संवारा था. टीम को हालांकि इस मुकाबले में 10 विकेट से हार का सामना करना पड़ा था. हेडेन से कहा कि अफरीदी के साथ ही भारतीय बल्लेबाजों को नसीम शाह और हैरिस रऊफ के खिलाफ भी योजना बना कर बल्लेबाजी करनी होगी. हेडेन ने दोनों चिर-प्रतिद्वंद्वी के बीच मुकाबले को विश्व क्रिकेट में सबसे रोमांचक मुकाबला करार देते हुए कहा, ‘भारत पाकिस्तान के तेज गेंदबाजों की तिकड़ी के खिलाफ खेलगा. यह क्रिकेट में सबसे रोमांचक मुकाबलों में से एक हैय पाकिस्तान के पास शाहीन अफरीदी, हैरिस रऊफ और नसीम शाह जैसे काबिल गेंदबाज हैं. तीन बहुत अलग प्रकार के गेंदबाज और उनसे निपटने के लिए भारतीय टीम को योजना के साथ आना होगा.' उन्होंने कहा, ‘कैंडी में परिस्थितियां तेज गेंदबाजों के लिए मददगार होगी. आपको पिच की उछाल पर नजर रखना होगा. इस मामले में हारिस के खिलाफ सतर्क रहना होगा। वह गेंद को तेज टप्पा खिलाकर ऑफ स्टंप के पास गेंदबाजी करता है.' पढ़ें ,राजनीति,खेल समाचार, और की ताजा समाचार अब हिंदी में ( ) लाइव खबर देखें: फॉलो करे:","pubDate":"2023-09-01 18:43:42","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-08/hnmr1ff_rohit-sharma_160x120_21_August_23.jpg","source_id":"ndtv_in","source_priority":129751,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"article_id":"a5a7b72c020a694104904d0747b611ea","title":"Asia Cup 2023: India to face arch-rival Pakistan in Pallekele; all eyes on Virat Kohli, Babar Azam","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/asia-cup-2023-india-to-face-arch-rival-pakistan-in-pallekele-all-eyes-on-virat-kohli-babar-azam/videoshow/103293932.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Team India and Pakistan don't get to play each other very frequently, but when they do, the term \"high-octane clash\" hardly scratches the surface and every match is greatly anticipated.

After winning the toss and opting to bat, Bairstow finished with an unbeaten 86 off 60 balls and Brook impressed with 67 from 36 as England finished on 198 runs for four. Atkinson made an immediate impression by taking the wickets of Devon Conway, Tim Seifert, Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson. Already named in England's preliminary squad for the World Cup in India, which begins in October, Atkinson was given his chance to prove his worth and wasted no time taking it. England started slowly but once Bairstow and Brook got going there was no stopping them as they combined for 131 runs. \"In recent times I've tried to play the ball on merit as much as possible. If I feel I can take an option on, I'll take it,\" Brook said. \"I try and move around in the crease as much as possible, I'm just trying to hit the ball where it's meant to be hit.\" To the disappointment of the Old Trafford crowd, Brook was finally taken out in the 17th over. After hitting five fours and five sixes he attempted another big shot but did not quite get hold of it and Finn Allen had a simple catch. New Zealand made a faster start than England had but wickets continued to fall at a steady pace. Adil Rashid claimed two to reach 97 T20I wickets, taking over from Chris Jordan as England's leading T20 wicket-taker. It was debutant Atkinson, however, who stole the show. He finished off proceedings in style, taking three wickets in the 13th over to finish off New Zealand. \"They just told me to do what I've been doing and that's what I tried to do and it went great,\" Atkinson said. \"I try to keep as cool as possible and whatever happens, happens, thankfully it went well.\" The third T20 of the series will be at Edgbaston on Sunday.

Well played, lads 👊 | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) The victory gave England a 2-0 lead in the four-match series coming after a similarly comfortable win in the opening game at Durham on Wednesday. The platform was laid by Bairstow and Brook as the pair put on 131 for the third wicket in a blistering 65 balls. Bairstow batted throughout the innings, hitting eight fours and four sixes from 60 deliveries while Brook, making another point following his World Cup omission, smashed five maximums in his 36-ball 67. New Zealand captain Tim Southee bore the brunt of their big-hitting, conceding 23 in one over on his way to figures of one for 48. Bairstow actually had a nervy start as he played and missed, survived a leg before appeal and scampered a tight single in a good first over from the lively Adam Milne. Yet he was soon into his stride, driving Tim Southee over the top in the next and following up with further boundaries off Milne and Mitchell Santner. Will Jacks also attacked and hit two fours and a six in one Lockie Ferguson over but he fell for 19 when he miscued a pull off Southee to midwicket. Dawid Malan quickly followed for a duck as he was bowled by Santner. That brought Bairstow and Brook together and the Yorkshire duo went on the offensive. Bairstow slog-swept Santner for six and Brook smashed two straight maximums off Ish Sodhi. Bairstow then brought up his half-century in 40 balls with successive fours off Santner before the acceleration really began with 23 from one Southee over. The boundaries kept coming and Brook reached a 31-ball 50 in another expensive Southee over in which he hit two sixes and a four. The entertaining partnership eventually ended when Brook, after slog-sweeping Sodhi for another four, holed out to Finn Allen at long on. Moeen Ali despatched his first ball off Sodhi over the legside boundary but then found Milne in the deep attempting the same shot. Bairstow saw little of the strike in the closing overs as Milne, particularly, brought some discipline back to the attack but Jos Buttler took the hosts close to 200 with 13 from eight balls. New Zealand’s reply got off to a bad start as Devon Conway chipped to Liam Livingstone at deep square leg to hand Atkinson his first international wicket in the second over.

Glenn Phillips began a recovery but Adil Rashid had him caught on the boundary by Brook for 22 and Mark Chapman, after launching Liam Livingstone for a straight six, then picked out the same fielder. Daryl Mitchell was caught behind off Brydon Carse, Santner clean bowled by Jacks and Milne reversed swept Rashid into the hands of Ali at slip. Tim Seifert offered the greatest resistance but he fell for 39 when he sliced Atkinson high into the air and Buttler claimed a steepling catch. Southee and Ferguson then fell in the same Atkinson over as the Surrey seamer wrapped the game in style.","pubDate":"2023-09-01 20:30:56","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17182304/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8f1bb2705739212b39343a06bb1c8c69","title":"Mitchell Marsh and Matt Short crack fifties as Australia cruise towards series victory over South Africa","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/mitchell-marsh-and-matt-short-crack-fifties-as-australia-cruise-towards-series-victory-over-south-africa/news-story/2c1352da0a6fa2bc6eb2070e5310cfb6","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia has cruised towards an unassailable 2-0 lead in their T20 series against South Africa after thumping the Proteas by eight wickets in Durban on Friday evening.","content":"Australia has cruised towards an unassailable 2-0 lead in their T20 series against South Africa after thumping the Proteas by eight wickets in Durban on Friday evening. Opener Matthew Short (66 from 30 balls) and captain Mitchell Marsh (79* from 39 balls) combined for a century stand as Australia chased the under-par 165-run target with 31 balls to spare. Marsh, who also top-scored for Australia during Wednesday’s series opener , cleared the boundary rope six times in another brutal batting performance. The West Australian has now scored 137 in the series without being dismissed. “It’s quite hard to keep your nerve when you’ve got two big boys trying to smoke you out of the ground the whole time,” Proteas captain Aiden Markram confessed in the post-match presentation. “We certainly got challenged tonight, but there are lessons we can take forward.” MATCH CENTRE: South Africa vs Australia second T20 scorecard Earlier, Australian quicks Sean Abbott and Nathan Ellis each snared three wickets, helping restrict South Africa to 8-164 from their 20 overs. Australia made two changes to its starting XI, with Adam Zampa and Jason Behrendorff replacing Tanveer Sangha and Spencer Johnson. Proteas opener Temba Bavuma got off to a blistering start after Marsh won the toss and elected to field first, cracking seven boundaries in the opening three overs, including a hook shot against Jason Behrendorff that flew over fine leg for six. Abbott only needed one delivery to end Bavuma’s onslaught, with the right-hander departing for 35 (17) after Australian wicketkeeper Josh Inglis settled underneath a leading edge.

Ellis was introduced to the attack in the sixth over and ended the Powerplay with a double-wicket maiden. After removing South African opener Reeza Hendricks LBW for 3 (9), the Tasmanian seamer knocked over the dangerous Dewald Brevis the following delivery, edging behind for a golden duck. The hat-trick delivery narrowly evaded Tristan Stubbs’ outside edge. South Africa had lost 4-10 in a chaotic 16-ball passage of play, leaving the hosts in a spot of bother at 4-46 after six overs. However, Stubbs and Markram steadied the ship with a 51-run partnership for the fifth wicket. Stubbs nailed a lap shot against West Australian all-rounder Aaron Hardie that flew over the wicketkeeper’s head for six before botching a reverse scoop against Behrendorff, bowled by a slower ball for 27 (20). Bjorn Fortuin became Abbott’s second victim in the 14th over after top-edging a cut stoke towards Hardie at point, exposing South Africa’s tail. The dismissal forced Markram to counter-attack, smacking a handful of elegant boundaries to ensure the Proteas registered a defendable total. Ellis snared his third dismissal with a back-of-the-hand slower ball that Gerald Coetzee spooned towards Marsh at cover, gone for 11 (11). Markham fell agonisingly short of a half-century, slapping a low full toss from Abbott towards the point boundary rider for 49 (38) in the penultimate over. Lungi Ngidi provided some valuable late runs, while Abbott finished with career-best figures of 3-22, later named player of the match. Sean Abbott of Australia.

Australian opener Travis Head wasn’t as lucky, charging at Proteas seamer Lizaad Williams and chipping a regulation catch towards mid-on for 18 (17). Short blasted 20 runs from the final over of the Powerplay, delivered by Lungi Ngidi, before combining with Marsh for a 100-run partnership for the second wicket. Bavuma put down a tough chance at deep mid-wicket in the tenth over, gifting the Australian skipper an extra life on 32. The Victorian reached his maiden international fifty in just 25 deliveries, scoring five consecutive boundaries during a wayward over from Coetzee. He brought up a century partnership with Marsh in the 12th over, but returned to the sheds the next delivery, with Proteas spinner Tabraiz Shamsi unearthing the much-needed breakthrough. Marsh continued on his merry way, reaching his half-century in 28 deliveries before slapping back-to-back sixes against Shamsi over square leg. The Australians cruised towards the target in the 15th over, with Inglis finishing unbeaten on 2. “In my time playing in South Africa, a series win is very hard to come by,” Marsh said at the post-match presentation. “I’m rapt for our young guys who have come in and played the way they have, and I thought tonight the game was set up by our bowlers, for sure.” The third T20 between South Africa and Australia gets underway at the same venue on Sunday, with the first ball scheduled for 10pm AEST.

The home side were sent in to bat in Durban and posted 164 for eight in their 20 overs, a total that never looked enough with the small boundaries at Kingsmead. Australia had little trouble knocking off their target in 14.5 overs as Marsh followed up his unbeaten 92 in the 111-run victory in the first match on Wednesday with 79 not out from 39 deliveries, including eight fours and six sixes. He put on 100 in 45 balls for the second wicket with impressive opener Matthew Short, who was both elegant and brutal in equal measure for his 66 from 30 balls. It was a maiden international half century for Short after he debuted in the first game of the series. \"It's great, I’m proud of the boys because a series win in South Africa is hard to come by,\" Marsh said at the post-match presentation. \"Tonight the game was set up by the bowlers, they were all fantastic.\" Home skipper Aiden Markram was the top scorer in South Africa’s innings with 49 from 38 balls after opener Temba Bavuma was fast out of the blocks with 35 off 17. But Australia picked up wickets at regular intervals with some clever changes of pace and swing on a helpful wicket. Seamers Shaun Abbott (3-22) and Nathan Ellis (3-25) were the pick of their bowlers, with Jason Behrendorff chipping in with a handy 2-25. \"Temba got us off to a great start but the loss of (regular) wickets made it challenging,\" Markram said. \"We wanted to take it deep. When they came on to bat it can be hard when there are two batters trying to muscle it out of the ground.\" The final match in the series is at the same venue on Sunday before the teams switch formats for a five-game One-Day International series ahead of the World Cup that starts in India next month.

The clash of titans is poised to be a historic showdown that will be etched in cricket­ing annals for years to come. Both the teams are primed to unleash their finest talents in pursuit of glory. The electrifying atmosphere surround­ing this match extends far beyond the boundaries of the cricket field, as it car­ries the weight of history, pride, and the insatiable thirst for victory that charac­terizes this fierce rivalry. In last year’s T20 World Cup, the relentless Shaheen Afridi repeatedly troubled the Indian batting order. The anticipated rematch between these two forces promises to be a tantalizing con­test, adding an extra layer of intrigue to an already monumental clash. For Pakistan, the spotlight is on their captain, Babar Azam, who is in scintillat­ing form, following his sensational 151 against Nepal in the tournament opener. However, concerns loom over Fakhar Za­man’s lean run of form since his remark­able three successive centuries, including an unbeaten 180 against New Zealand. Yet, both Pakistan and India are acutely aware of Fakhar’s destructive capabilities. Fur­thermore, Pakistan boast a formidable bat­ting lineup, a strength that India may envy. The was set to mark the re­turn of Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, with Iyer declared fit. However, Rahul is still striving for full fitness, paving the way for Ishan Kishan to make his mark. Kis­han’s recent string of three consecutive half-centuries in the West Indies is im­pressive, but with Rohit Sharma’s return, Kishan may need to adapt to a new role. India’s key player, Jasprit Bumrah, made a triumphant comeback during the Ire­land T20Is, expressing readiness to bowl ten overs, a positive sign for the team. As the match unfolds on a fresh pitch, reminiscent of the one in the Sri Lanka- Bangladesh encounter with assistance for both seamers and spinners, batsmen will face a daunting challenge. Addition­ally, the forecast of rain from early morn­ing till mid-afternoon could potentially delay the start, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to this high-stakes clash. In their storied history in the , Pakistan and India have squared off 13 times. Pakistan have secured vic­tory in 5 of those encounters, while India haveemerged victorious in 7 matches, with one ending in a no-result. Both teams have expressed their de­termination and respect for their oppo­nents. Shaheen Shah, speaking on behalf of Pakistan, said, “Pakistan will win the , we have prepared very well. We always do our best to make the country proud and happy.” Meanwhile, India’s Rohit Sharma acknowledged Pakistan’s prowess, saying, “No team becomes No. 1 just like that.

Pakistan will enter the field against India with the same squad as the one that played against Nepal in the first Asia Cup match on Wednesday in Multan resulting in a thumping victory for the home side. The national squad reached Kandy on Thursday after the first clash. Addressing a press conference there, Pakistan skipper Babar Azam on Friday said that the Men in Green have a home advantage against India in Sri Lanka as they have recently played a lot of cricket in the country. It may be noted that Pakistan have enough familiarity with the conditions in Sri Lanka as almost all the cricket they have played in the last more than two months has been in the island country. They played a Test series against the host team in Sri Lanka, then they played an ODI series against Afghanistan, while some players also participated in the Lanka Premier League (LPL) there. “There is no pressure on us; instead, we have the [winning] momentum and we will try to maintain this momentum,” Babar said. He said that all the players in the squad are pumped up as everyone knows that the Pakistan-India match is a great match. “Everyone in the world waits for this match and we are hopeful that it will be a good match,” he added. The skipper further stated that they will try to keep the best playing XI and perform well in the matches of continental cricketing event. Babar also said that sometimes the performances vary but the team has been doing well for a while. “We were in a bit of trouble regarding the middle order but the middle order has a good response now,” he said. The world will be witnessing a guaranteed blockbuster clash between the arch-rivals Pakistan and India, with a huge number of spectators arriving in the host city Kandy to watch the match.

Hayden also mentioned In­dian skipper Rohit Sharma’s dismissal against Shaheen Afridi during the 2021 World Cup. “You’ve got to be con­servative against Shaheen Afridi. Remember back to the [T20] World Cup [in the UAE in 2021] more recently. Sha­heen was able to take early wickets,” Hayden told Star Sports. “We’ll never forget that ball that he bowled to Rohit Sharma, so a little bit of caution against Shaheen Afri­di. If it’s swinging, look to play out those first three overs,” he added. The former Australian opener also lauded Pakistan’s other pacers in the shape of Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf. “India is playing against Paki­stan’s pace trio. This is one of the spiciest competitions on the planet. We’ve got Sha­heen Afridi, Haris Rauf, and Naseem [Shah]. Three very different types of bowlers and unique bowlers, which require unique plans from Team India,” he said.","pubDate":"2023-09-01 19:49:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"nation_pk","source_priority":353644,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"ff7571fa418ff5f4270f52b5393a58bd","title":"Pakistani men’s and women’s cricket teams set to compete in Hangzhou Asian Games","link":"https://dailymailnews.pk/pakistani-mens-and-womens-cricket-teams-set-to-compete-in-hangzhou-china-asian-games/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["DM NEWS"],"video_url":null,"description":"ISLAMABAD: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have recently revealed the player rosters for their men’s and women’s cricket teams, set to compete in the Hangzhou Asian Games.

Given India and Pakistan’s cricketing prowess, experts are speculating that the cricket gold medal at the Asian Games could likely be decided between these two cricket giants. Moreover, according to Gwadar Pro, shortly after the Asian Games concludes, the International Olympic Committee will convene a meeting in Mumbai to determine whether cricket, after a 128-year absence, will make a comeback to the “Olympic family.” The cricket matches of this edition of the Asian Games are also being seen by insiders as the ultimate litmus test for cricket’s potential re-entry into the Olympics. In ensuring the smooth execution of these events, the host city Hangzhou in China is in its final stages of preparation. Officials from Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus cricket venue, where the Asian Games cricket matches are set to unfold, emphasized the critical role of pitch quality. “The key to successful cricket matches lies in the quality of the playing surface. Thus, professional upkeep such as grass trimming and compaction needs to be carried out a month prior to the event. Currently, the Asian Games Organizing Committee has collaborated with the Asian Cricket Council and brought in experts from Bangladesh to oversee the final maintenance,” they shared during a media interview. The group stage and final matches of the cricket event at the Hangzhou Asian Games are scheduled at Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus. This cricket field stands as China’s largest, with a construction area of approximately 49,400 square meters and a total built-up area of around 12,689 square meters. It boasts an elliptical playing field measuring 150 meters along its longer axis and 120 meters along its shorter axis, accompanied by seating for 1,347 spectators and an all-encompassing pavilion. The indoor pavilion’s brick-red exterior façade complements the surrounding landscape, resembling a picturesque vista naturally unfurling from the northern mountains. The outdoor playing field takes on a boxy circular shape, housing four competition pitches and boasting a playing area roughly equivalent to that of two football fields. “In meeting the exacting demands of cricket pitches for clay, we embarked on a 13-month-long quest across a vast expanse of 9.6 million square kilometers of land to locate suitable soil sources. After subjecting 27 soil samples to 162 rounds of rigorous testing, we finally pinpointed the most suitable soil source in Liulie Village, Yancheng, Jiangsu,” officials from Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus cricket venue shared during an interview. Prior to this, Zhejiang University of Technology’s Pingfeng campus cricket arena hosted Asian Games test matches, earning high praise from both the Chinese national team and international participants like Hong Kong and Japan for the quality of the playing field. The spokesperson is confident that following the final month of preparations, the cricket arena will spring forth with delightful surprises for all participating teams. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that all-rounder Qasim Akram has been selected to lead the Pakistan Shaheens at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. The T20 format event is scheduled to take place from September 28th to October 7th. –INP","pubDate":"2023-09-01 19:20:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailymailnews","source_priority":24862659,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"94eb9cf94a6b9f28f8e6704d50ae64a0","title":"Asia Cup 2023: भारत-पाकिस्तान मुकाबले से पहले मैथ्यू हेडेन ने दी रोहित शर्मा को यह बहुमूल्य सलाह","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/hindi/cricket/asia-cup-2023-its-that-precious-advice-matthew-hayden-gives-to-rohit-sharma-before-the-match-against-pakistan-4348990#publisher=newsstand","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan vs India, 3rd Match: पाकिस्तान के खिलाफ शनिवार को मेगा मुकाबले का समूचा विश्व बेसब्री से इंतजार कर रहा है","content":"ऑस्ट्रेलिया के पूर्व दिग्गज मैथ्यू हेडेन ने Asia Cup 2023 में शनिवार को पाकिस्तान के खिलाफ मेगा मुकाबले से पहले टीम इंडिया को बहुत ही अहम सलाह दी है. यह सलाह बताने के लिए काफी है कि साल 2021 T20 World Cup का वाकया करोड़ों भारतीय प्रशंसकों के ही नहीं, बल्कि देशी-विदेशी दिग्गजों के मनोपटल पर अभी भी अंकित है. पाकिस्तान के साथ मुकाबले से पहले फैंस के बीच ज्यादा जर्चा हो रही है. फैंस को अभी भी याद है कि पाकिस्तानी लेफ्टी पेसर शाहीन आफरीदी के प्रहार ने कैसे पारी की शुरुआत में ही भारत को ऐसे पटरी से उतारा कि फिर बात बन ही नहीं सकी. यही वजह है कि अब हेडेन ने भारतीय कप्तान रोहित शर्मा को सलाह देते हुए कहा है कि यूएई 2021 टी20 विश्व कप जैसे हालात से बचने के लिए पाकिस्तान के तेज गेंदबाज शाहीन शाह अफरीदी के पहले तीन ओवरों में सावधानी बरतें. तब भारत को इस ग्रुप मैच में 10 विकेट से शर्मनाक हार का सामना करना पड़ा और टीम इस टूर्नामेंट में हार के सदमे से उबरने में नाकाम रही. हेडेन का मानना है कि पाकिस्तान के इस लंबे कद के तेज गेंदबाज से निपटने का यही सही तरीका है. हेडेन ने स्टार स्पोर्ट्स से कहा, ‘आपको शाहीन आफरीदी के खिलाफ शुरू में सतर्कता बरतनी होगी. हाल ही में (टी20) विश्व कप (2021 में यूएई में) को याद करिए. शाहीन शुरुआती ओवरों में विकेट लेने में सक्षम थे.' पूर्व लेफ्टी दिग्गज बोले, ‘हम उस गेंद को कभी नहीं भूलेंगे जो उन्होंने रोहित शर्मा को फेंकी थी, इसलिए उसके खिलाफ थोड़ी सावधानी बरतें. अगर यह स्विंग हो रही है, तो पहले तीन ओवर खेलने पर ध्यान दें.' कोहली ने मैच में 49 गेंद में 57 रन बनाकर भारतीय पारी को संवारा था. टीम को हालांकि इस मुकाबले में 10 विकेट से हार का सामना करना पड़ा था. हेडेन से कहा कि अफरीदी के साथ ही भारतीय बल्लेबाजों को नसीम शाह और हैरिस रऊफ के खिलाफ भी योजना बना कर बल्लेबाजी करनी होगी. हेडेन ने दोनों चिर-प्रतिद्वंद्वी के बीच मुकाबले को विश्व क्रिकेट में सबसे रोमांचक मुकाबला करार देते हुए कहा, ‘भारत पाकिस्तान के तेज गेंदबाजों की तिकड़ी के खिलाफ खेलगा. यह क्रिकेट में सबसे रोमांचक मुकाबलों में से एक हैय पाकिस्तान के पास शाहीन अफरीदी, हैरिस रऊफ और नसीम शाह जैसे काबिल गेंदबाज हैं. तीन बहुत अलग प्रकार के गेंदबाज और उनसे निपटने के लिए भारतीय टीम को योजना के साथ आना होगा.' उन्होंने कहा, ‘कैंडी में परिस्थितियां तेज गेंदबाजों के लिए मददगार होगी. आपको पिच की उछाल पर नजर रखना होगा. इस मामले में हारिस के खिलाफ सतर्क रहना होगा। वह गेंद को तेज टप्पा खिलाकर ऑफ स्टंप के पास गेंदबाजी करता है.' पढ़ें ,राजनीति,खेल समाचार, और की ताजा समाचार अब हिंदी में ( ) लाइव खबर देखें: फॉलो करे:","pubDate":"2023-09-01 18:43:42","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-08/hnmr1ff_rohit-sharma_160x120_21_August_23.jpg","source_id":"ndtv_in","source_priority":129751,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"article_id":"a5a7b72c020a694104904d0747b611ea","title":"Asia Cup 2023: India to face arch-rival Pakistan in Pallekele; all eyes on Virat Kohli, Babar Azam","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/asia-cup-2023-india-to-face-arch-rival-pakistan-in-pallekele-all-eyes-on-virat-kohli-babar-azam/videoshow/103293932.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Team India and Pakistan don't get to play each other very frequently, but when they do, the term \"high-octane clash\" hardly scratches the surface and every match is greatly anticipated.
