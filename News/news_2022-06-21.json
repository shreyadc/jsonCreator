Remarkably, the hosts chased down a challenging total of 299 on the final day to win in Nottingham after dismissing the visitors for 284 in their second innings. It was a sign of the positive attitude and aggressive intent that the English team has decided to adopt under under the new regime of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum . England Test wicketkeeper has now spoken about McCullum's 'Braveheart-style' team talk during during the tea break on the final day of the Trent Bridge Test. \"Baz's team talk at tea - it was like William Wallace!\" Foakes was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo . \"After he was done, everyone was desperate to get out there. \"The traditional Test approach in that situation would be 'see how it goes, see how many wickets we've got left, then if the situation isn't there, do we shut up shop?' He was like, 'Nah, we're not doing that. We're winning this game. If we don't, so be it - we've done it the right way. It doesn't matter if we don't win this game.' And it took the pressure off.\" \"I had a few questions and didn't want to be too indecisive and not know how I am meant to be playing. [McCullum] has been really clear with the doubts I had and it was good for me to be open with him,\" he added. \"It has changed the way I look at Test cricket,\" Foakes says. \"With playing for England, there are obviously a lot of pressures, a lot of criticisms and things like that. If you think about that too much, it weighs on you. But over the last two weeks, it's clear to see the positives and how amazing playing for England can be. Baz and Stokesy, the way they are, promote that.\" Prior to the ongoing Test series against New Zealand, England had failed to win any of their previous five Test series, winning just one match from 17. Just a year ago, England, under the guidance of then coach Chris Silverwood , settled for a draw after refusing to take on a target of 273 in 75 overs against New Zealand. But, fired by Jonny Bairstow 's brilliant 136 off just 92 balls and stirring words from McCullum, England smashed their way to victory in Nottingham. England captain Ben Stokes hammered an unbeaten 75. Promoted The third and final Test starts on Thursday at Headingley in Leeds.

The postponed fifth Test will now be played at Edgbaston from July 1 to 5. In almost 10 months since then, both teams have got new captains in Ben Stokes and Rohit Sharma along with new head coaches in Dravid and Brendon McCullum.

Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Tuesday (June 21). Hosts Lanka are leading the series 2-1 after their six-wicket win over Australia on Sunday led by opener Pathum Nissanka’s maiden ODI century. Former Australia wicketkeeper-batter Adam Gilchrist, meanwhile, is pleased with Travis Head’s batting performance in the third ODI against Sri Lanka at Colombo, saying that he can see the cricketer developing into a long-term opener in the shorter version of the game. Head was been flown from Hambantota – where he was touring with the Australia A side – to Kandy as cover for an injured Marcus Stoinis. The charismatic 28-year-old, who was Player of the Series during the Ashes, made an instant impact, smashing an unbeaten 70 off 65 balls as Australia piled on 291/6 in the third ODI at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Sunday night. But Gilchrist felt Head is fast developing into a fine opener. Head has played all three formats in 2022 after enjoying a great 12 months in national colours to be counted among the best batters in the world. With opener David Warner returning to the side after missing the Pakistan series, Head has had to move back to the middle-order slot against Sri Lanka. “I think longer-term, down the track, probably in the next 12 months or so, Travis Head will find a spot at the top of the order,” Gilchrist told SEN WA Breakfast on Monday. “I think he’ll end up opening regularly in the one-day setup and I think that`s where he`ll be able to provide most impact with the team. He can get off to a flying start, he can go at as good a clip as anyone but he`s also got a game where he can lay a foundation for the team.” Match Details Sri Lanka vs Australia, 4th ODI Venue: R.

It is no secret that the ECB initially wanted to play all seven matches at the Pindi Stadium due to security measures in and around the stadium. The PCB, it seems, has convinced the PCB to play T20I matches on grounds that have more capacity. The PCB’s priority is to organise these matches in Lahore, Karachi, or Multan because these cities' grounds could accommodate a higher number of spectators. Though the dates and venues of the seven matches have yet to be finalized, it is believed that these matches will now be staged at bigger venues. England are to tour Pakistan twice during the coming season first to play the seven-match T20 series and then to take on Pakistan in the three-match Test series. The PCB is more interested in holding Test matches at least two at the Pindi Stadium.","pubDate":"2022-06-21 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"INV vs DNA Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for ECS Austria T10 2022 Match 5 & 6","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/inv-vs-dna-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-ecs-austria-t10-2022-match-5-6?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Sahil Jain"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-20 19:31:21","image_url":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/06/15a78-16557128577608-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rishabh is very big, integral part of our plan in next few months: Dravid","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/06/21/rishabh-is-very-big-integral-part-of-our-plan-in-next-few-months-dravid/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bengaluru: India head coach Rahul Dravid has made it clear that the under-fire Rishabh Pant is a “big” and “integral” part of the set-up heading into the T20 World Cup in Australia.

Pant, who led the side in the five-match series against South Africa that ended in a 2-2 draw after the last game was called off due to rain, managed only 58 runs in the five innings that led to some questions being raised about his place in the shortest format. However, Dravid was very clear that Pant is going nowhere. “Personally, he would have liked to score a few more runs but it is not concerning him. Certainly, he is a very big part of our plans going ahead in next few months,” Dravid said during the post-match press conference. He was categorical that he won’t judge someone based on one series — whether it is batting form or captaincy. “I just don’t want to be critical. In the middle overs, you need people to play slightly attacking brand of cricket, to take the game on a little more. Sometimes it’s very hard to judge it based on two or three games,” the head coach said. In fact, Dravid was impressed wit Pant’s strike-rate of 158 plus during the IPL where he managed an underwhelming 340 runs for the Delhi Capitals. “I think he had a pretty good IPL in terms of strike-rate even though it might not have looked good on averages. In IPL, he looked to move up a little bit (in terms of averages) and probably three years ago he was on those numbers. “We are hoping that we can get those numbers from him at the international level.” Pant’s is a high risk game that comes with a price and the coach is ready to pay the price looking at the bigger picture. “In the process (of playing an attacking game), he might go wrong in a few games but he remains an integral part of our batting line-up with the power he has and the fact that he is a left-hander is important to us in the middle overs, he played some good knocks,” he said. About his captaincy, Dravid felt that Pant did well considering that he led the side back in the series from 0-2 down. “To bring a team back from 0-2 down and to level it at 2-2 and give us a chance to win was good. Captaincy is not about wins and losses only. He (Pant) is a young captain, growing as leader. It is too early to judge him and you don’t want to do that after one series,” Dravid was clear in his thought-process. “It was nice to see he has got opportunities to lead, keep and bat. He had a lot of load on him but gaining from that experience and credit to him for ensuring that we went from 0-2 down to 2-2,” the coach was all praise for the stand-in skipper. Dravid doesn’t want to put a time line but by the end of the England T20Is, he wants to have a fair idea about the 18 to 20-odd players he would be looking at ahead of World Cup in Australia. India and England will clash in six white-ball games (July 7-17) after one-off Test. “As you come closer and closer to the event, you want to firm up your final squad or if not, obviously you want to have some contingencies in the kind of world we live in today. Obviously you want to take only 15 to the WC but (need to identify) top 18 to 20 players,” he replied to a query on where he stands on his core team. “Obviously, there could be odd changes due to injury and things that are beyond your control but we are going to start looking to firm up that squad as quickly as possible. “Whether that will happen in next series (Ireland) or series after that (England) is hard to tell but we are certainly looking to do that as quickly as possible,” he revealed. —PTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-06-20 18:48:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"U-14 Cricket Tournament: DPS clinches summit trophy","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/06/21/u-14-cricket-tournament-dps-clinches-summit-trophy/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["KR Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Srinagar: Delhi Public School Srinagar defeat Oasis Educational Institute by six wickets on Monday in the finals played at SP College ground to clinch the U-14 Cricket Tournament summit trophy.

Bhuvneshwar, who now only plays white-ball cricket, got six wickets in four completed games and gave away only 85 runs in 14 overs at an economy rate which was just a shade above six runs per over. “Bhuvi was special in this whole series as we came up against some quality bowling. He put us under pressure in Powerplays and barring one game (Delhi), where we got off to a good start, they have dominated us with both ball and bat in Powerplays,” Boucher said after the series ended in 2-2 despite Proteas going 2-0 up at the onset. However, losing Markram due to COVID-19 at the start of the series had a huge impact, felt the former glovesman. “It was tough losing Aiden Markram even before we started the first game. We wanted to play six batters with Aiden being our sixth option and we couldn’t do that, Boucher added. The long IPL did make the players tired and that also had an effect on the final outcome, he said. “We didn’t play our best cricket and it was quite tough on our IPL players to stay throughout the whole IPL and then come to India back-to-back as well,” he explained. “Guys are little bit tired as well. So they will all enjoy the break and (having learnt a) lot of lessons in World Cup year. And see, if we can plug a few gaps going into Australia albeit in different conditions.” While stars like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah were rested for the series, Boucher lauded the depth of the Indian cricket system created by the IPL.\\ I know there weren’t a lot of top (India) players over here but the depth that Indian cricket has at the moment largely due to the IPL, they can take lot of confidence as well.” “You just cant walk up in India and expect to win a series as well. So, we played a couple of good games and two bad games and there are a couple of reasons for that, but you can’t get too much into it,” he added. However in Australian conditions, South Africa will have a different gameplan. “Plans will change in Australia and we are aware of that. We tried a few options in these conditions and saw if they worked or not. “And I think, we asked a few questions and we got some good answers.” Boucher made no bones about the fact that South Africa need to improve upon their Powerplay batting. “We struggled to get going in few of the games and we speak about it after every game and may be see how we can change our mindset and intent, specially after third game, when we went after with the intent we needed,” he said. “And our bowling at certain stages was very good and at certain stages, we looked rusty and sort of understand that couple of guys coming into the series after IPL and may be a bit tired,” he signed off. —PTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-06-20 18:38:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PHOTO FOCUS - 16 photos from Scarborough RUFC CC v Flamborough","link":"https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/sport/cricket/photo-focus-16-photos-from-scarborough-rufc-cc-v-flamborough-3738721","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Andy Bloomfield"],"video_url":null,"description":"CPH Scarborough Beckett Cricket League Division Three leaders Flamborough eased to a win at Scarborough Rugby Club on Saturday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-20 18:04:25","image_url":"https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/webimg/QVNIMTI2MTExMTc1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"thescarboroughnews","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Dhawan unlikely to make it to India squad for T20 World Cup: Gavaskar","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/dhawan-unlikely-to-make-it-to-india-squad-for-t20-world-cup-gavaskar-122062001289_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Gavaskar believes that it is curtains for Dhawan as far as T20I cricket is concerned and with just four months remaining to go for ICC's premier event in Australia","content":"Former India captain and noted commentator Sunil Gavaskar believes that opener Shikhar Dhawan is unlikely to make it to the national team as far as this year's ICC T20 World Cup is concerned. Dhawan has had a decent performance in IPL 2022 and failed to make it to the team for the subsequent South Africa series and the T20Is in England next month. Gavaskar believes that it is curtains for Dhawan as far as T20I cricket is concerned and with just four months remaining to go for ICC's premier event in Australia. \"No. I don't see his name popping up. If it had to pop up, it would have been in this squad. A lot of guys have gone to England and he could have been in this squad. If he is not in this squad, I don't see him ending in the mix (for T20 World Cup),\" Gavaskar said on Star Sports. With Rohit Sharma and K.L Rahul missing the series against South Africa Dhawan would have been hoping to make it back to the national team. But he did not get the chance as the selectors decided to test youngsters. Dhawan has scored more than 450 runs in the last seven IPL editions but still could not make it to the team for England. Though the selectors have opted for Ruturaj Gaikwad and Ishan Kishan in the recent series, Gavaskar believes that Rohit Sharma and K.L Rahul, if fit, will be the best options at the top for India at the T20 World Cup. \"My opening combination would have K.L Rahul, if he's fit, and Rohit Sharma alongside him,\" he said. In the next few weeks, India will play five T20Is against England and two against Ireland. --IANS bsk (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","pubDate":"2022-06-20 18:04:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka announce 19-member squad for white-ball series against Indian women’s cricket team","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sri-lanka-announce-19-member-squad-for-white-ball-series-against-indian-womens-cricket-team/article65546899.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        PTI  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"Skipper Chamari Athapaththu will lead both the squads, which include vital players like Hasini Perera, Nilakshi de Silva, Oshadi Ranasinghe and Inoka Ranaweera","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-20 17:29:40","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lack of Test cricket frustrating but T20 series great opportunity against the best: George Dockrell on Ireland playing India","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/lack-of-test-cricket-frustrating-but-t20-series-great-opportunity-against-the-best-george-dockrell-on-ireland-playing-india-7980714/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":["Rahul Pandey"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Kenny Caroll was an Ireland cricketer who played the ODI world cup in 2007. He also tried to play in the London Olympics as a hockey player but Ireland failed to qualify. What could an Irish sportsman do in those days? Kenny became a postman, clutching a grey-clothed postbag of dreams, regrets, and hopes across Dublin. Luckily, things have changed a bit now. Central contracts and with it comes not just security but excitement, says George Dockrell, who has played 198 international games for Ireland across formats and is part of the squad for the upcoming two T20 games against India to be played on 26th and 28th June. “It’s been incredibly exciting, playing over the last decade or so with Ireland and watching how much Irish cricket has developed”, the 29-year old Dockrell tells The Indian Express . Dockrell was one of the first 19 players to be awarded a central contract from Cricket Ireland in 2020 (the first year in which all contracts were awarded on a full-time basis). “It’s been a lot of changes. Most certainly, better support for players back home, and having a lot of the Irish guys now based in Ireland, the majority of them. It’s superb to have that kind of domestic structure grow. There’s certainly a lot of areas that we still need to work on in terms of the facilities and keep driving that domestic game up in standard. But it’s fantastic to see how far it has come. Exciting next 10 years for Irish cricket to see how far we can go from here.” Throughout his career of 193 international games for Ireland across formats, Dockrell has featured against India four times. Twice in the ODI World Cup (2011 and 2015) and in the two T20Is at home back in the summer of 2018. Dockrell says the upcoming T20 series against India is a ‘ pretty special way’ to start off what is going to be ‘a big summer’ for Ireland Cricket. Dockrell has featured against India four times. Twice in the ODI World Cup (2011 and 2015) and in the two T20Is at home back in the summer of 2018. (Twitter/ George Dockrell) “It’s a great opportunity to test ourselves against the best in the world,” he says. “I think having India to start off international summer, it’s always going to be a big one for us. Last time we played them in Dublin (2018), it was two sell out games. The atmosphere was absolutely electric. It’s always exciting when you have a game against India, and the buzz that is generated around that.” There are notable changes in the India squad that travels to Ireland this week than the one that featured in Dublin four years ago. Plenty of big names from the current India white-ball lineup, including captain Rohit Sharma are part of the squad in England for the one-off Test early next month. Stand-in skipper Hardik Pandya, Dinesh Karthik , Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Yuzvendra Chahal are the only common links between the two two-match series’ in Ireland four years apart. For most of the Indian players traveling to Ireland, it will be their first exposure to cricket in the UK conditions. Dockrell, though, believes it isn’t a strong argument to suggest that the visitors start on the backfoot going into the series. “Look it’s double edged in the sense that there’d be some inexperience in terms of that group but at the same time, it’s a hungry group of cricketers who are trying to make their mark in international cricket,” the slow left-arm orthodox says. “Yeah, there’s a lot of personnel changes within. It’s quite different I suppose, with the concurrent squads playing across the world. It’s something that we have seen more of off late. But I think with that India team, it’s still full of some world class players.” Recollecting from his experiences of playing against India in 2011, 2015, and 2016, Dockrell adds, “Every time I’ve taken the field against India, every single person you go up against pushes you right to where you want to be at this level of international cricket.” The Irish international associates this depth at hand for India and other international sides, across formats, to IPL and the T20 franchise leagues across the world. “You have guys now who have played a huge amount of IPL before making their India debut,” he says. “You get to test yourself against the best in the world on that platform. You have cricketers who come to the international platform with a lot of cricket under their belt, and therefore are better prepared. Means you have a bigger group of players to choose from who are at that level. These leagues have been fantastic in allowing players to develop. When they do get the opportunity (for national sides), they are that bit better. And we can see that as I say across these split format squads we’re seeing now in international cricket.” ‘Exciting next 10 years for Irish Cricket’ Dockrell made his debut for Ireland in February 2010. The men’s cricket team had just made remarkable first impressions in world tournaments, beating Pakistan in their first ODI World Cup in 2007 and Bangladesh in their first T20 World Cup in 2009. Since then, Ireland have been regulars at the white-ball World Cups, with the exception of the 2019 ODI World Cup in England which was reduced to 10 teams from 14 in the previous edition. Test Cricket: Love and frustration Dockrell says he loves all three formats of the game. But his eyes have an exclusive glimmer when he talks about Test cricket. “I’ve loved Test cricket, the longer format all my life,” he says. Congrats to @ACBofficials on winning their first test match. Plenty of things for us to work on moving forward but learnt a lot from this trip. Home now for a big summer with @LCU_Lightning and @Irelandcricket pic.twitter.com/TjN0fzFFd7 — George Dockrell (@georgedockrell) March 18, 2019 The Ireland all-rounder had to wait for nine years and 142 white-ball appearances before he got his first and only cap so far in the red-ball format. In the one-off Test against Afghanistan in Dehradun. Since then, the men in green have played only one more Test, accounting for a total of three in their history. “It’s been frustrating for us, the lack of Test cricket that we have had in the last number of years,” says Dockrell. “Now, I understand that there are financial restrictions and reasons behind a lot of these series but it’s incredibly important to be playing multi-day cricket. It’s where you learn a lot of your game. Spending time in the middle, bowling a lot. I think it to be incredibly important to developing the players, even players who’ve already made it but often it could be a big part for them to be spending a lot of time in the middle. It’s very important to keep growing the game across the world.” He concludes by saying, “Again, I understand there’s (smiles) logistical issues and things that are bigger than the things I think about but as a player certainly I’d like to see more of the longer format cricket.

A couple of days ago, a few media reports claimed that Saha will be joining Tripura as a player-mentor, but the wicketkeeper-batter has rubbished such claims. “I have offers from quite a few state associations, but I have not given my go-ahead to either of them. Just like other teams, I have had discussions with Tripura Cricket Association (TCA) as well and let me make it clear that so far, I have not confirmed anything yet,” Saha told Sportstar from Kolkata. A few weeks ago, the office-bearers of the TCA had long discussions with Saha and even offered him the role of a player-mentor. However, Saha claimed that he is yet to make up his mind. READ: Saha yet to take a call on new team after seeking NOC from Bengal “I am looking at a lot of aspects before making a decision about my next destination. I am looking at a role that will allow me to contribute better and while having discussions with all the state units, I have made it very clear,” Saha said, indicating that he is looking at a player-mentor role. “I have offers from teams from west, east and north and I have to factor in several aspects before I make up my mind,” he added. Saha, who played for Bengal for more than a decade, did not feature in the Ranji Trophy this season and has decided to seek a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from Cricket Association of Bengal. Soon after the Bengal squad for the Ranji knockouts was released by the CAB, Saha had a long conversation with Avishek Dalmiya, where he indicated that he may no longer play for Bengal. He was upset with comments by a senior CAB official, who had raised questions over Saha’s commitment after he decided to skip the group stage of the Ranji Trophy due to personal reasons. He even exited the Bengal team's WhatsApp group, despite coach Arun Lal having a word with the India international. ALSO READ: Manoj Tiwary: These runs will have no value to me if I can't help my side Earlier, Saha had told this publication that he decided to move on from Bengal after questions were raised on his commitment. “For me, too, it is a very sad feeling that I have to go through something like this after playing for Bengal for so long. It is disappointing that people make such comments and question your integrity. As a player, I had never faced such a thing in the past, but now that it has happened, even I need to (move on),” Saha had said. After being left out of the Indian Test team for the home series against Sri Lanka in March, Saha went to the Indian Premier League and had a successful stint with the champion side Gujarat Titans. Opening the innings for Titans alongside Shubman Gill, Saha amassed 317 runs. While an India call-up may be a distant dream for the stumper-batter, he is keen on continuing with domestic cricket for at least a few more years.","pubDate":"2022-06-20 14:41:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: Rohit, Shubman begin practice at new training base ahead of England Test - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC93YXRjaC1yb2hpdC1zaGFybWEtc2h1Ym1hbi1naWxsLWJlZ2luLXByYWN0aWNlLWF0LW5ldy10cmFpbmluZy1iYXNlLWFoZWFkLW9mLXJlc2NoZWR1bGVkLWVuZ2xhbmQtdGVzdC0xMDE2NTU3MzUwNDE2NTMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Watch: Rohit, Shubman begin practice at new training base ahead of England Test  Hindustan TimesWatch: Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill \"Getting Into The Groove\" In Leicester Ahead Of India-England Test..  NDTV SportsIndia tour of England | Watch: Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill hit the nets ahead of practice match in Leicestershire  India TodayWill Cheteshwar Pujara open against England in KL Rahul`s absence?

His first Test match was against the West Indies at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica, coming nearly three years after his ODI debut. It wasn’t an impressive beginning for the Delhi batter as he was dismissed cheaply in both innings of his debut Test match. After managing only four in the first innings, he was out for 15 in the second essay. In both instances, he was caught behind off fast bowler Fidel Edwards' bowling. It wasn’t long before Kohli found his groove in the traditional format of the game, though. He registered his first Test hundred against Australia in Adelaide in January 2012 and did not look back after that. The 33-year-old has, so far, amassed 8043 in 101 Tests at an average of 49.95, with 27 tons and 28 fifties. Social media was flooded with wishes for the star cricketer as he completed 11 years in Test cricket. Here’s a look at some tweets congratulating the cricketer: On the anniversary of his Test debut, the man himself took to social media and shared a nostalgic video, which featured snapshots of his achievements in Test cricket over the years. The former India captain shared the post with the caption: Apart from his achievements as a batter, the cricketer also led India in 68 Tests, out of which India won 40, making him the country’s most successful captain in the format. Under him, India ended up as runners-up in the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC), going down to New Zealand in the final. The 33-year-old gave up the Test captaincy of the Indian team after the series loss in South Africa earlier this year. He has seven double hundreds to his name in Test cricket, one more than Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag.

He led the team to a 2-2 draw, but, could not make a significant contribution with the bat.Pant managed to score only 58 runs in five innings at a strike rate of 105.Dravid, however, cleared the air about his place in the T20I squad going further. Talking at the post-match media interaction Dravid said, “Personally, he would have liked to score a few more runs but it is not concerning him. Certainly, he is a very big part of our plans going ahead in the next few months.”READ: Rishabh Pant gets better but has a long way to go as captainSeveral experts have said that Pant’s position is not definite in the playing XI for the T20 World Cup, especially looking at his performances in the shortest format of the game. The fact that KL Rahul and Dinesh Karthik can also keep wickets, and their tremendous batting form in recent times has added further fuel to the debate.Pant’s shot selection and the mannerism of getting out have specifically come under the scrutiny of cricket pundits.Albeit, Dravid supported the stand-in skipper and said that it would not be right to judge him so based on a few matches. “I just don't want to be critical. In the middle overs, you need people to play a slightly attacking brand of cricket, to take the game on a little more. Sometimes it's very hard to judge it based on two or three games.\"\"In the process (of playing an attacking game), he might go wrong in a few games but he remains an integral part of our batting line-up with the power he has and the fact that he is a left-hander is important to us in the middle overs.\"Dravid also mentioned that the southpaw had a very good outing with the bat during the IPL and that should be kept in mind before making critical remarks. “I think he had a pretty good IPL in terms of strike rate even though it might not have looked good on averages. In IPL, he looked to move up a little bit (in terms of averages), and probably three years ago he was on those numbers. We are hoping that we can get those numbers from him at the international level.”A happy & smiling bunch signing off from Bengaluru ☺️ ☺️#TeamIndia | #INDvSA | @Paytm pic.twitter.com/Y3LFSBfDA3— BCCI (@BCCI) June 19, 2022Pant scored 340 runs in the recently concluded IPL at a strike rate of more than 158.Pant will not be a part of the T20I side against Ireland as he will be with the Test team for the one-off test match against England. It will be important to see how Pant performs in the limited-overs leg against England, later in the tour.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Six baby steps to the crease. A small jump and roll of arms. This was very unlike the fierce Wasim Akram back in the day, when he bowled at former English legend Michael Atherton.What was similar to the vintage Akram was the delivery. A beautiful in-swinging yorker that went through the gap between pad and bat of Atherton and rattled the middle and leg stumps. Atherton was bowled.Akram went on to celebrate the wicket in his old fashion, with wide arms, but, with a smile on his face rather than aggression. As Atherton started walking back, he extended his bat towards Akram and the former Pakistan pacer patted gently on it.It seemed like the Pakistan quick had rolled back the time to the 1990s. While being competitors at the international level, the duo played for Lancashire County for many years.The legends were playing in Oxfordshire in England, in a Wellbeing of Woman organized charity match in the remembrance of late Australian spin wizard Shane Warne.Watch the video here –A classic @wasimakramlive inswinging yorker is too good for Michael Atherton! 👌🔥These legends are playing in the @WellbeingofWmen Celebrity Charity Match in remembrance of the great Shane Warne 🙌 pic.twitter.com/7GwcCL97kP— Cricket District 🏏 (@cricketdistrict) June 19, 2022The charity match also saw some other cricketing greats such as Ian Bell, Monty Panesar, Neil Johnson, and former England women’s captain Charlotte Edwards. Commentator and expert Mark Nicholas and Rajasthan Royals co-owner Manoj Badale were also present alongside the former legends. Subsequently, Akram also took a dig at Atherton tweeting, “Sorry @Athersmike we might get older but some things will stay the same!” Sorry @Athersmike we might get older but some things will stay the same 😉! https://t.co/k2SnvKGvX5— Wasim Akram (@wasimakramlive) June 19, 2022In one of his recent interviews, Atherton had described Akram as “one of the great left-arm bowlers that the game has ever seen.”Earlier, while coming to the crease to bat, Akram said, “I haven’t played for ten years, but I’m playing cricket for a great cause”Atherton’s side ultimately won the match, chasing a target of 237.The cricketing world was shocked as Shane Warne lost his life at the age of 52 due to a heart attack, in March 2022.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Sri Lanka will take on Australia in the 4th ODI match of the 5-match ODI series at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. The hosts are 2-1 ahead in the series, and they would want to seal the series, whereas the visitors would want to level it. The spin bowlers of the Sri Lankans are on fire, and they have dominated the Aussie batters. Australia will have to find a balance in their playing eleven, they played with just three full-time bowlers in the last match. Pat Cummins should come in for Australia for the 4th ODI match. R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo is set to host the 4th ODI match, and the pitch will again be looked at with great interest. A total of 127 ODIs have been played at this ground, where the teams batting first have won 73 matches. The teams batting first have done comparatively well at this stadium. The pitch at the R Premadasa Stadium has generally been a good batting track overall, with the batters getting a true value for their shots. In the initial overs of the match, the batters can certainly take advantage of the hardness of the wicket. However, the match takes a turn in the middle overs.

Spinners can take advantage of the turn and grip provided by the pitch, and they have the power to decide the fate of the match. In the last match, the Sri Lankan spinners dominated the Aussie batters, and they would aim to continue doing the same. The Australian can also pick an extra spinner for this match. The outfield of the pitch is quite fast, and this will assist the batters. Looking at the overcast conditions, both teams would want to bowl first.","pubDate":"2022-06-20 11:50:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chamari Athapaththu to lead Sri Lanka women's team in limited-overs series against India","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/womens-cricket/chamari-athapaththu-sri-lanka-womens-team-odis-t20is-vs-india/article38504511.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Team Sportstar"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sri Lanka Cricket on Monday named a 19-member women's squad for the limited-overs internationals to be played against India this month.","content":"Sri Lanka Cricket on Monday named a 19-member women's squad for the limited-overs internationals to be played against India this month.
