Ishan Kishan probably stands out with his double hundred, which was in a 50-overs game and that’s a fantastic achievement. He got it so easily. And he got in what 35 or 36th over,” Gavaskar said during an interaction on Sony Sports.“If he had carried on he would have got the first ever triple hundred in ODIs. It will happen with the way he is batting. That is a huge plus as India is concerned… But a 200 is an amazing achievement and at such a young age. So I think sky’s the limit as far as the white-ball cricket is concerned,” Gavaskar added.Read: Kishan should be sure-shot opener for India at World Cup, says LeeKishan’s extraordinary knock, which was studded with 24 fours and 10 sixes, would help the Men in Blue post a daunting 409/8 after being invited to bat by Bangladesh. Shardul Thakur would then lead the way with the ball in hand as the Bangla Tigers were bowled out for 182, allowing the Indians to collect a 227-run consolation win at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium after suffering back-to-back defeats in Dhaka to surrender the ODI series.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

From the rise of ‘Bazball’ and Virat Kohli hitting a historic milestone to the women’s game making its debut at CWG and multiple giant-killing acts in a single tournament, 2022 had it all.As we prepare to bring the curtains down on the year, we take a look at some of the standout moments from international cricket across the year:‘Bazball’Few terms have been more widely used in the sport than ‘Bazball’ — a term that has come to define England’s revolutionary aggressive approach to the red-ball game following the appointment of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum as the Test captain and head coach respectively.The English team, which had been going through a major slump until said appointments, adopted the kind of attack-from-the-outset attitude that McCullum had infused into the Black Caps during his time as captain in the previous decade. The result — England have won nine out of 10 Tests since Stokesy and Baz took over, starting with a 3-0 sweep against McCullum’s former side New Zealand at home and including a historic series win by a similar margin in Pakistan more recently.England’s T20 World Cup winIt’s not just the Test format where the English men’s team underwent a complete overhaul — white-ball captain Eoin Morgan was also sacked from his role, with the ECB appointing wicketkeeper-batter Jos Buttler as his successor and going for a separate white-ball coach in Matthew Mott.Though things did not begin as smoothly for the Englishmen in white-ball cricket as it did for them in the longest format, Buttler and Co gradually began to show an improvement in their performances, going on to win a seven-match T20I series in Pakistan.And it was in the T20 World Cup in Australia where the side lived up to their full potential, reaching the semi-finals despite losing to Ireland in the Super 12s followed by a rained-off game, demolishing India in the semis before beating Pakistan in the final in front of a sold-out MCG, the very same venue where they had lost the 1992 ODI World Cup final.Kohli ends century droughtKohli had perhaps his the lowest point of his career this year; after resigning as the Test captain following the 1-2 series defeat in South Africa, which officially marked the end of the ‘Kohli Era’, his form further dipped during the home season and in the IPL. Kohli took a break following the tour of England, skipping Zimbabwe and the West Indies tours, and returned to action during the Asia Cup.It was at the continental tournament where Kohli produced a knock that ended up becoming one of the most significant of the year, even if it did not count for much as far as India’s title hopes went, as the former India captain ended a near-three-year wait for an international century by smashing a scintillating 122 not out against Afghanistan in India’s final outing of the tournament.Rise and Rise of SKYFew players have had as much impact individually as India’s Suryakumar Yadav did. The Mumbai Indians batter, who was finding it difficult to break into the Indian team a couple of years ago much to everyone’s surprise, is now an indispensable member of the Indian white-ball teams, especially T20, following his exploits in the tour of England, the T20 World Cup as well as in New Zealand.What’s more, SKY was in the form of his life across 2022, which not only resulted in multiple awe-inspiring knocks but also helped him pip Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam to the top of the ICC T20I batting rankings and finish the year with 1,164 runs at an average and strike rate of 46.56 and 187.43 respectively — the only batter to cross the 1K-run mark in the format this year.Deepti Sharma’s run outRunning batters out at the non-striker’s end, a.k.a. ‘Mankading’, has been viewed as a controversial method of dismissal in some quarters even if the Marylebone Cricket Club, the custodian of the game’s laws, has legalised the move of dismissing a batter guilty of stealing an extra yard before the bowler completes his/her delivery.The moment India claimed their first ODI series win vs England in 20 years 🥺Deepti Sharma ran Charlie Dean out at the non-striker’s end in her delivery stride, to give India a 3-0 sweep and @JhulanG10 a victorious farewell ✨#ENGvIND #SonySportsNetwork #SirfSonyPeDikhega pic.twitter.com/Ai2hWxBPlo— Sony Sports Network (@SonySportsNetwk) September 25, 2022 During the third women’s ODI between England and India at Lord’s, the hosts were putting up a spirited fight through its last-wicket pair of Charlie Dean and Freya Davies and were looking set to pull off an unlikely win from a near-hopeless position when India all-rounder Deepti, having noticed Dean stepping out of her crease at the non-striker’s end for far too long, decided to whip the bails off and run Dean out before completing the fourth delivery of her eighth over.Not only would the move help the Women in Blue seal a historic 3-0 sweep, it would also leave the cricketing world divided with fans, experts as well as former and current cricketers alike joining the conversation on Twitter.Cricket returns to CWGAnother milestone that cricket hit in 2022 was its return to a major international multi-sport event, making its first appearance at the Commonwealth Games in 14 years in Birmingham earlier this year. And while men’s cricket had featured in the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur, it was the women’s turn to represent the sport at the Birmingham Games this year, which took place in the months of July and August.Australia continued their dominant run this year, following up their ODI World Cup victory in New Zealand by beating India in a tensely-fought gold medal match and finishing on top of the podium. For the Women in Blue, collecting silver was a redemption of sorts after they failed to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup. New Zealand, on the other hand, beat home team England in the bronze medal playoff to join Australia and India on the podium.Mithali and Jhulan retirementsThe year also bore witness to the conclusion of one of the most glorious chapters ever written in the sport with the veteran Indian duo of Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami hanging up their boots this year.Their retirements brought the curtains down on careers that spanned two decades (slightly more in Mithali’s case), careers that witnessed the rise of the women’s game in India out of the shadows of obscurity and into the limelight in the cricket-mad nation, it’s performances on the field also undergoing tremendous improvement over the years to the point where they are now considered among the top sides.While Mithali called it a day after the World Cup in New Zealand, where she led the Women in Blue one final time, seamer Jhulan got a fitting on-field farewell at the ‘Home of Cricket’ during the white-ball tour of England earlier this year. Both retire from the sport with a plethora of records to their name, Mithali finishing as the leading international run-scorer (10,868), with Jhulan having collected the most international wickets in the women’s game (355).Tragedies hit Australian cricketIt was a rather sombre year for the sport, especially for Australian cricket with multiple legends bidding us goodbye this year for their heavenly abode, including spin icon Shane Warne.The entire cricketing world would be dealt a rude shock on 4 March when news of Warne’s demise at the age of 52 during a trip to Thailand, believed to be a “suspected heart attack”, made waves across publications and news channels as well as on social media. This was on the same day wicketkeeper-batter and former chief selector Rod Marsh breathed his last aged 74.A little over two months later, Warne’s Australia teammate Andrew Symonds would pass away after getting involved in a car accident in Queensland, Australia. The former all-rounder was 46 at the time of his demise.Tributes would flow in for all three cricketers, with Cricket Australia renaming the ‘Great Southern Stand’ at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after Warne and also paid tribute to one of cricket’s most colourful characters on Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test against South Africa on Monday.Triumph of the underdogs2022 could also be termed the ‘Year of the Underdog’ given the number of cricketing upsets witnessed this year, a vast majority of them taking place at the T20 World Cup in Australia.The giant-killing acts had begun from the First Round itself, with Namibia beating Sri Lanka and Scotland and Ireland defeating West Indies. Ireland would then maintain their unbeaten record against England across World Cups by beating their neighbours in the Super 12s.Zimbabwe would then take ‘revenge’ against Pakistan over the latter ‘sending’ a fake Mr Bean to their country, defeating the eventual runners-up by one run in a nerve-wracking clash in Perth that went down to the very last ball of the match, with Pakistan-born Sikandar Raza playing a key role in helping the Chevrons win and earning the ‘Player of the Match’ award in the process.The biggest upset of the tournament, and perhaps of the year, however, came on the very final day of the Super 12s, with Netherlands landing the knockout punch on South Africa. Much like Raza against Pakistan, it was three South African-born players — Roelof van der Merwe, Brandon Glover and Colin Ackermann — who played a key role in the victory against their country of birth.Australia, England, New Zealand return to PakistanWhile cricket had slowly been limping back to normalcy in Pakistan after a period of complete isolation, it was the return of the Australian, English and New Zealand teams — nations that were the most apprehensive of touring this part of the world — that truly marked the return of international cricket in the country that has had to deal with a host of security issues for years.Australia would make its first appearance in Pakistan in 24 years, playing three Tests, as many ODIs and a one-off T20I across March and April earlier this year. England, which had not toured the country since 2005 and had backed out of its commitment last year, fulfilled its promise this time around, playing seven T20Is before the T20 World Cup as well as three Tests after it and winning both.New Zealand, which had cut its 2002 tour short due to a bomb attack, arrived after England’s departure for a two-Test series, the first match of which is currently underway in Karachi.Click here for more stories in ‘2022’ Rewind’ seriesRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Following a high-speed burst of fast bowling after lunch, Nortje was walking in the outfield between overs when the aerial camera, which glides along movable cables, came whizzing up from behind and hit him on his left shoulder and back, knocking him to the ground. Fortunately South Africa’s most impressive bowler on a torrid second day was able to get up immediately, but he gestured his incredulity at the umpire who had seen the incident. While it has become the fashion in rugby for the broadcast producers to use camera footage for the benefit of the home team, it would surely be taking things too far, (even for Australians!) to use an expensive, 315kg camera to barrel into players. While Nortje did not seem too bothered by the incident after the day’s play, he did say players have sounded the warning before about how low the spidercams sometimes travel. “We’ve spoken before about how low the camera goes for certain interviews. I really don’t think it should be travelling head-high. They need to take Marco Jansen (2.07m tall) into consideration as well,” Nortje said with a smile. “It knocked my shoulder and elbow and the medical staff will just monitor it. I just saw cables, I turned and moved my head, saw the camera and it all happened a little quick. I didn’t really know what had hit me.” Fox apologises Broadcasters Fox Cricket have made no public mention of the harrowing incident, but a Proteas spokeswoman said they did apologise to the team. “They put it down to human error and the cam was disabled for the rest of the day. They’ll ensure that measures are put in place for the remainder of the match and series to ensure that it doesn’t get as low as it did today,” Proteas media manager Lucy Davey told The Citizen.

His wife Candice Warner praised him as the best cricketer in this context as the best father, husband, brother and son. The 36-year-old Warner has been playing international cricket for Australia since 2009. He made his debut in Test cricket in 2011. Currently, he has played 100 Test matches including the Melbourne match with the South African team. He has accumulated a total of more than 8000 runs. In the first innings of this match, he scored 200 runs off 254 balls and retired Hurt. All his family members were present at the stadium to witness his 100th Test match. They all cheered and celebrated his performance. “Very proud and relieved. He is old. Everyone was saying that they should retire. But in this match he has created a record as a batsman who has crossed 8000 runs. He also scored a double century. It was very special for him to do this in front of his supporters and admirers. We are all proud of him.

We will have World Cups in cricket, hockey, and football. There’s a lot more besides this as well.We take a look at the showpiece events:Men’s Hockey World CupWhere: Bhubaneshwar and Rourkela, IndiaWhen: 13-29 JanuaryMen’s hockey World Cup is back and four years after hosting the event in Bhubaneshwar, India is once again gearing up to stage the prestigious event in Odisha, which has become the home of the sport. Belgium who won their first world title in 2018 will be aiming to defend the crown while India will be looking to win their second title after 1975. Pakistan have won the most four world titles but they are not part of the World Cup this time. Three-time winners Australia are seen as the top favourite for the trophy.Women’s T20 Cricket World CupWhere: South AfricaWhen: 10-26 FebruaryThe T20 World Cup will be the first one to be hosted after the 2018 edition in West Indies where without any surprises Australia won. In fact, Australia are also the ODI champions and hence the challenge for other participants will be to cause a surprise and stop the inevitable from happening. India will be taking part in the World Cup under the leadership of Harmanpreet Kaur and will be hoping to win their first title. With Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami retiring, this will be the first time in over two decades that India will be without those two legends in a world tournament. Ten teams will take part and they have been put in two groups of five teams each. The top two teams from the groups will make it to the semi-finals.Women’s Football World CupWhere: Australia and New ZealandWhen: 20 July to 20 AugustThe all-conquering United States women’s national team face stiff competition from a series of emerging European contenders for the World Cup. The Americans have won four of the eight previous editions of the tournament, including the last two, but have been beaten by Germany, England and Spain this year. England are looking to back up their victory on home soil at Euro 2022, while co-hosts Australia will be hoping Chelsea star Sam Kerr can lead the Matildas beyond the quarter-finals for the first time. Ten venues across nine host cities in Australia and New Zealand will host the first 32-team women’s World Cup, which is set to smash records for attendance and viewing figures in a further indication of the growing popularity of the sport.World Athletics ChampionshipsWhere: BudapestWhen: 19-27 AugustWorld athletes of the year Armand Duplantis and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone will bid to recreate their world record-setting victories in the Hungarian capital. Coming a year after the Covid-delayed world champs in Eugene, Oregon, the biennial event will play host to a raft of up-and-coming track and field stars. All eyes will be on Jamaica’s five-time 100m champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce in the women’s sprints, at the age of 36. The US team will look to the likes of Fred Kerley, Noah Lyles, Michael Norman and Erriyon Knighton to light up the men’s short track, while Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Karsten Warholm will bid to extend their winning form.Men’s ODI Cricket World CupWhere: IndiaWhen: October-November (dates to be decided)The 13th edition of the global 50-over showpiece will see England defend the title they won in thrilling fashion on home ground in 2019. Despite the event stretching over seven weeks and featuring 48 games, only 10 teams are taking part. The top seven countries from the Super League plus hosts India will make it through as well as two teams from a qualifying tournament to be held in Zimbabwe in June/July. There is, however, already controversy with former Pakistan Cricket Board chief Ramiz Raja having hinted his country could boycott the World Cup if India refuse to play the Asia Cup scheduled for Pakistan also in 2023.With AFP inputsRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Notably, the 31-year-old pacer made his second Test appearance at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium. It took almost 12 years for the Gujarat bowler to return to red-ball cricket. Unadkat made his debut under the leadership of former Indian captain MS Dhoni during a South Africa tour back on 16 December 2010. Thus, the comeback has emerged as one of the most significant events of his cricketing journey.To the journey of all those years in between.. 🥂#267#TeamIndia pic.twitter.com/XJZPvN9Qey— Jaydev Unadkat (@JUnadkat) December 27, 2022 Referring to the memorable feat, Unadkat took to Twitter and shared two special photographs with the caption reading, “To the journey of all those years in between.” The first picture depicts the jersey from his debut Test, while the other one has the one he wore in the Bangladesh game.Unadkat’s teammates from the 2010 Test in Centurion gave their signatures on the memento shirt. The names of legendary cricketers like Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman, Rahul Dravid, Harbhajan Singh, and Zaheer Khan can be spotted on the white jersey.The same pattern was followed in the recent “No. 267” kit too. As seen in the image, new-generation icons including Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Chetashwar Pujara, and Rishabh Pant signed on it. Most interestingly, only three fellows were common in both squads. Apart from Unadkat, another veteran seamer Umesh Yadav and 34-year-old batter Pujara were also part of that Africa-bound unit although Yadav did not get to play a match during the tour. He finally featured in his maiden Test in November 2011 against West Indies on home soil.Unadkat’s lack of consistency and the strong competition inside the Indian team kept him far from Test cricket. He could not pick up any wickets in his debut game against the Proteas. But this time, the left-arm quick made an immense contribution to his side’s thrilling 3-wicket victory in the second Test. He fetched a total of three scalps during both Bangladesh innings. He also got some runs with the bat scoring 14 and 13 runs respectively in two innings.","pubDate":"2022-12-27 10:54:14","image_url":"https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/380x285/fixed/jpg/2022/12/Unadkat-640_AP.jpg","source_id":"firstpost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ishan Kishan should be sure-shot opener for India at World Cup: Brett Lee","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/ishan-kishan-should-be-sure-shot-opener-for-india-at-world-cup-brett-lee-11880341.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ishan Kishan should be sure-shot opener for India at World Cup: Brett Lee","content":"Former Australia pacer Brett Lee wants Ishan Kishan to be one of India’s openers at the upcoming 2023 ODI World Cup. Kishan recently broke the record for the fastest double century in ODI cricket as he scored 210 off 131 balls against Bangladesh. He got to his double hundred in just 126 balls.With his whirlwind innings, Kishan has shown that he can be India’s regular opener and someone who can provide strong starts to the team. With opener Rohit Sharma captaining India, Kishan has emerged as a challenge for other openers like Shikhar Dhawan and Shubman Gill.Speaking in a video on his YouTube channel, Lee said Kishan should be India’s “sure-shot” opener for the World Cup.“With this deadly double, Ishan has staked a strong claim to open for India in the ODI World Cup at home in 2023. Will this happen? I don’t know. Should it happen? Hell yeah it should. The guy just scored the fastest 200 in ODI history. But if he can show consistency, stay fit, and be around the next few months, he should be a sure-shot opener for India at the World Cup,” said Lee.Lee also added a word of caution for the 24-year-old youngster and underlined that consistency will be key for him to secure the opening slot permanently.“Back Ishan to make it in the World Cup squad with an eye on the future and clearly, he would be on a high after that knock as he should be. However, a word of caution. Too much praise had led to cobwebs in the head,” said Lee.“So my advice to Ishan Kishan would be… forget about the milestone, forget about the double hundred as soon as you can. There are bigger milestones to achieve, higher peaks to scale. Ishan Kishan has to forget about the euphoria of his double hundred. Just focus on the process, stay fit and keep smashing big runs.”Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
