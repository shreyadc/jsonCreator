The league announced the timeline of completion for Grand Prairie Stadium, which will play host to MLC's Texas franchise. The stadium is using $20 million to convert the baseball diamond, formerly the home of the Texas AirHogs, into a cricket field with a natural grass turf wicket. \"I am excited to see the vision of bringing Major League Cricket to the US and to North Texas is beginning with the construction of the Grand Prairie Stadium,\" said Anurag Jain, Managing Partner of Perot Jain, LP and Chairman of Access Healthcare. \"What has been a grassroots sport with tremendous support, will now have a home stadium with world-class professional matches for many fans to watch. It will be exciting to watch a tremendous rise in interest for the game among North Texas sports fans once the stadium opens.\" Here is a rendering of what the new stadium is expected to look like, courtesy of Major League Cricket and the city of Grand Prairie: According to HKS, the Dallas-based project architect, the newly-converted stadium will feature 1,000 club and premium seats, with the ability to expand to a capacity of over 15,000 for major events. HKS is also known for designing other marquee venues including AT&T Stadium in Arlington and SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.

India created a world record on Sunday by sealing their 12th consecutive series win in the ODI format against the West Indies ‚Äî the most against a team. In this backdrop, head coach Rahul Dravid might be tempted to try out some of his reserve players but he will have to maintain a fine balance between keeping the momentum and testing his bench strength. In the batting department, it is unlikely that Ruturaj Gaikwad would be preferred over Shubman Gill, who after two innings of 64 and 43 would not like to sit out. Gaikwad had got a full South Africa series where he looked distinctly uncomfortable against quality pace. While his IPL credentials have kept him in the mix, chances of Indian cricket establishment investing in him on short term basis look dim. Shreyas Iyer and Sanju Samson have also hit the straps with fifties in last game and Suryakumar Yadav is not expected to cool his heels at the expense of Ishan Kishan despite his twin failures in the first two games. Kishan is seen as a timer of the ball who can use the Powerplay overs well by hitting over the in-field. He isn‚Äôt a power hitter who can force the pace after 35th over and hence Samson is a better option despite him being a left hander. Ravindra Jadeja as the designated vice-captain was the first choice all-rounder in this series before he was ruled out of the first two games due to a knee niggle. It is still not certain whether Jadeja will be available for the final game as Axar Patel after his match-winning knock of 64 in the second game could feel hard done by. However if Dhawan wants two play two left-arm spinners, then Yuzvendra Chahal could be asked to rest but that will be at the cost of sacrificing variety in bowling attack. Arshdeep Singh had a groin issue during the England ODIs but since he is a left arm seam bowler, he could be tried out in place of Avesh Khan, who was a tad expensive in the second ODI. He leaked 54 runs in his six wicket-less overs. Avesh and Prasidh Krishna have a similar type of hit the deck bowling style, getting deliveries to rear up from back of length or good length. It only warrants that one among the two should start in the eleven. As far as West Indies is concerned, they have capable players but as a unit, they have failed to fire. They depend too much on individual brilliance of Shai Hope, Nicholas Pooran, Rovman Powell or Romario Shepherd. More importantly, the team hasn‚Äôt shown resilience to win important moments that can impact the outcome of the match. West Indies could do well to use the experience of Jason Holder in the final game of the series. The hosts would aim to put an end to their losing streak in ODIs, which has now stretched to eight matches, including a 0-3 loss to Bangladesh in the preceding rubber. ‚ÄîPTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-07-26 18:52:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Border‚Äôs advice for Head: Improve against spin to emulate Hayden‚Äôs success during ‚Äô01 India tour","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/07/27/borders-advice-for-head-improve-against-spin-to-emulate-haydens-success-during-01-india-tour/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"MELBOURNE: Former captain Allan Border has advised southpaw Travis Head to improve his technique against spinners if he wants to replicate Matthew Hayden‚Äôs success when Australia tour India for four-Test series next year.

After some riveting action during the first two ODIs, the final ODI between South Africa and England at Leeds had to be unfortunately called-off due to rain, with the series ending in a stalemate. The Proteas now gear themselves up for some promising high-octane T20Is, with the first of the three-match series set to take place at the County Ground in Bristol today. South Africa would be led by their experienced campaigner in David Miller, with their regular skipper Temba Bavuma ruled out due to injury. Eyes would also be on Rilee Rossouw, who is likely to feature in the playing XI tomorrow, after tasting decent success during the various T20 leagues around the world including the PSL, BPL, and most recently the T20 Blast, where he finished as the second-highest run-scorer in the season. As for England, their new skipper Jos Buttler has faced back to back home ODI and T20I series defeats against India, followed by a draw against South Africa a couple of days ago. Having won the last three series against the Proteas in the format, he would like to continue with the streak and register a maiden series victory under his full-time leadership.

As for this year‚Äôs recently concluded T20 Blast, the average first innings total at this venue sat at 171, which perhaps suggests that the batters are likely to enjoy their time out there in the middle today. Moreover, the shorter square and straight boundaries at the County ground further aids the big hitters present in both the sides. As for the bowlers, the pacers are likely to get some assistance with the new ball, but would have to make ample use of their variations while taking the pace off the ball during the latter half of the innings, to taste success at this venue. All in all, expect a high-scoring clash between the two batting-heavy sides today at Bristol.

The ICC flagship event will return to the country after more than a decade. The last time a women's 50-over World Cup was held in India was back in 2013 when Australian emerged champions after beating the West Indies by 114 runs in the final in Mumbai. Three other ICC women's events were also awarded on the day with Bangladesh hosting the 2024 T20 World Cup and England winning hosting rights for the 2026 edition. The inaugural T20 Champions Trophy in 2027 will be hosted by Sri Lanka. The last big mega women's global cricket event held in India was the 2016 World T20 but that was primarily because ICC used to organise both men's and women's event simultaneously. However, the system has changed with popularity of women's game increasing exponentially and ICC has segregated the events to procure the proper value for women's game with separate broadcast deal and exclusive coverage. \"We were keen on hosting the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 and we are glad we have won the hosting rights for this marquee clash on the women's calendar,\" BCCI president Sourav Ganguly was quoted as saying in an ICC release. \"The sport has undergone tremendous transformation since then. The popularity of women's cricket is rapidly rising, and this is a step in the right direction. The BCCI will work closely with the ICC and fulfil all the requirements.\" BCCI secretary Jay Shah said: \"We are taking several steps to raise the profile of the sport right from the grassroots level and hosting the World Cup will further boost the popularity of the sport in the country. \"The BCCI remains committed to women's cricket in India. We have the infrastructure in place, and I am confident we will have a very successful edition of the World Cup.\" The 50 over Women's World Cup, however, has been a stand-alone event since its inception in 1973, two years before the men's mega event started in England in 1975. India have hosted the event thrice -- in 1978, 1997 and 2013. Those in the know of things in the ICC felt that it was prudent call by the BCCI if they are bidding for the 2025 ODI event. \"Since BCCI is bullish about starting the Women's IPL from next season, I think they wouldn't like to hold any other marquee T20 women's event right away. Hence the decision to bid for the 2025 World Cup seems logical,\" the source said. In the 2025 Women's World Cup, the hosts and five top nations from ICC Women's Championship (IWC) 2022-2025 will get direct entry into the tournament. The remaining two teams will be identified through a global Qualifier comprising six teams. Out of six teams in the Qualifier, four will be from the IWC (rankings after top five teams) and the other two will be selected according to the ICC Women's ODI Team Rankings. Other Key Decisions ICC Board Finalises FTP The ICC Board approved both the men's and women's Future Tours Programme (FTP) from 2023 to 2027 and these will be published in the coming days. It is learnt that India will play 38 Tests during the said period. Laxman in ICC cricket Committee India great and current head of National cricket Academy VVS Laxman has been appointed to the ICC Men's Cricket Committee as current player representative alongside former New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori. Roger Harper has been selected as the second past player representative on the committee joining Mahela Jayawardene. New ICC Chairman to be elected in November The Board approved the process to elect the next Chair of the ICC which will take place in November 2022. The election will be decided by a simple majority unlike earlier years when two-third majority was a must. The term of the elected Chair will run for a two-year period from December 1 2022 to November 30, 2024.

ICC World T20 will take place in Australia later this year. Ponting has been around a lot of T20 cricket in recent times, having spent time as assistant of the Australian team under Justin Langer, being the head coach of Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and doing commentary during Big Bash League games. \"I think India and Australia will be the two playing in the final and I will just have to say that Australia will beat them in the final,\" Ponting said on the latest edition of ICC Review. \"The reigning champions have got home conditions and that was one thing that made Australia's win in the last World Cup, not remarkable, but that little bit sweeter for them. The fact that a lot of people, me included, thought when they went to UAE, the conditions that they were going to have to face on the back of the IPL, I thought the conditions might have been the thing that might not have allowed them to win it. But they found a way,\" he added. He also gave his thoughts on the England cricket team. He is impressed by its recent appointed Test head coach Brendon McCullum and his performance in the recently concluded Test series with New Zealand at home. Ponting is also aware of the greatness of England's new white-ball coach Matthew Mott because of his superb record with Australian women's team as its coach. \"I actually think England are an outstanding white-ball team and they have an outstanding white-ball setup. I just think the three teams on paper that look to have most class and the most match-winners are India, Australia and England,\" he said. The Aussie legend does not really agree with Pakistan bowling legend Waqar Younis on the chances of the Asian side clinching their second T20I World Cup title. He acknowledges the greatness of star pacer Shaheen Afridi and Mohammad Rizwan, but feels that the batting relies too much on the world number 1 batter and skipper Babar Azam. \"If Babar does not have a great tournament, I do not think they can win. I saw him up close and personal a couple of years ago out here in a Test series against Australia and I said it then, I thought the sky was the limit for this guy as far as Test match batting (was concerned) and, if anything, he has probably got better and better in the last couple of years. Their openers are very important and their new-ball bowlers are very important, but that role of the spin bowler in Australia might be a little bit more difficult with wickets that probably won't give them assistance,\" he said. On chances of other teams at least making it to the finals, he said, \"I know the game too well and any of New Zealand, Pakistan or West Indies even - we know how they tend to love playing this game and they are probably most suited to the T20 format. It would not surprise me if any of those sides find their way through to the final.\" ANI","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-26 16:37:03","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/7/2022_7$largeimg_2091946283.jpeg","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"What do Laxmi Ratan Shukla and WV Raman‚Äôs appointments mean for Bengal cricket?","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/domestic/bengal-cricket-team-appoints-laxmi-ratan-shukla-wv-raman-what-to-expect/article65687120.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Shayan Acharya  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"Both Laxmi Ratan Shukla and WV Raman want to take things as they come and approach each and every situation with a positive mindset.","content":"The last time Bengal clinched the Vijay Hazare Trophy title in March 2012, it rode on a century by Laxmi Ratan Shukla to defeat a star-studded Mumbai in the final. While Shukla had an incredible outing in the tournament, the Sourav Ganguly-led Bengal team excelled in every department under the watchful eyes of coach WV Raman. It‚Äôs been a decade since and Bengal‚Äôs senior men‚Äôs team hasn‚Äôt been able to add another trophy in its cabinet. Over the last few years, Bengal came strikingly close to winning a Ranji Trophy title, but was outplayed by Saurashtra in the final in the 2019-20 season. In the just-concluded season, the team was knocked out of the Ranji Trophy semifinals after being defeated by Madhya Pradesh, which eventually went on to win the title. Ahead of the upcoming season, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has overhauled the coaching staff - bringing back Raman as the batting consultant, while Shukla will be the coach. Both Shukla and Raman, however, want to take things as they come. ‚ÄúWe already had a great relationship and if he comes and assists the Bengal team with his vast experience, it will be really great,‚Äù Shukla told Sportstar about Raman‚Äôs appointment. Having worked with Raman in the past - in the Bengal team and in the Indian Premier League - Shukla understands what the former India women‚Äôs team head coach would bring to the table. ‚ÄúWith WV Raman sir, it has always been a very sweet and positive equation. I always respect him as I learned so much from him, so obviously his presence will help a lot,‚Äù Shukla said. Raman will be stepping into the shoes of VVS Laxman - who was earlier the batting consultant for CAB‚Äôs Vision Programme - and the seasoned coach is looking forward to this stint. ‚ÄúWe will have different things to do. As the coach of the team, LR (Shukla) will have to see things in a different way, whereas, me sticking to one function, I will have to approach a different aspect altogether,‚Äù Raman told this publication. ‚ÄúBut then, it will also be a case of both working together because the team‚Äôs objective is important and to ensure that the boys do what is needed of them will be important‚Ä¶‚Äù Unlike Shukla, Raman will not travel with the team, rather his job will be to prepare the team for the overall season - something that Laxman would do during his stint. ‚ÄúThe target will be to try and make the players realise what they need to do with the skillsets they have and within their framework of technique, how things can be done in all formats,‚Äù Raman said. And, both Raman and Shukla agree that coordination will be important. In his playing days, Shukla was known for his indomitable spirit on the field and as a coach he wants to imbibe that. ‚ÄúFor the team, mental balance is very important. We need to be mature in our approach and improve our temperament. I can guide the team, but at the end of the day, I need to ensure that I improve that temperament,‚Äù Shukla, a former Bengal captain himself, said. ‚ÄúFor instance, if a Virat Kohli is getting out in a particular area, then no coach can help him. He himself needs to find a way. People can come and advise, but ultimately the player will have to do things himself. Similarly, I believe that a coach can guide a player, but ultimately, it is up to the player to pick the brains of the coach, understand what he wants and implement those things accordingly. That‚Äôs what I want this team to do‚Ä¶‚Äù A domestic cricket stalwart for Bengal, Shukla has also played three ODIs for India and after retiring in 2015, Shukla entered politics and was a minister of state, youth affairs and sports, until January last year. During his stint as the Bengal captain, Shukla played with quite a few current players like Manoj Tiwary and Abhimanyu Easwaran and he believes that will help. ‚ÄúThey have all played under me, so they know how I would manage the team and what I expect from all of them. So going forward, they know how LR Shukla operates and what he believes in and I hope that together, we can put up a good show,‚Äù the newly-appointed coach said. Just like his playing days, Shukla wants to play to his strengths and work together as a team alongside Raman and other support staff.

Paddy Upton has been roped in on a short term contract and will be the latest addition to coach Rahul Dravid‚Äô‚Äôs team of support staff. ‚ÄúYes, Paddy will be joining the ODI team from Wednesday‚Äôs third game against the West Indies. He will continue till the end of the T20 World Cup in Australia. It is a short-term arrangement for a period of four months,‚Äù a senior BCCI source informed Tuesday on conditions of anonymity. Upton was first roped in by former India coach Gary Kirsten, when he took charge of the senior national team in 2008. They forged a successful partnership till 2011. Upton, since then has been associated with various IPL teams and has worked with Dravid at Rajasthan Royals. It is only understandable that Dravid approached Upton for being familiar with his style of working which had worked wonders for the Indian team of last decade. With India having a hectic itinerary going into the T20 World Cup starting with the Pakistan game in Melbourne October 23, Dravid perhaps would have understood the need of having a man, who is known for being a motivator and also helping players cope with rigours of international cricket. The ICC silverware has eluded India since 2013 Champions Trophy and the BCCI is keeping no stone unturned to ensure that the ‚ÄòMen in Blue‚Äô come up trumps at the global meet. During the last edition, the BCCI had MS Dhoni as the ‚ÄòMentor‚Äô for the event but with a tired team and a dated approach in T20s, the move didn‚Äôt yield desired results. Some of the players that Upton has worked with during his Team India stint (between 2008-2011) are Virat Kohli, current skipper Rohit Sharma, senior spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. On the other hand, Yuzvendra Chahal and Prasidh Krishna have worked with Upton at Rajasthan Royals. It is understood that Upton might hold some sessions with team‚Äôs premier batter Kohli, whose prolonged lean patch has led to calls of him being dropped from the shortest format. ‚ÄúIt is great that someone like Paddy has again joined the Indian team. If you look at Virat‚Äôs batting, he isn‚Äôt always looking out of form and maybe it‚Äôs all in the mind. And who better than Upton to clear the cobwebs,‚Äù a former India player said. ¬†","pubDate":"2022-07-26 16:30:15","image_url":"https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rahul-Dravid-and-Paddy-Upton-300x156.jpg","source_id":"orissapost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CWG 2022: Women must climb a mountain to win India's first cricket medal","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/cwg-2022-women-must-climb-a-mountain-to-win-india-s-first-cricket-medal-122072601022_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A few possible scenarios on how Indian women's cricket team can bag a medal at upcoming Commonwealth Games in Birmingham","content":"Smriti Mandhana, a key part of Indian women's cricket team, said that the country‚Äôs chances of winning a medal at the upcoming Commonwealth Games are very high, while adding she would want nothing less than gold. ‚ÄúOur preparations have been good and we are gunning for the gold, just not a podium finish,\" she said. But is winning gold, or for that matter any medal in the competitive field of women‚Äôs cricket, at Birmingham 2022 going to be easy? No hiccups seen in the initial phase The Indian team would not like to give much importance to Australia, who are their toughest opponent at the group stage. ‚ÄúWe have played them (Australia) in the openers in quite a lot of tournaments. In a T20 tournament, any team can beat any team. I wouldn't term Australia as a big team and make them feel good about that,‚Äù Mandhana said in a video uploaded by BCCI Women‚Äôs Twitter handle.

In the 23 games that have been played between the two sides, the team from Down Under has emerged victorious in 16 while women in blue have won only six matches. However, apart from Australia, the other two teams in India‚Äôs group i.e. Pakistan and Barbados (West Indies‚Äô representative for CWG) haven‚Äôt had the upper hand against the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side. India have beaten arch-rivals Pakistan nine times out of 11 and outsmarted West Indies 10 times out of 18. Thus, India can fancy themselves beating Barbados (curtailed version of West Indies) easily. Hence, reaching the semi-finals is not a big issue. Battling fear in the semis The main test for the Indian team would begin in the semi-final where it will have to face either England, South Africa or New Zealand from Group B. India are part of Group A. Group B also has Sri Lanka. India would most probably face England as the hosts are being tipped to top their group despite being pitted against New Zealand and South Africa. They have recently beaten South Africa who are already playing without their two top players in Lizelle Lee and Marizanne Kapp. Against New Zealand too, the English team has an upper hand having defeated the White Ferns 22 times in 28 games. A warm send off for #TeamIndia as they left for Birmingham this morning from Bengaluru. #Birmingham2022 pic.twitter.com/Z6tcR3jcDf ‚Äî BCCI Women (@BCCIWomen) July 24, 2022 However, if India manages to beat Australia in the group stage, they can avoid facing England. India‚Äôs record against the English women has been very dismal. They have lost 17 times in 22 meetings. India haven't been good against New Zealand either. The Indian women have beaten the women from the Kiwi nation only four times in 13 games. Things are not going to be easy for India in the semi-final and the 11 ladies that take the field on that day would have to play nothing less than terrific cricket to get into the final and secure India‚Äôs first medal in cricket at Commonwealth Games . What if India don‚Äôt make it to the final? Looking at Mandhana‚Äôs confidence, India would be hoping for nothing less than a place in the final. But if, by any chance, they fail to do so, they would have another go at a medal (bronze), playing the other losing semi-finalist. Thus on August 07, 2022, the day of the gold medal match, India would be able to secure at least one medal. To secure the bronze though, they would have to once again give their best. The team that India will face would also be coming in with a loss in their previous tie. #TeamIndia captain @ImHarmanpreet speaks about the excitement to play in the @birminghamcg22 Commonwealth Games #B2022 pic.twitter.com/uOVnsKmwwU ‚Äî BCCI Women (@BCCIWomen) July 23, 2022 Cricket was once played at the Kuala Lampur Commonwealth Games in 1998.

During the third day of the second Test of Pakistan‚Äôs tour of Sri Lanka 2022 in Galle, Sri Lanka managed to build a strong lead for themselves despite the absence of any individual performance. The hosts‚Äô top seven batters getting to starts witnessed them scoring 176/5 in 50 overs before bad light forced players to walk off the Galle International Stadium to register a shortened evening session. Losing in-form former captain Dinesh Chandimal (21) in the 35th over did put Sri Lanka in trouble but an unbeaten 59-run partnership for the sixth wicket between captain Dimuth Karunaratne (27*) and all-rounder Dhananjaya de Silva (30*) avoided a batting collapse to power the lead in excess of 300 runs. Currently leading by 323 runs with half their batting unit remaining, Sri Lanka would want to post at least a 400+ target. While memories of Pakistan registering the highest successful run-chase at this venue would be fresh, Sri Lanka will have to both bat and time their declaration smartly keeping the weather in mind. Weather Galle tomorrow SL vs PAK Day 4 While two full days of cricket is remaining in the match, weather having it in it to play spoilsport on Day 4 could change the dynamics of the match.

The India squad left on Sunday morning for Birmingham without the two players. BCCI president Sourav Ganguly had earlier confirmed that one member of the touring party tested positive.

''A second player has tested positive for COVID-19 and it happened before departure. Both the players remain in India,'' an Indian Olympic Association official told PTI. A BCCI source added: ''As per protocol, both players can only join the team once they test negative.'' Considering the situation, the two players are unlikely to feature in the opener against Australia. The second game is against arch-rivals Pakistan on July 31 and the final league match against Barbados on August 3. All games, including the final, will be played at Edgbaston. The organizers have said that tickets for the semifinals and final are already sold out. The team will be having its first training session later on Tuesday. #TeamIndia captain @ImHarmanpreet speaks about the excitement to play in the @birminghamcg22 Commonwealth Games #B2022 pic.twitter.com/uOVnsKmwwU ‚Äî BCCI Women (@BCCIWomen) July 23, 2022 We are aiming for Gold Medal at the Commonwealth Games: #TeamIndia vice-captain @mandhana_smriti . #B2022 pic.twitter.com/7Tsovu3Y12 ‚Äî BCCI Women (@BCCIWomen) July 22, 2022 Ahead of the team's departure, India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur had spoken about how much playing in the Commonwealth Games meant to her and the team.

India created a world record on Sunday by sealing their 12th consecutive series win in the ODI format against the West Indies ‚Äì the most against a team. In this backdrop, head coach Rahul Dravid might be tempted to try out some of his reserve players but he will have to maintain a fine balance between keeping the momentum and testing his bench strength. In the batting department, it is unlikely that Ruturaj Gaikwad would be preferred over Shubman Gill, who after two innings of 64 and 43 would not like to sit out. Gaikwad had got a full South Africa series where he looked distinctly uncomfortable against quality pace. While his IPL credentials have kept him in the mix, chances of Indian cricket establishment investing in him on short term basis look dim. Shreyas Iyer and Sanju Samson have also hit the straps with fifties in last game and Suryakumar Yadav is not expected to cool his heels at the expense of Ishan Kishan despite his twin failures in the first two games. Kishan is seen as a timer of the ball who can use the Powerplay overs well by hitting over the in-field. He isn‚Äôt a power hitter who can force the pace after 35th over and hence Samson is a better option despite him being a left hander. Ravindra Jadeja as the designated vice-captain was the first choice all-rounder in this series before he was ruled out of the first two games due to a knee niggle. It is still not certain whether Jadeja will be available for the final game as Axar Patel after his match-winning knock of 64 in the second game could feel hard done by. However if Dhawan wants two play two left-arm spinners, then Yuzvendra Chahal could be asked to rest but that will be at the cost of sacrificing variety in bowling attack. Arshdeep Singh had a groin issue during the England ODIs but since he is a left arm seam bowler, he could be tried out in place of Avesh Khan, who was a tad expensive in the second ODI. He leaked 54 runs in his six wicket-less overs. Avesh and Prasidh Krishna have a similar type of hit the deck bowling style, getting deliveries to rear up from back of length or good length. It only warrants that one among the two should start in the eleven. As far as West Indies is concerned, they have capable players but as a unit, they have failed to fire. They depend too much on individual brilliance of Shai Hope, Nicholas Pooran, Rovman Powell or Romario Shepherd. More importantly, the team hasn‚Äôt shown resilience to win important moments that can impact the outcome of the match. West Indies could do well to use the experience of Jason Holder in the final game of the series. The hosts would aim to put an end to their losing streak in ODIs, which has now stretched to eight matches, including a 0-3 loss to Bangladesh in the preceding rubber.","pubDate":"2022-07-26 14:07:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
