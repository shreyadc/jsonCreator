Topley again proved just how potent his left-arm seam, swing and bounce can be with a match-defining spell while taking three wickets in England’s one-day series-levelling victory over New Zealand at the Ageas Bowl. But the injuries that have had such a devastating impact on his career still hang over Topley, 29, as he prepares to make up for lost time at the 50-over World Cup next month. It was in Brisbane ahead of the T20 world tournament last October that Topley tripped on one of the 20 centimetre high ‘Toblerone’ boundary markers during fielding practice ahead of England’s warm-up game against Pakistan . Such was the impact on his 6ft 7in frame that Topley ruptured ligaments and tore some muscles around his left ankle and his World Cup was over before it had begun. Reece Topley has admitted his mental health was affected after he missed last year's T20 World Cup due to injury The England star took three wickets against New Zealand on Sunday - showing how potent his left-arm seam, swing and bounce can be Life did not get any easier after his recovery for a bowler who almost quit the game when he suffered the third of three stress fractures of his back as he dislocated his shoulder during the IPL earlier this year and needed surgery. No wonder, on his return for England after being named in their provisional 15-man World Cup squad, he admits to a certain amount of trepidation as the build-up continues to the start of the tournament in Ahmedabad, also against New Zealand, on Oct 5. ‘You could say I have a bit of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) about getting on the plane again because I was pretty emotional coming back from the last World Cup injured,’ said Topley after England’s 79-run victory in the second one-day international. ‘But injuries happen and it’s just the nature of sport. I still have good and bad days and Sunday was brilliant. As you get older injuries do get harder to come back from and I definitely wouldn’t say I’m out of the jungle in terms of my ankle and shoulder. But it’s a case of doing the right things and hopefully there’s more performances like today.’ Clearly, after spending seven of the last 12 months on the treatment table, there was rust for Topley in the first ODI in Cardiff. But he showed why England rate him so highly in Southampton in finding his rhythm and potency at a crucial stage of the second game. ‘It’s always tricky to ease yourself in when you’re playing professional sport because you get caught up in the emotion of it,’ said Topley. ‘You want to win and you want to play well. The Hundred was part of my recovery process and so is this series. It’s still building and hopefully I’ll be in a good place cricket-wise in India.’ Topley is set to head for India for the upcoming World Cup but claims he is 'not out of the jungle' in terms of his conditioning England's 15-man World Cup squad is still not finalised, with Harry Brook (pictured) trying to earn his place in the team after being left out of the provisional squad Fitness permitting Topley will definitely be in England’s final 15-man squad but Sunday’s victory did little to clear up the uncertainty surrounding the last one or two places. It seemed England would reverse their controversial decision to leave out Harry Brook when he starred in the drawn T20 series against New Zealand. But two failures as an emergency 50-over opener have clouded the picture, particularly with Liam Livingstone cementing his place with two half centuries in the first two ODIs, the latter a mature and match-winning unbeaten 95 at the Ageas Bowl. Jason Roy needs to prove his fitness after missing the first two 50-over games with a back spasm while Dawid Malan is expected to be back for the third match at the Oval tomorrow after leaving the squad to attend the birth of his second child.

Durham, who have won the County Championship three times, were relegated from the top flight due to financial issues in 2016 and handed a 48-point deduction from the start of the following season. DURHAM ARE GOING UP!!! 💙💛 — Durham Cricket (@DurhamCricket) They have won six of their 12 fixtures this season under head coach Ryan Campbell, losing only once, and need five points from their remaining two matches to clinch the title. Durham’s next County Championship game starts next Tuesday at Worcestershire. Sussex revived their own promotion challenge and dealt Leicestershire’s a blow after dominating day two at Hove, where they bundled the visitors all out for 108. Sussex, who probably need to win their three remaining matches to join Durham in the top flight, reached 234 for five at stumps – a lead of 388 – with Tom Clark top-scoring with 67 and James Coles unbeaten on 43. 📰REPORT: Masood with a brilliant 192 and Revis with three wickets shine on day two as Yorkshire continue to dominate in South Wales. — Yorkshire CCC (@YorkshireCCC) Yorkshire skipper Shan Masood extended his highest score for the county to 192 as he led his side to maximum batting points against Glamorgan at Sophia Gardens. The Pakistani Test star, resuming on 113 with Yorkshire 330 for three overnight, dominated the day once again as his side were all out for 500. Yorkshire then tightened their grip on the game to leave Glamorgan on 150 for six at the close, trailing by 350 runs. Anuj Dal completed career-best figures of six for 69 to launch a determined Derbyshire fightback against Gloucestershire in Bristol. https://x.com/DerbyshireCCC/status/1701294534402121857?s=20 The 27-year-old seamer helped restrict the hosts to 377 all out, from an overnight 333 for six, including a superb catch off his own bowling to dismiss Ollie Price for 132, also a career-best. Derbyshire openers Harry Came (68) and Luis Reece (77) then put on 132 for the first wicket before their side closed on 260 for six. In Division One, Middlesex spinners Josh de Caires and Jayant Yadav shared three wickets to check Lancashire’s progress at Emirates Old Trafford, but Luke Wells’ unbeaten 65 means the home side remain in a dominant position. Replying to the visitors’ 194 all out – Sam Robson made 86 – Lancashire were 132 for three after bad light and rain had wiped out all but seven overs of the evening session. https://x.com/KentCricket/status/1701283987618935149?s=20 Kent spinners Aron Nijjar and Yuzvendra Chahal ripped through Nottinghamshire’s middle order at Canterbury to reduce the visitors to 219 for eight, a deficit of 227. Steven Mullaney and Joe Clarke, who made 86 and 62 respectively, put on a century stand for the third wicket, but Nijjar took a career-best three for 41 and India’s Chahal claimed three for 52. Nottinghamshire had started the day well, taking six for 59 to bowl Kent out for 446 before lunch. Home captain Jack Leaning made 64. Northamptonshire fought back hard after Olly Hannon-Dalby’s career-best seven for 46 put Warwickshire on top at Edgbaston. Hannon-Dalby, who will be on a hat-trick in the second innings, helped reduce Northamptonshire to 250 all out in a match they must win to keep their survival hopes alive before Jack White took three for 37 as Warwickshire closed on 142 for four in reply.","pubDate":"2023-09-11 19:19:34","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/16061804/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4a536493c4a1c55fef5b9a66fffafe3a","title":"Kohli's 47th ODI ton in record India win over Pakistan","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/kohlis-47th-odi-ton-in-record-india-win-over-pakistan-c-11873346","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Writers"],"video_url":null,"description":"India have cruised to a record 228-run win over arch rivals Pakistan in the Asia Cup with both Virat Kohli and KL Rahul starring with unbeaten centuries.","content":"Virat Kohli has hammered his 47th century in one-day internationals as India cruised to a record 228-run win over arch rivals Pakistan to collect crucial points in the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup. Having set a huge target of 357 thanks to the unbeaten tons of both Kohli and KL Rahul, India bowled out their neighbours for 128 in Colombo on Monday, to earn their biggest-ever margin of victory over Pakistan. After bad weather had halted play on Sunday, the game extended to the reserve day and threatened to end in a no result after several more rain interruptions, but India's bowlers did well to bowl out the opposition in 32 overs. Kuldeep Yadav finished with a five-wicket haul as Pakistan struggled against the left-arm wrist spinner. Earlier, Kohli and Rahul were the stars as India amassed 2-356, putting on an unbroken 233 for the third wicket off 194 balls, India's highest partnership for any wicket in the competition. It is also the fourth highest total at Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium, and India's joint-highest ODI total against Pakistan, equalling the 356 scored in Visakhapatnam in 2005. India resumed on 2-147 and soon took complete control. Rahul, back in the side after injury, scored a run-a-ball century, his sixth ODI hundred and the first since March 2021. He finished 111no off 106 balls with 12 fours and two sixes. Kohli did even better as he became the quickest batter to get to 13,000 ODI runs. The previous record holder, Sachin Tendulkar, needed 321 innings to reach the milestone but Kohli got there in 267. His latest ton came off 84 balls and was his fourth consecutive century at the ground. Only Hashim Amla of South Africa had previously scored four successive tons at the same venue, at Centurion. Kohli finished unbeaten on 122 off 94 deliveries with nine fours and three sixes, making Pakistan's formidable bowling attack look fairly toothless, a much different tale to when the teams met in a first-round game in Kandy. Pakistan's bowling was weakened, too, without Haris Rauf. The paceman sent down five overs on Sunday but wasn't available to bowl on Monday due to injury. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka all have one win apiece in the Super Four round, with India top on net run-rate. Bangladesh, the fourth team in the group, have lost both their matches.

Ahead of our 150th Anniversary Heritage Match, and Harry Kane met at the West of Scotland Cricket Club – the site where Scotland and England contested the first ever international match in 1872 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 — Scotland National Team (@ScotlandNT) The game has been billed as the 150th Anniversary Heritage Match, to commemorate the advent of international football on November 30, 1872. At the West of Scotland Cricket Ground in Partick, a Scotland team exclusively made up of Queen’s Park players drew 0-0 with England, whose biggest contingent came from Oxford University. Other clubs represented were Notts County, Sheffield Wednesday, Cambridge University, the 1st Surrey Rifles and the now defunct Hertfordshire Rangers, Barnes and Harrow Chequers. Scotland’s passing game and the English tactic of running with the ball cancelled each other out in front of several thousand supporters. England only lead 48-41 in the 116 meetings between the nations but Scottish wins, as well as the encounters themselves, have become scarcer in recent years. Scotland’s last home win came in the 1985 Rous Cup when Richard Gough headed the only goal, and their most recent victory was a bitter-sweet victory in 1999 when Don Hutchison headed a Wembley winner but England went through to Euro 2000 with a 2-1 play-off aggregate win. England have not lost in the past five meetings but the most recent two games were draws. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Still on 🔝 — Scotland National Team (@ScotlandNT) For probably the first time in the century-and-a-half of the fixture, many Scotland fans will be more concerned with a result elsewhere than what happens at Hampden. Scotland will become the first team to qualify for Euro 2024 if Norway and Georgia draw in Oslo. While the Scotland players will be focused on the task at hand, there might be some roars and celebrations from the home fans regardless of the situation in front of them. Full focus on Scotland: together 👊 — England (@England) England head to Hampden Park on the back of a hard-fought 1-1 draw with Ukraine in front of a partisan crowd in Poland. Gareth Southgate called it a good test in a hostile environment, just as he expects in Mount Florida on Tuesday night. This is England’s first friendly match since March 2022, after a run of 16 competitive matches taking in last year’s Nations League and World Cup before Euro 2024 qualification got under way. But do not expect too many changes as Southgate says it would be “ridiculous” to overly experiment against high-flying Scotland. “We’ve got to find the right balance of physical freshness – we’ve had a day less preparation – experience, finding out about some players, winning, playing well,” he said. England’s development under Southgate has been impressive since he took charge in challenging circumstances in 2016, but there are plenty of questions to answer as next summer’s Euros come into view. Key among them is what to do at centre-back, given trusted lieutenant Harry Maguire’s lack of form and game time at Manchester United. Saturday’s match against Ukraine was his first start for club or country of the season, with Southgate seeing his experience as vital alongside Marc Guehi given John Stones and Tyrone Mings are out injured. Fikayo Tomori and Lewis Dunk are other centre-back options in the squad if Southgate wants to change things up against Scotland, as is uncapped Levi Colwill. The 20-year-old flourished on loan at Brighton and impressed since getting his chance at Chelsea this term. This would be a big occasion to make his debut but a great test for a player some have tipped to be a starter come Germany.","pubDate":"2023-09-11 18:30:41","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17216167/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d5ca4952252ab61e94e8d468d0a993fb","title":"Updated Asia Cup Super 4 Points Table After India's Big Win Over Pakistan","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-updated-asia-cup-2023-super-4-points-table-after-indias-massive-win-4381237","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Check out the updated Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 table after India's massive win over Pakistan -","content":"Kuldeep Yadav registered a five-wicket haul while Virat Kohli and KL Rahul smashed unbeaten centuries as India outplayed Pakistan by 228 runs in the Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 match in Colombo on Monday. The game that started on Sunday but was moved to the reserve day due to rain eventually saw India finishing on a high with the bat as well as the ball. Resuming at the score of 147 for 2 in 24.1 overs on Monday with Kohli and Rahul at the crease, India posted a daunting total of 356 for 2 in 50 overs against Pakistan. Kohli scored 122 not out while Rahul hit unbeaten 111 to steer India to the big total. Only if India's dominance in the game lacked anything, Kuldeep returned with figures of 5 for 25. After the big victory, India rose to the top spot in the Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 table. They have two points to their credit but a superb net run rate (NRR) of +4.560 has put them at helm. On the other hand, Pakistan slipped to the number three spot with an NRR of -1.892. Sri Lanka are at the second spot with an NRR of +0.420 while Bangladesh are at the bottom place in the four-team table with an NRR of -0.749. Here is the updated table: Talking about the game, Kohli's supreme fitness was evident in his 47th ODI century while comeback man Rahul produced an equally engaging ton on comeback as India thrashed a listless Pakistan by record 228-run margin in the rain-marred contest. This is India's biggest win in terms of runs against the cross-border neighbours.

Topley again proved just how potent his left-arm seam, swing and bounce can be with a match-defining spell while taking three wickets in England’s one-day series-levelling victory over New Zealand at the Ageas Bowl. But the injuries that have had such a devastating impact on his career still hang over Topley, 29, as he prepares to make up for lost time at the 50-over World Cup next month. It was in Brisbane ahead of the T20 world tournament last October that Topley tripped on one of the 20 centimetre high ‘Toblerone’ boundary markers during fielding practice ahead of England’s warm-up game against Pakistan . Such was the impact on his 6ft 7in frame that Topley ruptured ligaments and tore some muscles around his left ankle and his World Cup was over before it had begun. Reece Topley has admitted his mental health was affected after he missed last year's T20 World Cup due to injury The England star took three wickets against New Zealand on Sunday - showing how potent his left-arm seam, swing and bounce can be Life did not get any easier after his recovery for a bowler who almost quit the game when he suffered the third of three stress fractures of his back as he dislocated his shoulder during the IPL earlier this year and needed surgery. No wonder, on his return for England after being named in their provisional 15-man World Cup squad, he admits to a certain amount of trepidation as the build-up continues to the start of the tournament in Ahmedabad, also against New Zealand, on Oct 5. ‘You could say I have a bit of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) about getting on the plane again because I was pretty emotional coming back from the last World Cup injured,’ said Topley after England’s 79-run victory in the second one-day international. ‘But injuries happen and it’s just the nature of sport. I still have good and bad days and Sunday was brilliant. As you get older injuries do get harder to come back from and I definitely wouldn’t say I’m out of the jungle in terms of my ankle and shoulder. But it’s a case of doing the right things and hopefully there’s more performances like today.’ Clearly, after spending seven of the last 12 months on the treatment table, there was rust for Topley in the first ODI in Cardiff. But he showed why England rate him so highly in Southampton in finding his rhythm and potency at a crucial stage of the second game. ‘It’s always tricky to ease yourself in when you’re playing professional sport because you get caught up in the emotion of it,’ said Topley. ‘You want to win and you want to play well. The Hundred was part of my recovery process and so is this series. It’s still building and hopefully I’ll be in a good place cricket-wise in India.’ Topley is set to head for India for the upcoming World Cup but claims he is 'not out of the jungle' in terms of his conditioning England's 15-man World Cup squad is still not finalised, with Harry Brook (pictured) trying to earn his place in the team after being left out of the provisional squad Fitness permitting Topley will definitely be in England’s final 15-man squad but Sunday’s victory did little to clear up the uncertainty surrounding the last one or two places. It seemed England would reverse their controversial decision to leave out Harry Brook when he starred in the drawn T20 series against New Zealand. But two failures as an emergency 50-over opener have clouded the picture, particularly with Liam Livingstone cementing his place with two half centuries in the first two ODIs, the latter a mature and match-winning unbeaten 95 at the Ageas Bowl. Jason Roy needs to prove his fitness after missing the first two 50-over games with a back spasm while Dawid Malan is expected to be back for the third match at the Oval tomorrow after leaving the squad to attend the birth of his second child.

Replying to the visitors’ 194 all out – Sam Robson made 86 – Lancashire were 132 for three after bad light and rain had wiped out all but seven overs of the evening session. https://x.com/KentCricket/status/1701283987618935149?s=20 Kent spinners Aron Nijjar and Yuzvendra Chahal ripped through Nottinghamshire’s middle order at Canterbury to reduce the visitors to 219 for eight, a deficit of 227.

Earlier, Kohli and Rahul were the stars as India amassed 2-356, putting on an unbroken 233 for the third wicket off 194 balls, India's highest partnership for any wicket in the competition. It is also the fourth highest total at Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium, and India's joint-highest ODI total against Pakistan, equalling the 356 scored in Visakhapatnam in 2005. India resumed on 2-147 and soon took complete control. Rahul, back in the side after injury, scored a run-a-ball century, his sixth ODI hundred and the first since March 2021. He finished 111no off 106 balls with 12 fours and two sixes. Kohli did even better as he became the quickest batter to get to 13,000 ODI runs. The previous record holder, Sachin Tendulkar, needed 321 innings to reach the milestone but Kohli got there in 267. His latest ton came off 84 balls and was his fourth consecutive century at the ground. Only Hashim Amla of South Africa had previously scored four successive tons at the same venue, at Centurion. Kohli finished unbeaten on 122 off 94 deliveries with nine fours and three sixes, making Pakistan's formidable bowling attack look fairly toothless, a much different tale to when the teams met in a first-round game in Kandy. Pakistan's bowling was weakened, too, without Haris Rauf. The paceman sent down five overs on Sunday but wasn't available to bowl on Monday due to injury. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka all have one win apiece in the Super Four round, with India top on net run-rate. Bangladesh, the fourth team in the group, have lost both their matches.

Ahead of our 150th Anniversary Heritage Match, and Harry Kane met at the West of Scotland Cricket Club – the site where Scotland and England contested the first ever international match in 1872 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 — Scotland National Team (@ScotlandNT) The game has been billed as the 150th Anniversary Heritage Match, to commemorate the advent of international football on November 30, 1872. At the West of Scotland Cricket Ground in Partick, a Scotland team exclusively made up of Queen’s Park players drew 0-0 with England, whose biggest contingent came from Oxford University. Other clubs represented were Notts County, Sheffield Wednesday, Cambridge University, the 1st Surrey Rifles and the now defunct Hertfordshire Rangers, Barnes and Harrow Chequers. Scotland’s passing game and the English tactic of running with the ball cancelled each other out in front of several thousand supporters. England only lead 48-41 in the 116 meetings between the nations but Scottish wins, as well as the encounters themselves, have become scarcer in recent years. Scotland’s last home win came in the 1985 Rous Cup when Richard Gough headed the only goal, and their most recent victory was a bitter-sweet victory in 1999 when Don Hutchison headed a Wembley winner but England went through to Euro 2000 with a 2-1 play-off aggregate win. England have not lost in the past five meetings but the most recent two games were draws. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Still on 🔝 — Scotland National Team (@ScotlandNT) For probably the first time in the century-and-a-half of the fixture, many Scotland fans will be more concerned with a result elsewhere than what happens at Hampden. Scotland will become the first team to qualify for Euro 2024 if Norway and Georgia draw in Oslo. While the Scotland players will be focused on the task at hand, there might be some roars and celebrations from the home fans regardless of the situation in front of them. Full focus on Scotland: together 👊 — England (@England) England head to Hampden Park on the back of a hard-fought 1-1 draw with Ukraine in front of a partisan crowd in Poland. Gareth Southgate called it a good test in a hostile environment, just as he expects in Mount Florida on Tuesday night. This is England’s first friendly match since March 2022, after a run of 16 competitive matches taking in last year’s Nations League and World Cup before Euro 2024 qualification got under way. But do not expect too many changes as Southgate says it would be “ridiculous” to overly experiment against high-flying Scotland. “We’ve got to find the right balance of physical freshness – we’ve had a day less preparation – experience, finding out about some players, winning, playing well,” he said. England’s development under Southgate has been impressive since he took charge in challenging circumstances in 2016, but there are plenty of questions to answer as next summer’s Euros come into view. Key among them is what to do at centre-back, given trusted lieutenant Harry Maguire’s lack of form and game time at Manchester United. Saturday’s match against Ukraine was his first start for club or country of the season, with Southgate seeing his experience as vital alongside Marc Guehi given John Stones and Tyrone Mings are out injured. Fikayo Tomori and Lewis Dunk are other centre-back options in the squad if Southgate wants to change things up against Scotland, as is uncapped Levi Colwill. The 20-year-old flourished on loan at Brighton and impressed since getting his chance at Chelsea this term. This would be a big occasion to make his debut but a great test for a player some have tipped to be a starter come Germany.","pubDate":"2023-09-11 18:30:41","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17216167/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d5ca4952252ab61e94e8d468d0a993fb","title":"Updated Asia Cup Super 4 Points Table After India's Big Win Over Pakistan","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-updated-asia-cup-2023-super-4-points-table-after-indias-massive-win-4381237","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Check out the updated Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 table after India's massive win over Pakistan -","content":"Kuldeep Yadav registered a five-wicket haul while Virat Kohli and KL Rahul smashed unbeaten centuries as India outplayed Pakistan by 228 runs in the Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 match in Colombo on Monday. The game that started on Sunday but was moved to the reserve day due to rain eventually saw India finishing on a high with the bat as well as the ball. Resuming at the score of 147 for 2 in 24.1 overs on Monday with Kohli and Rahul at the crease, India posted a daunting total of 356 for 2 in 50 overs against Pakistan. Kohli scored 122 not out while Rahul hit unbeaten 111 to steer India to the big total. Only if India's dominance in the game lacked anything, Kuldeep returned with figures of 5 for 25. After the big victory, India rose to the top spot in the Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 table. They have two points to their credit but a superb net run rate (NRR) of +4.560 has put them at helm. On the other hand, Pakistan slipped to the number three spot with an NRR of -1.892. Sri Lanka are at the second spot with an NRR of +0.420 while Bangladesh are at the bottom place in the four-team table with an NRR of -0.749. Here is the updated table: Talking about the game, Kohli's supreme fitness was evident in his 47th ODI century while comeback man Rahul produced an equally engaging ton on comeback as India thrashed a listless Pakistan by record 228-run margin in the rain-marred contest. This is India's biggest win in terms of runs against the cross-border neighbours. India posted an imposing 356 for 2, as Kohli (122 not out off 94 balls) and Rahul (111 not out off 106 balls), which was his sixth ODI hundred, pummelled a hapless Pakistan, whose chase ended at 128 for 8 as Kuldeep Yadav (5/25) scythed through them.

Meanwhile, India will take the field for the third consecutive day as they take on Sri Lanka in Colombo on September 12 (Tuesday).","pubDate":"2023-09-11 17:49:48","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2023/09/11/6dd73ae1f54bf1989e181cee4ff9042e1694454382546625_original.jpg","source_id":"abplive","source_priority":10959,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d475cd3e791ebcd1449b57873a1542dc","title":"England cricket star Reece Topley admits his mental health suffered after injury forced him out of the T20 World Cup last year - and claims he is 'not out of the jungle' as he looks to be fit for next month's tournament","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12505581/England-cricket-star-Reece-Topley-admits-mental-health-suffered-injury-forced-T20-World-Cup-year-claims-not-jungle-looks-fit-months-tournament.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PAUL NEWMAN: Topley again proved just how potent his left-arm seam, swing and bounce can be with a match-defining spell while taking three wickets against New Zealand at the Ageas Bowl.","content":"England cricket star Reece Topley admits his mental health suffered after injury forced him out of the T20 World Cup last year - and claims he is 'not out of the jungle' as he looks to be fit for next month's tournament England star Reece Topley has opened up on his mental health struggles Injury forced Topley out of the 2022 T20 World Cup, leaving him devastated He said he has 'PTSD' about going to India and is 'not out of the jungle' yet By Paul Newman for the Daily Mail Published: 18:03 BST, 11 September 2023 | Updated: 22:27 BST, 11 September 2023 e-mail 1 View comments Reece Topley admits his mental health suffered after he was forced home on the brink of the last World Cup with a freak injury and is still ‘not out of the jungle’ as he contemplates heading for India with England for the next one. Topley again proved just how potent his left-arm seam, swing and bounce can be with a match-defining spell while taking three wickets in England’s one-day series-levelling victory over New Zealand at the Ageas Bowl. But the injuries that have had such a devastating impact on his career still hang over Topley, 29, as he prepares to make up for lost time at the 50-over World Cup next month. It was in Brisbane ahead of the T20 world tournament last October that Topley tripped on one of the 20 centimetre high ‘Toblerone’ boundary markers during fielding practice ahead of England’s warm-up game against Pakistan . Such was the impact on his 6ft 7in frame that Topley ruptured ligaments and tore some muscles around his left ankle and his World Cup was over before it had begun. Reece Topley has admitted his mental health was affected after he missed last year's T20 World Cup due to injury The England star took three wickets against New Zealand on Sunday - showing how potent his left-arm seam, swing and bounce can be Life did not get any easier after his recovery for a bowler who almost quit the game when he suffered the third of three stress fractures of his back as he dislocated his shoulder during the IPL earlier this year and needed surgery. No wonder, on his return for England after being named in their provisional 15-man World Cup squad, he admits to a certain amount of trepidation as the build-up continues to the start of the tournament in Ahmedabad, also against New Zealand, on Oct 5. ‘You could say I have a bit of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) about getting on the plane again because I was pretty emotional coming back from the last World Cup injured,’ said Topley after England’s 79-run victory in the second one-day international. ‘But injuries happen and it’s just the nature of sport. I still have good and bad days and Sunday was brilliant. As you get older injuries do get harder to come back from and I definitely wouldn’t say I’m out of the jungle in terms of my ankle and shoulder. But it’s a case of doing the right things and hopefully there’s more performances like today.’ Clearly, after spending seven of the last 12 months on the treatment table, there was rust for Topley in the first ODI in Cardiff. But he showed why England rate him so highly in Southampton in finding his rhythm and potency at a crucial stage of the second game. ‘It’s always tricky to ease yourself in when you’re playing professional sport because you get caught up in the emotion of it,’ said Topley. ‘You want to win and you want to play well. The Hundred was part of my recovery process and so is this series. It’s still building and hopefully I’ll be in a good place cricket-wise in India.’ Topley is set to head for India for the upcoming World Cup but claims he is 'not out of the jungle' in terms of his conditioning England's 15-man World Cup squad is still not finalised, with Harry Brook (pictured) trying to earn his place in the team after being left out of the provisional squad Fitness permitting Topley will definitely be in England’s final 15-man squad but Sunday’s victory did little to clear up the uncertainty surrounding the last one or two places. It seemed England would reverse their controversial decision to leave out Harry Brook when he starred in the drawn T20 series against New Zealand. But two failures as an emergency 50-over opener have clouded the picture, particularly with Liam Livingstone cementing his place with two half centuries in the first two ODIs, the latter a mature and match-winning unbeaten 95 at the Ageas Bowl. Jason Roy needs to prove his fitness after missing the first two 50-over games with a back spasm while Dawid Malan is expected to be back for the third match at the Oval tomorrow after leaving the squad to attend the birth of his second child.

Durham, who have won the County Championship three times, were relegated from the top flight due to financial issues in 2016 and handed a 48-point deduction from the start of the following season. DURHAM ARE GOING UP!!! 💙💛 — Durham Cricket (@DurhamCricket) They have won six of their 12 fixtures this season under head coach Ryan Campbell, losing only once, and need five points from their remaining two matches to clinch the title. Durham’s next County Championship game starts next Tuesday at Worcestershire. Sussex revived their own promotion challenge and dealt Leicestershire’s a blow after dominating day two at Hove, where they bundled the visitors all out for 108. Sussex, who probably need to win their three remaining matches to join Durham in the top flight, reached 234 for five at stumps – a lead of 388 – with Tom Clark top-scoring with 67 and James Coles unbeaten on 43. 📰REPORT: Masood with a brilliant 192 and Revis with three wickets shine on day two as Yorkshire continue to dominate in South Wales. — Yorkshire CCC (@YorkshireCCC) Yorkshire skipper Shan Masood extended his highest score for the county to 192 as he led his side to maximum batting points against Glamorgan at Sophia Gardens. The Pakistani Test star, resuming on 113 with Yorkshire 330 for three overnight, dominated the day once again as his side were all out for 500. Yorkshire then tightened their grip on the game to leave Glamorgan on 150 for six at the close, trailing by 350 runs. Anuj Dal completed career-best figures of six for 69 to launch a determined Derbyshire fightback against Gloucestershire in Bristol. https://x.com/DerbyshireCCC/status/1701294534402121857?s=20 The 27-year-old seamer helped restrict the hosts to 377 all out, from an overnight 333 for six, including a superb catch off his own bowling to dismiss Ollie Price for 132, also a career-best. Derbyshire openers Harry Came (68) and Luis Reece (77) then put on 132 for the first wicket before their side closed on 260 for six. In Division One, Middlesex spinners Josh de Caires and Jayant Yadav shared three wickets to check Lancashire’s progress at Emirates Old Trafford, but Luke Wells’ unbeaten 65 means the home side remain in a dominant position. Replying to the visitors’ 194 all out – Sam Robson made 86 – Lancashire were 132 for three after bad light and rain had wiped out all but seven overs of the evening session. https://x.com/KentCricket/status/1701283987618935149?s=20 Kent spinners Aron Nijjar and Yuzvendra Chahal ripped through Nottinghamshire’s middle order at Canterbury to reduce the visitors to 219 for eight, a deficit of 227. Steven Mullaney and Joe Clarke, who made 86 and 62 respectively, put on a century stand for the third wicket, but Nijjar took a career-best three for 41 and India’s Chahal claimed three for 52. Nottinghamshire had started the day well, taking six for 59 to bowl Kent out for 446 before lunch. Home captain Jack Leaning made 64. Northamptonshire fought back hard after Olly Hannon-Dalby’s career-best seven for 46 put Warwickshire on top at Edgbaston. Hannon-Dalby, who will be on a hat-trick in the second innings, helped reduce Northamptonshire to 250 all out in a match they must win to keep their survival hopes alive before Jack White took three for 37 as Warwickshire closed on 142 for four in reply.","pubDate":"2023-09-11 19:19:34","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/16061804/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4a536493c4a1c55fef5b9a66fffafe3a","title":"Kohli's 47th ODI ton in record India win over Pakistan","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/kohlis-47th-odi-ton-in-record-india-win-over-pakistan-c-11873346","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Writers"],"video_url":null,"description":"India have cruised to a record 228-run win over arch rivals Pakistan in the Asia Cup with both Virat Kohli and KL Rahul starring with unbeaten centuries.","content":"Virat Kohli has hammered his 47th century in one-day internationals as India cruised to a record 228-run win over arch rivals Pakistan to collect crucial points in the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup. Having set a huge target of 357 thanks to the unbeaten tons of both Kohli and KL Rahul, India bowled out their neighbours for 128 in Colombo on Monday, to earn their biggest-ever margin of victory over Pakistan. After bad weather had halted play on Sunday, the game extended to the reserve day and threatened to end in a no result after several more rain interruptions, but India's bowlers did well to bowl out the opposition in 32 overs. Kuldeep Yadav finished with a five-wicket haul as Pakistan struggled against the left-arm wrist spinner. Earlier, Kohli and Rahul were the stars as India amassed 2-356, putting on an unbroken 233 for the third wicket off 194 balls, India's highest partnership for any wicket in the competition. It is also the fourth highest total at Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium, and India's joint-highest ODI total against Pakistan, equalling the 356 scored in Visakhapatnam in 2005. India resumed on 2-147 and soon took complete control. Rahul, back in the side after injury, scored a run-a-ball century, his sixth ODI hundred and the first since March 2021. He finished 111no off 106 balls with 12 fours and two sixes. Kohli did even better as he became the quickest batter to get to 13,000 ODI runs. The previous record holder, Sachin Tendulkar, needed 321 innings to reach the milestone but Kohli got there in 267. His latest ton came off 84 balls and was his fourth consecutive century at the ground. Only Hashim Amla of South Africa had previously scored four successive tons at the same venue, at Centurion. Kohli finished unbeaten on 122 off 94 deliveries with nine fours and three sixes, making Pakistan's formidable bowling attack look fairly toothless, a much different tale to when the teams met in a first-round game in Kandy. Pakistan's bowling was weakened, too, without Haris Rauf. The paceman sent down five overs on Sunday but wasn't available to bowl on Monday due to injury. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka all have one win apiece in the Super Four round, with India top on net run-rate. Bangladesh, the fourth team in the group, have lost both their matches.

Ahead of our 150th Anniversary Heritage Match, and Harry Kane met at the West of Scotland Cricket Club – the site where Scotland and England contested the first ever international match in 1872 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 — Scotland National Team (@ScotlandNT) The game has been billed as the 150th Anniversary Heritage Match, to commemorate the advent of international football on November 30, 1872. At the West of Scotland Cricket Ground in Partick, a Scotland team exclusively made up of Queen’s Park players drew 0-0 with England, whose biggest contingent came from Oxford University. Other clubs represented were Notts County, Sheffield Wednesday, Cambridge University, the 1st Surrey Rifles and the now defunct Hertfordshire Rangers, Barnes and Harrow Chequers. Scotland’s passing game and the English tactic of running with the ball cancelled each other out in front of several thousand supporters. England only lead 48-41 in the 116 meetings between the nations but Scottish wins, as well as the encounters themselves, have become scarcer in recent years. Scotland’s last home win came in the 1985 Rous Cup when Richard Gough headed the only goal, and their most recent victory was a bitter-sweet victory in 1999 when Don Hutchison headed a Wembley winner but England went through to Euro 2000 with a 2-1 play-off aggregate win. England have not lost in the past five meetings but the most recent two games were draws. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Still on 🔝 — Scotland National Team (@ScotlandNT) For probably the first time in the century-and-a-half of the fixture, many Scotland fans will be more concerned with a result elsewhere than what happens at Hampden. Scotland will become the first team to qualify for Euro 2024 if Norway and Georgia draw in Oslo. While the Scotland players will be focused on the task at hand, there might be some roars and celebrations from the home fans regardless of the situation in front of them. Full focus on Scotland: together 👊 — England (@England) England head to Hampden Park on the back of a hard-fought 1-1 draw with Ukraine in front of a partisan crowd in Poland. Gareth Southgate called it a good test in a hostile environment, just as he expects in Mount Florida on Tuesday night. This is England’s first friendly match since March 2022, after a run of 16 competitive matches taking in last year’s Nations League and World Cup before Euro 2024 qualification got under way. But do not expect too many changes as Southgate says it would be “ridiculous” to overly experiment against high-flying Scotland. “We’ve got to find the right balance of physical freshness – we’ve had a day less preparation – experience, finding out about some players, winning, playing well,” he said. England’s development under Southgate has been impressive since he took charge in challenging circumstances in 2016, but there are plenty of questions to answer as next summer’s Euros come into view. Key among them is what to do at centre-back, given trusted lieutenant Harry Maguire’s lack of form and game time at Manchester United. Saturday’s match against Ukraine was his first start for club or country of the season, with Southgate seeing his experience as vital alongside Marc Guehi given John Stones and Tyrone Mings are out injured. Fikayo Tomori and Lewis Dunk are other centre-back options in the squad if Southgate wants to change things up against Scotland, as is uncapped Levi Colwill. The 20-year-old flourished on loan at Brighton and impressed since getting his chance at Chelsea this term. This would be a big occasion to make his debut but a great test for a player some have tipped to be a starter come Germany.","pubDate":"2023-09-11 18:30:41","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17216167/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d5ca4952252ab61e94e8d468d0a993fb","title":"Updated Asia Cup Super 4 Points Table After India's Big Win Over Pakistan","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-updated-asia-cup-2023-super-4-points-table-after-indias-massive-win-4381237","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Check out the updated Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 table after India's massive win over Pakistan -","content":"Kuldeep Yadav registered a five-wicket haul while Virat Kohli and KL Rahul smashed unbeaten centuries as India outplayed Pakistan by 228 runs in the Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 match in Colombo on Monday. The game that started on Sunday but was moved to the reserve day due to rain eventually saw India finishing on a high with the bat as well as the ball. Resuming at the score of 147 for 2 in 24.1 overs on Monday with Kohli and Rahul at the crease, India posted a daunting total of 356 for 2 in 50 overs against Pakistan. Kohli scored 122 not out while Rahul hit unbeaten 111 to steer India to the big total. Only if India's dominance in the game lacked anything, Kuldeep returned with figures of 5 for 25. After the big victory, India rose to the top spot in the Asia Cup 2023 Super 4 table. They have two points to their credit but a superb net run rate (NRR) of +4.560 has put them at helm. On the other hand, Pakistan slipped to the number three spot with an NRR of -1.892. Sri Lanka are at the second spot with an NRR of +0.420 while Bangladesh are at the bottom place in the four-team table with an NRR of -0.749. Here is the updated table: Talking about the game, Kohli's supreme fitness was evident in his 47th ODI century while comeback man Rahul produced an equally engaging ton on comeback as India thrashed a listless Pakistan by record 228-run margin in the rain-marred contest. This is India's biggest win in terms of runs against the cross-border neighbours.
