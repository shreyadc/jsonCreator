According to a PCB statement, the 69th meeting of the PCB Board of Governors, second of the calendar year, took place yesterday at the National High Performance Centre under the chairmanship of Ramiz Raja. The BoG approved an operational activity-based annual budget for its 2022-23 fiscal year. “The PCB has budgeted a total spend of PKR15billion, with approximately 78 per cent allocated for cricket-related activities. This includes enhanced central contracts for men’s and women’s cricketers, men’s and women’s international and domestic cricket events in the 2022-23 cricket season with additional local tournaments and matches, the HBL Pakistan Super League 8 and the inaugural Pakistan Junior League,” the board said in a statement. “In addition to the operational budget, and looking ahead to the ACC 50-over Asia Cup 2023 and the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 that will be held in Pakistan, the BoG approved an allocation of funds for the upgradation of the infrastructure and stadia, which includes floodlights, replay screens, player dressing rooms and new spectator chairs. “The BoG, as part of its duty of care towards its staff, also approved management’s recommendation of introducing schooling allowance for lower staff to support their children’s education,” said the statement. The statement further said that as part of demarcation of CCAs, the BoG has also given approval of Affiliation Regulations. “The BoG approved amendments to the City Cricket Associations’ territorial jurisdictions in line with geographical demarcations, and also approved affiliation regulations to be complied with for future City Cricket Associations to be recognised. “According to the approved amendments, Balochistan will have 13 districts, Central Punjab will have 18 districts, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will have 19 districts, Northern will have 11 districts, Sindh will have 17 districts and Southern Punjab will have 14 districts.” The BoG appreciated the 81 per cent increase in media and sponsorship revenues. The BoG approved the concept of building additional rooms as player residences in Lahore, Karachi and Multan. The PCB Chairman provided an update on the Pakistan Junior League, which will be held in Lahore in October. The BoG was informed of the keen interest amongst the commercial partners as well as the ICC Member Boards, who have expressed their support by agreeing to release their players. “The BoG expressed their delight with the Chairman’s decision to increase the pensions of former Test cricketers, under the PCB Players’ Welfare Policy,” the statement added. “The BoG noted with satisfaction that 314 matches in 12 national tournaments were held in the 2021-22 domestic season. This helped domestic players earn between PKR3.7million to PKR5million through the PCB Domestic Player Contracts. This was in addition to the over 200 former cricketers, who are presently employed by the PCB in various roles, including administrative and coaching roles. “The BoG received an update on the ongoing club scrutiny, which is being carried out by the renowned international audit firm, KPMG.”","pubDate":"2022-06-25 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Raja asserts he will stay as PCB head","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/968991-raja-asserts-he-will-stay-as-pcb-head","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Ramiz Raja has rubbished rumours of being sacked and claimed that he would continue to lead Pakistan cricket.Speaking at a press conference, Raja also made it clear that he wants to continue in the top post, saying his contact with Imran Khan was cut off...","content":"LAHORE: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Ramiz Raja has rubbished rumours of being sacked and claimed that he would continue to lead Pakistan cricket. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ Speaking at a press conference, Raja also made it clear that he wants to continue in the top post, saying his contact with Imran Khan was cut off after he was removed as the prime minister. “Imran Bhai cut off contact with me.

Shehbaz recently also held meetings with three former Chairman of the board, Khalid Mahmood, Zaka Ashraf and Najam Sethi. “We can’t live around speculations. I believe there is a need for continuity,” said Raja. “It’s been two months now. If something had to happen it would have happened by now. Look unless you give continuity a chance nothing will improve in Pakistan cricket,” he said. “The PM is our in-charge and I have put in a request to meet him and brief him on what we are doing and our plans for the future,” Raja said. He said that his goal is to improve cricket in Pakistan and that good work should not be disregarded. “There is no ego issue here, we just want to improve Pakistan cricket. If the constitution allows a change, fine, but you should not undo the good work,” he said. “If we can achieve well-defined goals at the same time, why change? What I have seen is that we need to have corrections in our cricket,” he added. “It is the Patron-in-chief’s call but I think performance speaks for itself and if fans are with you it becomes difficult to make decisions,” he said.","pubDate":"2022-06-25 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Nadeem appointed director of Pakistan Junior League","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/968989-nadeem-appointed-director-of-pakistan-junior-league","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board has appointed former Test cricketer and Director National High Performance Centre Nadeem Khan as the director of the Pakistan Junior League .It has also been learnt that the PCB has also contacted different cricket bodies to rope in foreign players for Junior...","content":"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has appointed former Test cricketer and Director National High Performance Centre (NHPC) Nadeem Khan as the director of the Pakistan Junior League (PJL). .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ It has also been learnt that the PCB has also contacted different cricket bodies to rope in foreign players for Junior League.

But replying to Test world champions New Zealand’s first innings 329, England lost six wickets within 12 overs at Headingley, most of them due to good bowling rather than cavalier batting. Left-hander Alex Less, dropped in the slips off the first ball of the innings, was bowled by a superb Boult leg-cutter four balls later. Ollie Pope, fresh from a hundred in the second Test at Trent Bridge, was also cleaned up by Boult to leave England 14-2. The out-of-form Crawley was next to fall, bowled middle stump by Boult before Tim Southee had star batsman Joe Root caught behind for five on his Yorkshire home ground. That left England 21-4 and although skipper Stokes counter-attacked by going down the pitch to drive Southee for six, he could only chip recalled left-arm quick Neil Wagner to mid-off trying to play a similar shot. And when wicketkeeper Ben Foakes was plumb lbw to Wagner for nought, England were 55-6 from 11.5 overs.

In a season that started in September (since the time Ramiz Raja took over), Pakistan played 24 matches and won 18, losing four and drawing the other two. The total success ratio of the national team is 75 percent, more than any other team in the world. India comes next as the team played 32 matches, won 22, and lost nine, and drew the remaining one. India’s success ratio is 68.75. Surprisingly, Afghanistan occupy the third spot, winning 13 out of 19 they played and losing the remaining. South Africa come next, winning 19 of the 28 matches the team played and losing nine others. Australia occupy the fifth spot in the success ratio chart, winning 20 of the 30 matches they played, losing seven and drawing the other three. Australia’s success ratio is 66.67. Ireland, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, England, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and West Indies come next on the ladder. All have less than a 60 percent winning ratio. Commenting on the team’s progress, Ramiz said that the national team has progressed by leaps and bounds during the last eight months. The moment Pakistan defeated India fair and square in the World Cup T20 opener, the Pakistan team becomes a hotcake around the world. “We now have a team under the leadership of Babar Azam. Fans around the world wait for months to see the Greenshirts in action. We have been receiving an unprecedented response from everywhere and on every front. Be it from a cricketing angle or from the commercial point of view, there is no matching Pakistan. The credit definitely goes to the entire team. Babar Azam’s ability to lead the team has seen tremendous progress. “He is fully in charge and calling all the shots. He has grown in confidence and has performed outstandingly as a player and as a captain. The team under him is giving a united look.”","pubDate":"2022-06-25 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Special moment' as home crowd thanks Aussie cricketers","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/news-australia-defeat-sri-lanka-in-fifth-odi-crowd-scenes/f31dcc5d-9f52-40e1-a4ed-2c21ffc162e4","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia took a consolation win in the fifth one-day international against Sri Lanka with a four-wicket victory.","content":"Australia took a consolation win in the fifth one-day international against Sri Lanka with a four-wicket victory. Sri Lanka won the series 3-2 . Chasing a target of 161 in the dead rubber at Colombo’s R.

Carey added 51 runs for the fifth wicket with Marnus Labuschagne and then finished the game off by adding a further 43 runs for the unbroken seventh wicket with Cameron Green , who was unbeaten on 25. Sri Lanka’s spinners kept striking at regular intervals on a spin-friendly wicket but knew they were playing catchup in defending a low total. “I thought the series was very hard-fought ... They played conditions better and they deserved to win the series,\" Australia captain Aaron Finch said. \"Most of us got starts but we couldn’t get partnerships going. We saw that from Sri Lanka. We had 40 and 50 partnerships while they managed big ones. That was the difference.” After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, the hosts were out for 160 in 43.1 overs. It could have been a lot worse for Sri Lanka without the ninth-wicket partnership between Chamika Karunaratne and debutant Pramod Madushan which was worth 58 runs. The pair came together on 8-85 and Sri Lanka was in danger of being bowled out for its lowest total against Australia (91) and the lowest total at the venue (98). However, Karunaratne and Madushan helped the team to rebuild and gave the capacity crowd something to cheer. Some fans wore yellow jerseys to thank the Australian team who toured the island amid uncertainty owing to the economic crisis and political instability. The visitors did a lap of honour after the game as the crowd chanted, “Australia, Australia, Australia.” Karunaratne posted his first half-century in international cricket and was the last man dismissed for a run-a-ball 75 with eight fours and two sixes. The sixes were off successive deliveries from part-time legspinner Labuschagne. Apart from Karunaratne, none of the Sri Lanka batters posted a decent score. At one stage Sri Lanka lost four wickets in the space of seven deliveries for the addition of just six runs. That sealed their fate. Sri Lanka missed the services of Dhananjaya de Silva, the hero of the series-clinching game four , as he was unwell. The tour is all square heading into the two-match Test series, with Australia winning the T20 format 2-1 and Sri Lanka taking the ODI portion. “It’s disappointing that we couldn’t pull it off today but really proud of the team for the way we fought back, especially the young players,” Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka said. “It was the momentum that we took from the last T20 game. That set the tone for the ODIs. Our batsmen delivered and even when they didn’t our bowlers kept fighting.” The first Test begins on Wednesday in Galle.

Bairstow ran 40 yards past the stumps to celebrate his tenth Test ton and milked the cheers from his home Yorkshire crowd at Headingley. He said: “I don’t think I’ve surprised myself because there have been glimpses - look at some of the knocks I’ve played in four-day cricket. This is the way I’ve always been capable of playing. “When you come in after wickets have fallen, there are different ways of looking at it. \"You can either go into your shell and bat the way people have done for years and years by trying to survive. “But you need to transfer the momentum, take bowlers like Trent Boult and Tim Southee off their lengths. \"They were hitting their straps, conditions were in their favour. “We’re only a few games into the new regime so it’s too early to say we’re redefining Test cricket . \"But we’re definitely looking at things in a different way, going out and expressing ourselves, taking the positive option, taking the game forward and hopefully playing in ways that can change games. “Everyone knows this is my home and I love the history that comes with playing for Yorkshire for a long time. I’ve been fortunate to have some really good times here. “The atmosphere was amazing and I guess the celebration was my personality coming out.

Read full story","content":"LEEDS (Reuters) - Jonny Bairstow says England’s new desire to play test cricket \"different to the norm\" gave him the confidence to launch his brutal assault on New Zealand’s bowlers and wrestle back the momentum on the second day of the third test at Headingley. England were in trouble at 55 for six in reply to New Zealand’s first innings score of 329 before Bairstow and debutant pace bowler Jamie Overton (89 not out) put on an unbeaten seventh wicket stand of 209 in 223 balls. Their heroics have left the hosts trailing by 65 runs. Bairstow is unbeaten on 130, his second century in as many innings and the 10th of his test career. He says the new culture of positive cricket in the team has been the catalyst for his superb form. \"I am excited about the journey we are embarking on as a team,\" Bairstow told Sky Sports. \"For Jamie to come in and play the way he did on his debut and under pressure, to have the confidence against a very good New Zealand attack, was quite exceptional. \"We want to play test cricket in a way that is perhaps different to the norm. But it is also a case of putting pressure back on (opponents). If you just sit there, in England you know there is a ball there waiting for you (to get you out). Don’t just be a sitting duck. \"Sometimes it's a simple game that we complicate. We want to allow people to express themselves and that will bring the best out of them.\" Bairstow says the backing he has been given by new head coach Brendon McCullum to play his natural attacking game, no matter the match situation, has made him more relaxed at the crease. \"I am pleased with where my game’s at. The way I’m striking the ball,\" he said. \"Sometimes there is a lot of rubbish spoken about different things. Sometimes it gets into your mind and clutters it. You have to listen to the people that matter to you and that’s what I'm doing. \"Brendan just said to me, ‘Go and impose yourself on the game’. It is an exciting way of playing.\" (Reporting by Nick Said; Editing by Ken Ferris)","pubDate":"2022-06-24 18:52:00","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/06/25/1635669.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my","country":["malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England cricket coaching staff 2022: England cricket coach and other support staff Test cricket","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-england-cricket-coaching-staff-2022-england-cricket-coach-and-other-support-staff-test-cricket/","keywords":["Cricket","ECB","England"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"England cricket coaching staff 2022: The England men’s Test Cricket team have began a new era under head coach Brendon McCullum.

The England men’s Test Cricket side under the new captain-coach duo of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum had began their respective journeys in quite some style by registering a resounding 5-wicket victory against New Zealand at the iconic Lord’s. While the aforementioned victory was England’s first after nine Tests, they followed it up by registering their highest successful run-chase at the Trent Bridge, with Stokes even terming the victory as the best in his Cricketing journey so far. The positive results for the English side have come after an extended patch of poor returns in the format, with former skipper Joe Root managing to register just one win off his last 17 Tests as England captain. The recent appointments have taken place after Robert Key was elected as the Managing Director of England men’s Cricket. While Brendon Mccullum was roped in as the Test side’s head coach, former Australian women’s head coach Matthew Mott was appointed the the team’s coach in the One-Day format around a month ago. In fact in the ODI format as well, England under Mott, in his very first series as head coach against the Netherlands, registered a 3-0 clean sweep. Moreover, while England not only went on to register their highest ODI score ever in the aforementioned series, they also broke their own record of hitting the maximum Sixes in an ODI match.

England batter Jonny Bairstow and debutant pacer Jamie Overton have entered the record books on the back of their unbeaten 209-run seventh-wicket partnership on the second day of the third Test against New Zealand in Leeds today. Brought together at the crease by a terrible display of batting in the afternoon session, Bairstow and Overton rescued England from 55/6 to end the day at 264/6 in 49 overs. In complete tatters at one point in time today, England not only managed to avoid the follow-on but now also stand a chance to gain a first-innings lead at the Headingley tomorrow. The fact that Bairstow and Overton consumed only 223 deliveries to score the number of runs they scored is a primary reason why England have been able to stage yet another dramatic comeback in this series. Bairstow, who brought up a 10th Test century before Stumps, walked back to the pavilion after scoring 130* (126) with the help of 21 fours at a strike rate of 103.17. Overton, on the other hand, is on the brink of a maiden century in his first-ever international match. In spite of not having a batting reputation unlike his twin brother Craig , Overton batted splendidly well to score 89* (106) including 12 fours and two sixes.

Some 48 hours later, through another swashbuckling century from Jonny Bairstow and debutant Jamie Overton’s unbeaten 89, it became apparent the new captain was deadly serious. England had crumbled to 55 for six inside 12 overs after lunch on day two, having earlier seen New Zealand post 329 through another commanding 109 from Daryl Mitchell. For all the recent talk of playing “sexy cricket” from their head coach, Brendon McCullum, the hosts appeared to be suffering from, ahem, performance issues as Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Neil Wagner got the cherry-ripe Dukes ball to talk dirty. England v New Zealand: third Test, day two – live! Read more But in a febrile second half to proceedings, as the expected rain stayed away, a well-oiled capacity crowd at Headingley was treated to a breathtaking counterattack from Bairstow and Overton. The pair plundered 209 runs in just 37.1 overs for England’s all-time highest seventh wicket stand, Bairstow walking off unbeaten on 130 from 126 balls and the score a far healthier 264 for six. Entertainment? You betcha. This was Bairstow’s 10th Test century and his fourth in seven matches, brought up half an hour before the close from just 95 balls as he punched Boult down the ground for his 15th four and soaked up the love from his adoring home crowd. The Yorkshireman’s 136 at Trent Bridge last week was billed as the innings of his life but here was another to rival it, the ball repeatedly whistling along the outfield. Overton was no slouch either, if a touch more agricultural on occasions, using all of his 6ft 5in frame to muscle the ball either across or over the boundary rope. He had earlier been slightly misused by Stokes in a bumper plan to New Zealand’s tail but was in his element with the bat. The 28-year-old will resume first thing needing just 11 runs to become the 21st England player to make a century on Test debut. Jamie Overton is 89 not out overnight after a remarkable first Test innings. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images This scenario could easily not have been, Overton handed a life on five as Kane Williamson opted not to send a thwarted lbw appeal from Wagner upstairs. Had the New Zealand captain done so, England would have been 63 for seven. Overton made better use of the review system soon after too, given out caught behind on 13 and vindicated when the replays showed daylight between bat and ball. Bairstow similarly had a reprieve along the way, Wagner putting down a tough caught and bowled chance when the No 5 was on 27. Neither batter was remotely ruffled, instead pressing down on the pedal with a blaze of boundaries that swiftly softened the ball and exposed a New Zealand attack that consists of three frontline seamers and a part-time spinner in Michael Bracewell. England are still 65 runs behind but, by way of disposition as the two sides walked off, they are in the ascendancy. On another day a morning of 100 runs, three wickets, two dropped catches, a third successive Test century for Mitchell – brought up with a booming six down the ground off Jack Leach – and a DRS malfunction might have gone down as eventful . But compared to what followed, as Boult and co ran through England’s top seven like a dose of Senokot washed down with a pint of Samuel Smith’s, and the hosts then delivered their jaw-dropping prison break, this was the sedate part of the day. There was a sense that things may start to accelerate after lunch, however, England following their eventual removal of Mitchell before the break by wrapping up the last two New Zealand in the space of 10 balls. Leach completed his maiden five-wicket haul at home – figures of five for 100 from 38.3 overs rewarding his endeavours – and it was time, to pinch a phrase from Rob Key, for the spectators to buckle up. Boult, the world’s most prolific No 11, had been left spurned on nought not out and so channelled this into a sublime exhibition of left-arm swing that saw England’s top three all clean bowled. Alex Lees fell in the first over, failing to capitalise on a drop by Mitchell at slip second ball and playing back to one that trimmed his off stump, with Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley, the two right-handers, then both playing around deliveries that swung in and through the gate to elicit the dreaded death rattle. None of these three ruinous dismissals could exactly be filed under ‘Baz Ball’, nor Joe Root making it a fourth single-figure score of the session and 21 for four when, after surviving a run out chance, he fell caught behind to Southee. Chiefly the situation reflected the clinical excellence of Boult, hooping the Dukes ball like a sorcerer, even if the footwork from Lees, Pope and Crawley was a little bit stuck in drying concrete. The same could not be said of Stokes and Bairstow, the stars of the Trent Bridge run-chase crashing 34 runs from the 19 deliveries before drinks and the former even notching up his 100th six in Test cricket when he sashayed down the pitch to Southee and auditioned for a LIV Golf tour card.

Attempting to throw the left-armer off his length, Stokes charged his second ball only to chip to mid-off for a 13-ball 18. When Ben Foakes then followed his earlier drop off Mitchell on 80 with a third-ball duck, lbw playing around one that swung back in, England appeared to be circling the drain. This is Headingley, however, and it the entertainers are in town.","pubDate":"2022-06-24 18:03:25","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d8f7b366ec92e1ade3d7f5a56d500d7542d8656/0_123_3678_2207/master/3678.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=83ce33bc505d8db15957403bb8ef34ae","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LIVE India vs Leicestershire 4-Day Warm-up Test Cricket Score: Gill-Bharat Take India To 80/1 At Stumps On Da - India.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMi5wFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2xpdmUtaW5kaWEtdnMtbGVpY2VzdGVyc2hpcmUtNC1kYXktd2FybS11cC10ZXN0LWNyaWNrZXQtc2NvcmUtbGVpY2VzdGVyLWluZC12cy1sZWktbGl2ZS1zdHJlYW1pbmctdG9kYXktc2NvcmUtaW5kaWEtdnMtZW5nbGFuZC01dGgtdGVzdC1iYWxsLWJ5LWJhbGwtY29tbWVudGFyeS1rb2hsaS1zaGFtaS1wYW50LWdpbGwtc3R1bXBzLTgwLTEtNTQ3MjU0OC_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LIVE India vs Leicestershire 4-Day Warm-up Test Cricket Score: Gill-Bharat Take India To 80/1 At Stumps On Da  India.comIndia vs Leicestershire, Day 2: Mohammed Shami Dismisses Cheteshwar Pujara For A Duck, Celebrates By..  NDTV SportsPrasidh Krishna cleans up Shreyas Iyer after receiving valuable tips from Virat Kohli  CricTrackerIND vs LEIC, Warm-up Game: Rishabh Pant's Jubilant Celebration After Rohit Sharma Gets Out Early - WATCH  News18India vs Leicestershire, Tour Match, Day 2 Highlights: India Steady At Stumps, Lead Leicestershire B..  NDTV SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-24 17:44:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ENG vs NZ: Ben Stokes becomes first cricketer in England & third in world to reach this milestone","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/eng-vs-nz-ben-stokes-becomes-first-cricketer-in-england-third-in-world-to-reach-this-milestone-england-vs-new-zealand-2022-06-24-787156","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England's newly appointed skipper Ben Stokes added another feather to his cap during ongoing England vs New Zealand Test series.

Chasing a modest 161, Australia were reduced to 50-4 before Labuschagne (31) and Carey (45 not out) dug them out of a hole and Cameron Green (25 not out) finished the job with just over 10 overs to spare. Spinners Dunith Wellalage (3-42) and Maheesh Theekshana (2-26) kept Sri Lanka in the hunt but Dasun Shanaka's side were left to rue a limp performance with the bat. \"The series was hard fought, but credit to Sri Lanka for the way they played, they deserve the win,\" said Australia captain Aaron Finch. \"Pleased with the way we performed. I would like to thank all the fans, they have been amazing.\" Sri Lanka chose to bat but slumped to 85-8 before Chamika Karunaratne (75) dragged them back into the game with a fighting half century, putting on 58 runs for the ninth wicket with Pramod Madushan to push Sri Lanka to 160. Josh Hazlewood (2-22) and Pat Cummins (2-22) did the early damage for Australia while Matthew Kuhnemann (2-26) also chipped in with his left-arm spin, making fine use of a turning wicket at the R Premadasa Stadium. The sides will now turn their focus to the red ball, with Galle set to host the first of two tests from June 29.

On ‘Day 2’ of the ongoing third Test match between England and New Zealand at Headingley in Leeds, some scintillating display of seam and swing bowling by the Kiwis, with Trent Boult leading the attack, has meant that England have lost half their side in the first innings within the first 12 Overs itself. Smashing his third century in the ongoing three-match series, Daryl Mitchell (109) continued with his purple patch of form as New Zealand went on to post 329/10 in their first innings, after finding themselves in some trouble having lost half their side with 123 runs on the board. Post that, it was all about the Kiwi pacers, Trent Boult in particular, who breathed fire by disturbing the stumps of the top-3 English batters – Alex Lees (4), Zak Crawley (6), and Ollie Pope (5), to reduce them to 17/3 within the first seven Overs of their first innings. Soon after, the in-form Joe Root (5) was sent packing by Tim Southee as he edged one through to the wicket-keeper. At the time of writing, left-arm pacer Neil Wagner then joined the party as well, getting rid of the English skipper Ben Stokes (18) and wicket-keeper batter Ben Foakes (0) in only his first Over of the match, to leave England gasping for breath at 89/6. Trent Boult – Wrist Release 🎯👏 #BoultBoulevardOfBewilderment pic.twitter.com/GOBPy7Nijs — Damien Fleming (@bowlologist) June 24, 2022 With England still trailing by 239 runs, New Zealand might opt to enforce the follow on if they manage to pick the remaining four wickets with the former still trailing by 200 runs. As per the Merylebone Cricket Club (MCC) law 14.1 (lead on first innings) under the section ‘The Follow-on’, In a two-innings match of 5 days or more, the side which bats first and leads by at least 200 runs shall have the option of requiring the other side to follow their innings. The same option shall be available in two-innings matches of shorter duration with the minimum leads as follows: – 150 runs in a match of 3 or 4 days; – 100 runs in a 2-day match; – 75 runs in a 1-day match (law 14.1.2) With England requiring mere 38 runs to reduce New Zealand’s lead to less than 200 runs, Kane Willimson might not wish to enforce the follow-on (even if eligible), and try to pile on a massive second innings lead and hand England a stiff, steep target to chase in the fourth innings of the match.","pubDate":"2022-06-24 15:07:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
