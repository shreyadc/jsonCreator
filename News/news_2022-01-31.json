Son of a CRPF personnel, the Uttar Pradesh-born Ravi, who has followed footsteps of his illustrious state senior Mohammed Shami to ply his trade for Bengal, ended with excellent figures of 7-1-14-3 on a tacky track as Bangladesh were all out for 111 in 37.1 overs. Bangladesh were 56 for 7 at one stage before SM Mehrob (30) and Ashiqur Zaman (16) added 50 for the eighth wicket to take the team past 100-run mark. In reply, India chased down the target in 30.5 overs with opener Angkrish Raghuvanshi's 44 being the top-score. Skipper Yash Dhull scored a chiselled 20 not out and his deputy Shaik Rasheed making 26 as the victory was even more satisfying considering the youngsters came back without any training post recovery from Covid-19. It was a fitting reply from the 'Boys in Blue' to the 'Tiger Cubs' after their senior batch lost an ill-tempered final of 2020 edition which was followed by boorish behaviour from both sides, especially Bangladeshis, whose reactions has always been over the top when it came to beating India. For the current batch, the win was also necessary after they were beaten twice by this same side last year during a four-nation meet in Kolkata. India won a good toss and Ravi made full use of the moisture underneath with initial movement in the air helping team's cause. Ravi, who has the natural ability to bring the ball back into right-handers, had right-handed Mahfijul Islam (2) beaten all-ends up to an inswinger in the second over. His opening partner left-handed Iftakher Hossain (1) was done in by the slowness of the track as he tried to square cut and was held at point by vice-captain Shaikh Rasheed. One drop batter Prantik Nawrose (7) was not at all comfortable during his stay and was late into the drive to a delivery that swung away only to offer a catch to Kaushal Tamble in the slips. Down at 14 for 3 in the eighth over, there was no coming back for Bangladesh boys as they started losing wickets at regular intervals. Left-arm spinner Vicky Ostwal (9-1-25-2) was consistent as ever with his flight and dip which was not very easy for the opposition batters. However if anyone deserves the credit for restricting Bangladesh to a manageable total, it is Ravi, who till few months back, was another outstation cricketer, plying his trade in Kolkata club cricket. The 18-year-old had his share of twists and turns before he became the pace spearhead for India colts in the tournament. In fact, talking to officials in Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), it was learnt that left-arm pacer who played for Ballygunge United had come for U-16 Bengal trials in 2019 but was rejected after he failed to clear the TW3 (Bone test for age verification) test. ","pubDate":"2022-01-30 19:15:06","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/01/30/500x300_1197981-icc-u19-world-cup.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia"},{"title":"Women's Ashes: Australia and England serve up vintage Test - BBC Sport","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0LzYwMTkwMzg40gEuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0LzYwMTkwMzg4LmFtcA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Women's Ashes: Australia and England serve up vintage Test  BBC SportAustralia, England fall just short in incredible draw | Women's Ashes 2021-22  cricket.com.auWomen’s Ashes Test match: Australia and England draw after thrilling finish – as it happened  The GuardianAshes thriller leaves everyone wanting more  Sydney Morning HeraldWomen's Ashes Test: England and Australia both fall just short of victory in thrilling finish in Canberra  Sky SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-30 18:07:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Rashid Khan PSL salary: How much has Rashid Khan been paid by Lahore Qalandars in PSL 2022?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-rashid-khan-psl-salary-how-much-has-rashid-khan-been-paid-by-lahore-qalandars-in-psl-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","Lahore Qalandars","Pakistan Super League","PSL 2022","rashid khan"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Rashid Khan PSL salary: The leg spinner from Afghanistan was placed in the highest draft category during PSL draft event last month.

Under Kohli, Team India reached at the top of the ICC Test rankings, they won two series in Australia and were 2-1 up win England before the final game got postponed due to covid. Root, on the other hand, captained England to a 4-0 loss in the Ashes Down Under earlier this year. \"This is a tale of two cricket captains; one very good at his job and the other a failure,\" Chappell wrote in his column for ESPN Cricinfo. \"There's no doubt Kohli was an exception as captain; he didn't curb his enthusiasm but he was still able to lead the Indian team to a higher level. With the capable assistance of vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane, he lifted India to overseas success like no other captain had done,\" Chappell opined. Further emphasizing on Root, Chappell said, \"The captaincy failure, despite having led his country more times than any other captain, is Joe Root. It doesn't matter what Root or any other English devotee tells you, Root is a fine batter but a poor captain.\" Chappell also said that Kohli reinforced the legacy of two successful Indian skippers - Sourav Ganguly and MS Dhoni. \"Kohli took the legacy of Sourav Ganguly and Dhoni and substantially built on it in seven years at the helm. His biggest disappointment as captain was the recent series loss to South Africa after India led the away series 1-0, though he didn't captain in the middle Test of that series, in Cape Town.\" The former Australian skipper also heaped praise on Kohli for \"instilling\" the passion to do well in Tests in his team. \"One of Kohli's great achievements was instilling in his team craving for Test cricket. Despite his all-encompassing success, Kohli's major aim was to achieve victory in the Test arena and this is where his passion really shone,\" added Chappell. In addition, Chappell solely credited Kohli for Rishabh Pant's success in Test cricket. The wicketkeeper-batsman had fallen off the good books of the previous management's (Kohli, former head coach Ravi Shastri and bowling coach Bharat Arun), who picked Wriddhiman Saha for the first Test in Australia. It took a 36 all out in Adelaide and the realization that Saha doesn't have the batting technique to survive in SENA countries, which prompted Ajinkya Rahane to bring back Pant and the rest, as they say, is history. \"Kohli has a number of individual achievements in his resume, none bigger than the development of Rishabh Pant as a wicketkeeper and batter. Kohli tended to get his way when it came to selection and some of his decisions in this area were a little questionable but there's no doubting his support of Pant was a masterstroke,\" Chappell observed. Joe Root lacks imagination as captain: Ian Chappell \"He (Root) was never going to be a successful leader. Though England under him have a reasonably presentable record at home, Root has lacked imagination as a captain, quickly run out of ideas, and showed little gut feel for the game. Too often his choice of bowlers to begin a session caused head-scratching, but the real killer were his tactics: they often made no sense,\" explained Chappell. Chappell also expressed that the reason why Root is a failure is that he hasn't exactly been his own man with \"too many off-field advisers\". \"A good captain has to take charge and this was an area where Root failed dismally. There's no doubt his last tour was badly hampered by player injuries and he was poorly treated by fate. Nevertheless ten Tests for eight losses and two unflattering draws is a fair summation of Root's leadership in Australia. It was poor captaincy accompanied by bad luck,\" said Chappell. Chappell also made it clear that seasoned pacer Stuart Broad isn't the answer to England's captaincy problems. \"To suggest that the answer to the leadership void is Stuart Broad lacks understanding of cricket captaincy. Apart from Broad's advanced (cricket) age and articulate off-field responses, he's a negative influence -- particularly with field placings -- and would be a poor choice as captain,\" the former Aussie cricketer said.","pubDate":"2022-01-30 11:54:37","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/01/03/500x300_1139525-kohli.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia"},{"title":"India vs West Indies: Cricket West Indies announce squad for T20I series against India","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-west-indies-cricket-west-indies-announce-squad-for-t20i-series-against-india-2022-01-30-757093","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The selection committee of Cricket West Indies has announced their squad for the upcoming three-match T20I series against India.

While all their batters contributed in putting together a fighting chase, at least one of them needed to outperform the others to be able to seal the chase. Asked to bat first by Lions captain Misbah-ul-Haq (2), Giants scored a formidable score on the back of Corey Anderson scoring a match-winning 94* (43) with the help of seven fours and eight sixes at a strike rate of 218.60. Kevin Pietersen posts video of acrobatic fielding effort in Legends League Cricket Former England and Giants batter Kevin Pietersen took to social media platform Twitter to post videos of his outstanding contribution in the match. Opening the batting with wicket-keeper Phil Mustard (9), Pietersen scored an eye-catching 48 (22) comprising of two fours and five sixes. Pietersen, who picked a slower ball from Lions fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar only to dispatch it over the boundary for a six, posted a video of the same. However, an even intriguing video saw him engaging in an acrobatic fielding display. It all had happened on the fourth delivery of the 12th over when Lions batter Asghar Afghan (24) hit an Albie Morkel delivery for a big shot. Pietersen, who was at the boundary, not only grabbed the catch successfully but was also aware enough to pass the ball to captain Daren Sammy as momentum was carrying him on the other side of the boundary rope.

The one-off Women’s Ashes Test between Australia and England in Canberra ended in a draw on Day 4 at a time when all four results were possible going into the last two overs. Chasing a 257-run target on a final day pitch, England scored 245/9 in 48 overs despite looking set to win the match a few overs ago. Highlighting how tricky a Test chase can be, England lost wickets in a hurry in the last six chances only to hurt their chances of registering a world record run-chase. As if the fourth day didn’t comprise of enough drama already, the penultimate English wicket added some more to increase the tension among players and fans. It all happened in the 46th over, when needing 13 runs off 19 balls, England spinner Charlie Dean swept Australia spinner Alana King only to top-edge the ball to wicket-keeper Alyssa Healy. Back foot no ball in cricket King, who was bowling leg-spin from round the wicket, had to stop midway her celebration of picking the second wicket of her spell as third umpire Bruce Oxenford was checking for a back foot no-ball as the bowler’s right foot was quite close to the returning crease. so. shook. One wicket required. #Ashes pic.twitter.com/HvK6PR3JZM — Australian Women’s Cricket Team (@AusWomenCricket) January 30, 2022 While Oxenford ruled the decision in King’s favour, legendary cricketers calling the match thought of the otherwise. “The rule is some part of the foot has to land before it touches the crease line and on first vision, to me, it felt as if there was contact. It looked even more so from behind,” former Australia batter Mel Jones said on Fox Cricket to received an affirmative from from former England pacer Isa Guha. According to MCC’s Law 21.5.1 for back foot no balls, “the bowler’s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to his/her stated mode of delivery”. In such a situation, first contact becomes extremely crucial for an umpire to call a no-ball. While King’s foot did touch the back foot eventually, the first point of contact came to her rescue at the Manuka Oval today. A part of Kings’ right foot appeared to touch the returning crease initially but it wasn’t the case as it appeared to be airborne on that particular occasion.

The Ashes Test at Manuka Oval has ended in dramatic scenes, with all four results possible heading into the final couple of overs of day four in Canberra. England came agonisingly close to pulling off mission impossible, scoring the largest fourth-innings team total in the history of women’s Test cricket. But it ultimately wasn’t enough, with the thrilling contest ending as a draw. With the possible exception of day five of the New Year’s Test in Sydney, this was the most captivating day’s cricket of the 2021/22 summer. Just as Steve Smith couldn’t get the job done for the Aussies at the SCG earlier the month, Australian debutant Alan King was tasked with unearthing a miracle 10th wicket in the last over, but it wasn’t to be. Watch the CommBank Women‘s Ashes Series on Kayo. Every Test, T20 & ODI Live & On-Demand. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > Skipper Meg Lanning declared Australia’s second innings in the afternoon session of day four, leaving England with 48 overs to chase the 257 runs required for victory. The highest successful run chase in the history of women’s cricket was 198, achieved by Australia over a decade ago – England’s all-time best was 173. The Australian camp understood that a draw would have strategically worked in their favour, with the scoring system in the multi-format series meaning the hosts only needed one victory in the three ODIs to retain the trophy in such a scenario. And at the change of innings, it seemed as though a draw was an inevitability – Australia’s bowlers needed 10 wickets for victory, but the pitch had flattened out beautifully over the course of three-and-a-half days of action. However, England opener Tammy Beaumont made it abundantly clear that the visitors had no intention of playing for a draw. She smacked a quick-fire 36 before Tahlia McGrath removed the right-hander with her first delivery of the day. At the other end, Lauren Winfield-Hill compiled a patient 33 off 65 balls, prompting a journalist from the media centre to chuck his head out of the window and bellow, “Have a go, Lauren!” But momentum quickly shifted back in England’s favour when skipper Heather Knight came to the crease, fresh off her record-breaking 168 not out in the first innings. Knight and England all-rounder Nat Sciver combined for a game-changing 72-run partnership, scoring at quicker than a run per ball. Lanning put six fielders on the boundary rope, hoping to stem the flow of runs – but easy singles became quick twos as England’s required run rate dropped below six per over. The Manuka Oval deck was offering zero seam movement for Australia’s pace bowlers, with the exception of a couple of deliveries from young all-rounder Annabel Sutherland that crept below the bat. Suddenly, the target didn’t seem unfeasible – England required under 100 runs for victory with eight wickets in hand heading into the final hour. Teenage quick Darcie Brown got the long-awaited breakthrough with less than an hour left in the day, trapping Knight on the pads to halt England’s stampede. But England’s Sophia Dunkley switched into T20 mode as soon as she waltzed into the middle, smacking 37 from her first 21 balls at the crease. With 10 overs remaining in the day, England required just 45 runs for victory with seven wickets in hand. They were favourites. According to the almighty CricViz, England’s chances of securing a win had risen from two per cent to 87 per cent in less than two hours. This is a truly incredible Test match. Unbelievable. #Ashes This is completely bananas #Ashes This session is mental #Ashes However, in yet another stunning twist, only two runs were scored from the following two overs, making the equation 43 needed from eight overs. Sciver then slapped a short ball from Sutherland directly towards Lanning at square leg, ending her swashbuckling knock on 58 from 62 balls – no women‘s player has scored more runs in a Test innings at a faster strike rate. With England requiring 38 runs for victory, Australian wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy missed a tough stumping chance off King’s bowling, gifting Amy Jones an extra life on zero. A handful of sloppy misfields from the Australians leaked crucial runs, but Sutherland struck again a couple of overs later, with Jones cracking a delivery towards Beth Mooney at the mid-wicket boundary, who claimed a regulation chance. All four results were still possible. In another game-changing moment, Mooney snared a remarkable diving catch low to her right at long-on to remove the dangerous Dunkley for 45. It was a late contender for catch of the summer. “This woman has had jaw surgery just days ago, titanium plates in her face, and absolutely no fear to take a diving catch to dismiss the dangerous Sophia Dunkley,” former Australian captain Alex Blackwell said on Fox Cricket. The Aussies at this stage required four wickets from 28 balls for an unlikely victory, while England still needed 24 runs. This woman. Seriously. England need 24 from 28 to win, we need four wickets #Ashes pic.twitter.com/otnB91UNQh How does a player with a broken face take a catch like that? #Ashes Bloody hell. What a game #AUSvENG #Ashes Sutherland snared her third breakthrough the following over, dismissing the powerful Katherine Brunt for 4 with a short ball that was edged through to Healy with the gloves. Three overs remaining – Australia needed three wickets, England required 17 runs. King’s next over featured a cataclysmic run out, with Anya Shrubsole attempting a suicidal quick single only to find herself half a metre short of making her ground. And the very next delivery, Charlie Dean attempted to sweep King towards fine leg, but the top edge was caught by Healy for Australia’s ninth wicket of the innings. England had lost 6/26 in a dramatic collapse. As Dean made her way back to the pavilion, the third umpire checked for the dreaded back-foot no-ball, but replays showed that King was safe by a matter of millimetres. Two overs remaining – Australia needed one wicket, England required 13 runs. Several deliveries went past the outside edge in Sutherland’s relatively uneventful penultimate over, in which just the one run was scored. Ultimately, it came down to the last over. Just as James Anderson did four weeks ago, England No. 11 Kate Cross successfully blocked out the final six balls to avoid a dramatic defeat, and the Test was drawn. Largest fourth-innings scores in women’s Test history 245/9 - England vs AUS, Jan 2022 229/5 - England vs IND, Jun 1986 225/8 - England vs NZ, Jul 1996 223/8 - India vs ENG, Jul 1999 214 - New Zealand vs ENG, Mar 1969 Former England bowler and Fox Cricket commentator Isa Guha called it “one of the greatest Test matches in Ashes history.” “Heather Knight and the rest of that team are going to be absolutely devastated,” she said. “They pulled off an unbelievable heist. To get themselves into a position to win the Test match — they were only one wicket away. “I just can’t believe what we have witnessed.” Australian batter Marnus Labuschagne tweeted: “What a finish that was. Absolutely great for Test cricket.” Cricket broadcaster Adam Collins tweeted: “Well played Meg Lanning, Heather Knight and both teams. In just 10 sessions, they‘ve engineered an excellent, compelling Test. More of it, across five days. And also, crucially, time for multi-day domestic women’s cricket. Let this be a springboard.” Australia takes a 6-4 lead in the multi-format series ahead of the one-day internationals, which get underway on Thursday. Australian cricket legend Mel Jones showed she is as classy as they come, with a generous act during the women’s Ashes Test. Australia has mounted a gutsy fightback at Manuka Oval to ensure no English team will taste victory in an Ashes Test this summer. Alyssa Healy has joined an unwanted list of Australians to score a pair in Test cricket, falling victim to an England rival for a 12th time.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"“Shame there’s only one”: Jimmy Anderson reacts to riveting Australia vs England Women’s Ashes Test","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-shame-theres-only-one-jimmy-anderson-reacts-to-riveting-australia-vs-england-womens-ashes-test/","keywords":["Cricket","Australia Women","England Women","Womens Ashes"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia vs England Women’s Ashes Test: The one-off Women’s Ashes Test ended up being a cliffhanger of a cricket match.

During the fourth day of the one-off Test between Australia Women and England Women in Canberra, both teams fought incredibly hard to put on display a riveting draw. Chasing a 257-run target in 48 overs, England ditched the conventional approach of playing safe in a bid to draw a match. Having treated the chase as an archetype ODI situation, England’s Top six batter contributing put them ahead of the hosts. To be precise, it was a 69-ball 72-run partnership for the third wicket between England captain Heather Knight (48) and all-rounder Nat Sciver (58) which increased the intrigue-factor on the final day. England batter Sophia Dunkley scoring a stroke-filled 45 (32) with the help of five fours and two sixes had provided signs of sealing the chase on her own until Alana King dismissed her in the 44th over. What followed was a cat-and-mouse game between Australia and England as both of them were on the verge of winning the match at one point in time. However, the last two overs were all about the visitors defending everything for a draw especially after losing eight wickets (ninth in the penultimate over). A draw was perhaps a fitting result for a match in which both the teams tried their level best to win the match. With bowling figures of 13-0-69-3, Australia pacer Annabel Sutherland was the pick of the Australian bowlers. While King picked a couple of wickets at the Manuka Oval, Darcie Brown, Tahlia McGrath and Ellyse Perry picked a wicket apiece. Australia vs England Women’s Ashes Test Shame there’s only one!

Cross was up to the task, playing solid forward defence as both sides walked off the field wondering how they weren't able to lock up the win. \"What a brilliant Test match from both teams,\" player of the match Heather Knight said afterwards. \"We've gone toe-to-toe with the Australians, we've fought over four days and I don't think it deserves a draw in the end, does it? \"Delighter with the way the girls fought and the fact that we went for it is really pleasing.\" The multi-format series will now pivot to 50-over cricket, with the first of three ODIs to take place on Thursday.

Uganda have lost their first four group matches and were placed at the bottom of the points table. In their last game, they tasted their first victory in the tournament. They defeated Papua New Guinea by 35 runs in a low-scoring game, thanks to their bowlers, who kept their nerves in check and successfully defended the total. Meanwhile, Scotland are still searching for their first win in the tournament as they lost their first four matches in a row and their last match was canceled due to COVID-19 cases. UGA-U19 XI Ronald Opio, Fahad Mutagana, Ronald Lutaaya, Cyrus Kakuru (wk), Pascal Murungi (C), Joseph Baguma, Christopher Kidega, Juma Miyaji, Edwin Nuwagaba, Matthew Musinguzi, Yunusu Sowobi. SCO-U19 XI Charlie Tear (wk), Oliver Davidson, Samuel Elstone, Tomas Mackintosh, Jack Jarvis, Muhaymen Majeed, Lyle Robertson, Rafay Khan, Charlie Peet (c), Ruaridh Mclntyre, Sean Fischer Keogh. Match: UGA-U19 vs SCO-U19, U19 World Cup 2022, Playoff. Date and Time: 30th January 2022; 06:30 PM IST. Venue: Diego Martin Sporting Complex Stadium, Trinidad. The wicket at Diego Martin is expected to favor bowlers over batters. Matches here have generally been low scoring, and this trend is expected to continue in this match as well. Anything above 180 runs could be a par-score on this track. Cyrus Kakuru: Kakuru is expected to play a key role in this game. He played a valuable 65-run innings in the last game and is expected to deliver once again in a must-win match. Muhaymen Majeed : Although he has that potential, Majeed hasn't been able to perform as expected and will have a big chance to prove himself in this crucial match. Pascal Murungi: Murungi is a top all-rounder for his team. He has scored 142 runs and has eight wickets under his belt in four matches. Murungi is a must-have player in your UGA-U19 vs SCO-U19 Dream11 fantasy team. Juma Miyagi: He has picked up nine wickets in his last three games. Miyagi could prove to be a valuable pick for your UGA-U19 vs SCO-U19 Dream11 fantasy team. Matthew Musinguzi (UGA-U19) - 256 points. Charlie Peet (SCO-U19) - 181 points. Joseph Baguma (UGA-U19) - 333 points. Jack Jarvis - 112 runs and six wickets in his last four games; bowling average: 23.33. Olly Davidson – 102 runs and six wickets in his last four games; batting average: 25.5. Charlie Tear - 89 runs in his last four games; batting average: 22.25. Fantasy Suggestion #1 : Cyrus Kakuru, Muhaymen Majeed, Ruaridh Mclntyre, Ronald Opio, Oliver Davidson, Jack Jarvis, Pascal Murungi, Joseph Baguma, Charlie Peet, Juma Miyaji, Matthew Musinguzi. Captain : Pascal Murungi. Vice-captain : Oliver Davidson.

India and Pakistan last played a bilateral series in 2012 when the latter toured the former. Since then, the two countries have met each other only in global or ICC tournaments. Speaking to Sportstar, Sohail agreed with the ICC's narrative of keeping political conflicts away from the sport. The 55-year old added that fans worldwide deserve to see more of India-Pakistan games. Pakistan scored a landmark victory over India in the T20 World Cup 2021, beating them for the first time in World Cups. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan helped annihilate India by ten wickets as they chased 152 for the win. The southpaw claimed Rohit Sharma's experience as Mumbai Indians' captain should help India. He also wants India's selection to be based only on domestic performances. Sohail, one of Pakistan's all-time greatest openers, also feels India's future looks bright despite Virat Kohli's resignation as captain. Sharma will return to India's line-up for the upcoming white-ball series at home against the West Indies. The explosive opener missed the tour of South Africa due to a hamstring injury.","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/01/fd540-16435203623890-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda"},{"title":"All-rounder Barty: Cricketer, golfer & Aus Open champion","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/australian-open/all-rounder-ash-barty-cricketer-golfer-and-australian-open-tennis-champion/articleshow/89217205.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Hitting a tennis ball is not all that the 25-year-old Australian Open champion Ashleigh Barty has done over the last two decades.
