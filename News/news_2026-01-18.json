Here's a look at his ODI record in Indore","description":"Virat Kohli 2.0 has truly arrived. After his unbeaten 74 against Australia in Sydney, the Indian batting star has not looked back. He carried that rich vein of form into the home series against South Africa in November–December, where his two centuries sent a clear message that the ‘King’ had rediscovered his peak prowess.Kohli's resurgence in international cricket has reignited discussions around milestones, records and match-winning knocks.Riding on his batting excellence, the 37-year-old went on to reclaim the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings, replacing Rohit Sharma as the world’s number one ODI batter. His rise was sealed by a match-winning 93 off 91 balls in the first ODI at Vadodara, an innings that powered India to a successful chase of a 300-plus target against New Zealand.Also Read: Virat Kohli reclaims No.1 spot in ODI rankings after 4 long yearsNumbers That Tell the StoryKohli’s recent ODI scores make for impressive reading,74*, 135, 102, 65*, and 93 culminating his prowess with the bat. As India prepare to face New Zealand in a crucial ODI at Indore with the series finely poised at 1–1, all eyes are once again on Kohli and the possibility of his 85th international century.Indore: A Rare BlipDespite his stellar form, Kohli’s ODI record at Indore’s Holkar Stadium is modest by his standards. In four innings at the venue, he has scored 99 runs at an average of 33 and a strike rate of 108.79, with a highest score of 36. His knocks include 23* against West Indies in 2011, 12 against South Africa in 2015, 28 versus Australia in 2017, and 36 against New Zealand in January 2023.While Indore has not been Kohli’s happiest hunting ground, its reputation as a batting-friendly venue offers fresh opportunity.
