In her first over of the day, Perry bowled Hayley Matthews for nought with an absolute peach before snaring the wicket of Kycla Knight on her first ball to leave the West Indies flailing at 2/4. Unfortunately the hat-trick ball wasn’t as successful as the previous two deliveries, as opener Deandra Dottin looked to hold down the fort. However, Dottin departed after she flashed the blade at a tempting delivery from Perry and sent it straight to Meg Lanning at first slip who took a sensational diving catch and leave the West Indies at 3/33. It’s now on to Stafanie Taylor and Shermaine Campbelle to keep the runs ticking along. A win for Australia at Basin Reserve would keep their undefeated streak at the tournament alive, as wins against England, Pakistan and New Zealand has the Aussies sitting at the top of the group. A fourth-straight win would certainly put one foot in the semi final. The West Indies have also made a strong start with wins over New Zealand and England, but a loss to India has the side sitting just outside the top four.

Swepson’s maiden Test outing in the second Test against Pakistan began in good fashion with 15 runs at No.11, followed by a direct hit run-out of Abdullah Shafique and 2-32 from nine overs. Mitchell Swepson after taking his maiden Test wicket. Credit: AP After five years of being involved with the Australian setup, Swepson would have made the late Shane Warne a proud man by removing Pakistan captain Babar Azam for his first Test scalp, caught in the deep for 36 by his Queensland skipper Usman Khawaja. It was fitting that not only did Khawaja present Swepson with his baggy green, but that he was also wearing the youngster’s new cap while the catch was taken. “It was nice to contribute to the team and get out there,” Swepson said. “It has been a long wait, two days in the shed, so I was keen to get out there. I hit the ball OK and it was nice to get a run-out. “The first wicket was a big monkey off the back, so very happy with the day. “There was a little bit of nerves there but I’m at a point now where I’ve played so much cricket that standing at the top of my mark is almost my happy place, it’s the place where I get so much enjoyment out of. Knowing I’m about to bowl for Australia is a really good feeling. “In my first couple of overs I missed my length a little bit, but just happy to get the ball in a decent area a few times. [I] some spun out of the footmarks, some didn’t, but I probably could have started a little bit better.” Swepson’s run-out, a direct hit from short third man, changed the momentum of the innings as Shafique was caught short of his ground. Pakistan had batted almost 100 overs, across the first and second Tests, without losing a wicket when Swepson’s individual bit of brilliance energised the tourists and triggered a major collapse . Swepson had just sent down his first six balls in Test cricket and was soaking up the atmosphere before some sharp work that will be in highlights packages for years to come. “It just went straight into the hand and I let go and it hit the stumps,” Swepson said. “It was a great feeling to get a breakthrough, those two openers were going well there. To have a run out next to my name in Test cricket is great. “To be honest, after my first over I calmed down but the run out got me going again. It got the blood flowing, so it had me a bit more wired again. It was a great feeling to know I’d contributed even if it wasn’t with my bowling.” Swepson was taken out of the attack while Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Cameron Green tore through Pakistan’s top and middle order. Cummins brought Swepson back on and his ball to Babar, a classic leg break, came out of the hand just as he’d hoped. “It was one of those ones where you let go of it, it comes out of the fingers really nicely and luckily enough he tried to really take it on and got that leading edge,” Swepson said. “It was exactly what you want when the ball comes out of your hands. I know Uzzie has a great pair of hands, so I was glad he was at mid-off. It was a great feeling, a great emotion. “Getting your first wicket is one of those things you want to get done. It was obviously getting to the end of the innings, we had them eight down and I wasn’t sure if I was going to get a wicket. The outpouring of emotions from my teammates ... them getting around me like they did with the run out was a great feeling.” Swepson said Australia’s decision to not enforce the follow-on and bat again late on day three, already with a first innings buffer of 408 runs, made sense. “Obviously as a debutant I’m not involved in discussions but my assumption would be [it was] to get more wear and tear on the wicket, get their fast bowlers running up and down the wicket, so more footmarks for me and Gaz [Nathan Lyon] to work with,” Swepson said. “We think it will be harder to bat on later in the game.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"smh","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘It was a great feeling’: Swepson reflects on maiden Test wicket and game-changing run-out","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/it-was-a-great-feeling-swepson-reflects-on-maiden-test-wicket-and-game-changing-run-out-20220315-p5a4nh.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Tom Decent"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mitch Swepson became Australia’s first specialist leg-spinner to play Test cricket in over a decade on Monday and didn’t disappoint.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-14 20:54:14","full_description":"Karachi: Mitch Swepson says he feels like he’s got the monkey off his back following a maiden Test wicket and a bonus run-out that “got the blood flowing”.

READ MORE SPORT STORIES Robinson was ruled out of the series-opening draw in Antigua after suffering back spasms in the warm-up match. But interim head coach Paul Collingwood described his subsequent progress as ‘really positive’ over the weekend. The 28-year-old effectively underwent an extended fitness test on Monday, bowling two spells and working up towards full pace in an attempt to recreate match conditions. England will keenly monitor the Sussex seamer’s reaction and it’s likely he will be asked to back-up his work with another session before any decision is made over his participation on Wednesday.

The most interesting aspect to watch during the tests would be whether the 28-year-old gets clearance to bowl full tilt in the cash-rich league where Titans would start their campaign against Lucknow Supergiants on March 28. \"Hardik will be at the NCA for next two days and appear in the various fitness tests. He is a centrally contracted cricketer and has not played any cricket since T20 World Cup in UAE,\" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. \"He would need to pass the fitness test as it has been mandatory for some time now. Last year, even Shreyas Iyer appeared for a fitness test post shoulder surgery before playing ,\" he added. The national team and the NCA medical staff always keeps a close tab on its centrally-contracted players and it has been learnt that during the Titans short five-day training camp in Baroda, Hardik had bowled during a couple of sessions. It is understood that when it comes to batting and fielding fitness, he is fully ready and playing as a pure batter might not be an issue at all for the flamboyant Baroda all-rounder. However, it is understood that he might still be bowling at 75 per cent of his full potential or what it was before he sustained a lower back injury leading to a surgery in 2019. \"If Gujarat is looking at a pure batter, a skipper and a finisher, Hardik, in all likelihood, is ready but it will be interesting to see what is NCA's Sports Science and Medicine team's take on his bowling. Is he ready to bowl at 135 clicks upwards?,\" the source privy to developments said. Hardik, during Gujarat Titans' jersey launch, kept cards close to his chest stating that his bowling would be a \"surprise\". However, recently during a media conference, chairman of selectors Chetan Sharma had said that his committee will monitor Hardik and he will be considered only when he is bowling regularly like old times. If and when it happens is still not known but IPL 2022 might see evolution of Hardik Pandya, the pure batter.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"DAT vs BOB Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for Oman D10 League 2022, Match 7","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/dat-vs-bob-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-oman-d10-league-2022-match-7?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Anjishnu Roy"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-14 13:16:42","full_description":"The Darsait Titans will take on Bousher Busters in the seventh match of the Oman D10 League 2022 at the Al Amerat Cricket Ground in Oman on Monday.

Karunaratne has scored the most runs as an opener in Tests since 2018, with seven hundreds in the longest format during this period. It was not going to be easy to bat last on a rank turner against a quality Indian bowling attack. While other Sri Lankan batters failed to handle the hosts' bowlers, Karunaratne batted with authority and led by example with the bat. Fans on Twitter hailed the Sri Lankan skipper for showing some fight and countering the potent Indian bowling attack. Here are some of the reactions: Having set an astronomical target of 447 for Sri Lanka, India looked on course for a win. The Sri Lankan batters have shown no spine throughout the series. The visitors got off to a horrible start in their second innings, with opener Lahiru Thirimanne trapped in front by Jasprit Bumrah in the very first over. Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne then saw off the Indian bowlers and returned unscathed at the end of Day 2. It was expected that the visitors would just roll over as the pitch was going to get more difficult for batting. However, both Mendis and Karunaratne came out to bat with a positive approach. The duo took on the Indian bowlers and showed great resistance. The hosts then struck with wickets at regular intervals, but Karunaratne kept going strong from one end. Soon after bringing up a well-deserved Test hundred, the Sri Lankan skipper was cleaned up by a beauty from Bumrah. Although the result of the game was never in doubt, Karunaratne will be proud of his knock given the difficult conditions.","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/03/ea127-16472601098366-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan vs Australia 2nd Test Day 3 Highlights: Australia take complete control after bundling Pakistan for 148 - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9wYWtpc3Rhbi12cy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtMm5kLXRlc3QtZGF5LTMtbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3JlLXBhay12cy1hdXMtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLXNjb3JlY2FyZC0xMDE2NDcyMjcwNTUwNTYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan vs Australia 2nd Test Day 3 Highlights: Australia take complete control after bundling Pakistan for 148  Hindustan TimesWatch: Babar Azam Denies Alex Carey His Maiden Test Century; Takes Only His 2nd Test Wicket  Cricket AddictorAustralia's front-loading puts Pakistan in danger on wearing surface  ESPNcricinfoPak vs Aus: An unwanted home Test record for Pakistan  Geo NewsAkhtar posts epic tweet as Pakistan collapse to lose flurry of wickets against Australia on 'boring' Karachi pitch  Hindustan TimesView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-14 13:13:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Sri Lanka Man of the Series today: Who was awarded Man of the Series in IND vs SL Test series?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-india-vs-sri-lanka-man-of-the-series-today-who-was-awarded-man-of-the-series-in-ind-vs-sl-test-series/","keywords":["Cricket","India","rishabh pant","Sri Lanka","Sri Lanka tour of India 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Sri Lanka Man of the Series: The Indian wicket-keeper batter has won his maiden series award in Test cricket.

India have continued their winning spree by winning all their five matches across against Sri Lanka. A 3-0 T20I series whitewash has been followed by a 2-0 Test series whitewash after the hosts beat Sri Lanka by 238 runs to win the second Test in Bengaluru. In what was India’s fourth pink-ball Test, they have now won three (all at home) and lost one. The development also means that India have won their 100% points of the ongoing second ICC World Test Championship. Chasing a formidable 447-run target, Sri Lanka managed to evade embarrassment as captain Dimuth Karunaratne (107) and batter Kusal Mendis (54) tried their best to counter an in-form Indian bowling unit. However, lack of support from other batters resulted in Sri Lanka scoring 208/10 in 59.3 overs. With bowling figures of 19.3-3-55-4, all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin was the pick of the Indian bowlers on Day 3 today. While fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah picked three wickets, all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel picked two and one wicket respectively. India vs Sri Lanka Man of the Series There were multiple contenders for the Man of the Series award after a series where the hosts have dominated across divisions. Having said that, wicket-keeper batter Rishabh Pant was adjudged the Man of the Series for the first time in his Test career. Third-highest run-scorer in the two-match series behind Ravindra Jadeja (201) and Shreyas Iyer (186), Pant was handed the award for contributing behind the wickets as well.

India have continued their winning spree by winning all their five matches across against Sri Lanka. A 3-0 T20I series whitewash has been followed by a 2-0 Test series whitewash after the hosts beat Sri Lanka by 238 runs to win the second Test in Bengaluru. In what was India’s fourth pink-ball Test, they have now won three (all at home) and lost one. The development also means that India have won their 100% points of the ongoing second ICC World Test Championship. Chasing a formidable 447-run target, Sri Lanka managed to evade embarrassment as captain Dimuth Karunaratne (107) and batter Kusal Mendis (54) tried their best to counter an in-form Indian bowling unit. However, lack of support from other batters resulted in Sri Lanka scoring 208/10 in 59.3 overs. With bowling figures of 19.3-3-55-4, all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin was the pick of the Indian bowlers on Day 3 today. While fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah picked three wickets, all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel picked two and one wicket respectively. There were multiple contenders for the Man of the Series award after a series where the hosts have dominated across divisions. Having said that, wicket-keeper batter Rishabh Pant was adjudged the Man of the Series for the first time in his Test career. Third-highest run-scorer in the two-match series behind Ravindra Jadeja (201) and Shreyas Iyer (186), Pant was handed the award for contributing behind the wickets as well. In three innings of this series, Pant’s 185 runs have come at an average and strike rate of 61.66 and 120.12 respectively including a couple of half-centuries.

You can always come back and bat again,” Archer said.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LIVE India vs Sri Lanka Score Pink Test Day 3: SL Lose 6 Wickets; Karunaratne Slams Hundred - India.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMi7QFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2xpdmUtY3JpY2tldC1zY29yZS1pbmRpYS12cy1zcmktbGFua2EtMm5kLXRlc3QtZGF5LTMtcGluay1iYWxsLWRheS1uaWdodC10ZXN0LXBheXRtLWluZC12cy1zbC1iYWxsLWJ5LWJhbGwtY29tbWVudGFyeS11cGRhdGVzLWJlbmdhbHVydS1zdGFyLXNwb3J0cy1zdHJlYW1pbmctaG90c3Rhci1rYXJ1bmFyYXRuZS1qYXNwcml0LWJ1bXJhaC1hc2h3aW4tNTI4NTgwMS_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LIVE India vs Sri Lanka Score Pink Test Day 3: SL Lose 6 Wickets; Karunaratne Slams Hundred  India.comRecent Match Report - India vs Sri Lanka 2nd Test 2021/22  ESPNcricinfoIndia vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd Test, Day 3: IND need 4 wickets to win pink-ball Test; Karunaratne hits classy 100  Hindustan TimesIND vs SL: Jasprit Bumrah Is The Kind Of Bowler Batsmen Do Not Want To Face: Sunil Gavaskar  Cricket AddictorIndia vs Sri Lanka: Hosts turn the screw to assume total control  The Indian ExpressView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-14 11:50:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Aussies claim all 10 wickets in a day!","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/aussies-claim-all-10-wickets-in-a-day/video/495c2b99e65c8bac783d4a53c87933d5","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Wickets had been hard to come by thus far in the Tests between Australia and Pakistan, but after building an enormous lead the Aussies dismantled Pakistan inside a day.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-14 11:36:21","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ITV Racing presenter Oli Bell was called ‘lunatic’ by The Queen and dated fellow TV star Francesca Cumani","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/horseracing/14087513/itv-racing-oli-bell-queen-dated-francesca-cumani-glorious-goodwood/","keywords":["Horse Racing","Cheltenham Festival 2022","Grand National","Sport Features"],"creator":["Jon Boon"],"video_url":null,"description":"OLI BELL is familiar to horse racing fans as the fresh-faced presenter of The Opening Show, and will be covering Glorious Goodwood for ITV.

BEGAMBLEAWARE.ORG It was then reported that he was dating jockey, Hayley Turner, before she went public with a romance with fellow rider Nick Scholfied last September. Bell, whose uncle owns racehorses, was also one jokingly called ‘a lunatic’ by The Queen when the pair crossed paths at Royal Ascot in 2017. And least we mention the £30,000 he won playing poker… KEEPING IT PROFESSIONAL Ahead of the Cheltenham Festival in 2020, Oli and Francesca called it quits on their romance. It must’ve had TV bosses sweating, however the pair remained professional to fulfil their duties for ITV. They began dating in 2018, after Cumani – the daughter of Italian-born trainer Luca Cumani – separated from Australian polo player Rob Archibald. After Oli and Francesca broke up, he was rumoured to have got close to renowned jockey Turner. The pair were friends before, and never confirmed whether they were in a relationship or not. Turner regularly rides for Oli’s uncle, Derby-winning trainer Michael Bell, and is now happily loved up with Scholfield.

Completely forgetting his reporting duties, he sprinted after the horse once it passed the finishing line from the commentary box, dropping his mic in the process, to celebrate victory. The next day, Oli was in the paddock interviewing the trainers before each race, when he got a tap on the shoulder from John Warren, the Queen’s racing adviser, who told him there was someone he’d like him to meet. Minutes later, Oli saw Queen Elizabeth II walking towards his direction and they were introduced. “You’re the lunatic that ran on the track yesterday?,” she said him to which Oli replied, “Yes I am!” “It was like having a dream,” Oli later said. “It was just completely bonkers.” Rex FeaturesBell famously ran on the track to celebrate his uncle’s horse Big Orange win at Royal Ascot[/caption] Getty Images - GettyThe Queen called Bell a ‘lunatic’ after seeing him run onto the track when Big Orange won[/caption] SCHOOL DROPOUT Broadcasting was always going to be Oli’s calling. From the age of 15, he showed he had a flair for presenting – hosting the breakfast show on his high school’s radio station. A year later, aged just 16, he worked as a live radio reporter at the Burghley Horse Trials, then covered the British Touring Car Championships, as well as the Land Rover G4 Challenge. At 18, Oli left school and soon scored a job as an editorial assistant with Racing UK, covering major events including the Grand National. Three years overseas working for Sky Australia broadened Oli’s sporting experience, before he returned to the UK with Racing UK and then a job with ITV in 2019. RICH PICKINGS A keen sportsman, Oli loves football and cricket – and plays the latter for the Newmarket Racing XI team. He also played semi-professional football in Australia, while he worked there.
