India lost to Bangladesh by five runs in the second ODI in Mirpur Wednesday to concede the series 0-2 after having suffered a one-wicket defeat in the first ODI. “Definitely the Indian team is not going in the right direction. I have not seen the intensity in the team off late. I have not seen ‘Josh’ in them in the last couple of years,” Lal told PTI in an interview. “They are not looking like an Indian team at all. That passion of playing for the country is missing. Either their bodies are too tired or they are just going through the motions. And this is a serious concern.” Deepak Chahar, who has been bothered by injuries this year, couldn’t complete his quota of overs during the second ODI. The Indian players are dealing with fitness issues with star pacer Jasprit Bumrah and all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja too out of the team owing to injuries. Highlighting fitness issue of players, skipper Rohit Sharma on Wednesday said that India “can’t have guys coming in to play for the country half-fit.” Referring to Rohit’s observation, Lal, who is a member of the 1983 World Cup winning team, said: “It is a very sad thing. If the captain is saying this then something is wrong somewhere.” “Who is responsible for this? Are trainers responsible for this? Why are unfit players going? You are playing international cricket and the result is in front of you. “If they want to take rest they can take rest during IPL matches. Your country comes first. If you are not going to win ICC trophies, your nation’s cricket is going to go down.” India had crashed out of the T20 World Cup after losing to eventual champions England in the semifinals. Rohit Sharma and Co also made early exit from the Asia Cup after losing their super 4 games to Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Lal put the blame on top-order batters for India’s not-so-impressive performance in recent times. “If you see the record, how many centuries they (seniors) have scored in the last three years? And how many in the last one year? With age factor, your hand-eye coordination slows down. “But they are experienced players and they should have performed. If your top order does not perform you are not going to win.” The 71-year-old former all-rounder also pulled up the bowlers for their lack of intensity. “Your bowling unit has become very weak suddenly. It looks like they are not going to get any wickets. After 69 for 6, Bangladesh managed to score 271. So what is all this going on?” Asked if there was a need to have different players for different formats, Lal said: “Every country is playing like that. Must have specialised cricketers for different formats. Why not have different players for different formats? All countries are doing it and India should also do the same.” PTI","pubDate":"2022-12-09 02:50:38","image_url":"https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Madan-lal-300x171.jpeg","source_id":"orissapost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PAK vs ENG 2nd Test Dream11 prediction: Fantasy cricket tips for Pakistan vs England 2nd Test match in Multan","link":"https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-pak-vs-eng-2nd-test-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-for-pakistan-vs-england-2nd-test-in-multan-sonyliv-3009334","keywords":["Sports","Cricket"],"creator":["DNA Web Team"],"video_url":null,"description":"PAK vs ENG 2nd Test Dream 11 Team - Check My Dream11 Team, Best Player's list for Pakistan vs England 2nd Test at Multan Cricket Stadium in Multan.","content":"After playing out one of the most thrilling Test matches of recent times, Pakistan and England gear up to lock horns once again in the 2nd Test at Multan. Ben Stokes' England won the previous Test in Rawalpindi by 74 runs and Babar Azam's Pakistan will surely try to level the series. As many as four England batsmen smashed centuries on Day 1 of the previous Test, with Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope and Harry Brook's heroics helping the Three Lions reach 657 runs in their first innings. Pakistan also roared back into the contest by smashing 579 runs courtesy of centuries from Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam, but England showed brave character when they declared their second innings at 264/7, and still managed to restrict the home side below the required target, minutes before the match was due to be declared a draw. After winning the first Test, Stokes said that he has 'no interest' playing for a draw, and a similar 'all in or nothing' approach would be expected from the visitors, while Babar and Co will eye revenge.

Abandon the frankly ridiculous legal processes around the question of removing the ban, and say that CA’s board has chosen to rescind Warner’s suspension because it was the same body that insisted upon it in 2018. This outcome would be humiliating for chief executive Hockley, having led a longwinded “parole” process that has ultimately stumbled down a blind alley where independent commissioners Alan Sullivan, Robert Heath and Adrian Anderson have allowed it to become a retrial. It would also expose chair Henderson and the board to accusations of burying the 2018 ball-tampering scandal at Newlands when there remains much still to be known about it all. In the public mind, this information is loaded with weight because of the enormous penalties handed down to Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft five years ago and the idea that others with similar if not total knowledge were able to avoid censure. Usman Khawaja’s dressing room assertion that the team should have taken collective responsibility still stands out. As does Greg Chappell’s admission that all participants in Australian cricket at the time were guilty in some way or another. David Warner has withdrawn from the process to review his leadership ban. Credit: AP But the removal of Warner’s ban would at the very least bring some measure of closure to an affair that has caused untold damage to the game that Hockley, Henderson and the other directors purport to serve. At the same time, it would be the first occasion in quite some time when CA’s leaders took genuine ownership of the issue, instead of hiding behind process and procedural details as has too often been the case lately.","pubDate":"2022-12-09 00:55:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND-W vs AUS-W 1st T20I Dream11 prediction: Fantasy cricket tips for India W vs Australia W 1st T20I match in Mumbai","link":"https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-ind-w-vs-aus-w-1st-t20i-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-for-india-w-vs-australia-w-1st-t20i-match-3009323","keywords":["Sports","Cricket"],"creator":["DNA Web Team"],"video_url":null,"description":"IND-W vs AUS-W 1st T20I Dream 11 Team - Check My Dream11 Team, Best Player's list for India W vs Australia W 1st T20I in Mumbai.","content":"India Women will host Australia Women in the opening T20I of the five-match series at Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy in Navi Mumbai on Friday (December 9).

The stunning first-Test win in Rawalpindi means the tourists, enjoying a revolutionary change in tack and success under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, took the field in Multan today riding the crest of a wave. Head coach McCullum and captain Stokes have revitalised the team since taking over last summer, with seven wins in eight Test matches. They reached new heights by securing a remarkable fifth-day first-Test victory in fading light having earlier piled on the runs at a remarkable rate in a bid to force a positive result. Batting coach Trescothick, who was a free-scoring all-format international opener between 2000 and 2006, believes if England continue in the same manner, next summer’s home Ashes against Australia could be fun. ‘I wish we were going into the Ashes next week,’ Trescothick said. ‘If it continues on in this form then it bodes well for a great series. Ben Stokes of England is hoping to lead the England team to victory (Picture: Getty Images) ‘As we say we do not look too far ahead in what is going on, but it is exciting no doubt about it because India series and Ashes series are the pinnacle of what we do in Test cricket.’ Trescothick was a key part of England’s famous 2005 Ashes success, but he retired from international cricket three years later for mental health reasons.

The 25-year-old did not appear in any of England’s three group stage games as they booked their place in the knockout stage with wins over Iran and Wales and a draw with USA before beating Senegal in the last 16. According to the Daily Star, White became unhappy in the England camp and struggled to mix with his fellow international team-mates before he fell out with Gareth Southgate’s No 2 Holland in front of the rest of the squad. Holland and White allegedly had a heated exchange when the defender turned up to a team meeting prior to the 0-0 draw with the USA not knowing some key information over his own personal stats with the assistant manager also angry over the player’s lack of knowledge of their American opposition. White was subsequently not included in the Arsenal squad who flew out to Dubai for a training camp as the Gunners beat Lyon 3-0 in a friendly on Thursday.

Clarke said that the Proteas would be “licking their lips”, adding that he has sympathy for Warner and the other Australian players caught up in the drama.“South Africa will be licking their lips... look at the papers today and we’re not even talking about the Sandpapergate,” he said.“This is in the lead-up. That is why I believe this is a big reason why Davey hasn’t gone through with this challenging the captaincy stuff, because he knows that if he says one thing that is off-script compared to what has been said, he puts his teammates in it. “I feel for the boys that were involved as well because, more than anyone else, that team would want this to go away. The players in that Test match would want this to go away. Cricket: David Warner has withdrawn his appeal to have his lifetime leadership ban revoked, stating it was not worth the anguish to his family and friends.“While it doesn’t, you’re walking out on the field playing with that in the back of your mind thinking, ‘Oh my God, what are we going to see when we come off for lunch? What are we going to see when we come off for tea?’. “I wonder what Davey is thinking as well. He walks out to bat while this is going on. He walks off, don’t worry about getting out for 20, he opens the newspaper or turns his phone on after the day’s play and says, ‘Here we go again’. It’s not going to end.”It was just the latest off-field distraction that has overshadowed Australia’s second Test against the West Indies, with Warner also revealing he had withdrawn a bid to overturn his leadership ban earlier in the week. In explaining that decision, Warner accused the review panel of wanting a “public lynching” should he have gone through with the appeal, adding he was “not prepared for my family to be the washing machine for cricket’s dirty laundry”.","pubDate":"2022-12-09 00:09:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Meet the 10-year-old viral prodigy taking Sydney cricket by storm","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/how-10yearold-cricket-star-kaya-kumar-is-making-people-take-notice-in-the-sydney-cricket-scene/news-story/1d10df8d4443a30b4fdecf8d78e7b933","keywords":["Sport news and galleries","Swoop","Womens Cricket"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KAYA Kumar is anything but your average 10-year-old.","content":"The Hills local is taking the local cricketing scene by storm at the moment, showing maturity well beyond her years and earning the online clicks for her ability as well.Plying her trade with the Hills Barbarians in the Parramatta junior competition, Kaya’s run-scoring exploits are making people stand up and take notice.What’s more incredible is the young dynamo is just in her third year of the sport, where she is taking on the older boys and girls.“This is my third season of playing cricket,” Kaya said.“My brother was playing when I was I was younger, and I always really liked to hit the ball.“When I first started I played U11 boys and U14s stage two with the girls.

Clarke scored just 10 less runs than Philippe in the last BBL campaign and at a better strike rate, finishing with 419 runs at a rapid rate of 151.3. But I will slot him in as emergency with Inglis – who has the round 1 bye - on-field if Clarke scores poorly in his first match. With unlimited trades until the end of round 1, I’d seriously consider bringing in Philippe if Clarke fails and downgrading elsewhere. Alternatively, I can sub Nielsen for Inglis from my batting bench.BattersMatt Short (Strikers) $197.5k BWL-BATDaniel Sams (Thunder) $179.3k BAT-BWL (VC)Alex Hales (Thunder) $130.3k BATRilee Rossouw (Thunder) $105k BATMarcus Stoinis (Stars) $83.4k BAT-BWLAaron Hardie (Scorchers) $99.6 BAT-BWLHarry Nielsen (Strikers) $62.5 BAT-WKPYou’re not taking KFC SuperCoach seriously if you don’t have Stoinis, who comes in at a draw-dropping price with the round 1 double. Short and Sams (if fit) should both have attractive all-rounder roles and two opportunities in round 1 to score big points. I have loaded up on Thunder players – who have a double-double in the first two rounds – with T20 World Cup stars Hales and Rossouw getting four opportunities to go large. Hales is a no-brainer after helping lead his country to World Cup glory with the eighth-most runs in the tournament. Rossouw is more hit and miss, but the South African has blasted two T20I tons in the past two months, so his upside is massive.CHEAPIE BIBLE: BEST KFC SUPERCOACH OPTIONS UNDER $100KBowlersRashid Khan (Strikers) $193.6k BWL (C)Trent Boult (Stars) $180k BWLColin de Grandhomme (Strikers) $125k BAT-BWLShadab Khan (Hurricanes) $125k BAT-BWLFazalhaq Farooqi (Thunder) $105k BWLMitch Swepson (Heat) $107,400 BWLCooper Connolly (Scorchers) $42.5k BAT-BWLAn all-international on-field bowling line-up, spearheaded by none other than Rashid Khan. The Afghan tweaker was just about my first picked player with the round 1 double, and his compatriot Farooqi is the late bolter. The left-arm seamer took two wickets against the Aussies at the T20 World Cup and made his IPL debut this year for Sunrisers Hyderabad. Him and de Grandhomme, who also has the round 1 double, have enticing value at their low price-tags. Shadab Khan is the only player in my XI without a first-round double, but his sensational T20 World Cup – where he consistently took wickets and went at a miserly 6.34 per over - speaks for itself. Same goes for short-form superstar Boult, who is a class above the BBL competition, and has two opportunities to skittle opponents in round 1. Swepson will occupy the bench with an eye to the Heat’s third-round double, pending the XI for the second Test against the West Indies. AL PATON’S TEAMIt’s time for some Lynnsanity in KFC SuperCoach BBL.Chris Lynn has scored more runs, and hit more sixes, than anyone in BBL history. Now he’s set to light up the Adelaide Oval after crossing from the Heat to the Strikers for BBL12.It’s fair to say Lynn didn’t have the greatest tournament last summer but his record speaks for itself, he’s just $112k and the Strikers play twice in round 1.He’s one of four Strikers in my squad alongside superstar (and likely round 1 captain) Rashid Khan, Matt Short and evergreen Peter Siddle.I have thought long and hard about “shorting” Short (as SuperCoach AFL Investor Daniel Begala would say) and I’m not very happy about spending nearly $200k on a player after a massive breakout but the real KFC SuperCoach BBL experts in here have convinced me it’s too risky to leave him out. Still, I’m not ruling out switching back to Sean Abbott, who had been in that spot for most of the past few weeks.As with others here the fixture has guided most of my selections with all but one of my starting XI on the double to start the year.Here’s how Don’t Argue is looking with a few days to go.FIXTURE GUIDE: EASY GUIDE TO NAVIGATING THE EARLY ROUNDSWicketkeepersJoe Clarke (Stars) $153,800Josh Inglis (Scorchers) $87,000I didn’t think too long about this position. Clarke is expensive but was a great scorer last summer and will likely open the batting again for the Stars. Inglis is ready and waiting for Perth’s round 2 double.BattersAlex Hales (Thunder) $130,300Daniel Sams (Thunder) $179,300 BAT-BWLChris Lynn (Strikers) $112,200Marcus Stoinis (Stars) $83,400 BAT-BWLShadab Khan (Hurricanes) $125,000 BAT-BWLTim David (Hurricanes) $89,700Josh Brown (Heat) $42,000Stoinis was my first-picked player, and Sams wasn’t far behind - but I’ll be watching the Thunder teams closely after talk of an injury niggle. Hales smashed 86 off 47 against India in the T20 World Cup final although his more recent scores aren’t as inspiring - 0, 0, 6, 17, 1 in his past five for Abu Dhabi. Still, he gets four chances at the crease in the first two rounds. Shadab Khan and Tim David should make me plenty of money even though Hobard doesn’t have a double until round 8.BowlersMatt Short (Strikers) $197,400 BAT-BWLRashid Khan (Striker) $193,600Trent Boult (Stars) $180,000Peter Siddle (Strikers) $151,300Adam Zampa (Stars) $103,600Will Sutherland (Renegades) $62,500 BAT-BWLFazalhaq Farooqi (Thunder) $105,000The ageless Siddle is a long-time favourite and he came straight in after re-signing with the Strikers last week. Zampa is one of the world’s best white-ball spinners and can form a nice partnership with Kiwi destroyer Boult. I’ll put the emergency on Farooqi for the first game and if he brains it I can trade one of those Strikers to one of the Scorchers’ star bowlers to get ahead for round 2. ISA GUHA’S TEAMI am back playing KFC SuperCoach BBL and I have one man in my sights: KFC SuperCoach Ambassador and my Fox Cricket colleague, Mike Hussey.But I know I have my work cut out for me trying to compete with Mr SuperCoach.I have tended to lose my way in the last couple of seasons with uncertainty around teams and grounds but I’m ready to take it all the way this season and follow in the footsteps of Shane Warne. Starting strong has never been an issue, and I have loaded up on options playing twice in the opening round to give me the best chance of success.Here is how my starting side is shaping up for the KFC SuperCoach BBL season.WicketkeepersJosh Philippe (Sixers) WKP-BAT $166,300Josh Inglis (Scorchers) WKP-BAT $87,000Two of the most destructive players in the BBL in recent times make up my keeping ranks. Philippe is very consistent and he generally starts BBL seasons strongly, while Inglis has just spent a lot of the time on the bench at the T20 World Cup – I expect him to be raring to go for the Scorchers’ after a round 1 bye. BattersDaniel Sams (Thunder) $179,300 BAT-BWLAlex Hales (Thunder) $130,300 BATRilee Rossouw (Thunder) $105,000 BATJake Weatherald (Strikers) $87,100 BATMarcus Stoinis (Stars) $83,400 BAT-BWLHarry Nielson (Strikers) $62,500 BAT-WKPJosh Brown (Heat) $42,000 BATAll of my on-field batters play twice in the opening round. Hales is self-explanatory after scoring more runs than any player in the last three BBL seasons, along with his triumphant return for England at the T20 World Cup. Rossouw is coming off a big World Cup hundred and is very cheap, while Sams is a reliable all-rounder who scores points with both bat and ball.Meanwhile, Weatherald is my first-round punt. He didn’t have the best return in his last BBL campaign but he is a cheap option who can come off – and he has just five per cent ownership in KFC SuperCoach BBL. Stoinis picks himself at that price and he can offer with both bat and ball.BowlersMatt Short (Strikers) $197,500 BWL-BATRashid Khan (Strikers) $193,600 BWL (C)Trent Boult (Stars) $180,000 BWLAndre Russell (Renegades) $145,000 BWL-BATAdam Zampa (Stars) $103,600 BWLWill Sutherland (Renegades) $62,000 BWL-BATLance Morris (Scorchers) $62,500 BWLThe toughest call in my starting side is Andre Russell vs Shadab Khan. The Pakistan all-rounder had a brilliant World Cup, but Russell has plenty of potential with his batting strike rate and wicket-taking. I am not sure where the Renegades will bat Russell, but I think I will start him and then switch to Khan later in the season.Short opens the batting and was getting through four overs with the ball last season – a role that screams KFC SuperCoach BBL points. His teammate Khan will be my round 1 captain. The Afghan tweaker is high quality: he takes wickets, keeps things tight and can go at an amazing strike rate with the blade.Boult can take wickets at the start of the innings and is very good at the death, which is key for any successful bowler in KFC SuperCoach BBL. One of the best T20 leg spinners in world cricket rounds out my team in Zampa, who is coming off strong World Cup and one-day form.FIVE NEW INTERNATIONALS TO WATCHAll Big Bash fans and KFC SuperCoach players know Rashid Khan, Andre Russell, Alex Hales, James Vince and Colin Munro.But what about the international imports playing in their first BBL tournament?Isa Guha outlines five new faces to watch and what they can offer in KFC SuperCoach BBL.Faf du Plessis (Scorchers) $180,000 BATI’ve watched a lot of du Plessis in the T20 format and he is superb against both pace and spin. The South African superstar brings a wealth of experience to the Scorchers and can get their batting innings off to a good start - and that means big points in KFC SuperCoach. Du Plessis has a bye first up, but will be the No.1 trade target ahead of the Scorchers’ round 2 double.Shadab Khan (Hurricanes) $125,000 BAT-BWLKhan is one of Pakistan’s best limited overs players. He offers so much with the ball with his leg spin and bowled some key overs in the World Cup, where he took 11 wickets. Outside of the powerplay he can keep things tight and pick up wickets and he is more traditional as a leg-spinner than his namesake, Rashid Khan. With the bat he has been used as high as number three in the Pakistan Super League and he has been shuffled up the order as a pinch-hitter for his country as well.Zak Crawley (Hurricanes) $125,000 BATCrawley is still finding his way in Test cricket but a run-a-ball ton in the first Test in Pakistan might be the catalyst he needs to dominate again. In the short format, he has been outstanding domestically where he knows his game pretty well. Crawley is a very good player of the short ball so I think he’ll enjoy these pitches. He won’t be available until at least round 4-5 but watch out for him once he joins the Hurricanes camp.Luke Wood (Stars) $105,000 BAT-BWLI have watched him a lot domestically and for England as well. The opening bowler is a good left arm option for the Stars with his aggression, skiddy bounce and array of slower balls.Fazalhaq Farooqi (Thunder) $105,000 BWLWatch out for Fazalhaq Farooqi from Afghanistan, an overseas replacement player for Englishman David Willey. A skiddy bowler, Farooqi has good pace and can bowl well at the death.","pubDate":"2022-12-08 22:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pace turmoil with latest setback and it’s not Cummins","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-v-west-indies-follow-all-the-action-from-day-2-of-the-daynight-test-in-adelaide/news-story/f0d0c37e914a07a311ccf9b442137710","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Josh Hazlewood is in extreme doubt for the first Test against South Africa in Brisbane next week and possibly beyond, after being ruled out of Adelaide for a second straight year with a side strain.","content":"Michael Neser was ushered in at the 11th hour as Hazlewood’s replacement in an attack already missing Pat Cummins, after the big-right armer pulled up sore from bowling for 25 minutes in the nets on match-eve before being sent for scans.Cummins is expected to be fully recovered from a minor quad strain for the opening Test against South Africa starting on Saturday week, but there is far less certainty over when Hazlewood might return this summer after Cricket Australia confirmed he has suffered a low range left side strain.Aus v Win fact boxIt’s a major blow to Australia and Hazlewood — who after injuring his side against England in the first Test of last summer, missed the rest of the campaign.“He pulled up pretty sore in his left side after the final day there in Perth,” Cummins said of Hazlewood in commentary for Fox Cricket.“(He had) a roll yesterday to make sure he was all good and pulled up a little bit sore again.“He went off for a scan this morning, he’s got a small, very minor left side strain.“It’s quite different to the one last year, so we’ll manage him over the next little bit, but unfortunate for Joshy, he misses this one.”Cummins said in the end common sense prevailed with his own quad strain.SCBBL PROMO“I was a bit too optimistic. It’s about a 7-10 day injury the physio is telling me and today is day six today so it was a bit high risk. I got close, I felt good but a bit too high risk,” Cummins said on Fox.“Not only for myself, but if I go down early, Starcy (and the other overs, I) put more overs into them than you’d like. So that’s the flow on effect.”Hazlewood has yet to be scratched for Brisbane and will be assessed in the coming days, but it’s more than likely he won’t be rushed back, with only five days’ between the two series.There is a massive year ahead for Australian cricket and Hazlewood is crucial.Based on last year’s experience, it’s possible Hazlewood may have played his last Test for the summer.It means that despite Scott Boland and Neser getting the nod in Adelaide, there is a chance Lance “The Wild Thing” Morris is a possibility to make his Test debut at the Gabba if selectors believe his express 150km/h pace could cause havoc on the fast Brisbane wicket.Mark Waugh said on Fox Cricket he was surprised Morris wasn’t backed in for Adelaide.“I thought they might’ve went with him ahead of Neser given that he’s got that extra pace. (Scott) Boland and Neser are a similar sort of pace,” Waugh said on Fox Cricket. “It would’ve been tempting (to pick Morris). They’ve brought him into the squad so he’s obviously on the radar which is a good sign for morris.“150km/h under lights — he would’ve been a handful.”However, the Gabba is Queenslander Neser’s home ground and he may be backed in for back-to-back Tests if Hazlewood is unable to recover.The circumstances of Cummins and Hazlewood being withdrawn from the same Test in Adelaide is eerily similar to what happened last summer, when Australia was forced to bring in Jhye Richardson and Neser at the 11th hour.Watch Australia v West Indies.

Also, with Azhar Ali and Agha Salman looking comfortable at the crease while batting at individual scores of over 30+, the Babar Azam-led side were in with a realistic chance to notch-up a memorable win during the first Test at Rawalpindi, with only 86 runs required to win in the final session of the Test and five wickets in the bank. However, the two lone England fast bowlers in the match – Ollie Robinson (22-6-50-4) and James Anderson (24-12-36-4), managed to extract significant reverse swing to scalp four Pakistani wickets in the session, to leave no option for the last opening pair, but to go for the seemingly unlikely draw. The pair of Naseem Shah (6 off 46) and Mohammad Ali (0* off 26) did stand their ground for some good half-an-hour of a block fest, while doing everything they could – from change of gloves to loo break as well all this while, but ultimately Jack Leach trapped Naseem in front of the wickets to help England win only their third Test on Pakistan soil. R Ashwin expresses awe of James Anderson India’s off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, on Thursday, was all in praise of the veteran, 40-year-old English bowler James Anderson for his bowling master class on display during the final session, on the Rawalpindi pitch which was nothing short of a graveyard for the bowlers. Commending Anderson via his Youtube channel, Ashwin reminisced Anderson’s similar reverse bowling skills on display during the Chennai Test last year in February, when he had castled the likes of Shubman Gill and Ajinkya Rahane in the second innings to help England win the contest against India by 227 runs. ALSO READ: Mark Waugh thrilled for The Ashes 2023 after England’s memorable win in Rawalpindi “He (Anderson) bowled a brilliant spell in Chennai in the last innings. His reverse swing to Shubman Gill and Ajinkya Rahane cleaned bowled them. Jimmy Anderson, take a bow. When it comes to Test format, his pinpoint accuracy, adaptability, ability to bring reverse swing into play, and all those subtle changes. Only a guy with so much experience and skill can do that,” exclaimed Ashwin. For more Cricket-related news, click here.

Expressing anguish over India’s miserable run in white ball cricket, former seamer Prasad urged the think tank to make “tough calls”, while Virender Sehwag urged Rohit Sharma and Co to “wake up”. In his usual quirky style, Sehwag took to Twitter to describe his anguish: “Cryptos se bhi tez gir rahi hai apni performance yaar. (Our performance is falling faster than cryptos). Need to shake up – wake up.” India earlier lost 0-1 to New Zealand in a rain-curtailed ODI series. Playing non-stop cricket, the star-studded Indian batters looked out of place while bowling has been below par. That India have not won a major ICC title since their Champions Trophy triumph in 2013 was once again highlighted by Prasad. “India is innovating in so many fields across the world. But when it comes to playing Limited overs cricket, our approach is a decade old,” Prasad wrote in a series of tweets. “England after the 2015 WC first round exit took tough calls and turned around to become such an exciting team, India need to take tough calls… “And change approach drastically. We haven’t won a T20 WC since the IPL started & last 5 years have been poor in ODI’s apart from winning inconsequential bilateral. “Haven’t learned from our mistakes for too long and far from being an exciting team in limited overs cricket.

Their 199-run collaboration for the unbroken fourth wicket helped Australia overcome a wobble in the second session, when they lost two quick wickets, and stay on course for a 2-0 series sweep. Labuschagne, who scored 204 and 104 not out in the opening Test in Perth, hit 11 boundaries in his unbeaten 120. Head’s breezy 114 was his first hundred at his home ground and included 12 fours. Australia rested regular skipper Pat Cummins because of a quadricep strain. Fellow quick Josh Hazlewood was ruled out with a side strain which makes him doubtful for the start of the subsequent series against South Africa. Stand-in skipper Steve Smith elected to bat against an injury-ravaged West Indies side who had to make four changes to the squad that suffered a comprehensive defeat in Perth. David Warner (21) smashed Alzarri Joseph for three fours in an over but squandered a fine start by chasing a wild delivery from the bowlers only to be caught behind. Opening partner Usman Khawaja (62) completed 1000 runs for the calendar year and was looking in great touch before West Indies struck back with two quick wickets after the lunch break. Debutant Devon Thomas dismissed Khawaja lbw with an angling delivery, a decision Khawaja challenged but could not reverse. In the next over, Jason Holder stooped in his follow through to take a return catch from Smith, who fell for an eight-ball duck. Head joined Labuschagne to punish a depleted West Indies attack missing the injured trio of Kyle Mayers, Kemar Roach and Jayden Seales. As if that was not bad enough, debutant paceman Marquino Mindley bowled only two overs before leaving the field with a suspected hamstring injury. Labuschagne, currently the top-ranked Test batsman, shrugged off a slow start and hit Thomas to the point boundary to bring up his third successive century of the series. Head, who fell for 99 in Perth, could not be denied his hundred either and the left-hander reached the mark with a boundary off Joseph. “It’s probably one of the better ones, it’s very nice,” Head told Cricket Australia and also heaped praise on Labuschagne. “A chanceless hundred from Marnus. He’s played beautifully. He’s come and done it in challenging conditions and with a short turnaround.” —Agencies 2nd Test: Labuschagne, Head centuries for Australia deflate depleted West Indies added by KR Desk on 12:34 am December 9, 2022 View all posts by KR Desk → KR Desk Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-08 19:04:47","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"2nd Test: England recall Mark Wood, Ollie Pope retains keeper’s gloves against Pakistan","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/12/09/2nd-test-england-recall-mark-wood-ollie-pope-retains-keepers-gloves-against-pakistan/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["KR Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"KARACHI: England have replaced injured all-rounder Liam Livingstone with fast bowler Mark Wood in the only change to their squad for the second Test against Pakistan, with Ollie Pope retaining the wicketkeeper’s gloves.

Wood missed the first Test as he continued his recovery from a hip injury. Ben Foakes, who missed the opener with illness, is now fully fit but England skipper Ben Stokes confirmed that Pope, who made 108 in the first innings in Rawalpindi, will continue behind the wicket because of his superior batting. “I’ll still keep saying that he (Foakes) is the best keeper in the world,” Stokes said on the eve of the match, which begins on Friday. “It must sound silly to not be picking him but you got to see the conditions we face here.

FirstCricket Staff December 9th, 2022 0:03:53 IST Security personnel stand guard as England cricketers and team officials travel on a bus in Karachi after landing in Pakistan for a three-Test series. AFP The England team were in for a minor security scare ahead of the second Test against Pakistan in Multan after gunshots were heard not far from where the teams are staying. England are playing a Test series on Pakistani soil for the first time in 17 years and both the home and away teams have been under heavy security cover since the start of the series in Rawalpindi. According to a report on The Independent , the gunshot sounds were the result of a fight that broke out between rival gangs in the southern Punjab city, the gunfight taking place around a kilometre from where the English and Pakistani teams are staying. The report added that Pakistani police have made up to four arrests in the case. The gunshots have apparently not affected Ben Stokes and company’s preparation for the second Test, which starts on Friday. The Brendon McCullum-coached side are currently leading the series after a memorable victory in the series opener at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, where Stokes and Co smashed more than 500 runs on a dramatic opening day. They would make a bold declaration on Day 4 to set a challenging, but not impossible target of 343 and would ultimately bundle the hosts out to register a 71-run win under fading light in the final session of the final day. England had played both Tests and ODIs the last time they toured Pakistan in 2005, with veteran pacer James Anderson the only member of that English side featuring in the current series. Pakistan would win both the Tests (2-0) and ODIs (3-2). International cricket would come to a halt after an attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore in 2009, and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) would be forced to host Pakistan’s home games in the UAE. No international team would visit Pakistan for the next six years until Zimbabwe showed up in 2015 for two T20Is and three ODIs. Since then, every Test-playing side barring India has travelled to Pakistan, with Australia winning the three-Test series against Babar Azam and Co 1-0 in their first trip to the country since 1998.

It is like IPL cricket in our country. In a match of the current season, Sri Lankan player Shamika Karunaratne unexpectedly lost his teeth while catching the ball. Accidents like this happen very rarely on the cricket field. It seems that Karunaratne has lost four of his teeth. This has been confirmed by the Kandy Falcons team he is playing in this league series. The accident took place during a match held last Tuesday. The incident took place when the Galle Gladiators team player took the opportunity to catch Fernando. That catch came from a very high position. Just as he catches it, the ball hits his mouth. Despite the pain, he made the catch. Later, after bleeding from the mouth, the medical team rushed to the field and examined him. He then left the field. It is reported that he has been treated. The team reported that four of his teeth were broken in the accident.","pubDate":"2022-12-08 17:15:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Michael Clarke blasts Cricket Australia, says David Warner was made scapegoat in leadership review","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/michael-clarke-blasts-cricket-australia-says-david-warner-was-made-scapegoat-in-leadership-review-2022-12-08-829776","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Australia captain Michael Clarke has accused his country's cricket board of making David Warner the \"scapegoat\" in its messy handling of his captaincy ban following the ball-tampering scandal.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-08 16:58:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cummins throws support behind Warner","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/cummins-throws-support-behind-warner-c-9105810","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pat Cummins says Australia's players are behind David Warner amid his fury with Cricket Australia's independent review panel.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-08 16:36:31","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-9105810/995ba3111b11dadb77d4e9e81f49d5da8ef2f7f3-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Darts players are ‘better in bed than any other sports stars’ but table tennis aces have terrible sex reputation","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/9893394/sex-sport-darts-best-table-tennis-worst/","keywords":["Sport","Darts","Football","Sex","Tennis"],"creator":["Ian Tuckey"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"DARTS players are better known for trying to go a leg up than get one over - but new research shows they are double top for sex.

FirstCricket Staff December 8th, 2022 21:05:01 IST File image of the India women's cricket team. Image: Asian Cricket Council The India women’s cricket team are set to play in front of their home crowd again after a while on the road as they take on world champions Australia in a five-match T20I series starting Friday. The Indian team returns to action on home soil after more than a year, having last played in their backyard against South Africa in March last year, which incidentally was also their first taste of cricketing action since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic. The ‘Women in Blue’ would tour England and Australia later that year, achieving mixed results in both. The team had travelled to New Zealand for a bilateral series earlier this year before the World Cup, where they failed to reach the semi-finals after finishing fifth in the round-robin group stage, just outside the qualification zone. Then-captain Mithali Raj would announce her retirement not long after the event, bringing the curtains down on a glittering career spanning more than two decades. India however, would bounce back from the World Cup disappointment by winning both the ODI and T20I legs in their tour of Sri Lanka before winning the silver medal in the women’s cricket competition at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. Their England trip would get even sweeter as they would go on to whitewash the three-match ODI series against the 2017 ODI world champions that followed right after CWG. And in their most recent outing, India powered their way to a seventh Asia Cup title, outplaying Sri Lanka in the final in Sylhet. Ahead of the five-match series against Australia, with all the games taking place in and around Mumbai, we take a look at the live telecast and other important details: When will the first T20I between India and Australia take place? The first T20I between India and Australia will take place on Friday, 9 December. Where will the first T20I between India and Australia be held? The first T20I between India and Australia will be held at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra. What time will the first T20I between India and Australia begin? The first T20I between India and Australia will start at 7 pm IST. Toss will take place half an hour before start of play. How can I watch the first T20I between India and Australia?

The hosts have managed to take an unassailable 2-0 lead over the Rohit Sharma-led unit in the three-ODI series. The performance of the Indian top order has also come under the scanner, with several people wondering if the Men in Blue need to change their playing XI.Former cricketer-turned-commentator Vivek Razdan has weighed in on the debate and asked the selectors to “stop experimenting”. Razdan gave the example of star batter Virat Kohli, who has been struggling against the Bangladesh bowling attack, just months after being the highest run-scorer at the T20 World Cup in Australia.“I would like to make just one suggestion. Stop experimenting,” Razdan commented while on air during the second India-Bangladesh ODI in Dhaka. “In the past few months, we have seen this happening. Time to halt this line of thinking. There’s been too much experimentation. Still there’s a lot of time before the ODI World Cup.”He also asked the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) to keep playing cricketers who are in form. “Look at Virat Kohli – he was in good form at the T20 World Cup but then you rested him for the New Zealand tour. Now, he has started struggling again” Razdan added.He asked the selectors to keep in mind that the ICC World Cup is just months away and the team for the first match at least should have been finalised by now.India’s recent performance in ODIs:The Indian team has had a disappointing few months. After enduring a heartbreaking loss in the T20 World Cup semi-finals in Australia, many members of the team made their way to New Zealand for a T20 and ODI series. While big names like Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, and Virat Kohli were rested for the tour, the ODI team was captained by Shikhar Dhawan. The Men in Blue lost the ODI series 1-0 after two fixtures were abandoned due to rain.The two consecutive losses in Bangladesh mark India’s second ODI series defeat within a month.The team will face off against Bangladesh for the third and final ODI on 10 December at Chattogram’s Sher-e-Bangla stadium.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Speaking to Channel 7, he admitted to former teammate Matthew Hayden that he still struggles if he hears Warne’s voice on television.

Consistent number three Labuschagne smacked 204 then 104 not out at the first Test in Perth to overtake England’s Joe Root this week as the world’s top-ranked Test batsman. And he carried that form to Adelaide with a patient unbeaten 120 to again torment the Caribbean team, as the hosts amassed 330-3 by stumps. The chanceless Head was not out 114, relieved at converting to three figures after he was out for 99 in the first Test. The visitors, who are missing three first-choice bowlers, enjoyed some success on a flat track that offered little for the fast bowlers, removing David Warner (21), Usman Khawaja (62), and captain Steve Smith for a duck. Khawaja surpassed 1,000 Test runs for the year in his knock, becoming only the third man in 2022 to hit the landmark after Root and fellow Englishman Jonny Bairstow, who have both played more matches. He departed lbw to debutant Devon Thomas, who earned his first Test wicket. Like Labuschagne, Smith smacked 200 in Perth but he only lasted eight balls, caught and bowled by Jason Holder, while Warner nicked Alzarri Joseph to wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva. The home side, who have won every day-night Test they have contested, including six-from-six in Adelaide, are looking to wrap up the two-match series after winning the opener by 164 runs. Both sides were without key players. Australian pace spearheads Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood were ruled out, with Scott Boland and Michael Neser replacing them. Three West Indian mainstays were also omitted injured, with allrounder Kyle Mayers joining fast bowlers Kemar Roach and Jayden Seales on the sidelines. Anderson Phillip, Marquino Mindley and Thomas started instead, with the latter two on debut. But in another setback, Mindley, who only arrived in Adelaide on Tuesday after a dash from Jamaica, lasted just two overs before limping off to have a scan for a hamstring problem. Their situation is so dire that former Test player Omar Phillips, who was playing club cricket in Australia, was rushed to Adelaide to serve as an emergency fielder. On a fine but cool day, Smith won the toss and batted, looking to build a big score. Warner initially bided his time, but then unleashed in the ninth over with three sumptuous fours off Joseph. But, like in the first Test, the left-hander’s desire for quick runs cost him. He was caught behind by Da Silva after slashing at another wide Joseph delivery and getting a nick. Khawaja was just getting in his stride when Thomas pounced, with the Australian late to react as the ball rocketed into his pads. Smith was undone by good reflexes from the lanky Holder, who got down low to collect a catch off his own bowling. As they departed, Labuschagne remained defiant, picking off boundaries and running well between the wicket to bring up a 10th Test century, crunching a four through the covers off Thomas as the bowlers ran out of ideas. Head, on his home ground, was equally composed in making a fifth century, also converting with a boundary off Joseph. – AFP The post Head, Labuschagne slam centuries as Australia take charge against Windies appeared first on Kuwait Times.","pubDate":"2022-12-08 14:55:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","country":["Kuwait"],"category":["sports"],"language":"arabic"},{"title":"Milestones galore as Marnus, Head take full control | Australia v West Indies 2022-23 - cricket.com.au","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9eWdtMnpNbjJRTWfSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Milestones galore as Marnus, Head take full control | Australia v West Indies 2022-23  cricket.com.auRecent Match Report - Australia vs West Indies 2nd Test 2022/23  ESPNcricinfoLabuschagne, Head hundreds sink hamstrung West Indies | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  Cricbuzz'My discipline was very good': Marnus on third-straight ton | Australia v West Indies 2022-23  cricket.com.auLabuschagne, Head lead strong batting display to tune out off-field noise  ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-08 14:50:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Western Province’s Tony de Zorzi not taking red-hot form for granted","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/domestic/western-provinces-tony-de-zorzi-not-taking-red-hot-form-for-granted-8efffb4a-bf7c-40bb-b0a8-dce40b47140e","keywords":null,"creator":["Zaahier Adams"],"video_url":null,"description":"Tony de Zorzi says he is enjoying his cricket at the moment, and doing his best to keep his feet on the ground.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-08 14:06:04","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/8a61cf47-11c5-5f7f-a08d-8320fb04b2eb&operation=CROP&offset=0x272&resize=5184x2912","source_id":"iol","country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
