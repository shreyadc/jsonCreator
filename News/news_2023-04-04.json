The victory took South Africa into eighth and the final qualification spot in the International Cricket Council’s World Cup Super League table. Ireland must win all three of their games against Bangladesh from 9-14 May to match South Africa’s 98 points. Net run-rate would then decide who progresses to the World Cup. The other side will join two-time World Cup winners West Indies in the qualifiers, which take place in Zimbabwe between 18 June and 9 July. Sri Lanka, led by former England head coach Chris Silverwood, are already in the qualifiers, alongside the Netherlands, Zimbabwe, Nepal, Oman and Scotland. Ireland or South Africa will join them, alongside two other sides who are already competing in a qualifying tournament. Two sides will qualify for the tournament proper, which takes place in India and will see England try to defend the crown they won at Lord’s in 2019 with a dramatic super-over win over New Zealand. South Africa posted their 11th-highest ODI score of 370-8 against the Dutch, thanks to Aiden Markam’s 175 off 126 balls and David Miller’s 61-ball 91. It was a maiden ODI ton for captain Markram, with his score South Africa’s sixth-highest individual total in the format.

CA has announced an increase in payments for all centrally contracted cricketers, with female players the big winners with a boost of almost 66 per cent. Notably, women’s cricket leagues are becoming popular all over the world, and with the successful opening edition of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in India, the competition has increased. Therefore, to ensure that the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) remain competitive, AC has doubled the salary cap of WBBL to AUD$ 732,000 per team. Earlier this year , Australia’s Women’s team won a record-breaking sixth ICC Women’s T20 World Cup title in South Africa and Meg Lanning’s side also tasted success in 2022 when they collected the ICC Women’s World Cup trophy for the seventh time with a commanding victory over England in the final in New Zealand “I think we will have a few of them [earning a million] in the next few years,” Australia Cricketers’ Association CEO Todd Greenberg was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo. After the new MoU, many Australian Female Cricketers will come under the million-dollar bracket considering they are earning well in overseas countries as well. The players who are centrally contracted can now earn AUD $800,000 by combining national and WBBL deals. Australian Female cricketers’ 75 per cent earning comes from WBBL and Domestic tournaments i.e. The Women’s National Cricket League, now will be AUD 151,000. The Australia Cricketers’ Association CEO, said, “Some of our girls who are playing in India earn significant amounts of money in the WPL, and on top of this deal now, they will become million-dollar athletes. And so they should because they are the best in the world at what they do.” “Unashamedly we stand here and want them to be remunerated at the levels that we are talking about. That is a wonderful thing, not only for those athletes but for every girl who wants to make a choice of what sport they want to play. Cricket is that choice and it’s where you can achieve those things,” ACA CEO added. CA also announced that they will rise the women’s national contract list from 15 to 18 paying a 25 per cent increase in their salaries. Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley was thrilled he was able to announce the new deal and believes female cricket will continue to grow even further within Australia and around the world. “Cricket now clearly offers the best earning opportunities of any team sport for elite female sportspeople,” CA CEO Nick Hockley said in an official statement released by Cricket Australia. “I am particularly pleased that this MoU represents another major step forward in the rise of women’s cricket with significant increases in remuneration for the inspirational role models of the world champion Australian women’s team and the WBBL, who are driving substantial growth in female participation,” he added. In this MoU, male cricketers Big Bash League (BBL) salary scale has been hiked by AU$ 1 Million which will increase their pay from AUD$2 million to AUD$3million, and for players who will be in centrally-contracted, their pay has also risen to 7.5% and the team strength will also be lifted up to 24 players in each team. Contracted male cricketers in Australia will receive an increase of 9.5 per cent as part of the new deal, with the number of contracted players rising from 20 to 24.

While MI captain Rohit’s IPL rut continued getting out for 1 off 10 balls, Kohli enjoyed an explosive start to the season cracking an unbeaten 82 to guide RCB to a comprehensive 8-wicket win. Kohli smashed the 50th IPL half-century of his career to join en elite list and put behind the ghosts of IPL 2022 in style. Kohli and Faf du Plessis’ half-century gave RCB a roaring start in chase of MI’s 172-run target and the team chased it down in just 16.2 overs to send MI and the rest of the IPL teams a strong statement. But while Kohli flourished, Rohit struggled and this once again led to a Twitter war between the fans of the two stalwarts of Indian cricket. Rohit was trolled for being unfit as he looked woefully out of touch during his 10-ball stay. He was beaten outside off, for pace and even had a catch dropped of him before finally edging one to Dinesh Karthik. Later, when Kohli walked out to bat and his batting looked nothing like Rohit, the IPL sent out a poll, which stated: “Who will score more runs this IPL – Kohli or Rohit” It did not take long for the public to come to a verdict as they sided with Kohli with 67 percent, while Rohit received just 33. This further fuelled the debate between the two on social media. While the Kohli vs Rohit debate gained steam on the internet, former India coach Ravi Shastri, on commentary duties gave his two cents on the topic and addressed the burning Kohli vs Rohit in IPL 2023 topic. “The fact that he has to bat long and deep will allow him to get those volume of runs. On the other hand, with Rohit Sharma, you will see some short bursts, some match-winning bursts but in terms of volume, Virat will get a lot of runs this season,” he said on air. Both Kohli and Rohit will have a point to prove in this edition of the IPL. Their fate in the Indian T20I setup all but sealed, Kohli, opening the innings, showed just how good he can be when in full flow. Struggling for form throughout last year, Kohli endured three first-ball ducks, and despite scoring a couple of fifties, lacked fluency. This year, if the opening fixture from last evening is any indication, expect a rip-roaring season from Kohli, who still holds the record for most runs in a single edition of the IPL with 973 runs. Rohit on the other hand, seems to be having a tougher job among the two. He went the whole of IPL 2022 without scoring a single half-century and began this year without much difference. Furthermore, under Rohit’s captaincy, this is the 11th straight IPL season opener that MI have lost and although they have won five titles while being stuck in this pattern, both Rohit and MI would want to snap out of it.

The memorial will be built at the location where MS Dhoni’s historic winning six had landed in the stands. He also said that MCA will approach MS Dhoni, India’s then-skipper in 2011 triumph for the inauguration of the memorial. MCA is hopeful that Dhoni will inaugurate the memorial when he is in Mumbai for his Indian Premier League (IPL) team Chennai Super Kings (CSK) match against Mumbai Indians (MI), which will take place on April 8. The date is yet not finalised as it will completely depend on MS Dhoni’s consent and availability. “MCA will also felicitate MS Dhoni when he inaugurates the World Cup Victory Memorial in Wankhede Stadium,” concluded Kale. India defeated Sri Lanka in the final by six wickets in the summit clash at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. After batting first, Sri Lanka posted 274/6 in their 50 overs. An unbeaten century from Mahela Jayawardene (103*) and knocks from skipper Kumar Sangakkara (48), Nuwan Kulasekara (32) and Thisara Perera (22*) powered Lanka to a competitive total. Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan took two wickets each and Harbhajan Singh took one wicket. Chasing 275, India lost Sehwag (0) and Tendulkar (18) early. But an 83-run stand between Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli (35) revived India’s chances. Gambhir went on to score 97 in 122 balls and had a 109-run stand for the fourth wicket with skipper MS Dhoni, who ended at an unbeaten 91* off 79 balls. Dhoni and Yuvraj (21*) had an unbeaten 54-run stand for the fifth wicket that guided Team India to their first World Cup title in 28 years.

The victory took South Africa into eighth and the final qualification spot in the International Cricket Council’s World Cup Super League table. Ireland must win all three of their games against Bangladesh from 9-14 May to match South Africa’s 98 points. Net run-rate would then decide who progresses to the World Cup. The other side will join two-time World Cup winners West Indies in the qualifiers, which take place in Zimbabwe between 18 June and 9 July. Sri Lanka, led by former England head coach Chris Silverwood, are already in the qualifiers, alongside the Netherlands, Zimbabwe, Nepal, Oman and Scotland. Ireland or South Africa will join them, alongside two other sides who are already competing in a qualifying tournament. Two sides will qualify for the tournament proper, which takes place in India and will see England try to defend the crown they won at Lord’s in 2019 with a dramatic super-over win over New Zealand. South Africa posted their 11th-highest ODI score of 370-8 against the Dutch, thanks to Aiden Markam’s 175 off 126 balls and David Miller’s 61-ball 91. It was a maiden ODI ton for captain Markram, with his score South Africa’s sixth-highest individual total in the format.

CA has announced an increase in payments for all centrally contracted cricketers, with female players the big winners with a boost of almost 66 per cent. Notably, women’s cricket leagues are becoming popular all over the world, and with the successful opening edition of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in India, the competition has increased. Therefore, to ensure that the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) remain competitive, AC has doubled the salary cap of WBBL to AUD$ 732,000 per team. Earlier this year , Australia’s Women’s team won a record-breaking sixth ICC Women’s T20 World Cup title in South Africa and Meg Lanning’s side also tasted success in 2022 when they collected the ICC Women’s World Cup trophy for the seventh time with a commanding victory over England in the final in New Zealand “I think we will have a few of them [earning a million] in the next few years,” Australia Cricketers’ Association CEO Todd Greenberg was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo. After the new MoU, many Australian Female Cricketers will come under the million-dollar bracket considering they are earning well in overseas countries as well. The players who are centrally contracted can now earn AUD $800,000 by combining national and WBBL deals. Australian Female cricketers’ 75 per cent earning comes from WBBL and Domestic tournaments i.e. The Women’s National Cricket League, now will be AUD 151,000. The Australia Cricketers’ Association CEO, said, “Some of our girls who are playing in India earn significant amounts of money in the WPL, and on top of this deal now, they will become million-dollar athletes. And so they should because they are the best in the world at what they do.” “Unashamedly we stand here and want them to be remunerated at the levels that we are talking about. That is a wonderful thing, not only for those athletes but for every girl who wants to make a choice of what sport they want to play. Cricket is that choice and it’s where you can achieve those things,” ACA CEO added. CA also announced that they will rise the women’s national contract list from 15 to 18 paying a 25 per cent increase in their salaries. Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley was thrilled he was able to announce the new deal and believes female cricket will continue to grow even further within Australia and around the world. “Cricket now clearly offers the best earning opportunities of any team sport for elite female sportspeople,” CA CEO Nick Hockley said in an official statement released by Cricket Australia. “I am particularly pleased that this MoU represents another major step forward in the rise of women’s cricket with significant increases in remuneration for the inspirational role models of the world champion Australian women’s team and the WBBL, who are driving substantial growth in female participation,” he added. In this MoU, male cricketers Big Bash League (BBL) salary scale has been hiked by AU$ 1 Million which will increase their pay from AUD$2 million to AUD$3million, and for players who will be in centrally-contracted, their pay has also risen to 7.5% and the team strength will also be lifted up to 24 players in each team. Contracted male cricketers in Australia will receive an increase of 9.5 per cent as part of the new deal, with the number of contracted players rising from 20 to 24.

While MI captain Rohit’s IPL rut continued getting out for 1 off 10 balls, Kohli enjoyed an explosive start to the season cracking an unbeaten 82 to guide RCB to a comprehensive 8-wicket win. Kohli smashed the 50th IPL half-century of his career to join en elite list and put behind the ghosts of IPL 2022 in style. Kohli and Faf du Plessis’ half-century gave RCB a roaring start in chase of MI’s 172-run target and the team chased it down in just 16.2 overs to send MI and the rest of the IPL teams a strong statement. But while Kohli flourished, Rohit struggled and this once again led to a Twitter war between the fans of the two stalwarts of Indian cricket. Rohit was trolled for being unfit as he looked woefully out of touch during his 10-ball stay. He was beaten outside off, for pace and even had a catch dropped of him before finally edging one to Dinesh Karthik. Later, when Kohli walked out to bat and his batting looked nothing like Rohit, the IPL sent out a poll, which stated: “Who will score more runs this IPL – Kohli or Rohit” It did not take long for the public to come to a verdict as they sided with Kohli with 67 percent, while Rohit received just 33. This further fuelled the debate between the two on social media. While the Kohli vs Rohit debate gained steam on the internet, former India coach Ravi Shastri, on commentary duties gave his two cents on the topic and addressed the burning Kohli vs Rohit in IPL 2023 topic. “The fact that he has to bat long and deep will allow him to get those volume of runs. On the other hand, with Rohit Sharma, you will see some short bursts, some match-winning bursts but in terms of volume, Virat will get a lot of runs this season,” he said on air. Both Kohli and Rohit will have a point to prove in this edition of the IPL. Their fate in the Indian T20I setup all but sealed, Kohli, opening the innings, showed just how good he can be when in full flow. Struggling for form throughout last year, Kohli endured three first-ball ducks, and despite scoring a couple of fifties, lacked fluency. This year, if the opening fixture from last evening is any indication, expect a rip-roaring season from Kohli, who still holds the record for most runs in a single edition of the IPL with 973 runs. Rohit on the other hand, seems to be having a tougher job among the two. He went the whole of IPL 2022 without scoring a single half-century and began this year without much difference. Furthermore, under Rohit’s captaincy, this is the 11th straight IPL season opener that MI have lost and although they have won five titles while being stuck in this pattern, both Rohit and MI would want to snap out of it.

MCA is hopeful that Dhoni will inaugurate the memorial when he is in Mumbai for his Indian Premier League (IPL) team Chennai Super Kings (CSK) match against Mumbai Indians (MI), which will take place on April 8. The date is yet not finalised as it will completely depend on MS Dhoni’s consent and availability. “MCA will also felicitate MS Dhoni when he inaugurates the World Cup Victory Memorial in Wankhede Stadium,” concluded Kale. India defeated Sri Lanka in the final by six wickets in the summit clash at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. After batting first, Sri Lanka posted 274/6 in their 50 overs. An unbeaten century from Mahela Jayawardene (103*) and knocks from skipper Kumar Sangakkara (48), Nuwan Kulasekara (32) and Thisara Perera (22*) powered Lanka to a competitive total. Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan took two wickets each and Harbhajan Singh took one wicket. Chasing 275, India lost Sehwag (0) and Tendulkar (18) early. But an 83-run stand between Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli (35) revived India’s chances. Gambhir went on to score 97 in 122 balls and had a 109-run stand for the fourth wicket with skipper MS Dhoni, who ended at an unbeaten 91* off 79 balls. Dhoni and Yuvraj (21*) had an unbeaten 54-run stand for the fifth wicket that guided Team India to their first World Cup title in 28 years.

CA has announced an increase in payments for all centrally contracted cricketers, with female players the big winners with a boost of almost 66 per cent. Notably, women’s cricket leagues are becoming popular all over the world, and with the successful opening edition of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in India, the competition has increased. Therefore, to ensure that the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) remain competitive, AC has doubled the salary cap of WBBL to AUD$ 732,000 per team. Earlier this year , Australia’s Women’s team won a record-breaking sixth ICC Women’s T20 World Cup title in South Africa and Meg Lanning’s side also tasted success in 2022 when they collected the ICC Women’s World Cup trophy for the seventh time with a commanding victory over England in the final in New Zealand “I think we will have a few of them [earning a million] in the next few years,” Australia Cricketers’ Association CEO Todd Greenberg was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo. After the new MoU, many Australian Female Cricketers will come under the million-dollar bracket considering they are earning well in overseas countries as well. The players who are centrally contracted can now earn AUD $800,000 by combining national and WBBL deals. Australian Female cricketers’ 75 per cent earning comes from WBBL and Domestic tournaments i.e. The Women’s National Cricket League, now will be AUD 151,000. The Australia Cricketers’ Association CEO, said, “Some of our girls who are playing in India earn significant amounts of money in the WPL, and on top of this deal now, they will become million-dollar athletes. And so they should because they are the best in the world at what they do.” “Unashamedly we stand here and want them to be remunerated at the levels that we are talking about. That is a wonderful thing, not only for those athletes but for every girl who wants to make a choice of what sport they want to play. Cricket is that choice and it’s where you can achieve those things,” ACA CEO added. CA also announced that they will rise the women’s national contract list from 15 to 18 paying a 25 per cent increase in their salaries. Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley was thrilled he was able to announce the new deal and believes female cricket will continue to grow even further within Australia and around the world. “Cricket now clearly offers the best earning opportunities of any team sport for elite female sportspeople,” CA CEO Nick Hockley said in an official statement released by Cricket Australia. “I am particularly pleased that this MoU represents another major step forward in the rise of women’s cricket with significant increases in remuneration for the inspirational role models of the world champion Australian women’s team and the WBBL, who are driving substantial growth in female participation,” he added. In this MoU, male cricketers Big Bash League (BBL) salary scale has been hiked by AU$ 1 Million which will increase their pay from AUD$2 million to AUD$3million, and for players who will be in centrally-contracted, their pay has also risen to 7.5% and the team strength will also be lifted up to 24 players in each team. Contracted male cricketers in Australia will receive an increase of 9.5 per cent as part of the new deal, with the number of contracted players rising from 20 to 24.

While MI captain Rohit’s IPL rut continued getting out for 1 off 10 balls, Kohli enjoyed an explosive start to the season cracking an unbeaten 82 to guide RCB to a comprehensive 8-wicket win. Kohli smashed the 50th IPL half-century of his career to join en elite list and put behind the ghosts of IPL 2022 in style. Kohli and Faf du Plessis’ half-century gave RCB a roaring start in chase of MI’s 172-run target and the team chased it down in just 16.2 overs to send MI and the rest of the IPL teams a strong statement. But while Kohli flourished, Rohit struggled and this once again led to a Twitter war between the fans of the two stalwarts of Indian cricket. Rohit was trolled for being unfit as he looked woefully out of touch during his 10-ball stay. He was beaten outside off, for pace and even had a catch dropped of him before finally edging one to Dinesh Karthik. Later, when Kohli walked out to bat and his batting looked nothing like Rohit, the IPL sent out a poll, which stated: “Who will score more runs this IPL – Kohli or Rohit” It did not take long for the public to come to a verdict as they sided with Kohli with 67 percent, while Rohit received just 33. This further fuelled the debate between the two on social media. While the Kohli vs Rohit debate gained steam on the internet, former India coach Ravi Shastri, on commentary duties gave his two cents on the topic and addressed the burning Kohli vs Rohit in IPL 2023 topic. “The fact that he has to bat long and deep will allow him to get those volume of runs. On the other hand, with Rohit Sharma, you will see some short bursts, some match-winning bursts but in terms of volume, Virat will get a lot of runs this season,” he said on air. Both Kohli and Rohit will have a point to prove in this edition of the IPL. Their fate in the Indian T20I setup all but sealed, Kohli, opening the innings, showed just how good he can be when in full flow. Struggling for form throughout last year, Kohli endured three first-ball ducks, and despite scoring a couple of fifties, lacked fluency. This year, if the opening fixture from last evening is any indication, expect a rip-roaring season from Kohli, who still holds the record for most runs in a single edition of the IPL with 973 runs. Rohit on the other hand, seems to be having a tougher job among the two. He went the whole of IPL 2022 without scoring a single half-century and began this year without much difference. Furthermore, under Rohit’s captaincy, this is the 11th straight IPL season opener that MI have lost and although they have won five titles while being stuck in this pattern, both Rohit and MI would want to snap out of it.

The date is yet not finalised as it will completely depend on MS Dhoni’s consent and availability. “MCA will also felicitate MS Dhoni when he inaugurates the World Cup Victory Memorial in Wankhede Stadium,” concluded Kale. India defeated Sri Lanka in the final by six wickets in the summit clash at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. After batting first, Sri Lanka posted 274/6 in their 50 overs. An unbeaten century from Mahela Jayawardene (103*) and knocks from skipper Kumar Sangakkara (48), Nuwan Kulasekara (32) and Thisara Perera (22*) powered Lanka to a competitive total. Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan took two wickets each and Harbhajan Singh took one wicket. Chasing 275, India lost Sehwag (0) and Tendulkar (18) early. But an 83-run stand between Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli (35) revived India’s chances. Gambhir went on to score 97 in 122 balls and had a 109-run stand for the fourth wicket with skipper MS Dhoni, who ended at an unbeaten 91* off 79 balls. Dhoni and Yuvraj (21*) had an unbeaten 54-run stand for the fifth wicket that guided Team India to their first World Cup title in 28 years. Notably, India will be hosting the Cricket World Cup 2023 in its entirety, for the first time ever. ICC on Sunday unveiled the logo of the upcoming 2023 World Cup on the same day the Indian team led by MS Dhoni stood victorious over Sri Lanka to lift the ICC trophy in 2011.
