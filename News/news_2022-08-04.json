Cairns, the 52-year-old former Black Cap, suffered a life-threatening heart attack last year, resulting in an aortic dissection, or a tear in the inner layer of the body's main artery. He also suffered a spinal stroke and received a cancer diagnosis just months later. Following multiple surgeries, rehabilitation and chemotherapy, Cairns took time to reflect on the last year in an Instagram post he labelled \"reflections from 12 months on\". \"It is a year today that I was admitted to hospital with an aortic dissection, an event that would impact every aspect of my life (and those around me) in ways I never imagined possible. As I reflect on all that has happened there are 3 key takeaways that I will carry forward with me,\" he wrote on the social media platform. \"1. Set the direction, not the destination. I now use a compass to navigate rather than a GPS, setting my North Star towards where I am heading, but very alive to the fact that there will be unintended stops, delays and some rerouting. \"2. Life is what happens between the plans you make. Mel (Cairns' wife) reminded me recently that I needed to stay present. I have always been guilty of focusing on the future and rushing to get where I was going. Saying things like 'once XXX happens, then it will be the start.' I've also looked back and wondered if I could have done something differently to avoid being where I am today. Chemo can feel like Groundhog Day, but I have found that taking it day by day (and even hour by hour when needed) has given me the ability to stay in the moment and I find that calming. It also helps to focus on the little things, watching the kids play sport, helping with homework, reading books, dinners with family and friends….these little things, strung together are no longer taken for granted.\" Cairns finished his thoughtful post by saying he wants to \"pay it forward\" after everything he's been through. \"3. Find your purpose. You are always evolving and who you were isn't always who you will be. We often define ourselves by what we do, but recently I've been able to engage with different groups of people and find that my story has an impact. Not just the outcome of my medical events, but the roller coaster of triumph and disaster that is life and that at varying degrees everyone encounters. I have been told by people far smarter than me, that there is no medical reason I should have survived - so I will assume that I have been given a gift and I will do what I can to pay it forward.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chris Cairns (@chriscairns2021) In an interview with the Between Two Beers podcast in May, Cairns said he now has a positive outlook of life and is determined to make the most of his second chance. \"I'm no different from anyone else … there's no secret recipe. \"It's choice, fundamentally. The human race is gifted with an asset in the mind that allows you to choose your reaction to any situation. \"That is the most important thing you possess, and at times people don't tap into that. \"It's easy to be a victim, easier for it to be someone else's fault … to be unlucky. \"I just never carried that mentality. Maybe that was through cricket or other things in my life … that choice aspect is always the most important. \"Of course, I will burst into tears or feel horrible, but I quickly try to transition out of that. The key things in all of this are choice and purpose.\"","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-04 02:10:26","image_url":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/pgcojbpq/chris-cairns-is-staying-positive-12-months-after-his-serious-health-scare-instagram.jpg","source_id":"newstalkzb","country":["new zealand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Commonwealth Games 2022: England captain Heather Knight ruled out, no replacement player added for cricket semis","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/commonwealth-games-2022-england-captain-heather-knight-ruled-out-no-replacement-player-added-for-cricket-semis-1983519-2022-08-04?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CWG 2022: England captain Heather Knight ruled out ahead of cricket semifinals","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-04 01:36:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia whip Pakistan by 44 runs in last match","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/979418-australia-whip-pakistan-by-44-runs-in-last-match","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"From our correspondentBIRMINGHAM: Pakistan women cricket team ended their Commonwealth Games journey on a pathetic note as they lost their third successive game.

Dhaliwal scored 103 runs before being caught as Canada, which won the toss, finished at 275 for nine in its 50 overs. His 116-ball innings featured 12 fours. Dhaliwal scored 100 not out Saturday in Canada's six-wicket victory over Singapore, with 12 fours in his 108-ball knock. Ravinderpal Singh finished at 56 not out. Qatar was all out for 91 in the 26th over, collapsing from 67 for two. Zaheer Ibrahim was the top scorer with 34 runs. Jeremy Gordon took four wickets for Canada, which wraps up play Friday against Vanuatu. The six-team tournament, which runs through Sunday at the Maple Leaf Cricket Club, is part of the World Cup qualifying process. Denmark, Malaysia, Qatar, Singapore and Vanuatu are also taking part. The Challenge Leagues are a 2 1/2-year competition involving 12 teams considered three steps away from the 2023 World Cup. The King City event was originally slated to be held last August but was pushed back due to the pandemic. There are two Challenge Leagues, A and B, each comprising six teams that play 15 matches each over two years. Canada is in Group A while Group B is made up of Bermuda, Hong Kong, Italy, Jersey, Kenya and Uganda. Canada leads Group A at 8-1. The top team in each league at the end of the competition will secure two of the six places in the Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier Playoff to be held later in 2022, alongside the bottom four of Men’s CWC League 2. The top two teams from the playoff continue in the hunt to participate in India 2023. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 3, 2022 The Canadian Press","pubDate":"2022-08-03 23:10:10","image_url":null,"source_id":"princegeorgecitizen","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India’s golden run at CWG 2022: The times are a-changin’","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/indias-golden-run-at-cwg-2022-the-times-are-achangin-101659563827775.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian contingent at the ongoing Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games continues to bring medals and glory for the country, which compels us to ask some legendary sportspersons about how things are changing for us as a sporting nation. From being a cricket loving country to becoming a sports loving nation, there’s much that they talk about.","content":"For the longest time, the country had been following the rise and accomplishments of only a few chosen sports. In this cricket crazy nation, the triumphs and joys or defeats and heartbreaks in other sports didn’t count as much. But the country’s stellar performance at Tokyo Olympics 2020 changed this sentiment. And the gold run at the ongoing Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games has only strengthened the shift, feel ace sportspersons. “During our times, it was only one or two newspapers to alert people of India’s performances at global events. But now, the entire country waits to watch the National Anthem being played after us winning a medal,” says Padma Shri Anju Bobby George. The Arjuna awardee made history by winning bronze in long jump at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics. Comparing that era with the present, she adds, “When the Tricolour flutters with an Indian sportsperson winning a medal, it makes everyone feel that they are present in that moment. As a country, our national pride is rising. We are supporting many more sports now. Initially, it was only a few sports in which we used to perform on the world stage. But now multiple sports are achieving big. For instance, lawn bowls was not very popular, but I now hear people saying they are really enjoying the event and want to learn more about it. We are a talented country, and with the correct support and guidance the results are for everyone to see.” Indian men’s table tennis team defeated Singapore in the finals to win the gold medal. (Photo:Twitter) The first Indian woman to win a medal at the Olympics in 2000, retired weightlifter Karnam Malleswari, feels, “Pehle parents sirf education pe hi focus karte the; kehte the bas padhai karo. Lekin ab parents bhi samajh rahe hain ki khel mein bhi aage badh kar aap tarakki kar sakte ho. Name, fame and respect can be earned through sports as well! The sporting culture is rising in India because of such performances like in the ongoing Commonwealth Games.” Recalling her time at the Olympics when she made India proud, Malleswari adds, “When I brought a medal from Sydney Olympics, it came as a huge surprise to the whole nation that even girls can achieve such big things in sports. And look at it now, the women are bringing home [so many] medals and [so much] pride for the country in all these global competitions.” “We have many exceptional athletes who are getting recognised at a higher level at such a young age, which is extremely impressive. It’s great to see the love and support they are receiving,” opines tennis star, Padma Shri Sania Mirza, adding, “Having your country right behind you, gives you an added motivation. I believe this will serve as a platform for more victories and medals in the upcoming events. I want to congratulate all the athletes. You all have done our country proud and it’s an immense joy to watch you all perform and win medals!” Former discus thrower, gold medallist Krishna Poonia feels the adulation and accolades encourage the sports culture further. “I remember at one point people did not even know what discus throw is, but when the Commonwealth Games happened in India, people learned about the game. All these things play a major role in taking our sporting legacy to greater heights,” adds Poonia. And coach Satyapal Singh, a former national level player who trains para-athletes today, feels the biggest change has been in the news reportage of sports events in our country. “Tokyo Olympics jab huye toh sabne cover kiya. Aur aaj sabke hath mein mobile hai, freedom hai news kahin bhi aur kabhi bhi dekhne ki. Pehle sirf TV par news aati thi aur wahan sirf cricket dikhta tha. Jabki cricket teams sirf 10-12 countries ki hain. In Olympics, there is participation of around 200 countries, and in CWG about 70 countries participate... It’s also true that the participation from other countries has reduced in CWG over the years, and that has also helped Indian athletes to shine brighter.” Author tweets @karansethi042 For more stories follow Facebook and Twitter SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Subscribe to our best newsletters HT Daily Capsule Pick a topic of your interest and subscribe All Newsletters Subscribe Subscribed to newsletter successfully Thank you for subscribing to our Daily News Capsule newsletter.

Hendricks struck 10 fours and a six in his 74 from 53 balls as South Africa, who had elected to bat, posted 211 for five in their 20 overs. It follows his three half-centuries in the 2-1 series win over England last week. Ireland were in the chase until the 17th over of their innings after an excellent 78 from 38 balls by Lorcan Tucker, who put on 86 for the sixth wicket with George Dockrell (43 from 28 balls). But when those two fell in consecutive deliveries, their effort fizzled out as they ended on 190 for nine, with spinners Keshav Maharaj (2-29) and Tabraiz Shamsi (2-37) the pick of the South African bowlers. South Africa’s batting innings was also boosted by a superb 56 from 27 balls from Aiden Markram as he struck five sixes on the small County Ground, while new find Tristan Stubbs blasted a breezy 24 off 11.

That led to discussions over opening the door to the Saudi-owned St James’ Park club. SunSport understands that Spurs, Chelsea and Manchester City have been the most enthusiastic about the idea of an olive branch to the Magpies after the bad blood surrounding scrutiny of last year’s £300million takeover. They have argued that enlisting the Toon would ensure a blocking minority to prevent contentious measures getting through under the Prem’s two-thirds majority requirement for rule changes.

It seems unlikely that the change will be implemented this season but is likely to coincide with the Prem adopting Fifa’s new computer- assisted offside tech next term.

En route the target of 163 runs, Barbados were never in the chase one bit, as they got bundled up for 62/8 in their 20 Overs. Middle-order batter Kyshona Knight (16) was the highest run-scorer in the entire innings, which pretty much sums up the lopsided nature of the contest. India’s Renuka Singh (4-0-10-4) bagged her second consecutive four-wicket haul at the Games, to puncture the spirits of the Barbadian batting-order, in what was a must-win encounter for both the sides. Earlier, some fantastic contributions from the destructive opener Shafali Verma (43 off 26), and later by the pair of Jemimah Rodrigues (56* off 46) and Deepti Sharma (34* off 28) propelled the India score to 162/4 after 20 Overs.

Invited to bat, India posted a competitive 162 for 4 on the back of a fine unbeaten half-century from Jemimah Rodrigues (56 not out off 46 balls) and a 26-ball 43 from opener Shafali Verma . The Indians then restricted Barbados to 62 for 8 in 20 overs with Renuka bamboozling the Barbados batters with an impressive spell. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur , Sneh Rana, Meghna Singh and Radha Yadav chipped in with a wicket apiece. Kyshona Knight was the top-scorer for Barbados with 16 while Shakera Selman made 12. Seven of their batters failed to reach double-digit figures. Barbados were dismissed for 64 in their nine-wicket defeat against Australia in an earlier match. With the win, India finished second behind Australia (6 points from 3 matches) in Group A with four points from two wins. They had beaten Pakistan and lost to Australia in their earlier matches. The semifinals will be played on Saturday. Renuka struck in the third ball of the Barbados innings, removing opener Deandra Dottin for a duck. She then dismissed captain Hayley Matthews (9), Kycia Knight (3) and Aaliyah Alleyne (0) in quick succession to reduce Barbados to 19 for 4 in nine overs. During the Indian innings, opener Smriti Mandhana (5), who hit a half century in India's win over arch-rivals Pakistan, fell cheaply but Verma and Rodrigues stitched a 71-run stand for the second wicket to prop up the innings. India were, however, in a spot of bother as captain Harmanpreet (0) departed just three balls after Verma's dismissal. But a 70-run partnership between Rodrigues and Deepti Sharma (34 not out) for the unbroken fifth wicket took India to a good total. Promoted For Barbados, Shanika Bruce, Hayley Matthews and Shakera Selman took a wicket each.

Not that No.3 Stoinis needed to do much. The allrounder made a careful six off eight balls and only bowled one set of five balls, for eight runs, as Southern Brave thrashed Welsh Fire by nine wickets. He did, though, avoid being dismissed by Zampa whose 15 balls went for 20 runs without reward. Brave skipper James Vince, a two-time Big Bash League winner with Sydney Sixers, scored 71 not out off 41 balls as Brave chased the target with 31 balls left. Fire, who were without star batter Jonny Bairstow, who withdrew from the tournament to rest ahead of the Test series with South Africa, made an inadequate 7-207 from their 100 balls. Aussie veteran Michael Hogan took 1-7 off ten balls, picking up the key wicket of Tom Banton. Only Ben Duckett, with 40, made runs of note though Zampa made a useful unbeaten run-a-ball ten at the end of Fire's innings. England bowlers Chris Jordan and Craig Overton took 2-16 and 2-21 off 15 and 20 balls respectively. Ryan Higgins dropped Vince for one in the first over, the ball going for four, and the night did not get any better for Fire as Vince cracked eight fours and a six at Southampton's Ageas Bowl. The Hundred is the England and Wales Cricket Board's attempt at developing a new format attractive to broadcasters and 'new' cricket fans, especially young ones and families. Among the innovations balls are bowled in 'sets' of five, not overs of six. However, it has proved bitterly divisive as it features eight city-based franchises rather than the traditional 18 counties, the future of some of which many feel it threatens. The ECB has also invested huge sums into it. In a new twist on the schism, England captain Ben Stokes tweeted in response to a survey of county members showing strong resistance to mooted plans to reduce red-ball county cricket - allowing for more white-ball: 'Ab-so-bloody-lutely'.","pubDate":"2022-08-03 21:03:41","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-7752442/ad6f152bd6902f04f372326d7cee7ec30bf543b5-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ravichandran Ashwin's form ahead of the T20 World Cup is a positive sign for Indian cricket: Kamran Akmal","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ravichandran-ashwin-s-form-ahead-of-the-t20-world-cup-is-a-positive-sign-for-indian-cricket-kamran-akmal-1983499-2022-08-04?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ashwin's form ahead of the T20 World Cup is a positive sign for Indian cricket: Akmal","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-03 20:37:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India beats Barbados to qualify for Commonwealth Games cricket semifinal","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/commonwealth-games/news/india-beats-barbados-womens-t20-cricket-semifinal-commonwealth-games-2022-birmingham/article65723824.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Team Sportstar  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Barbados, Commonwealth Games: India beats Barbados by 100 runs to enter the women’s T20 cricket semifinal at CWG 2022 in Birmingham.","content":"India beat Barbados by 100 runs to enter the semifinal of the women’s T20 cricket tournament at the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham on Wednesday.

The first T20I of New Zealand’s tour of Netherlands will be played in The Hague tomorrow. New Zealand, whose last destination on the ongoing European tour is Netherlands, have reached here after playing in England, Ireland and Scotland. Having arrived in Netherlands for the first time, New Zealand’s visit to this country has been delayed by a couple of years. Readers must note that New Zealand were scheduled to play a T20I in Rotterdam in 2020 but the same got cancelled due to COVID-19. A rare T20I in New Zealand between these two teams had to be abandoned without a ball being bowled earlier this year. As a result, Netherlands and New Zealand will be playing only their second T20I against each other on Thursday. It was during the ICC World Twenty20 2014 in Chattogram when the first-ever Netherlands-New Zealand T20I was played with New Zealand sealing a 152-run target in 19 overs. An unwelcome practice of international cricket in West Indies, New Zealand, Bangladesh and some other nations not being available for television audiences in India will continue during New Zealand’s tour of Netherlands 2022 as no channel has acquired the broadcasting rights for this series either. However, streaming platform Fan Code will be streaming the same at a nominal price. Indian fans, who wish to buy a pass for the whole tour (two T20Is), will have to pay a 62% discounted price of INR 19 on the website or mobile application of FanCode. In the absence of an official confirmation with respect to the host broadcaster, exact name of channel for fans in Netherlands and UK will be shared in due course of time. Fans following their team back home in New Zealand have the option watching these matches on Spark Sport. Readers must note that this match will be played on August 5 in New Zealand due to the time difference. Training at @VoorburgCC ahead of Thursday’s 1st T20I against @KNCBcricket .

The second half of 2022 won’t provide any relief to the Indian cricket team as players will continue to be on the road for back-to-back series (both home and away) including a couple of multi-team tournaments. As has been the case of late, fans shouldn’t be surprised if the Indian team retains its habit of fielding separate teams for separate formats almost simultaneously. Considering the amount of cricket that is to be played at the highest level in the near future, players and selection committees don’t have a lot of option than to rest and rotate for optimum performance. Currently in West Indies for a white-ball tour, India have two more T20Is to be played in Florida. It will only be this month that India’s ODI squad will tour Zimbabwe for a three-match series. The T20I squad, on the other hand, will travel to the UAE to participate in Asia Cup 2022. In what is another ICC T20 World Cup year, India, like all other teams, will continue to play white-ball cricket in the build-up to the world event in October-November. Post T20 World Cup 2022 in Australia, India will immediately board a flight to New Zealand for a white-ball tour. Having confirmed fixtures of home series against Australia and South Africa before the World Cup, expect BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) to do the same for the last month of the year in due course of time.

In the absence of senior players such as Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, and Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik captained India to a 2-0 T20I series victory in Ireland. Before that, he had led Gujarat Titans (GT) to the Indian Premier League (IPL) title in their maiden season earlier this year. \"I've always enjoyed the responsibility and it has added more and more to my game. It has added a little more strength to my game because it makes me think more. When I think more, it just adds more value to my cricket,\" said Hardik in the press conference after India's seven-wicket win on Tuesday. India went 2-1 up against West Indies on Tuesday with two more games remaining in the series. WI vs IND: When I bowl, it adds balance to the side, says Hardik Pandya Hardik finished with figures of 1 for 19 in his quota of four overs but could manage just four runs in India's chase of 165. The all-rounder has been bowling regularly off late and that has paid off for Team India. The wicket that he picked up in the third T20I against West Indies at Warner Park, St. Kitts, made Hardik the first-ever Indian to the double of 50 wickets and 500 runs in T20I cricket. \"I've enjoyed bowling. That is why I felt I should take some time off to make sure my bowling comes in. When I bowl it adds a lot of balance to the side, and it gives a lot of confidence to the captain. When I used to bowl before, I used to be a filler when someone was not bowling well. But I can proudly say now that I can bowl as a third seamer or a fourth seamer where I can contribute as equally as I do with the bat,\" added Pandya in the same interview. If your name is @hardikpandya7 nothing seems 𝐇𝐚𝐫𝐝 enough to achieve! 😍How much has he made you #BelieveInBlue since his return in #TeamIndia colours? Tell us 👇. pic.twitter.com/9WjjAfpAjd After Rohit Sharma walked away retired hurt during India's chase in the third T20I, his opening partner Suryakumar Yadav took charge and produced a match-winning knock of 76 off 44 deliveries. He struck eight fours and four sixes as he scored the runs at a strike rate of 172.73. \"Surya is someone who is an exceptional player. When he plays certain shots you are in awe. Today he played some amazing shots. The wicket was not that easy, compared to when we were bowling. A lot of credit goes to him. He has worked hard. He is getting his due late in his life but God is kind to him and he is getting the maximum,\" said Hardik in Hardik also credited skipper Rohit and head coach Rahul Dravid for the change in approach in the third T20I. \"About the approach... credit goes to Rohit and coach. Yesterday we were all having a chat - how to go about the wicket? This wicket is slow. Do we still continue the style of play? The credit goes to him [Dravid], he gave us the freedom, and said 'You know what, forget about the result, we are trying something new and we will make mistakes, we're gonna learn from them'. What we've been doing for 5-6 years, we are going to get away from that.' \"We got to make sure we try everything we can and know exactly what are our scoring options when it comes to the T20 World Cup,\" added Hardik. One of the Indian players who was massively criticised after the last T20 World Cup was Hardik as India had failed to qualify for the semi-final. Ahead of the T20 World Cup 2022, which is scheduled to be played in Australia in October-November, Hardik now brings the much-needed balance in Team India, now that he has begun to bowl regularly. \"The things which I worked on...it's all about following the process, making sure the routine I have set the last six months, I don't change much. I'm keeping cricket as a priority. A lot of things are looking good as the results are coming my way but it's the approach that I am following. \"I understood in my life that if you enjoy life; be in a frame of mind where you're positive, a lot of time the results go your way. For me, it's not about the result, but how I take the game on, how smart I'm thinking and how I can make sure that I use the condition and the situation that is offering me - something with the bat or ball,\" the Indian all-rounder added further. WI vs IND: Will continue to smile regardless of my performances, says Hardik Pandya Speaking further about the upcoming ICC event, Hardik said, \"The last World Cup was different, this World Cup is different, but the process has been the same. The form is at times there sometimes not there. But I have said many times, that I have maintained a balance in life - I will continue to smile regardless of how I perform.\" Top win 💯🇮🇳 We move forward. pic.twitter.com/UMhURXJCBj The 28-year-old Baroda cricketer said that he was \"Very privileged to get the opportunity to be even vice-captain\" for the ongoing Caribbean tour before further praising Rohit for giving a \"lot of flexibility and a lot of freedom.\" \"With the captain, Rohit gives you a lot of flexibility and a lot of freedom, which is his strength throughout his captaincy stint whenever I've played with him. A lot of credit goes to him and Rahul Dravid for the way they have got the team together, a lot of positive mindsets comes in. \"At the same time, the players are feeling secure, they are not looking over their shoulders. They are getting ample chance and they are being told if they're not playing. Coming to the captaincy bit, \"added Hardik. India and West Indies will now head to Florida for the fourth and the fifth T20I. The fourth game will be played on Aug. 6 at Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground, Lauderhill.","pubDate":"2022-08-03 15:34:58","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/08/03/500x300_1306178-hardik-pandya.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CWG, IND-W vs BAR-W Live: India Face Barbados In A Do Or Die Clash","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/commonwealth-games-india-women-vs-barbados-women-live-score-updates-3221896","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CWG 2022 India Women vs Barbados Women Live Updates: India take on Barbados in a women's cricket Group A match in the ongoing Commonwealth Games at Edgbaston Cricket Ground","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-03 15:01:25","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-08/t20629p8_smriti-mandhana-afp_625x300_03_August_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India cricket schedule 2022: 6 टी-20 और 3 वनडे... ऐसा है ऑस्ट्रेलिया-साउथ अफ्रीका के खिलाफ भारत के घरेलू दौरे का पूरा कार्यक्रम","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/cricket-news/bcci-announces-schedule-for-home-series-vs-australia-and-south-africa/articleshow/93328393.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India Cricket Team 2022 Schedules And Fixtures: भारतीय टीम को टी-20 वर्ल्ड कप तक सांस लेने की फुर्सत नहीं मिलनी है। भारतीय क्रिकेट कंट्रोल बोर्ड ने साउथ अफ्रीका और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के साथ होने वाली घरेलू सीरीजों का शेड्यूल जारी किया है, जो टी-20 वर्ल्ड कप के बेहद करीब तक चलनी हैं।","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-03 14:51:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"India vs Pakistan all match win list: India vs Pakistan total T20 match record","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-india-vs-pakistan-all-match-win-list-india-vs-pakistan-total-t20-match-record/","keywords":["Cricket","asia cup","India","Pakistan"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Pakistan all match win list: India and Pakistan will be locking horns for the first time this year later this month.

The second season of The Hundred is all in readiness of commencing at the Ageas Bowl tonight with the season-opener to be played between defending champions and hosts Southern Brave and Welsh Fire. In the general run of things, England batter Jonny Bairstow would’ve represented Welsh Fire in Southampton and their following few matches. Having said that, that won’t happen now as the 32-year old player is set to miss the whole tournament. It is noteworthy that Bairstow had represented Welsh in just a couple of matches in The Hundred 2021 scoring 128 runs at an average and strike rate of 64 and 170.66 respectively. “We understand Jonny’s decision and wish him all the best. We can’t wait to get our Hundred campaign under way tomorrow night and then look forward to getting back in front of our own fans at Sophia Gardens on Sunday,” Fire said in a statement around Bairstow missing The Hundred 2022.

While former captain Eoin Morgan will be playing this season despite retiring from international cricket, Bairstow will join Test captain Ben Stokes in missing The Hundred 2022. Coming on the back of a hectic period of international cricket, Bairstow has emphasized on taking a “breather” before the upcoming three-match Test series against South Africa starting from August 17. A vital cog in the wheel in England’s Test plans, Bairstow prioritizing Test cricket is rare among modern-day cricketers. “I’m really disappointed I won’t be part of the Hundred this year. I loved it last year, but I’ve had a hectic few months with the schedule as it is and I really need to take a breather before the South Africa Test series. All the best to the Welsh Fire men and women – I’ll be cheering you on,” Bairstow told Sky Sports News to confirm his absence.
