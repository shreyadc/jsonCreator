The former India captain is set to be replaced as board president by 1983 World Cup winning-team member Roger Binny in the apex body’s upcoming AGM (Annual General Meeting). “You can’t play forever. You can’t be an administrator forever, but it’s been fun doing both and seeing both sides of the coin. I will go for bigger things in future,” Ganguly said on the sidelines of an event related to Bandhan Bank. “I was a cricketer’s administrator. Yes you had to make decisions because there’s so much cricket happening, there’s so much money around. There’s women’s cricket, there’s domestic cricket. Yes you had to take calls at times as an individual,” he added. Ganguly was keen to continue as the BCCI chief, but things didn’t pan out that way, even as Jay Shah is set to continue as the secretary. Ganguly first got into cricket administration as a secretary under Jagmohan Dalmiya at the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), before heading the state body after the veteran’s death in September 2015. Speaking of achieving success, the former skipper cited the example of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Life, achievements and progresses are about small goals, you don’t become a Sachin Tendulkar, or an Ambani or Narendra Modi in one day. “You have to spend your life, time, days, weeks, months working towards it. That’s the key to success. If you decide that this is my job, this is my life, give everything you have for the rest of your life to be the best.” Ganguly also spoke about the high points of his tenure as BCCI president. “I think I thoroughly loved it. If you see the last three years, so many good things have happened. IPL during COVID, such difficult times for all of us in the country. We didn’t know how to deal with it. The broadcast rights which went to an all time high. “The Under-19 winning the World Cup. I wish the women won the Commonwealth Games gold, they were in a position to beat Australia. Senior team winning in Australia. Those were great moments as an administrator. But they returned with a silver which was still first. “I hope they do well in Australia because it’s a tremendous cricket team. There’s so much talent, so much power, class in the side,” he said, wishing Team India luck for the upcoming T20 World Cup. “You expect them to win all the time. But the challenge of being a player was completely different. So you can’t compare both.” Ganguly said the challenges as a cricketer were more than being an administrator. —PTI “I did eight years’ of administration. I was president of the Cricket Association of Bengal, then became president of the BCCI, all these have tenures and you have to go after finishing it. “But I feel the challenge as a cricketer was a lot more. When you do backroom work, sitting on tables and running the game, you have time to correct things. “But if you nicked a delivery from Glenn McGrath on the first morning of a Test, you are out, you didn’t have the time to correct it — I think that’s the major difference. “But when you do administration you realise that you contribute so much, you could make things better for a cricketer and me being a player who played for a long period of time, I understood that,” he signed off.

Only 11 months have passed since Australia claimed its maiden men’s World T20 crown under lights in Dubai, with Mitch Marsh and David Warner the heroes. Now, after the shortest reign in tournament history, the pressure is on Australia to reproduce that magic — this time in front of its home fans. Here’s everything you need to know about the T20 World Cup, including a team-by-team guide, key players, and tournament explainer. Catch the T20 World Cup Live on Kayo.

Standby players: Mohammad Shami, Shreyas Iyer, Ravi Bishnoi, Deepak Chahar ICC Ranking: 1 Key player: Hardik Pandya Why can/can’t they win? Virat Kohli is back in form at just the right time, finally breaking a century drought that spanned more than 1,000 days, while the nation will be hungry to atone for a disastrous 2021 campaign in which it failed to get out of its group. There are some seriously notable absentees, however. Ravindra Jadeja’s knee injury is a massive blow to the team’s balance, while gun pacer Jasprit Bumrah is also out with a back injury. ENGLAND England still has one of the most ferocious batting line-ups in world cricket. Source: Getty Images Squad: Jos Buttler (c), Moeen Ali, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Dawid Malan, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Ben Stokes, Reece Topley, David Willey, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Alex Hales. Standby players: Liam Dawson, Richard Gleeson, Tymal Mills ICC Ranking: 2 Key player: Liam Livingstone Why can/can’t they win? England still has one of the most ferocious batting line-ups in world cricket that will be a force to be reckoned with. Dawid Malan is in scary form, while a line-up boasting Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes and Liam Livingstone can do some serious damage. There is an inherent risk that comes with England’s style of cricket, however, that has disaster always just lurking around the corner. SOUTH AFRICA Tabraiz Shamsi will be a key figure for the Proteas.

Standby Players: Bjorn Fortuin, Andile Phehlukwayo, Lizaad Williams ICC Ranking: 3 Key player: Tabraiz Shamsi Why can/can’t they win? The Proteas have taken some important steps in T20 cricket since the last edition — a period highlighted by its 2-1 victory over England away from home. In truth, Australia only beat South Africa out of the group last year on Net Run Rate, while conditions down under will better suit the Proteas than those in the UAE. Losing all-rounder Dwaine Pretorius to a thumb fracture will hurt, while South Africa seem to have a way of always failing to deliver at cricket World Cups, having never made the final at either version. PAKISTAN Pakistan has what it takes to go all the way. Source: Getty Images Squad: Babar Azam (c), Shadab Khan, Asif Ali, Haider Ali, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Hasnain, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Wasim, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shan Masood, Usman Qadir. Standby Players: Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Haris, Shahnawaz Dahani ICC Ranking: 4 Key player: Babar Azam Why can/can’t they win? There should be no doubt that Pakistan has what it takes to go all the way. Last year, Pakistan had its body and three limbs in the final until Matthew Wade was dropped — then he hit three-consecutive sixes to pull the rug out from beneath the nation. Prior to that, Pakistan was undefeated, having already beaten India and eventual finalists, New Zealand. Pakistan returns in great health, and has two of the world’s three top-ranked batters; Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam. Its bowling stocks may be a little thin, though, particularly with Shaheen Shah Afridi underdone after a lengthy injury lay-off. NEW ZEALAND New Zealand will be driven by the heartache of losing last year’s final. Source: Getty Images Squad: Kane Williamson (c), Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Mitchell Santner, Glenn Phillips, Jimmy Neesham, Daryl Mitchell, Adam Milne, Martin Guptill, Lachlan Ferguson, Devon Conway, Mark Chapman, Michael Bracewell, Trent Boult, Finn Allen ICC Ranking: 5 Key player: Trent Boult Why can/can’t they win? Oh so close in 2021, New Zealand will be driven by the heartache of losing last year’s final to rivals Australia. The Black Caps are also one of the form sides of 2022 having won 12 of 14 completed T20Is this year. It should be said, however, that most of those matches came against lower-ranked nations, while New Zealand’s hoodoo in Australia is a massive concern. The nation hasn’t won a match in Australia in any format since 2011’s Hobart Test. AUSTRALIA Australia knows how to get it done. Source: Getty Images Squad: Aaron Finch (c), Ashton Agar, Pat Cummins, Tim David, Josh Hazlewood, Josh Inglis, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Kane Richardson, Steven Smith, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, David Warner, Adam Zampa ICC Ranking: 6 Key player: David Warner Why can/can’t they win? Australia wasn’t meant to get close to winning in the UAE — according to form and the rankings, that is — and look at how that turned out. Australia knows how to get it done in the clutch and has arguably the most formidable bowling line-up of the tournament with Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa. Throw in the brilliant form of Matthew Wade down the order, and the addition of T20 wildcard Tim David alongside 2021 World Cup heroes David Warner and Mitchell Marsh, and it’s clear Australia can go all the way once again. That said, Australia carries into the tournament some big concerns with the bat. Aaron Finch is a man under pressure, as is Glenn Maxwell who hasn’t scored big in some time. WEST INDIES Never completely count out the West Indies. Source: Getty Images Squad: Nicholas Pooran (c), Rovman Powell, Yannic Cariah, Johnson Charles, Sheldon Cottrell, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Kyle Mayers, Obed Mccoy, Raymon Reifer, Odean Smith, Shamarh Brooks ICC Ranking: 7 Key player: Nicholas Pooran Why can/can’t they win? True it feels awfully unlikely that any nation outside of that top six will win, but you should never completely count out the West Indies. Few teams have embraced the game’s shortest format like the West Indies have, while its mixture of youth and experience will old them in good stead. You never know then they could catch fire. Nonetheless, there’s a genuine lack of big-name stars these days, while there’s also the not-so-small matter of needing to get out of round one first. Should they progress, the extra matches and acclimatisation could be turned into an advantage. SRI LANKA Sri Lanka is fresh from winning the Asia Cup. Source: Getty Images Squad: Dasun Shanaka (c), Danushka Gunathilaka, Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Charith Asalanka, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dhananjaya de Silva, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Jeffrey Vandersay, Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Lahiru Kumara, Dilshan Madushanka, Pramod Madushan. Standby Players: Ashen Bandara, Praveen Jayawickrema, Dinesh Chandimal, Binura Fernando, Nuwanidu Fernando ICC Ranking: 8 Key player: Wanindu Hasaranga Why can/can’t they win? There’s plenty of good feeling with this group that might’ve finally turned the corner. Winning the Asia Cup last month was a massive achievement for a young group that will have the confidence it needs to punch with the heavyweights. Australian conditions, however, will likely work against the nation that also has to grind out wins in round one to get a shot at the Super 12s. BANGLADESH Shakib Al Hasan carries Bangladesh’s hopes on his shoulders. Source: Getty Images Squad: Shakib Al Hasan (c), Sabbir Rahman, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Afif Hossain, Mossadek Hossain, Litton Das, Yasir Ali, Nurul Hasan, Mustafizur Rahman, Saifuddin, Taskin Ahmed, Ebadot Hossain, Hasan Mahmud, Najmul Hossain, Nasum Ahmed. Standby players: Shoriful Islam, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Soumya Sarkar ICC Ranking: 9 Key player: Shakib Al Hasan Why can/can’t they win? Things are looking a little grim for Bangladesh this time around. Ranked sixth going into the last T20 World Cup, Bangladesh is now ninth in the world and was just booted from the Asia Cup without notching a single win, losing to Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. More recently, the Tigers have lost consecutive games to New Zealand and Pakistan. There are plenty of concerns, but teams must beware Shakib Al Hasan, who is one of T20 cricket’s most esteemed players and has hit form at the right time. AFGHANISTAN Rashid Khan leads the charge for Afghanistan. Source: AFP Squad: Mohammad Nabi (c), Najibullah Zadran, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Azmatullah Omarzai, Darwish Rasooli, Farid Ahmad Malik, Fazal Haq Farooqi, Hazratullah Zazai, Ibrahim Zadran, Mujeeb ur Rahman, Naveen ul Haq, Qais Ahmad, Rashid Khan, Salim Safi, Usman Ghani. Standby players: Afsar Zazai, Sharafuddin Ashraf, Rahmat Shah, Gulbadin Naib ICC Ranking: 10 Key player: Rashid Khan Why can/can’t they win? Afghanistan can barely be called a ‘long shot’ at winning the T20 World Cup, but that doesn’t mean it can’t create an upset or two along the way. The team is confident heading into the tournament having already pulled off a big upset at the Asia Cup, where it burst into the Super Four stage. That gives the side some crucial momentum — ride that a little longer and you never know where it might take this side. Furthermore, having the world’s best T20I spinner, Rashid Khan, who also has years of experience in Australian conditions, will certainly help.

Two groups of four will take part in a round robin in Round 1 to determine who progresses through to the Super 12 stage. The top two teams from each group will progress. Sri Lanka (8th) and the West Indies (7th) are the top-ranked nations in Round 1, while the rest of the groups are formed from qualifying results. The winner of Group A and second from Group B go into the Super 12’s Group 1, while the Group B winner and Group A runner-up go into Group 2. The two groups of six compete in another round robin with the top two of each group going into the knockout stage. Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa all automatically qualified for the Super 12 stage. Those nations qualified for the Super 12 stage by virtue of their rankings on November 15 2021. They will be joined by four Round 1 qualifiers. Two semi-finals then take place, followed by the final.

Pakistan lost Babar’s wicket and another in the 13th over and had to rely on Mohammad Nawaz, who struck an unbeaten 45 from 20 balls to close out the win. There was a flicker of concern when Rizwan holed out in the deep in the 19th over with Pakistan needing nine from seven balls. At the start of the last over it needed eight from six balls but with seven wickets in hand and Nawaz still at the crease, Pakistan was in command. Asif Ali took a streaky single from the first ball and Nawaz played an overhead tennis shot from the second ball for two. Nawaz continued to find gaps in the field for two runs until a four behind point by Nawaz from the fifth ball of the over clinched the win. “I think if you give a chance to the Bangladesh bowlers they don’t make it easy because they bowl very well,” Rizwan said. “You have to bat within your plan because chasing a target is always difficult and you must keep wickets in hand. “I would give credit to Nawaz for the way he batted on this wicket. If you ask me honestly, the Bangladesh bowlers bowled extremely well but Nawaz innings was the moment that changed the whole match.” The match was the last in the round-robin section of the tri-series and came after the tournament finalists already had been determined. Pakistan and New Zealand will meet in the final on Friday. Bangladesh finished the tournament without a win but still picked up some momentum ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia later this month. The team’s total on Thursday was its best of the tournament and its third-best against Pakistan in a T20 international. Litton Das made 69 and captain Shakib Al Hasan 68 to provide 137 runs out of Bangladesh’s total of 173-6. Their runs came from only 84 balls. “I think we played our best cricket today,” Shakib said. “We could have scored maybe a few more runs in the last over. The impression we wanted to get from this series, we got that, so it’s up to us to express ourselves and do something good for the country. “I think from a management point of view we are very clear now on the team which will play in the World Cup which is what exactly we were looking for.” —PTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-10-13 17:24:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"No bilateral cricket series against Pak in 2023-27 FTP","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-pakistan-bilateral-series-2023-27-ftp-8207347/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":["Devendra Pandey"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"India won’t be playing Pakistan in any bilateral series in the 2023-2027 cycle.

The BCCI can’t take any decision on a bilateral series with Pakistan until it gets a nod from the Government of India. The number of bilateral matches India will play across formats has been reduced from the previous cycle (163 to 141) due to an ICC event every year and a bigger dedicated window for the Indian Premier League (75-80 days every season), but BCCI secretary Jay Shah, in a circular, indicated that the quality of the content had improved.

A regular IPL season along with a fixed home season also allows for ideal preparation against quality opponents in the right format going into ICC events.” India will be playing against Australia and England more frequently, with a Test or white-ball series scheduled every year (either home or away). “India will be playing 5-match Test series against both England and Australia on a home-and-away basis every two years i.e. one home series every four years. In addition, there will also be standalone tours (home and away) of 3 ODIs and 5 T20Is. Thus, India will play 5 Tests, 3 ODIs and 5 T20Is in the cycle (Home and Away) against Australia as well as England comprising one annual series (either red ball or white ball) every year in this cycle.” Advertisement With T20 matches against West Indies and New Zealand generating more fan interest, India will be playing 5 T20Is at home against these teams.

The Board is obligated to deliver a tax exemption or a tax solution to the ICC for this event. As per ICC rules, the host country needs to get a tax exemption from its government, but India has no rule in place for granting full exemption. The BCCI has advised ICC that in line with the tax order for the 2016 ICC World T20, it was expecting to obtain a 10 percent (excluding surcharges) tax order as an interim measure for the 2023 event within the required timeframe. “The ICC has now received a 20% (excluding surcharges) tax order for its broadcast revenue for the 2023 event from the tax authorities in India. The BCCI is currently working with the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, and have represented against this 20% (excluding surcharges) tax order at the very highest level and are hopeful that a 10% (excluding surcharges) tax order would be forthcoming shortly,” the BCCI informed its members.","pubDate":"2022-10-13 17:22:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WA XI Highlights: KL Rahul-led India STUNNED in 2nd practice game, Western Australia win by 36 runs: Watch FULL Highlights - InsideSport","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVzcG9ydC5pbi9pbmQtdnMtd2EteGktaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy1rbC1yYWh1bC1sZWQtaW5kaWEtc3R1bm5lZC1pbi0ybmQtcHJhY3RpY2UtZ2FtZS13ZXN0ZXJuLWF1c3RyYWxpYS13aW4tYnktMzYtcnVucy13YXRjaC1mdWxsLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMv0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs WA XI Highlights: KL Rahul-led India STUNNED in 2nd practice game, Western Australia win by 36 runs: Watch FULL Highlights  InsideSportIndia vs Western Australia Practice Match Highlights: India Lose To Western Australia In Second Practice Game  NDTV SportsIndia vs Western Australia Live Score- India's Practice Match Live Score, ICC T20 World Cup 2022 Live Score.

Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh had publicly called out the PCA president on October 7 via an open letter to the administrators asking them to intervene into the matter. Chahal, on 13 October evening, tweeted out that will be stepping down from the post due to personal reasons. Due to personal reasons I hereby tender my resignation as President of Punjab Cricket Association. — Gulzar Chahal (@gulzarchahal) Chahal was recently seen in the public eye during India's T20I game against Australia at Mohali. After his stepping down, the former India spinner tweeted that \"Truth might be troubled, but it cannot be suppressed,\" indicating at the ongoings of the PCA. Singh has turned out to be one of the chief architects behind the proceedings after hewrote a strongly-worded open letter to all the stakeholders of the cricket body, alleging illegal activities by its president with regards to offering new memberships. The player had urged members and the stakeholders of the PCA to come together and stop such illegal activities to preserve the integrity of the state body. \"For the last week or 10 days, I have been receiving numerous complaints from cricket lovers in Punjab and several stakeholders that the PCA under the present president is resorting to a lot of illegal activities, which is against transparency and the spirit of cricket administration,\" Harbhajan had written in his letter. \"I learned that yesterday, complaints in this regard have been lodged with the Ombudsman,\" Harbhajan wrote in the letter. Harbhajan broke down the matter and revealed that the issue was with the PCA trying to sign around 150 new members with voting rights to tilt the balance in their favour. He further added that this process was going behind people's back to induct people who would be voting in favour for the current administration.","pubDate":"2022-10-13 14:39:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"When I saw his passion for cricket, I let him follow his dream: Shahbaz Ahmed’s father","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/shahbaz-ahmed-father-interview-india-debut-vs-south-africa-odi/article66006501.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        P.

During his brief Shield career, Drinnen scored an important 74 runs in one innings. His vast coaching career included coaching Scotland and Netherlands.Brett Henschell (Ipswich Grammar School): Henschell was a veteran of more than 60 Sheffield Shield games for his state, initially playing in the 1981-82 season as a batting all-rounder.He scored five first class hundreds, but also developed his off-spin and was a perfect support bowler to the Bulls powerhouse fast bowling line-ups of that era. As a coach he started his own Academy.Steve Baker (The Southport School): Baker was an outstanding club gloveman who was unlucky not to play Sheffield Shield cricket in an era when Queensland also had Ian Healy, Peter Anderson and Drinnen as options.The GPS First XI premiership winning coach has been responsible for bringing some of Queensland’s best young players through the system, including the likes of recent state players Mathew Kuhnemann, Xavier Bartlett, Jack Sinfield and Hugo Burdon who is certain to play Shield cricket.Trevor Irvine (Brisbane Grammar School): Director of coaching at BGS, Irvine and head coach Pete Steindl oversaw BGS’s remarkable 2022 First XI premiership win.Irvine, along with the Steindl and Hugh Weibgen (Valley) as captain, took BGS from battlers in 2020 to its first premiership since 2013 when Bulls ace Matt Renshaw, outstanding Western Suburbs all-rounder Paddy Dooley and South Brisbane representative batsman Aryan Jain were in the team.Steindl was of course coach of Wests which won last season’s Bulls Masters two-day first grade competition earlier this year.As a player, Irvine was a member of the powerful Valley Cricket Club (mid-1990s-2000s) where he had the distinction of being a first grade premiership winner.A top order batsman, he had the thrill of batting with Australian opening great Matthew Hayden on a number of occasions, and was a Valley teammate of Henschell (the IGS coach mentioned above) and decorated Bulls fast bowler Joe Dawes.A former First XI coach at St Columban’s College, Irvine has been coach or director of cricket at BGS for the last eight years. Peter McGiffin (BSHS): BSHS also has a decorated coach as its First XI mentor, Peter McGiffin, who has been both a head coach and assistant coach of the Queensland Fire and WBBL Heat side.Balir Copelin (Gregory Terrace): Head of Cricket, Copelin was a powerful right-hand opening batsman for Redland Tigers whom he later coached.Copelin has overseen the development of countless excellent young cricketers during his time at Terrace.He will be assisted by Patrick Collins, an Old Boy and a former Wests premiership captain and GPS premiership winner with Terrace in 2004. Collins played seasons in the First XI.Another assistant at Terrace is Tom O’Malley, an Old Boy and four time second grade premiership captain from Norths.Ben Schuhmacher (Toowoomba Grammar School): TGS again has Ben Schuhmacher as its First XI Head Coach after TGS gave opponents plenty of cheek last season during a spirited campaign. Schuhmacher was a first grade premiership winner as head coach of Valley where he played with distinction.","pubDate":"2022-10-13 14:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket Australia to lift David Warner's captaincy ban this week: Details","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/cricket-australia-to-lift-david-warners-captaincy-ban-this-week-details-765278","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"David Warner is currently banned from any leadership role in Australian cricketWarner was slapped with the ban following the Sandpaper Gate in 2018 Australia’s limited-overs captain Aaron Finch recently retired from ODI cricket","content":"David Warner is currently banned from any leadership role in Australian cricket The leadership ban on David Warner could reportedly be lifted on Friday when Cricket Australia's directors meet for an annual general meeting with the states and rewrite the codes of ethics. Following his role in the infamous Sandpaper Gate in 2018, Warner was slapped with a liftetime captaincy ban in Australian cricket. With Aaron Finch's ODI retirement opening up the leadership role, several members of the current Australian team have backed Warner to lead the side. \"The view within Cricket Australia is that David is doing particularly well on the field and making a great contribution off the field. The first step in terms of David's leadership ban is to review the code and see if those sanctions are able to be reviewed. And the appropriate revisions to that code that would need to be made,\" chairman Lachlan Henderson was quoted as saying. Henderson went on to add that rewriting the codes of ethics would be required before a call on the ODI captaincy is made. \"Our intention is to review the code as quick as is practical. It's not in anyone's interest for us to delay that. It would be in time for any future leadership conversations in relation to David,\" said Henderson further. Meanwhile, Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley pointed out that players had a right to show they have changed. \"In very simple terms, we are looking at sanctions to be reviewed for good behaviour and growth after a period of time. Pending tomorrow's discussion, there would then need to be a revision of the code and that would need to be approved by the board,\" Hockley said. These statements came after Cricket Australia reported a massive loss of USD 5.1 million during the 2021-22 financial year.

We have a very good outfit.\" The former Test captain said his ambition as board Chairman remained to make Pakistan the number one team in all three formats. There have been calls for separating the opening pair of Muhammad Rizwan and Babar Azam but Raja made it cleat there was no need to make any such move. \"I am surprised we talk about separating them when the talking point for any team is having a solid opening pair. The three make points for a team to be successful is to have a good opening pair and we also have good bowlers. \"Yes the team does disappoint us sometimes but they have a 75 percent success ration which is why fans and our commercial partners are engaging with them.

The World Cup displays some of the best cricket nations and players taking on each other in a fight for glory in the shortest format. This edition too promises nothing short of a thrilling four-week competition Down Under. Numerous cricket stars have embraced the cricket field in the T20 World Cup, while there are only a handful of them who played in the first edition and will represent their teams in the 2022 edition too. Talismanic opening batter and India's captain Rohit Sharma is one of the two current Indian players, who have got their hands on the 2007 T20 World Cup trophy. The swashbuckling right-handed batter is one of the most dangerous openers to play limited-over cricket. Sharma made his International debut in September 2007 against England and featured in four T20I games in the World Cup. The 35-year-old played in the 2007 World Cup and is set to lead the men in blue in their fight for the Cup in 2022. Wicket-keeper batter Dinesh Karthik has been India's second current star, who lifted the fabled trophy in 2007 and stands a chance to repeat history in 2022. The right-handed batter has seen peaks and valleys in his career as he has been in and out of the team on many occasions. Karthik made a dream comeback to the team after doing a commentary stint more than a year ago. The wicket-keeper batter played in the 2007 edition but could not find his place in further tournaments, until a dream call-up for the 2022 World Cup. Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan is a T20 specialist and a renowned player in the shortest format. Shakib debuted in 2006 in an ODI game against Zimbabwe. Shakib played in all five matches for Bangladesh in the inaugural edition of the World Cup and is yet again a vital cog for the team in the 2022 edition. Also, Zimbabwe player Sean Williams is another cricketer, who featured in the squad for the T20 World Cup in 2007 and still finds his name in the Zimbabwe squad for the 2022 World Cup. However, Williams was only part of the squad in 2007 and did not take the field as a player.","pubDate":"2022-10-13 11:20:04","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Don’t look to survive, look to score runs”: Gautam Gambhir advises Indian batters around facing Shaheen Afridi in T20 World Cup 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-dont-look-to-survive-look-to-score-runs-gautam-gambhir-advises-indian-batters-around-facing-shaheen-afridi-in-t20-world-cup-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","Gautam Gambhir","Shaheen Afridi"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Gautam Gambhir has given his mantra for the Indian batters to face Shaheen Afridi in the upcoming T20 World Cup game against Pakistan.

This is a high-octane match, and both sides would want to start their tournament with a win. India had a disappointing T20 World Cup last year, and they faced Pakistan in the first match of the last tournament as well, where Pakistan defeated India by 10 wickets. India’s problem against left-arm pacers is known to the entire world, and Shaheen Afridi again proved that last year in Dubai. Afridi just ripped apart the top order of the Indian side last year, where he got the wickets of Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli. He would want to do the same in Melbourne as well. Former Indian opener Gautam Gambhir has advised the Indian batters on how to play Shaheen Afridi in the upcoming T20 World Cup game against Pakistan at the MCG. Gambhir said that the batters should look to score runs instead of just surviving in order to be successful against Shaheen Afridi. Gambhir insists that Afridi will be dangerous with the new ball, and you cannot just look to survive in the T20 format. He also asked the Indian batters to try to time the ball instead of smashing it as it will allow them to get into better positions. “When it comes to Shaheen Afridi, don’t look to survive. Look to score runs from him because the moment you look to survive, everything becomes really small,” Gambhir said while speaking on Star Sports show Game Plan. “Whether it’s your backlift, whether it’s your footwork, and obviously, in T20 cricket you can’t look to survive. I know that he can be dangerous with the new ball, but again, irrespective, the Indian batters need to score more runs, get into better positions, and look to time the balls rather than to hit it.” Shaheen Afridi on absolute 🔥 KL Rahul now departs for 3 as the Pakistan pacer delivers another wonder of a delivery! | | — T20 World Cup (@T20WorldCup) Afridi is nursing a knee injury that forced him out of the Asia Cup 2022.

Followed categories will be added to My News. There were bizarre scenes in the WBBL|08 season opener between the Sydney Sixers and Brisbane Heat in Mackay on Thursday night when an underwhelming wicket celebration led to complete confusion. Batting first, the Heat made a strong start as opener Georgia Redmayne looked in fine form before being dismissed one run short of a half century (49). Watch the Weber WBBL. Every game live and ad-break free during play on Fox Cricket, available on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > Georgia Voll (32 off 39 balls) was also solid at the top of the order and quickfire knocks from Amelia Kerr (19 off 15) and Charli Knott (21 not out off 9) ensured the Heat posted a competitive total of 141 off 20 overs. The Sixers were rushing through their overs late in the innings to avoid being penalised for a slow over rate, but their good intention backfired in unusual fashion. Brisbane’s Mikayla Hinkley slapped a full toss from Maitlan Brown straight to Ellyse Perry, who took a straightforward catch at cover. But such was the ease of the dismissal and rush to get through the over, Perry didn’t even celebrate. It meant the umpire didn’t give Hinkley out and the Heat batter was looking around in confusion as she prepared to make her way back to the pavilion. The umpire wasn't sure if Ellyse Perry had taken the catch. The decision was sent to the third umpire, who sure enough found Hinkley had indeed been caught by Perry. But the delay ironically meant the Sixers’ hopes of speeding through Brown’s over didn’t eventuate, although they weren’t penalised for a slow over rate. Cricket is the dumbest sport sometimes. Sixers don't celebrate a clear catch because they are running behind on overs. Umpires don't give it out because no appeal. Confusion ensures. Time wasted. Randomly referred upstairs. More time wasted. Finally given out. #WBBL08 — Scott Bailey (@ScottBaileyAAP) October 13, 2022 One of the strangest wickets I've ever seen. #WBBL08 — Lachlan McKirdy (@LMcKirdy7) October 13, 2022 What was the umpire doing Why did Hinkley not walk Why was Perry so awkward about a ball she obviously caught What a waste of everyoneâs time. — Tom O'Neil (@thomasjameoneil) October 13, 2022 Former Australian captain Lisa Sthalekar said on Channel 7: “The issue is the umpires weren’t sure. Because the Sixers are behind time, they’re just trying to rush through. Jason Richardson added: “Because they’re behind time, they quickly took the catch and got back to their mark. Mikayla Hinkley went to walk off and went, ‘Hang on’. Sixers wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy later explained the confusion was because the umpire didn’t see if Perry had taken the catch when she rolled over onto her side on the follow through. “Nah apparently it wasn’t that,” Healy said when asked if the confusion was because the Sixers didn’t appeal for the catch. “She (the umpire) was unsighted when Pez rolled, so she wasn’t sure she claimed it. But we made sure we appeal, just in case.” Maitlan Brown of the Sixers celebrates taking the wicket of Laura Harris of the Heat.
