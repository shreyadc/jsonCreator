season’s IPL auction at $A2.16 million, while fellow England international Jofra Archer also fetched a high price despite being doubtful for the upcoming edition. Livingstone went to Punjab Kings as the 10 teams splurged millions in Bangalore but the final day witnessed England white-ball stars including Eoin Morgan and Dawid Malan going unsold. However, Archer’s price of $A1.48 million remained the day’s surprise after the franchises had been warned to pick the quick bowler at their own risk and with a view to potential participation only in 2023 and 2024 due to his elbow injury. Mumbai owner Akash Ambani said Archer will make a “formidable” pace pair with India’s Jasprit Bumrah who was retained by the franchise ahead of the auctions. “We had discussed his name in the pre-auction meetings, but firmed up on our plans last night after being priced out on all the other fast bowlers,” Ambani told reporters. “Of course he is not available this year but we believe in the best of him and when he is fit and available I believe that with Bumrah he will make a formidable partnership.” Watch The Dettol T20 Series Australia vs Sri Lanka.

Photo: AFP Source: AFP Former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted: “You know you are good when you go for a Million dollars & you are injured !!! #Jofra #IPLAuction2022.” The 26-year-old Archer had placed himself in the top bracket with a base price of $370,000 after a late entry into the list of players going under the hammer in the Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament. Livingstone, who hit England’s fastest T20 century in 42 balls in a game against Pakistan last year, stood out this auction following his play for Rajasthan Royals the previous season after being bought for $140,000. The 28-year-old remained above overseas big buys including Sri Lanka’s Wanindu Hasaranga and the West Indies’ Nicholas Pooran as the two secured bids of $A2.06 million each on day one. Punjab, still searching for their first IPL title in 14 seasons, also bagged West Indies bowling all-rounder Odean Smith for nearly $1.12m. Both Livingstone, who can also bowl off spin and leg spin, and Smith had a base price of $182,000. “He is one of the best all-rounders, bowls off spin, leg spin. He is a world-class cricketer,” Punjab co-owner Ness Wadia said. “He plays a lot with Jonny Bairstow (who was bought by Punjab for $A1.23m) in England so from our perspective that combination is great. Smith is a person who bowling attacks fear.” England batting all-rounder Liam Livingstone is one of the IPL’s richest cricketers.

Super Over after late T20 MADNESS | 02:14 Singapore all-rounder Tim David turned heads with a winning bid of $A1.53m sending him to Mumbai. India’s Ishan Kishan remained the costliest player to be sold this auction after he went for $A2.8m million on day one when Mumbai bought the wicketkeeper-batsman back to their franchise that has won a record five titles. Mumbai also got batting great Sachin Tendulkar’s son Arjun, a left-arm pace bowler, for $A56,000 in the final stages of the accelerated auction.

The teams went going big on current India players and largely based their decision on the form players from overseas with more focus on fast bowlers, not caring about reputations as the likes of Steve Smith, Aaron Finch, Suresh Raina, Ishant Sharma found out. The two-day IPL auction ended on Sunday with Sunrisers Hyderabad and Punjab Kings predictably making the hefty pay-outs with bigger purses in store while Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals now look formidable on batting front but slightly short in bowling arsenal. Having roped in Livingstone, Punjab Kings also used its deep pockets to pick up West Indies all-rounder Odean Smith for Rs 6.5 crore. He was impressive in the recently concluded ODI series against India. Sunrisers weren't going to be left behind in bidding frenzy, roping in CPL sensation from the West Indies Romario Shepherd for Rs 7.75 crore based on his all-round skills. Mumbai and Delhi look good in batting not so in bowling =================================== Delhi's bowling attack where Anrich Nortje will be partnered by Shardul Thakur, Khaleel Ahmed, Chetan Sakariya and Kuldeep Yadav doesn't inspire highest confidence. Having lost Kagiso Rabada on the first day to a rampaging Punjab Kings, Delhi invested 5.25 crore on Khaleel Ahmed, who is known to leak runs in slog overs and Rs 4.20 crore on left-armer Sakariya who pace is limited to 130s. The duo cumulatively cost them Rs 9.45 crore which is more than what Punjab paid for Rabada. Similarly for Mumbai Indians, Tymal Mills despite his T20 exploits, has been a big flop in Indian conditions as he gets ready to partner Jasprit Bumrah and Daniel Sims in absence of Archer for the year. \"So happy to have got him (Archer). So happy to have Jof and Boom making a lethal bowling attack although next year,\" MI owner Akash Ambani confirmed that Archer indeed won't play this edition. MI is looking at Archer being one of their legends in the space vacated by Lasith Malinga and stay on for the next five to six years and are ready to sacrifice one year. But Mumbai Indians' x-factor player certainly was Singapore international of Australian origin, Tim David who was bought for Rs 8 crore. David, who has played for RCB, is an all-rounder but known more for his big-hitting abilities. He produced 19 sixes in seven games for Multan Sultans in Pakistan Super League. \"Tim David is going to partner Kieron Pollard at number 5 and 6. Fortunately, he got a spell at RCB last year. so he has got experience of IPL.\" Lucknow has best first XI but not so great back-up ================================ Lucknow Supergiants have prepared a good first eleven with likes KL Rahul, Quinton de Kock, Marcus Stonis, Manish Pandey, Krunal Pandya, Jason Holder, Mark Wood and Avesh Khan but look short on back-up in terms of batting reserves. Manan Vohra isn't simply good enough having failed in IPL for ages now. But if their first XI clicks, they are the team to watch out for. It is understood that Gautam Gambhir will speak to sworn enemies Krunal Pandya and Deepak Hooda to ensure harmony in the teams. Hooda had left his first-class team Baroda, alleging that Pandya senior had bullied him and threatened to destroy his career. Rajasthan Royals have best bowling attack =========================== Rajasthan Royals in terms of bowling talent has the best resources with Ravichandran Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal as spinners along with Prasidh Krishna and Trent Boult as their first choice pacers. With Navdeep saini as back-up, the bowling attack looks good and so does the batting where Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson, Shimron Hetmyer and Devdutt Padikkal pack quite a punch. The only weak link is lack of a genuine all-rounder. Chennai Super Kings once again has solid base ============================== CSK spent heavily (around 4 crore) on big-hitting batting all-rounder Shivam Dube but got New Zealander Devon Conway for a steal amount of Rs 1 crore base price and little known Sri Lankan spinner Mahesh Theeksana. They have their core in place and Dhoni will perhaps depend on Adam Milne to do the job alongside Deepak Chahar, Dwayne Bravo and Ravindra Jadeja. It would be interesting to note if Dhoni invests his time on young U-19 pacer Rajvardhan Hangargekar and builds him as one for the future. Kolkata Knight Riders look short on batting depth ====================================== While Venkatesh Iyer is a sure-shot opener in IPL, Ajinkya Rahane doesn't inspire the highest confidence and only Shreyas Iyer and Andre Russell look like game-changers in the middle-order. While Nitish Rana cost them a fortune, his struggles against quality pace bowling and short-pitched stuff is well documented even if he is slotted to open like last year. Also Sheldon Jackson, a dedicated domestic performer doesn't have a lot of experience and KKR lost a bidding frenzy to Sunrisers Hyderabad, going for Nicholas Pooran (10.75 crore). Finally, late in the day, they got Sam Billings for Rs 2 crore and the controversial but very talented Alex Hales for Rs 1.5 crore. But both beng foreign recruits, the choice of four overseas players becomes a tricky one in the absence of a good Indian glovesman. However with Pat Cummins, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakravarthy and Shivam Mavi they make a good bowling attack and if Russell is fit to bowl, it just adds to the sting. Gujarat Titans doesn't look the best side on view ============================== The team that impressed least at the auction was Gujarat Titans and their planning for the auction, prepared by Director of Cricket Vikram Solanki, was not clear. Till last hour of two-day auction, Titans didn't have a keeper in its rolls and finally grabbed Wriddhiman Saha for Rs 1.90 crore, beating Chennai Super Kings. They also bid for Matthew Wade for Rs 2.40 crore. In their batting department, they have Shubman Gill, Jason Roy as only specialist batters with skipper Hardik Pandya as the most experienced IPL player. The only other player was Abhinav Manohar before they understood their desperation and went for David Miller, who fetched a cool Rs 3 crore after going unsold on first day. It was therefore understandable that if Miller was so sought after, then why didn't he get picked in first place. In all it was an IPL auction where most of the marquee buys showed a prudent approach from the franchises while some like every year defied logic.

Australia posted 164-6 and were cruising to victory until powerful hitting by Nissanka and captain Dasun Shanaka (34 from 19 balls) kept the touring side in the game and they finished level on 164-8. In the tie-breaking Super Over, Australia's Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell easily chased down the five-run target set by Sri Lanka to put their side 2-0 up in the five-match series. Josh Hazlewood was the pick of Australia's bowlers, taking 3-22 in addition to his miserly Super Over, capping a brilliant weekend for the 31-year-old after he was bought for $1 million in the Indian Premier League auction on Saturday. A superb run-out by Steve Smith at deep midwicket ended Shanaka's effort, leaving Sri Lanka at 115-5 after 16 overs and the game delicately poised. Nissanka holed out in the deep with 12 off four balls required, and one ball later there was concern for Smith who hit his head on the ground in an acrobatic, but unsuccessful, effort to save a six. It was later confirmed that the 32-year-old had suffered concussion and would miss the rest of the series. \"Steve Smith has concussion and will be subject to low level protocols for the next few days and full recovery in 6-7 days,\" Cricket Australia said in a statement. Australia captain Aaron Finch said: \"It was great to get the win, but pretty sloppy overall.\" After losing the toss, Finch survived two close lbw reviews before departing for 25, stumped off the bowling of Wanindu Hasaranga. The leg-spinner ended with figures of 2-33. Josh Inglis top-scored with 48, including five boundaries. Sri Lanka, who did not concede a six until Matthew Wade's 20th over cameo of 13 from four balls against Nuwan Thushara, bowled with discipline and the seamers utilised clever changes of pace. \"The boys showed character, these youngsters when they go to the middle, they take the fight on,\" Shanaka said.

In the final over of Sri Lanka’s thrilling run chase in Sydney, Maheesh Theekshana slapped a length delivery from all-rounder Marcus Stoinis towards the mid-wicket boundary. Smith leapt up with an outstretched arm, and in one motion managed to catch the ball in his right hand and flick it back into play. Watch The Dettol T20 Series Australia vs Sri Lanka.

Start your free trial now > But the 32-year-old landed heavily onto the turf and didn’t initially return to his feet, instead rolling on the ground and holding his head in considerable discomfort. Australian teammate Pat Cummins quickly retrieved the ball before checking on Smith as Glenn Maxwell frantically waved towards the dressing rooms. “Smith’s in all sorts of trouble,” Fox Cricket commentator Mark Howard said. “Steve Smith has come down really, really hard here.” What an entertaining last over! Unbelievable effort from @stevesmith49 ridiculous hands ð. Come on Aussies #AUSvSL Hope Steve Smith is OK after this one. Superhuman effort cruely denied by a step on the rope. Concern obviously there for concussion, suffered a concussion with delayed symptoms in 2019 Ashes series #AUSvSL pic.twitter.com/lQxYE6Y2ly Team doctors sprinted onto the field to assess Smith, who did not feature in the rest of the match. A relieved cheer echoed around the SCG as the star cricketer returned to his feet, albeit a bit dazed and frazzled. However, the New South Welshman was bitterly disappointed to find out his fielding efforts were for nothing, with umpires awarding a six because his right foot had touched the boundary rope before he jumped in the air. Smith watched from the fine-leg boundary as Dushmantha Chameera cracked Stoinis’ final delivery towards long-off for a four, forcing a Super Over. He seemed more concerned about the match outcome than his own health. “Whenever anyone dives and doesn’t get up straight away, it’s always a bit of a concern,” Australian teammate Josh Hazlewood told reporters after the match. “It’s good to see him walking around now and make his way off the field.” Cricket Australia later confirmed in a statement: “Steve Smith has concussion and will be subject to low level protocols for the next few days and full recovery in 6-7 days. He will miss the remainder of the Dettol T20 International Series against Sri Lanka. “No replacement in the squad planned at this stage.” That was scary. Hope Steve Smith is ok. Hitting his head after making spectacular attempt to catch and save a six. @scg #AUSvSL pic.twitter.com/g1hfNeApfg Earlier in the match, Smith pulled off a miracle run out to remove the dangerous Pathum Nissanka for 73, hitting the stumps from 50 metres away to find the Sri Lankan opener inches short of making his ground. He struck 14 off 15 balls to help Australia register a score of 6/164 in the first innings, with Perth Scorchers gloveman Josh Inglis top-scoring with 48 off 32 balls. Smith has an unfortunate history of concussion – the right-hander was infamously struck on the neck by a Jofra Archer bouncer during the 2019 Ashes Test at Lord’s, and subsequently missed the third match at Headingley. He also suffered a head knock in a net session during a white-ball tour of England in 2020, sidelining him for most of the series. On Saturday, Victorian opener Will Pucovski suffered the 11th concussion of his young career after kicking a netball into his own head during a warm-up before day four of a Sheffield Shield clash against South Australia. The 24-year-old’s latest setback sparked debate about whether he should consider early retirement to avoid long-term brain damage. Last year, Derbyshire wicketkeeper Harvey Hosein retired from all forms of professional cricket at the age of 25 after suffering repeated concussions. Stoinis was tasked with defending 19 runs from the final over in Sunday’s 20-over contest, but Sri Lanka’s lower-order took advantage of some wayward bowling to force a Super Over. But Hazlewood, bowling the first Super Over of his professional career, showed his class by conceding just five runs in six deliveries, with Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell needing only three balls to chase the six-run target. Following a sublime 12 months in the game’s shortest format, which included an Indian Premier League title and a T20 World Cup triumph, Hazlewood was picked up by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for approximately AU$1.44 million at this weekend’s IPL action. Australia’s third T20 against Sri Lanka gets underway at Canberra’s Manuka Oval on Tuesday evening, with the first ball scheduled for 7.10pm AEDT. Sydney Sixers all-rounder Moises Henriques will presumably replace Smith at No. 5 for the third T20, but Daniel Sams and Ashton Agar are also options if selectors believed an strike bowler was required. The life of an unheralded cricketer has changed after he was snapped up for an eye-watering sum in the IPL auction. It took a super over and some Steve Smith acrobatics with potentially dangerous consequences before Australia could emerge victorious in a thrilling T20 contest with Sri Lanka. England paceman Stuart Broad has broken his silence on his shock Test axing, which was delivered to him in a “five-minute phone call”.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Aussie cricket star ‘in all sorts of trouble’","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/smith-smith-ruled-out-of-t20-series-against-sri-lanka-after-concussion-scare/news-story/aa3bc6e2c66768f5d8b65171c4926819","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australian cricketer Steve Smith has been ruled out of the remainder of the T20 series against Sri Lanka after suffering concussion during Sunday evening’s match at the SCG.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-13 14:17:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 Auction Day 2 Live: Tim David, Romario Shepherd The Surprise Packages, U19 Stars Raj Bawa, Rajvardhan Hangargekar Hit Jackpot - NDTVSports.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvaXBsLTIwMjItbWVnYS1hdWN0aW9uLWxpdmUtdXBkYXRlcy0yNzY1NjAz0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9pcGwtMjAyMi1tZWdhLWF1Y3Rpb24tbGl2ZS11cGRhdGVzLTI3NjU2MDM_YW1wPTEmYWthbWFpLXJ1bT1vZmY?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022 Auction Day 2 Live: Tim David, Romario Shepherd The Surprise Packages, U19 Stars Raj Bawa, Rajvardhan Hangargekar Hit Jackpot  NDTVSports.comIPL Auction 2022 LIVE updates: Hales sold to Kolkata; Miller, Saha, Wade to Gujarat; Shakib, Umesh unsold  SportstarDay 2 Of Mega IPL Auction Begins 143 Players Under The Hammer | Breaking News  India TodayBig payouts for young fast-bowlers reflect cultural shift in Indian cricket  CNBCTV18As Faf du Plessis' CSK Journey Ends, Team & Wife Post Emotional Messages: IPL Auction | The Quint  The QuintView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-13 14:14:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Steve Smith to miss remainder of T20 series with concussion after freakish fielding effort - Wide World of Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3b3MubmluZS5jb20uYXUvY3JpY2tldC9hdXN0cmFsaWEtc3JpbGFua2Etc2Vjb25kLXQyMGktMjAyMi1zLXRldmUtc21pdGgtY29uY3Vzc2VkLWFmdGVyLWNyYXp5LWZpZWxkaW5nLXNhdmUvOTM3MzcxNjMtOTlhZC00NDU3LWFhNWMtMWNhMGZhNjRhMDI10gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Steve Smith to miss remainder of T20 series with concussion after freakish fielding effort  Wide World of SportsAussie cricket star ‘in all sorts of trouble’  NEWS.com.auConcussed Smith out of T20 series as Australia hang on in thriller  Sydney Morning HeraldSmith out of T20 series with concussion after scary head knock trying to save six  Fox SportsSteven Smith suffers concussion, to miss the rest of the SL T20I series  ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-13 13:57:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"David joins IPL millionaires club as top Aussie buy - cricket.com.au","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcmlja2V0LmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2lwbC1tZWdhLWF1Y3Rpb24tZGF5LXR3by1hdXN0cmFsaWFucy10aW0tZGF2aWQtc21pdGgtbWNkZXJtb3R0LWZpbmNoLWx5bm4temFtcGEtYWdhci1tZXJlZGl0aC1tYXJudXMvMjAyMi0wMi0xM9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"David joins IPL millionaires club as top Aussie buy  cricket.com.auNo.1 player in Aus?

With this win, Australia have gained a 2-0 lead in the five-match series and the third T20I will now be played on Tuesday. In the super over, Sri Lanka scored just five runs and Australia managed to chase it down. Chasing 165, Sri Lanka got off to a bad start as the side lost Danushka Gunathilaka (0) on the fifth ball of the innings to Josh Hazlewood. In his next over, Hazlewood struck again as he dismissed Avishka Fernando (5). Charith Asalanka (0) was bowled for a duck by Pat Cummins and Sri Lanka were reduced to 25/3 in the fifth over. Pathum Nissanka kept Sri Lanka in the game with his 73-run knock and he was supported by Dasun Shanaka who scored 34. In the final over, Maheesh Theekshana scored ten runs from three balls and in the end, the match progressed to a super over. Earlier, Josh Inglis played a 48-run knock as Australia posted 164/6 in the allotted 20 overs. Skipper Aaron Finch scored 25 for Australia and there was no other batter who stayed at the crease for a long haul. Promoted Ben McDermott (18), Glenn Maxwell (15), Steve Smith (14), Marcus Stoinis (19) all got in but none of them managed to stay at the crease for a long time. In the end, Matthew Wade (13) and Pat Cummins (6) remained unbeaten for the hosts. For Sri Lanka, Dusmantha Chameera and Wanindu Hasaranga picked up two wickets each. Brief scores: Australia 164/6 (Josh Inglis 48, Aaron Finch 25; Dushmantha Chameera 2-30); Sri Lanka 164/8 (Pathum Nissanka 73, Dasun Shanaka 34; Josh Hazlewood 3-22).","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-02/6958n2lo_australia-sri-lanka-afp_625x300_13_February_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka send it to Super Over","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/sri-lanka-send-it-to-super-over/video/bd7cc5c80629ded42e063fa5ff6fa834","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Steve Smith put his body on the line in attempt to save a boundary in the final over against Sri Lanka, however the six was awarded and Sri Lanka would hit a four on the final ball to tie the match and send it to a Super Over.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-13 12:32:09","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka send it to Super Over","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/sri-lanka-send-it-to-super-over/video/bd7cc5c80629ded42e063fa5ff6fa834","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Steve Smith put his body on the line in attempt to save a boundary in the final over against Sri Lanka, however the six was awarded and Sri Lanka would hit a four on the final ball to tie the match and send it to a Super Over.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-13 12:32:09","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Confused and angry’ Stuart Broad breaks silence on England snub for West Indies tour","link":"https://metro.co.uk/2022/02/13/cricket-stuart-broad-breaks-silence-england-snub-west-indies-ashes-defeat-16097175/","keywords":["Cricket","Australia cricket","England cricket","James Anderson","Joe Root","Stuart Broad","The Ashes","West Indies Cricket"],"creator":["Louis Sealey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Broad and fellow England legend James Anderson were both left out.","content":"England dropped Stuart Broad for next month’s tour to West Indies (Picture: Getty) England hero Stuart Broad says the decision to leave him out of the West Indies tour has left him ‘confused and angrier with each passing day’. Broad and long-time opening partner James Anderson have both been omitted from England’s squad for next month’s three-match Test series in the Caribbean. The 35-year-old, England’s second-highest wicket-taker with 537 from 152 Tests, took 13 wickets in three matches during the recent 4-0 Ashes defeat in Australia. ‘I am waking up more confused and angrier with each passing day. I feel gutted,’ Broad said in a column for the Daily Mail. ‘Do I need to prove myself again? In my mind, I’ve nothing to prove. I am a proven performer, so it is now about the English cricketing summer and mentally and physically targeting the home series against New Zealand in June.’ Only one England bowler – Mark Wood – took more wickets than Broad during the Ashes defeat. Broad says the West Indies omission hurts as his ‘standards have not dropped’ and reveals he was told the news in a five-minute phone call with interim England director of cricket Sir Andrew Strauss. He added: ‘I have to confess that I wasn’t expecting the phone call I received from Andrew Strauss on Tuesday that started with him saying: “I’ve got some bad news.” ‘That’s not what you really want to hear on selection matters, and not something I have heard very often during my career of 152 Test caps. ‘I always try to find a positive in the hand that has been dealt to me. To be honest, though, that’s been quite tricky this time because the decision to leave me out of the tour of West Indies has hit me pretty hard.’ Only five bowlers in history have taken more wickets than Broad and Strauss insists the door is not closed for the Nottinghamshire star and his close friend and team-mate Anderson. ‘I want to emphasise this does not mean the end for them as England players,’ said Strauss. “We feel that it is important to look at some exciting new bowling potential and give some added responsibility to other players who have featured previously,” added Strauss. ‘No-one doubts the quality and experience that James and Stuart bring to the England set-up.

England fast bowler Jofra Archer’s white-ball prowess was highlighted by Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians after they flexed their financial muscle to buy him in the mega auction ahead of the 15th season of the IPL. In what will be termed as an intelligent yet strange ploy by the most successful franchise in the tournament, them playing an incredible waiting game to buy him speaks a lot about a decision made for the future. Archer, who had listed himself in the highest base price category of INR 2 crore, immediately initiated a bidding war between Rajasthan Royals (his previous IPL franchise) and Mumbai. While Royals opted out after a certain price limit, Indians then faced competition from Sunrisers Hyderabad. However, MI’s determination led to them buying Archer for INR 8 crore. You know you are good when you go for a Million dollars & you are injured !!! #Jofra #IPLAuction2022 — Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) February 13, 2022 In 35 IPL matches across three seasons, the 26-year old player has picked 46 wickets at an average of 21.33, an economy rate of 7.13 and a strike rate of 17.93. Will Jofra Archer be playing IPL 2022? Archer, who has frequently missed international cricket for almost two years now due to a trouble in his right elbow, had to undergo a surgery in May last year. Having injured his elbow yet again in a Sussex vs Kent County Championship 2021 match, a surgery was the need of the hour for Archer. Archer, who had written about the ICC T20 World Cup 2021 and Ashes 2021-22 being his primary focus, had to miss both the premier tournaments due to a lengthy rehabilitation process. It is worth mentioning that Archer is highly unlikely to take part in IPL 2022 due to the aforementioned reason. It goes without saying that MI have bid for him keeping an eye on the 2023 and subsequent seasons. Knowing that Archer would have missed IPL 2022, Mumbai don’t even have an option of seeking for a replacement player for him. Hence, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that Indians have already saved INR 8 crore for IPL 2023 auction.
