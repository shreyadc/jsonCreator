For a team that has lost the previous five Test series’, the decision to hand McCullum represents a major risk especially since he has never coached at first-class or Test level. Watch The 2022 Indian Premier League on Kayo. Every Match Live & On-Demand. New to Kayo? Try 14-Days Free Now > As a player, the Kiwi was known for his exciting and attacking play across all forms of cricket, dazzling with his risky style of batting that either netted him major rewards or ended his innings early. His only experience as a coach has come in franchise cricket, leading teams in the Indian and Caribbean Premier League. T20 cricket is the one form of the game that was a perfect marriage for how McCullum liked to play the game, but how will he go as a Test coach? No-one exactly knows, which is perhaps why England director of cricket Rob Key warned fans to “buckle up and get ready for the ride.” What that ride entails has former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan slightly nervous. MORE COVERAGE Aussie tour concerns grow amid deadly protests and ‘shoot on sight’ orders Tim Paine overlooked for contract in sign career may be officially over Aussie World Cup duo star for Ponting’s Delhi as Warner makes mockery of IPL axing Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum was named coach of England's Test side. (Photo by Marty MELVILLE / AFP) Source: AFP “I am all for attacking play and being aggressive but I don’t think this England Test team is in a position to play that way at the moment,” Vaughan wrote in The Telegraph. “They have to take small steps first, get used to playing long hard periods of Test cricket and then in time, if you get a group of players with a lot of confidence, they can play more flamboyantly. “They need a bit of ‘backs to the walls’ stuff first. I hope Brendon can drive that. “He is the kind of person who might not want to do that but he has to realise England are in a position where they need to just to do the basics for longer periods than they have been doing. “They cannot be flamboyant because they will get bowled out cheaply. They are not a team who can play a huge amount of shots. They have to give themselves a chance to stay in.” But nervousness can also bring about excitement. Handing McCullum the keys to the Test team is a one-way trip to the unknown as England prepare to risk things a little more than they have in the past. Sure, the results may not be exactly what all parties involved wish for, but The Times’ chief cricket correspondent Mike Atherton believes that “it will be a lot of fun watching them try.” McCullum has no experience as a Test coach. (AAP Image/Dave Hunt) Source: AAP “After two grim years of desperate, unimaginative leadership, the England Test team, one suspects, are about to be given licence and freedom to play, and will not lack inspiration from leaders in whom a competitive spirit and desire to win seeps from every pore,” Atherton said. “The sense of renewed optimism after the announcement of Stokes as captain has been reinforced.” There are also undeniable parallels between the personalities of Stokes and McCullum. “The perception of Brendon is that he is attacking, flamboyant, risky, a gambler and a bit of a lad,” Vaughan said. “What is our impression of Ben? Exactly the same.” The striking similarities between the two might be why McCullum is reportedly set to end England’s midnight curfew, according to The Telegraph’s Nick Hoult and Tim Wigmore. The curfew has been in place since 2017 having been imposed by former team director Andrew Strauss after a number of boozy drinking sessions late at night became public knowledge. The curfew required players to return to the team hotel by midnight and they were permitted to continue enjoying each other’s company after that time but only in the confines of the team hotel. Ending the curfew will be music to the ears of Stokes and other senior players in the squad. Stokes took over as England captain after Joe Root resigned in April. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images “It is understood Stokes believes players should be responsible for their own actions and if treated like adults will act accordingly,” Hoult and Wigmore said. “If they go out drinking at times when it would be unprofessional for the team’s cause, then they will be held responsible.” Of course, the decision will not be made without informing Key. But he has shown that he’s willing to make bold choices in his quest to restore England as a Test powerhouse. “In his first big appointment - making Stokes captain was such a formality as to be no decision at all - Key could not have signalled his intention any more clearly to move away from what has characterised the side for two years,” Atherton said. “As is often the way, Key has chosen someone cut from a very difficult cloth to his predecessor; McCullum is the anti-Chris Silverwood.” It just so happens that McCullum’s first games as England Test coach will be a three-match series against New Zealand in June. Time will tell as to how successful he will prove to be, but from the commentary over in England, one thing’s for certain: it won’t be a boring ride.","pubDate":"2022-05-12 22:07:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England name Kiwi as new coach","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/england-name-kiwi-as-new-coach/video/8a84d5c6a7164ad21d01712d8080ba3a","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Kiwi great Brendon McCullum will take over as England coach, following a disappointing couple of years.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-12 21:36:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australian state 'p****d off' after Messi's Argentina pull out of highly anticipated clash","link":"https://www.the42.ie/australian-state-pissed-off-after-messis-argentina-pull-out-of-highly-anticipated-clash-5762528-May2022/","keywords":["Victoria"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ticket holders for the clash at Melbourne Cricket Ground will be eligible for refunds.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-12 21:29:09","image_url":"https://c1.thejournal.ie/media/2022/05/soccer-football-world-cup-south-american-qualifiers-argentina-v-venezuela-estadio-la-bombonera-buenos-aires-argentina-march-25-2022-argentinas-lionel-messi-reacts-reutersagustin-marcari-630x422.jpg","source_id":"the42","country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Brabourne Stadium last IPL match 2022: Brabourne Stadium IPL 2022 match list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-brabourne-stadium-last-ipl-match-2022-brabourne-stadium-ipl-2022-match-list/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Punjab Kings","RCB","Indian Premier League","PBKS","Royal Challengers Bangalore"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brabourne Stadium IPL 2022 match list: The Cricket Club of India will be hosting its 14th Indian Premier League 2022 match tonight.

Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma has appreciated the ground staff for preparing a bowler-friendly pitch for the recently concluded 59th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League against Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede Stadium. 30.5 overs of play witnessed both the teams scoring a combined of 200/15 under testing conditions. With the surface conducive to swing bowling, both Chennai and Mumbai underwent top-order collapses against left-arm pacers in the powerplay. “We have played a lot of cricket here [Wankhede Stadium]. On so many occasions, we’ve had pitches like this. It’s nice to get bowlers into the game as well at times. It’s been batting-friendly pitches all over. It was good to see bounce and swing from both sides which was good to watch,” Sharma told Star Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony. Win at home! 💙 Well done boys 💪🧿 pic.twitter.com/zdMiLG825p — Surya Kumar Yadav (@surya_14kumar) May 12, 2022 It was due to the pitch that MI were reduced to 34/4 in the powerplay in a 98-run chase . Sharma admitted that top-order dismissals including himself resulted in “tense moments” in the dugout. “Looking at how the pitch was playing and to lose wickets upfront, there were tense moments in the middle. It was just about keeping calm and getting the job done,” Sharma added. The calm which Sharma talked about was primarily provided by batter Tilak Varma. Coming in to bat at No. 4 after the skipper was dismissed in the fourth over, Varma scored 34* (32) with the help of four fours to play a titular role in guiding Mumbai to their third IPL 2022 victory. In what wasn’t the most fluent of Varma’s innings, a responsible knock was enough to prevent a further batting collapse. Having scored 368 runs in 12 innings at an average and strike rate of 40.88 and 132.85 respectively, Varma has successfully converted his maiden IPL season into a breakout one by being the top-order for his team. “He [Tilak Varma] has been brilliant, playing for the first year, having such a calm head is never easy. I feel he’s going to be an all-format player for India pretty soon. He’s got the technique and temperament. A lot of things are looking bright for him. And there’s hunger as well,” Sharma said of the 19-year old batter from Hyderabad. A significant change to their Playing XI for this match had come in the form of vice-captain Kieron Pollard making way for debutant batter Tristan Stubbs. While the move didn’t work out like most of their moves this season, Sharma reiterated his views on the former West Indian captain volunteering to make way for a youngster. “He’s been a stalwart for Mumbai. There’s no doubt about it. I said it at the toss as well. It was him who came out and spoke about he was okay with that because obviously we are looking at players. Had we been in a situation where we had a chance to qualify, probably this wouldn’t have happened,” Sharma concluded.","pubDate":"2022-05-12 18:37:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan Women's Captain's Daughter Denied Accreditation For CWG Village","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/pakistan-womens-cricket-captain-bismah-maroofs-infant-daughter-denied-accreditation-for-accessing-commonwealth-games-village-in-uk-2971023","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"It has been learnt that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had asked the CWG Federation for two extra accommodations for Maroof's mother and daughter in the village","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-12 17:27:31","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/hlr9fuh_india-players-with-bismah-maroof_120x90_07_March_22.jpg","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CSK vs MI IPL 2022 HIGHLIGHTS: Mumbai land knock out punch on Chennai -

Their chances of qualifying for the playoffs look bleak. \"I'd like to say how pleased I am to be given this opportunity to positively contribute to England's Test cricket set-up and move the team forward into a more successful era. In taking this role on, I am acutely aware of the significant challenges the team faces at present, and I strongly believe in my ability to help the team emerge as a stronger force once we've confronted them head-on. \"I've enjoyed several robust conversations with Rob Key about the direction of travel for the team and have found his enthusiasm contagious. I'm no stranger to bringing about change within a team environment, and I can't wait to get started. Ben Stokes is the perfect character to inspire change around him, and I look forward to working closely with him to build a successful unit around us,\" McCullum was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, ECB's CEO Rob Key expressed their delight to get McCullum on board as England's Test head coach. \"It has been a real privilege to get to know him and understand his views and vision for the game. I believe his appointment will be good for England's Test team. He has a recent history of changing cricket culture and environments for the better, and I believe he is the person to do that for England's red-ball cricket. \"We were incredibly fortunate to have a seriously strong list of quality candidates for the post, with Brendon demonstrating he was our number one choice. I'd like to thank Tom Harrison and the ECB Board for their support in this process. I believe in Brendon and Ben Stokes - a formidable coach and captain partnership. Time for us all to buckle up and get ready for the ride.\" McCullum represented the BlackCaps for 12 long years as he earned 101 Test caps, 260 One-Day International (ODIs), and 71 T20Is before calling it quits in 2016.","pubDate":"2022-05-12 17:02:49","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/05/12/500x300_1291832-bru.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RCB vs PBKS head to head list: Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Punjab Kings head to head last 5 match results","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-rcb-vs-pbks-head-to-head-list-royal-challengers-bangalore-vs-punjab-kings-head-to-head-last-5-match-results/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Punjab Kings","RCB","Indian Premier League","PBKS","Royal Challengers Bangalore"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"RCB vs PBKS head to head records and stats: The SportsRush presents for you the Head to Head statistics for IPL 2022 Match 60.

After what has been stated as ‘A calculated gamble’ by England’s new managing director of Cricket Rob Key, former Kiwi international Brendon McCullum has been named as England’s men team’s next test coach on Thursday. With Mccullum signing a four-year deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the development has meant that he would have to step down as head coach of the IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) post the ongoing season. “I’d like to say how pleased I am to be given this opportunity to positively contribute to England’s Test cricket set-up and move the team forward into a more successful era,” McCullum said in an ECB press release. The 40-year-old’s appointment comes at a time when the England men’s Cricket side is going through one of their worst phases in Test Cricket, having won mere one Test match out of the previous seventeen, including a 0-4 Ashes drubbing being handed by Australia earlier this year.

The former Kiwi batter’s appointment was a unanimous decision taken by ECB’s selection panel comprising Rob Key, CEO Tom Harrison, Strategic Adviser Andrew Strauss and Performance Director Mo Bobat. Between 2004 to 2016, McCullum amassed a total of 6,453 runs runs across 101 Test matches for New Zealand at an average of 38.64. With a personal highest score of 302 against India in the year 2014, the former Kiwi international remains the only triple-centurion for his country till date.

From the buccaneering if ultimately thwarted World Cup campaign in 2015 that inspired Eoin Morgan’s white-ball side to silverware four years later, to last summer’s World Test Championship triumph, admiration has been plentiful. In some ways the move to hire one of its architects, Brendon McCullum , should not be a total shock. Nevertheless, McCullum taking charge of the Test team, with the white-ball vacancy still outstanding, is an eye-catching move by Rob Key. It is in keeping with the wind that has swept through since the lamentable winter too. Key is a director of men’s cricket plucked from the commentary box, Ben Stokes is the new Test captain despite having occupied the role in only one previous first-class match – a head coach who has never done the job with a red-ball team simply completes the set. Brendon McCullum named England men’s Test coach on four-year deal Read more McCullum, 40 years young, hung up his rapier-like bat only in late 2019 and has since combined a couple of plum Twenty20 coaching roles with punditry. Even with a Caribbean Premier League trophy and a runners-up finish in the Indian Premier League to show for it, his rise to international coach has been rapid and those leapfrogged will doubtless be chuntering. As one veteran county player joked on text this week: “I’m not sure why I’m doing all these ECB coaching courses.” But like Key and Stokes, this appointment is based on a belief that real-life cricketing experience – in this case 101 Test caps and 31 as a dynamic captain – trumps all. Gary Kirsten, once again pipped to the job, took India and South Africa to new heights by galvanising teams with established stars; McCullum, along with Mike Hesson, his head coach, reimagined the culture of the New Zealand setup between 2013 and 2016, something that continued long after they departed. Having drunk in New Zealand’s approach to white-ball cricket, England now want to try the red. Looking at how McCullum did this gives clues to the approach Key wants. And like England’s revival under Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower back in the day, after the brief and loveless Kevin Pietersen/Peter Moores marriage, his tenure began amid acrimony. Ross Taylor had been sacked as captain to much public outcry and shouldered arms the next tour to South Africa. New Zealand then hit rock bottom in McCullum’s first Test in charge, rolled for 45 on the opening morning in Cape Town. Along with Hesson and Mike Sandle, the team manager, McCullum began diagnosing the problems. Players, they felt, were operating as individuals with the goal of doing just enough to stay in the side and not necessarily supporting newcomers. They had also become a touch arrogant on the field and were sledging opponents in a way that was out of character and inauthentic. “The way we played,” McCullum said two years on. “There was no soul.” For McCullum and his support staff this could only be achieved with an honest, optimistic environment and by reminding players why they took up the sport in the first place. “For a long time I had lost that and the team had lost that,” he recalled. “It sounds corny, but we talk about the little boy who fell in love with the game: when you have that mindset you can be positive and aggressive, because you’re thinking about what can go right, rather than what might go wrong.” Brendon McCullum’s first job will be to form a key relationship with the new England Test captain Ben Stokes. Photograph: Ricardo Mazalán/AP Have England been guilty of falling out of love with the sport in recent times? Losing never helps and though a charge of arrogance would be a stretch, from the outside it is clear that cabin fever set in during the pandemic. The call from Stokes for a selfless, team-first mentality upon being made Test captain not only chimes with McCullum’s outlook but suggests this had not been the case while Australia were putting them through the Ashes mangle. Mark Wood, one of the most honest members of the squad, recently laid bare some of the whinging that had set in too. “We have to stop making excuses,” Wood told the latest Middle Please, Umpire podcast. “It has been hard with Covid but if we keep making excuses it gives us a way out, or a comfort zone as to why we’re not performing. We need to stand up more as individuals and say, ‘Look, this is why we’re not doing well, how are we going to get better?’ instead of ‘the nets aren’t good, we’ve had Covid, there’s too much travel’. Whatever the excuse, that breeds negativity.” Similarly, Key’s early appraisal was of a negative mentality and so with Covid-safe bubbles (hopefully) in the rear-view mirror, it is clear he believes McCullum’s infectious character, allied with the totemic presence of Stokes, can provide a jolt and maybe some soul. That said, it is important to remember that McCullum was one cog in the New Zealand machine, in conjunction with a wider move to produce better domestic pitches, improved leadership at all levels (ahem, English cricket still has no chair) and consistency in selection and communication. You can predict now that his mantra of “aggressive cricket” will be misunderstood in some quarters when England get it wrong. Like Trevor Bayliss, the previous head coach drafted in from overseas, McCullum preaches the positive option. But while he holds the record for the fastest Test century – 54 balls against Australia in 2016 – his career-best 302 against India in Wellington two years earlier was carved out over nearly 13 hours. Aggression comes in many forms. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. McCullum will also have to establish the distance required to make dispassionate calls. England’s players love his company after-hours and on the golf course – Morgan, a key influence in his appointment, made him master of ceremonies at his wedding – but the new relationship will require boundaries. Cosiness is not inevitable though. Both McCullum and Stokes are uncompromising men with a strong rugby influence – the former once nudged out Dan Carter at schools level, the latter is the son of a league international – and neither shirks confrontation. All told, it is a daring but calculated appointment starting rather poetically with the visit of New Zealand at Lord’s from 2 June. Nothing is guaranteed with a team that has languished for so long but English cricket, having stared admiringly at McCullum for so long, is about to find out if this can blossom into romance.","pubDate":"2022-05-12 15:00:06","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f64b462649e3fcbdacd2defd21d743d2da3b70a/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d19e4f99dabacef639a0002ec1a77fb9","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/chennai-super-kings-vs-mumbai-indians-live-score-over-match-59-t20-6-10-updates-2970322","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians from Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai.

Two good overs in a row for Chennai. 9.5 overs (0 Run) Floats it up on off, blocked. 9.5 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Dhoni though will feel he missed out! This is fired down the leg side. Dhoni looks to sweep but misses. Wided. Had he got bat on that, would have been a boundary. 9.4 overs (0 Run) Steps out, this is fired on the pads, Dhoni works it to mid-wicket. 9.3 overs (2 Runs) Two more! Leg byes! On off, this one turns back in nicely. It hits the pad of Dhoni as he tries to flick, it goes fine for two. 9.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Over the fence! Dhoni is batting with a lot of intent against the spinners! Uses his feet, gets to the pitch of it and heaves it over the mid-wicket fence. They need him to play long here. He has started off really well. 9.1 overs (1 Run) Leading edge but safe! On middle, comes slow off the surface. Bravo looks to flick it but does so early. It goes off a soft leading edge through mid on for one. 8.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! We saw power on the last ball and now a deft touch! Shorter and outside off, Dhoni waits and then guides it past point. This one races away too. A good end to the over and Chennai will need a lot more of these. 8.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Dhoni power! This is right in his arc, a lot of flight given, this is on middle, it is heaved over the mid-wicket fielder for a boundary. 8.4 overs (0 Run) Was there bat? Dhoni steps out, the length is shortened. Dhoni looks to defend. Not sure if he gets an inside edge onto the pads. It lobs towards cover but lands short. 8.3 overs (0 Run) Half an appeal but nothing! On the pads, Dhoni looks to defend but is beaten and gets hit on the pads. 8.2 overs (1 Run) Slightly shorter and on off, this is pushed through covers for one. 8.1 overs (0 Run) Flatter and on middle, defended. Kumar Kartikeya is brought into the attack now. 7.6 overs (1 Run) DROP AND RUN! Length and on off, Bravo pushes it towards point and takes one. He is off the mark. 7.5 overs (0 Run) BEATEN AGAIN! We are in the 8th over and the ball is still doing a bit. On off, this shapes away. Bravo is beaten all ends up as he tries to defend. 7.4 overs (0 Run) BEATEN! That is a beauty! The ball is still swinging. Length and on off, this one shapes away. Bravo is beaten as he tries to defend. 7.4 overs (5 Runs) FIVE WIDES! That has really taken off! Bonus runs though for Chennai and this will help their cause a little. This is short and down the leg side, this keeps rising. Kishan leaps but it hits his glove and goes down to the fine leg fence. Dwayne Bravo walks out. 7.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! Another one bites the dust and Riley Meredith gets his revenge! This is a really good short ball. Bends his back on this one. Bangs it short and on middle, this one comes at an awkward height for Dube who looks to ramp it. It goes off the top edge and Kishan takes a good leaping catch. Mumbai all over Chennai now. 7.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! That has been cracked! What a shot! Dube was probably waiting for the short ball and it did come, Dube rocks back and hammers it over the mid-wicket fielder for a boundary. 7.1 overs (0 Run) Shorter and outside off, Dube looks to cut but ends up chopping it on the off side. Strategic Break! And breathe! What a start it is to the El-Clasico and it is Mumbai on the front foot. They have sent Chennai's half of the team back. MS Dhoni is still out there and he needs to bat almost till the end to take his team to a respectable total. 6.6 overs (0 Run) Slightly shorter and pitches it on middle. The ball turns into Dhoni. He goes back and looks to work it towards the leg side but the ball bounces and hits him high on the pads. 6.5 overs (0 Run) Goes fuller on middle again. Dhoni works it towards the leg side. 6.4 overs (1 Run) Fuller on middle. Dube works it to long on for a single. 6.3 overs (0 Run) Slower in the air, on off. Dube gets forward and defends it. 6.2 overs (0 Run) A flatter and quicker one on off. Dube blocks it off the front foot. 6.1 overs (2 Runs) Just over the cover fielder! This is fuller, around off. Dube drives it uppishly and just over the cover fielder. Tristan Stubbs in the deep runs to his right and dives to keep it to just two runs. Hrithik Shokeen to bowl now. 5.6 overs (1 Run) Now a short ball to end the over. It is angled on the body. Dube manages to work it towards the leg side for a single. Mumbai have dominated this Powerplay. Chennai are 32/5 after 6 overs! 5.5 overs (2 Runs) A full delivery on middle. Dube flicks it through mid-wicket for a couple. Shivam Dube is the new man in. 5.4 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT BEHIND! Another wicket and Chennai have lost half of their side for just 29 runs here! This is a dream start for Mumbai and Ambati Rayudu who was looking good walks back disappointed. This one lands on a good length, around off. It nips back in a bit. Ambati Rayudu looks to defend. The ball catches the inside edge of his blade. Just a faint edge and Ishan Kishan behind the stumps takes the catch. Chennai will need a special effort to get to a competitive total from hereon. 5.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Superb shot from Ambati Rayudu! A fullish delivery, around off. Ambati Rayudu drives on the up and creams it through covers for a boundary. 5.2 overs (0 Run) Again that shape away from the batter, It is on a length and outside off. Ambati Rayudu plays away from his body and gets the bottom of his blade towards covers. 5.1 overs (0 Run) Starts with a full delivery on off. Bit of shape away from the batter. Ambati Rayudu blocks it out.","pubDate":"2022-05-12 14:44:10","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637879832423898136.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"DRS in IPL 2022: Why no DRS for Devon Conway in CSK vs MI IPL 2022 match?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-drs-in-ipl-2022-why-no-drs-for-devon-conway-in-csk-vs-mi-ipl-2022-match/","keywords":["Cricket","CSK","IPL 2022","Mumbai Indians","chennai super kings","csk","Daniel Sams","Devon Conway","Indian Premier League","MI"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"DRS in IPL 2022: The absence of Decision Review System in Indian Premier League Match 59 has ruffled many feathers.

During the 59th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma’s decision of fielding first after winning the toss has worked wonders for them. New ball bowlers Daniel Sams and Jasprit Bumrah joined hands to reduce Chennai Super Kings to 5/3 in the second over itself. It was on the second ball of the match that Sams found Devon Conway (0) wanting in front of the stumps. A couple of deliveries later, Chennai all-rounder Moeen Ali (0) had no clue whatsoever on how to cope with a well-directed short delivery from Sams. As a result, the left-handed batter ended up lobbing a short delivery to Hrithik Shokeen at short mid-wicket. Robin Uthappa, who batted at No. 4 for CSK after opening for a large part of IPL 2022, departed after scoring 1 (6) as Jasprit Bumrah pinned him in front of the stumps. It is worth mentioning that both players and fans were left confused after Conway wasn’t allowed to challenge umpire C. Ravikanthreddy’s decision regarding his dismissal. Bowling from over the wicket, Sams’ in-swinging delivery to dismiss Conway appeared to be missing the leg-stump. Had DRS been available, there was a high possibility of the third umpire changing the decision in Conway’s favour. IPL gyaan: You are playing cricket’s wealthiest tournament and there is no DRS because of ‘technical issues; then you get a poor umpiring call in the first over.
