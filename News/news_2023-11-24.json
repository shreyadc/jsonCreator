On winning the toss, Zimbabwe – who suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the hosts Namibia in their opening match at this tournament on Wednesday – put Tanzania in to bat first and their bowlers were soon among the wickets. Richard Ngarava started it off with two quick scalps, but the captain, Abhik Patwa, showed some determined resistance as he scored 18 runs off 33 balls before he was bowled by Sikandar Raza. The middle order crumbled and Tanzania appeared to be heading for humiliation when their seventh wicket fell at 40 in the 14th over. However, the later batters showed some spirit, with Ally Kimote at number nine starting the fightback with 16 off 15 balls. Their number 10, Salum Jumbe, did even better, hitting powerfully to score 24 not out off 14 deliveries, with two sixes and a four. Kimote was caught off Ngarava off the penultimate ball of the innings, which closed at 96 for nine. Ngarava took three wickets for 17 and Raza had three for 10, both bowling four overs, while there was a wicket each for Tendai Chatara and Ryan Burl. Zimbabwe opened their batting with Innocent Kaia and Tadiwanashe Marumani, who made 36 together off the first four overs. Kaia was then caught off Sanjay Thakor for 21, scored off 18 balls. Sean Williams then joined Marumani and the pair romped to victory without further loss. Marumani scored 39 not out off 27 balls, winning the match with a six over midwicket, while Williams was unbeaten with 36 off 19. Zimbabwe completed their nine-wicket victory with 9.2 overs to spare. Their next match is against Uganda on Sunday.","pubDate":"2023-11-23 18:58:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"3mob","source_priority":1904716,"country":["zimbabwe"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a439f56db242927a637da7965a8c1aef","title":"'Beckham' is revealed as Britain's favourite sports documentary with 'Senna' and 'Welcome to Wrexham' making up the podium in survey... but 'The Last Dance' is nowhere to be seen in the top 10!","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-12784717/Beckham-revealed-Britains-favourite-sports-documentary-Senna-Welcome-Wrexham-making-podium-survey-Dance-seen-10.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"While football documentaries dominated the top ten, nine different sports were represented in the top 20.

'Beckham' was only released in October but has been a smash hit and pips 'Senna' and 'Welcome to Wrexham' to top spot. In a big shock, 'The Last Dance' - the series about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls that inspired a new wave of basketball fans - has to settle for 14th place. While football documentaries dominated the top ten, nine different sports were represented in the top 20, showing Britain's varied taste. They're now so ingrained in our routine that almost one in five people (19%) say that sports docs take centre stage for a Saturday night binge. 'Beckham' has been named as Britain's most-loved sports documentary in a new poll by Betfair 'The Last Dance', following Michael Jordan's historic time with the Chicago Bulls, only ranked 14th in the list Even out of those people who admit they couldn't care for sport, 60% owned up to the guilty pleasure of feasting their eyes on a fine sporting documentary. Alongside documentaries on football, F1, and basketball, there was room in the top 20 for shows about snooker, tennis, cycling, cricket, golf, and cheerleading. Brits named football and F1 as the two sports they want to see documentaries about the most, but also named athletics - which doesn't have any shows in the top 20 - in third place on their wishlist. As for specific teams they'd love to watch one about, they opted for Manchester United's 1999 Treble-winning side under Sir Alex Ferguson as their most craved. That was ahead of England's 2003 Rugby World Cup-winning team coached by Mail Sport columnist Sir Clive Woodward, and the 1980s West Indies cricket team. 'Welcome to Wrexham' came third behind 'Senna' and the new Beckham documentary The survey was put together by Betfair, who have produced a mini-doc on Irish jockey Rachael Blackmore titled: 'Serial Winners: Rachael Blackmore'. It comes out on November 25. Betfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom said: 'It's clear that we're a nation of sports documentary lovers. They are fast becoming the new 'go-to' for Saturday night viewing, bringing the same levels of drama and intrigue as some of the nation's favourite soaps. 'Even people who aren't into sport are tuning into them, with 60% saying they like to watch them. Give me Beckham over Brookside any day of the week! 'The story of Rachael Blackmore is no different – a tale of the trials, tribulations and perseverance it takes to succeed against the odds. Our Serial Winners mini-documentary will give fans a great insight on this and we can't wait for the yellow carpet premiere at Haydock Racecourse on Saturday.

Playing his first international match at home, Rinku scoring 22* (14) with the help of four fours came across as a breath of fresh air for disheartened Indian fans. Needing seven runs in the last over with five wickets in hand, there wasn’t an iota of doubt around the match going down to the last ball. With India losing three batters within as many deliveries, Rinku was required to score a run off the last ball. Once Australia all-rounder Sean Abbott (1/43) bowled in the left-handed batter’s slot, all Rinku had to do was clear the 11 Australian fielders present inside the 30-yard circle. The 26-year old player, on the contrary, hit the right-arm pacer down the ground for an authoritative six. What A Game! What A Finish! What Drama! 1 run to win on the last ball and it’s a NO BALL that seals #TeamIndia‘s win in the first #INDvAUS T20I! Scorecard https://t.co/T64UnGxiJU @IDFCFIRSTBank pic.twitter.com/J4hvk0bWGN — BCCI (@BCCI) November 23, 2023 That said, an unintentional no-ball on Abbott’s part denied Rinku of a match-winning six. For the unversed, a match gets over as and when the required number of runs are completed. In this case, Abbott’s no-ball handed India the run they were looking for in the first T20I in Visakhapatnam on Friday. India, who chased down a 209-run target, registered their highest successful run-chase in the format. Conditioned to remain calm and composed in such nail-biting circumstances, Rinku spread his arms to announce his arrival at the highest level tonight. In what was his sixth T20I, the Uttar Pradesh batter was facing a top opponent such as Australia for the first time. Known for his finishing skills, Rinku not letting the magnitude of this match affect him has provided a shot in the arm to his stature. Virender Sehwag Was Denied An ODI Century In 2010 13 years before Rinku’s sealed a last-ball chase for the nation, Sehwag was denied of what would’ve been his 13th ODI century at the time. Chasing a 171-run target against Sri Lanka at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, both India and Sehwag needed a run to win and complete a hundred respectively. As one would’ve expected from him back in the day, Sehwag had hit former Sri Lanka spinner Suraj Randiv for a six at will to accomplish both the aforementioned tasks. However, Randiv’s foot-long no-ball became an instant source of controversy.

McGahey featured in six T20 internationals at an International Cricket Council World Cup qualifying series hosted in Los Angeles, scoring 118 runs. But under the new rules she will no longer be eligible to represent her country in women’s cricket, with any player who has gone through male puberty prior to transitioning now excluded. Australia's former World Cup winning captain Alex Blackwell shares her disappointment with ICC's decision to ban trans athletes in cricket. — Female Cricket (@imfemalecricket) The England and Wales Cricket Board’s current regulations for domestic matches state participation of trans players is to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, though the policy is yet to be tested in elite county cricket. Yet there are fears over the message that the ICC’s ruling will sent to young players starting out in the game and those competing at amateur level. Lachlan Smith, chair of Birmingham Unicorns CC, one of only three LGBTQ+ cricket clubs in the country, told the PA news agency: “It came completely out of the blue. Nobody saw it coming at all. “Relative to my understanding of how sport is addressing the question of trans participation, cricket and the ICC seem to have gone much further than any other sport. They’ve brought in a policy that feels like a very blunt instrument, and it’s disappointing to see that. “If you’re a young person who identifies as trans and you’re playing cricket, I think it will be very disheartening to see this. “Even if you don’t believe you’re good enough to be international standard, it’s just a very negative message to be receiving at a time when we’re trying to get more LGBTQ people involved in the game. “We’ve had a lot of success in doing that including within the trans community. So we’re disappointed.” Cricket Australia said on Thursday that its policy on trans participation remains unchanged and that players who have transitioned are still eligible to compete at elite level domestically. That also remains the ECB’s stance, though consultations have taken place over the last year with stakeholders from across the game which could lead to an updating of the governing body’s position.

McGahey featured in six T20 internationals at an International Cricket Council World Cup qualifying series hosted in Los Angeles, scoring 118 runs. But under the new rules she will no longer be eligible to represent her country in women’s cricket, with any player who has gone through male puberty prior to transitioning now excluded. Australia's former World Cup winning captain Alex Blackwell shares her disappointment with ICC's decision to ban trans athletes in cricket. — Female Cricket (@imfemalecricket) The England and Wales Cricket Board’s current regulations for domestic matches state participation of trans players is to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, though the policy is yet to be tested in elite county cricket. Yet there are fears over the message that the ICC’s ruling will sent to young players starting out in the game and those competing at amateur level. Lachlan Smith, chair of Birmingham Unicorns CC, one of only three LGBTQ+ cricket clubs in the country, told the PA news agency: “It came completely out of the blue. Nobody saw it coming at all. “Relative to my understanding of how sport is addressing the question of trans participation, cricket and the ICC seem to have gone much further than any other sport. They’ve brought in a policy that feels like a very blunt instrument, and it’s disappointing to see that. “If you’re a young person who identifies as trans and you’re playing cricket, I think it will be very disheartening to see this. “Even if you don’t believe you’re good enough to be international standard, it’s just a very negative message to be receiving at a time when we’re trying to get more LGBTQ people involved in the game. “We’ve had a lot of success in doing that including within the trans community. So we’re disappointed.” Cricket Australia said on Thursday that its policy on trans participation remains unchanged and that players who have transitioned are still eligible to compete at elite level domestically. That also remains the ECB’s stance, though consultations have taken place over the last year with stakeholders from across the game which could lead to an updating of the governing body’s position. Last year, Rugby Union and Rugby League both took the decision to ban trans players from competing in the female-only from of the game, whilst swimming and cycling have taken similar steps. Smith said that members of his club have been consulted by the ECB and that they had been satisfied with the process so far, but call for more transparency from the ICC on how its decision has been reached. “The ECB are currently undertaking review of their trans participation policies,” said Smith. “They’ve worked with us and other LGBTQ stakeholders in the game on a consultation process.

On winning the toss, Zimbabwe – who suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the hosts Namibia in their opening match at this tournament on Wednesday – put Tanzania in to bat first and their bowlers were soon among the wickets. Richard Ngarava started it off with two quick scalps, but the captain, Abhik Patwa, showed some determined resistance as he scored 18 runs off 33 balls before he was bowled by Sikandar Raza. The middle order crumbled and Tanzania appeared to be heading for humiliation when their seventh wicket fell at 40 in the 14th over. However, the later batters showed some spirit, with Ally Kimote at number nine starting the fightback with 16 off 15 balls. Their number 10, Salum Jumbe, did even better, hitting powerfully to score 24 not out off 14 deliveries, with two sixes and a four. Kimote was caught off Ngarava off the penultimate ball of the innings, which closed at 96 for nine. Ngarava took three wickets for 17 and Raza had three for 10, both bowling four overs, while there was a wicket each for Tendai Chatara and Ryan Burl. Zimbabwe opened their batting with Innocent Kaia and Tadiwanashe Marumani, who made 36 together off the first four overs. Kaia was then caught off Sanjay Thakor for 21, scored off 18 balls. Sean Williams then joined Marumani and the pair romped to victory without further loss. Marumani scored 39 not out off 27 balls, winning the match with a six over midwicket, while Williams was unbeaten with 36 off 19. Zimbabwe completed their nine-wicket victory with 9.2 overs to spare. Their next match is against Uganda on Sunday.","pubDate":"2023-11-23 18:58:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"3mob","source_priority":1904716,"country":["zimbabwe"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a439f56db242927a637da7965a8c1aef","title":"'Beckham' is revealed as Britain's favourite sports documentary with 'Senna' and 'Welcome to Wrexham' making up the podium in survey... but 'The Last Dance' is nowhere to be seen in the top 10!","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-12784717/Beckham-revealed-Britains-favourite-sports-documentary-Senna-Welcome-Wrexham-making-podium-survey-Dance-seen-10.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"While football documentaries dominated the top ten, nine different sports were represented in the top 20.

'Beckham' was only released in October but has been a smash hit and pips 'Senna' and 'Welcome to Wrexham' to top spot. In a big shock, 'The Last Dance' - the series about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls that inspired a new wave of basketball fans - has to settle for 14th place. While football documentaries dominated the top ten, nine different sports were represented in the top 20, showing Britain's varied taste. They're now so ingrained in our routine that almost one in five people (19%) say that sports docs take centre stage for a Saturday night binge. 'Beckham' has been named as Britain's most-loved sports documentary in a new poll by Betfair 'The Last Dance', following Michael Jordan's historic time with the Chicago Bulls, only ranked 14th in the list Even out of those people who admit they couldn't care for sport, 60% owned up to the guilty pleasure of feasting their eyes on a fine sporting documentary. Alongside documentaries on football, F1, and basketball, there was room in the top 20 for shows about snooker, tennis, cycling, cricket, golf, and cheerleading. Brits named football and F1 as the two sports they want to see documentaries about the most, but also named athletics - which doesn't have any shows in the top 20 - in third place on their wishlist. As for specific teams they'd love to watch one about, they opted for Manchester United's 1999 Treble-winning side under Sir Alex Ferguson as their most craved. That was ahead of England's 2003 Rugby World Cup-winning team coached by Mail Sport columnist Sir Clive Woodward, and the 1980s West Indies cricket team. 'Welcome to Wrexham' came third behind 'Senna' and the new Beckham documentary The survey was put together by Betfair, who have produced a mini-doc on Irish jockey Rachael Blackmore titled: 'Serial Winners: Rachael Blackmore'. It comes out on November 25. Betfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom said: 'It's clear that we're a nation of sports documentary lovers. They are fast becoming the new 'go-to' for Saturday night viewing, bringing the same levels of drama and intrigue as some of the nation's favourite soaps. 'Even people who aren't into sport are tuning into them, with 60% saying they like to watch them. Give me Beckham over Brookside any day of the week! 'The story of Rachael Blackmore is no different – a tale of the trials, tribulations and perseverance it takes to succeed against the odds. Our Serial Winners mini-documentary will give fans a great insight on this and we can't wait for the yellow carpet premiere at Haydock Racecourse on Saturday.

Playing his first international match at home, Rinku scoring 22* (14) with the help of four fours came across as a breath of fresh air for disheartened Indian fans. Needing seven runs in the last over with five wickets in hand, there wasn’t an iota of doubt around the match going down to the last ball. With India losing three batters within as many deliveries, Rinku was required to score a run off the last ball. Once Australia all-rounder Sean Abbott (1/43) bowled in the left-handed batter’s slot, all Rinku had to do was clear the 11 Australian fielders present inside the 30-yard circle. The 26-year old player, on the contrary, hit the right-arm pacer down the ground for an authoritative six. What A Game! What A Finish! What Drama! 1 run to win on the last ball and it’s a NO BALL that seals #TeamIndia‘s win in the first #INDvAUS T20I! Scorecard https://t.co/T64UnGxiJU @IDFCFIRSTBank pic.twitter.com/J4hvk0bWGN — BCCI (@BCCI) November 23, 2023 That said, an unintentional no-ball on Abbott’s part denied Rinku of a match-winning six. For the unversed, a match gets over as and when the required number of runs are completed. In this case, Abbott’s no-ball handed India the run they were looking for in the first T20I in Visakhapatnam on Friday. India, who chased down a 209-run target, registered their highest successful run-chase in the format. Conditioned to remain calm and composed in such nail-biting circumstances, Rinku spread his arms to announce his arrival at the highest level tonight. In what was his sixth T20I, the Uttar Pradesh batter was facing a top opponent such as Australia for the first time. Known for his finishing skills, Rinku not letting the magnitude of this match affect him has provided a shot in the arm to his stature. Virender Sehwag Was Denied An ODI Century In 2010 13 years before Rinku’s sealed a last-ball chase for the nation, Sehwag was denied of what would’ve been his 13th ODI century at the time. Chasing a 171-run target against Sri Lanka at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, both India and Sehwag needed a run to win and complete a hundred respectively. As one would’ve expected from him back in the day, Sehwag had hit former Sri Lanka spinner Suraj Randiv for a six at will to accomplish both the aforementioned tasks. However, Randiv’s foot-long no-ball became an instant source of controversy.

Lachlan Smith, chair of Birmingham Unicorns CC, one of only three LGBTQ+ cricket clubs in the country, told the PA news agency: “It came completely out of the blue. Nobody saw it coming at all. “Relative to my understanding of how sport is addressing the question of trans participation, cricket and the ICC seem to have gone much further than any other sport. They’ve brought in a policy that feels like a very blunt instrument, and it’s disappointing to see that. “If you’re a young person who identifies as trans and you’re playing cricket, I think it will be very disheartening to see this. “Even if you don’t believe you’re good enough to be international standard, it’s just a very negative message to be receiving at a time when we’re trying to get more LGBTQ people involved in the game. “We’ve had a lot of success in doing that including within the trans community. So we’re disappointed.” Cricket Australia said on Thursday that its policy on trans participation remains unchanged and that players who have transitioned are still eligible to compete at elite level domestically. That also remains the ECB’s stance, though consultations have taken place over the last year with stakeholders from across the game which could lead to an updating of the governing body’s position.

The talks with our members were quite constructive. “That (outcome) is still to be seen, but I’m hopeful that it will be nuanced and will consider as many variables as possible, unlike the ICC. “Other sports have been a bit more nuanced in considering things like testosterone levels, but these all feels very blunt. It would be interesting to know what research has been drawn on, particularly when there are such a small number of trans cricketers out there.

On winning the toss, Zimbabwe – who suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the hosts Namibia in their opening match at this tournament on Wednesday – put Tanzania in to bat first and their bowlers were soon among the wickets. Richard Ngarava started it off with two quick scalps, but the captain, Abhik Patwa, showed some determined resistance as he scored 18 runs off 33 balls before he was bowled by Sikandar Raza. The middle order crumbled and Tanzania appeared to be heading for humiliation when their seventh wicket fell at 40 in the 14th over. However, the later batters showed some spirit, with Ally Kimote at number nine starting the fightback with 16 off 15 balls. Their number 10, Salum Jumbe, did even better, hitting powerfully to score 24 not out off 14 deliveries, with two sixes and a four. Kimote was caught off Ngarava off the penultimate ball of the innings, which closed at 96 for nine. Ngarava took three wickets for 17 and Raza had three for 10, both bowling four overs, while there was a wicket each for Tendai Chatara and Ryan Burl. Zimbabwe opened their batting with Innocent Kaia and Tadiwanashe Marumani, who made 36 together off the first four overs. Kaia was then caught off Sanjay Thakor for 21, scored off 18 balls. Sean Williams then joined Marumani and the pair romped to victory without further loss. Marumani scored 39 not out off 27 balls, winning the match with a six over midwicket, while Williams was unbeaten with 36 off 19. Zimbabwe completed their nine-wicket victory with 9.2 overs to spare.

'Beckham' was only released in October but has been a smash hit and pips 'Senna' and 'Welcome to Wrexham' to top spot. In a big shock, 'The Last Dance' - the series about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls that inspired a new wave of basketball fans - has to settle for 14th place. While football documentaries dominated the top ten, nine different sports were represented in the top 20, showing Britain's varied taste. They're now so ingrained in our routine that almost one in five people (19%) say that sports docs take centre stage for a Saturday night binge. 'Beckham' has been named as Britain's most-loved sports documentary in a new poll by Betfair 'The Last Dance', following Michael Jordan's historic time with the Chicago Bulls, only ranked 14th in the list Even out of those people who admit they couldn't care for sport, 60% owned up to the guilty pleasure of feasting their eyes on a fine sporting documentary. Alongside documentaries on football, F1, and basketball, there was room in the top 20 for shows about snooker, tennis, cycling, cricket, golf, and cheerleading. Brits named football and F1 as the two sports they want to see documentaries about the most, but also named athletics - which doesn't have any shows in the top 20 - in third place on their wishlist. As for specific teams they'd love to watch one about, they opted for Manchester United's 1999 Treble-winning side under Sir Alex Ferguson as their most craved. That was ahead of England's 2003 Rugby World Cup-winning team coached by Mail Sport columnist Sir Clive Woodward, and the 1980s West Indies cricket team. 'Welcome to Wrexham' came third behind 'Senna' and the new Beckham documentary The survey was put together by Betfair, who have produced a mini-doc on Irish jockey Rachael Blackmore titled: 'Serial Winners: Rachael Blackmore'. It comes out on November 25. Betfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom said: 'It's clear that we're a nation of sports documentary lovers. They are fast becoming the new 'go-to' for Saturday night viewing, bringing the same levels of drama and intrigue as some of the nation's favourite soaps. 'Even people who aren't into sport are tuning into them, with 60% saying they like to watch them. Give me Beckham over Brookside any day of the week! 'The story of Rachael Blackmore is no different – a tale of the trials, tribulations and perseverance it takes to succeed against the odds. Our Serial Winners mini-documentary will give fans a great insight on this and we can't wait for the yellow carpet premiere at Haydock Racecourse on Saturday.

Playing his first international match at home, Rinku scoring 22* (14) with the help of four fours came across as a breath of fresh air for disheartened Indian fans. Needing seven runs in the last over with five wickets in hand, there wasn’t an iota of doubt around the match going down to the last ball. With India losing three batters within as many deliveries, Rinku was required to score a run off the last ball. Once Australia all-rounder Sean Abbott (1/43) bowled in the left-handed batter’s slot, all Rinku had to do was clear the 11 Australian fielders present inside the 30-yard circle. The 26-year old player, on the contrary, hit the right-arm pacer down the ground for an authoritative six. What A Game! What A Finish! What Drama! 1 run to win on the last ball and it’s a NO BALL that seals #TeamIndia‘s win in the first #INDvAUS T20I! Scorecard https://t.co/T64UnGxiJU @IDFCFIRSTBank pic.twitter.com/J4hvk0bWGN — BCCI (@BCCI) November 23, 2023 That said, an unintentional no-ball on Abbott’s part denied Rinku of a match-winning six. For the unversed, a match gets over as and when the required number of runs are completed. In this case, Abbott’s no-ball handed India the run they were looking for in the first T20I in Visakhapatnam on Friday. India, who chased down a 209-run target, registered their highest successful run-chase in the format. Conditioned to remain calm and composed in such nail-biting circumstances, Rinku spread his arms to announce his arrival at the highest level tonight. In what was his sixth T20I, the Uttar Pradesh batter was facing a top opponent such as Australia for the first time. Known for his finishing skills, Rinku not letting the magnitude of this match affect him has provided a shot in the arm to his stature. Virender Sehwag Was Denied An ODI Century In 2010 13 years before Rinku’s sealed a last-ball chase for the nation, Sehwag was denied of what would’ve been his 13th ODI century at the time. Chasing a 171-run target against Sri Lanka at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, both India and Sehwag needed a run to win and complete a hundred respectively. As one would’ve expected from him back in the day, Sehwag had hit former Sri Lanka spinner Suraj Randiv for a six at will to accomplish both the aforementioned tasks. However, Randiv’s foot-long no-ball became an instant source of controversy.

Yet there are fears over the message that the ICC’s ruling will sent to young players starting out in the game and those competing at amateur level. Lachlan Smith, chair of Birmingham Unicorns CC, one of only three LGBTQ+ cricket clubs in the country, told the PA news agency: “It came completely out of the blue. Nobody saw it coming at all. “Relative to my understanding of how sport is addressing the question of trans participation, cricket and the ICC seem to have gone much further than any other sport. They’ve brought in a policy that feels like a very blunt instrument, and it’s disappointing to see that. “If you’re a young person who identifies as trans and you’re playing cricket, I think it will be very disheartening to see this. “Even if you don’t believe you’re good enough to be international standard, it’s just a very negative message to be receiving at a time when we’re trying to get more LGBTQ people involved in the game. “We’ve had a lot of success in doing that including within the trans community. So we’re disappointed.” Cricket Australia said on Thursday that its policy on trans participation remains unchanged and that players who have transitioned are still eligible to compete at elite level domestically. That also remains the ECB’s stance, though consultations have taken place over the last year with stakeholders from across the game which could lead to an updating of the governing body’s position. Last year, Rugby Union and Rugby League both took the decision to ban trans players from competing in the female-only from of the game, whilst swimming and cycling have taken similar steps. Smith said that members of his club have been consulted by the ECB and that they had been satisfied with the process so far, but call for more transparency from the ICC on how its decision has been reached. “The ECB are currently undertaking review of their trans participation policies,” said Smith. “They’ve worked with us and other LGBTQ stakeholders in the game on a consultation process. The talks with our members were quite constructive. “That (outcome) is still to be seen, but I’m hopeful that it will be nuanced and will consider as many variables as possible, unlike the ICC. “Other sports have been a bit more nuanced in considering things like testosterone levels, but these all feels very blunt. It would be interesting to know what research has been drawn on, particularly when there are such a small number of trans cricketers out there. The ICC haven’t been very forthcoming yet on that. “Cricket is a unique sport. You may have a first XI that has a 14-year-old and a 70-year-old. You have such a breadth of ages and skill levels and things like that.
