They are not going by theory that this could happen only if this happens. Look at the difference in their cricket and the difference in their results. India needs to make sure that they don’t fall into the trap of theories. They have got to look at the practicality of the situation at hand and take decisions accordingly,” mentioned Gavaskar.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar had an awful day with the ball in the first T20I of the three-match T20I series against Aaron Finch’s Australia National Cricket Team at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium, Mohali, Chandigarh on Tuesday, September 20, where India lost by 4 wickets.

Hayden lauded Green and said that he has been a big asset for Australia for a couple of years now. “Greene, he has been a really big asset for Australian Cricket for a couple of years now. He’s a genuine all-rounder. I just think he’s such a huge part of the future of Australian cricket. So it doesn’t really surprise me, he’s very capable, he’s a big man with good skills. He looked a little bit disappointing with the ball, but it’s a tough place to bowl.” Cameron Green.

Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli failed to make any major contributions with the bat. | ICC Teams Rankings | ICC Players Rankings However, KL Rahul (55), Suryakumar Yadav (46) and Hardik Pandya (71) played absolutely sensational innings to help the Men In Blue score 208 runs. While defending the target, Indian bowlers performed poorly and India lost the match by 4 wickets. Image: Twitter During the Australian innings, veteran wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik showed no interest in reviewing a close LBW call against young all-rounder Cameron Green, who smashed 61 runs off 30 balls, including 8 fours and 4 sixes. Notably, the young all-rounder wouldn’t have smashed a half-century if India would have taken a DRS early on in the innings. Ravi Shastri Mentions Dhoni After Karthik Doesn’t Appeal For An LBW Ravi Shastri (Image Credits: Twitter) In the 5th over of the second innings, which was bowled by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, the leg-spinner darted the ball on leg-stump and Green tried to smash it on the leg side. However, he failed to make any connection with the ball and it crashed into the pads. The bowler, the wicket-keeper and the entire India team didn’t appeal for an LBW. In the very next over, the big screen highlighted India’s missed opportunity as the ball-tracking showed that the ball would have crashed into the leg-stump. On-air commentators Murali Kartik, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri talked about this and Shastri even mentioned Dhoni’s name and stated that the legendary wicket-keeper was outstanding when it came to taking DRS calls. Below is how the conversation between the three panned out, as quoted by Hindustan Times: Gavaskar: It was a straight delivery, and he went for the sweep. But India did not review. The ball was hitting the stumps. Shastri: Hitting? It was nice and clean. Surprising because he had gone across. Just wondering if he thought it was the height or the ball had struck outside the line. Kartik: I wish we could pan to the cameras. Dinesh Karthik the wicketkeeper, Chahal and Rohit Sharma… as soon as they saw the giant screen, all of them were having a look at one another. I wish we could have panned immediately. Shastri: Such an important role, the keepers. This is where MS was so good.

Even in Indian politics, out of the 543 members of the Lok Sabha (upper house of the Indian parliament), 475 of them (or 88%), are declared ‘crorepatis’ (as per their affidavit), and despite this fact, a renowned MP from the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, who was spotted donning a ‘Burberry T-shirt’ worth INR 41,000 recently, was hilariously criticized by the ruling BJP despite Mr. Gandhi possessing enough generational wealth alone to afford many such T-shirts. Thus, for a common man to expect the super rich to lead a rather modest public life, would only expose the former’s two-facedness, despite knowing that they are capable of leading a luxurious life. As for Pandya in our case, the hard-hitting allrounder just does not seem to care for the aforementioned common public perception, and be it his , or even a private jet, he does from time to time flaunt his several materialistic possessions via his social media handles. As per several reports in the beginning of this year, Hardik Pandya’s net worth accumulates to the tune of INR 67 Crores, thanks to his social media engagements, income as a cricketer, investments, and around a dozen brand endorsements. Just the last month, and a few days before the commencement of Asia Cup 2022, Pandya took to his Instagram handle to post a video of ‘a day in his life’, where he is seen arriving his home by travelling in his private jet, while wearing a black vest, a silver chain, a golden watch, flaunting his shades etc. before beginning with his training out in the field. The 28-year-old is presently with the Indian team, playing a three-match home T20I series against Australia.","pubDate":"2022-09-21 19:42:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Oval, Lord's to host two ICC World Test C'ship finals","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/oval-lords-to-host-two-icc-world-test-cship-finals-762640","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Hans India"],"video_url":null,"description":"The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday confirmed that The Oval in London will play hosts to the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final in 2023, with the 2025 edition of the finale to take place at Lords.","content":"Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday confirmed that The Oval in London will play hosts to the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final in 2023, with the 2025 edition of the finale to take place at Lords.

Three years felt like forever. It felt like a debut again. It feels like a dream come true to come back and contribute with a half-century in a winning team,” said Hales. Hales returned after 3.5 years to the England setup after being discarded from the scheme of things for testing positive for recreational drugs. On his return to the team, Hales hit 53 off 40 deliveries to anchor the innings and help his side chase 159 with four balls to spare.

Hales struggled to get going in the first six overs of the batting powerplay but blossomed after getting dropped twice in his 20s as he reached his half-century off 39 balls with a flick against fast bowler Haris Rauf to the fine leg boundary. Hales and Harry Brook dominated the Pakistan fast bowlers at the back end of the run chase with some fluent boundaries. “The deeper you take it, the more fluent the innings becomes,” he said. “I got a couple of boundaries away towards the end and killed the game with Harry.” During his exile from international cricket, Hales featured prominently in domestic T20 leagues around the world that included stints in the Pakistan Super League. The stadium on Tuesday was nearly packed to its capacity of 34,000 to witness England's first match in Pakistan in 17 years. “I've been lucky to have played in front of full houses here before and it's just outstanding,” Hales said. “It's one of the best places to play cricket in the world and the fans really put on a show.” The second T20 is on Thursday at the same ground.","pubDate":"2022-09-21 18:35:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"HISTORIC | England, Australia to play first 5-day women's Test match","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/england-australia-to-play-first-5-day-women-s-test-match-2022-09-21-810375","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In what can only be touted as a historic moment in the history of women's cricket, England women and Australia women will face off in a first-ever five-day women's Test match next year in the Ashes.","content":"In what can only be touted as a historic moment in the history of women's cricket, England women and Australia women will face off in a first-ever five-day women's Test match next year in . The calls for women's Test cricket to be turned into a five-day affair have long been gaining steam and now it's finally a reality. Women's test matches have traditionally been played over four days as opposed to five in the men's game. Only six women's tests have taken place worldwide since 2017, all of them finishing in draws after time ran out. The decision by the England and Wales Cricket Board and Cricket Australia to break the longstanding convention comes three months after International Cricket Council chairman Greg Barclay said he wanted women to play five-day tests, while at the same time raising doubts about the long-term future of the format in women's cricket. “I'm so happy,” England captain Heather Knight said. “I feel like I've been banging the drum for five days for a long time, so it's a special moment. It feels like the right time, for five days, for bigger grounds, and it feels like it's been a long time coming. “I probably spent most of my career being grateful for what you're given. When I started anything was a bonus, you were just happy to be playing the sport you love for England and not even getting paid, but my eyes have opened a bit more. You see the inequalities you've gone through and not really realised.

The in Nagpur, will host the second match of the series on September 23, as Rohit Sharma’s men will not only look to avoid a series defeat, but most importantly iron out quite a few wrinkles ahead of the imminent T20 World Cup in Australia. ‘There would be nothing more welcoming news as that of a possible return back of their ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah, who last played a T20I more than two-and-a-half months ago. As for the Aussies, akin India, it is their bowling department, which needs to be addressed ahead of the mega event. The online tickets for India vs Australia match, to be played at VCA Stadium Jamtha on Sep 23, were sold within minutes on Sunday. This had caused a major displeasure among cricket fans in Nagpur and nearby district. — Viraj Deshpande (@VirajDeshLokmat) The Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium will host a T20I after almost a three-year gap, with the last one taking place in November 2019 between India and Bangladesh, which the former had won by 30 runs. The average score across the 12 T20Is at this venue from 2009-2019 is 145 runs. Overall, across a total of 56 T20 matches here, the average score goes a touch lower, to 144.2 runs. Also, with scores in excess of the 180-run mark breached only thrice across the 12 T20Is here so far, the pitch has over the years, assisted the bowlers in general, and spinners in particular. With dew likely to settle down later in the night, expect the captain winning the Toss to bowl first. Having said that, teams batting first have won nine of the twelve encounters here after batting first. The conditions on the match night is likely to be overcast, with a thunderstorm expected during the day as well.","pubDate":"2022-09-21 16:59:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India Women vs England Women, 2nd ODI Live Score: Danni Wyatt Hits Fifty, England Four Down In Chase.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvaW5kaWEtd29tZW4tdnMtZW5nbGFuZC13b21lbi0ybmQtb2RpLWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtdXBkYXRlcy0zMzY0NDg10gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS13b21lbi12cy1lbmdsYW5kLXdvbWVuLTJuZC1vZGktbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLTMzNjQ0ODUvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India Women vs England Women, 2nd ODI Live Score: Danni Wyatt Hits Fifty, England Four Down In Chase..  NDTV SportsEngland vs India: Follow live updates as hosts attempt to level ODI series  Sky SportsIndia Women vs England Women Live Streaming Details- When And Where To Watch IND W vs ENG W Live In Your Country?

Dunkley, in an exclusive chat with NDTV, said the kind of cricket on display in women's Tests recently shows how far the game has come and also batted for women's Tests to be increased to five days instead of four. \"I think I would love to see more women's Tests because the ones I've played in, they've all been really exciting. They've not all had results but I think there have been really great bits of cricket in there, some really fun sessions,\" Dunkley told NDTV. \"To be fair, a lot of them have been affected by rain so potentially you might have had a result,\" she added. \"But I think it just shows how far the women's game has come and that we can put on a show and entertain. So yeah it would be great to see some more Test matches in the future,\" said the 24-year-old. \"I think five days just gives a better chance for a result. When you've got things like rain and stuff that you can't control, it's quite frustrating to play really hard for four days and not get that result,\" Dunkley said. \"So yeah I think five days would be amazing to the game and I'm sure it would create some exciting Test matches.\" Dunkley played a big role in England's recent 2-1 win over India in the T20I series. She scored an unbeaten 61 in the first match and then 49 in the series decider. \"We spoke about few of the different plans the Indian bowlers might have. Deepti Sharma is a very clever bowler, bowls well in the Powerplay. And Renuka bowled very well as well. So yeah, every game we learned a little bit more and put up some good plans into place,\" she said about how England countered India's bowlers. \"Obviously, India are very skilled with their spin attack vas well, and how we combat that, I think we did that quite well. Pretty happy how we went about it.\" The series saw the chasing side win all three matches, but Dunkley felt that in the end, it was the better team on the day that won all three matches. \"I think sometimes in England, batting second, when the dew comes on it skids on a little bit nicer so it can be nicer to chase. But I think in all three games the dominant side probably got the win,\" she said. \"In the second game, we didn't play our best and India took advantage of that and came out and played really well. But I think against a team like India, you got to be on it from ball 1. So yeah we did pretty well to come back last game and I just think the best side on the day won really,\" she asserted. And what of the BCCI's proposed women's IPL, which may start as soon as next year? \"Very excited. It would be a great, great opportunity for the women's game and give it a great platform,\" Dunkley said. Promoted \"If you obviously see the men's IPL and how successful that has been and how much followed it is around the world, so I think to have that for the women would be amazing and a very exciting time.\" Dunkley is currently in action for England in the three-match ODI series against India, which is being broadcast by the Sony Sports Network in India.","pubDate":"2022-09-21 16:05:08","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-07/i2dve42o_sophia-dunkley-instagram_625x300_01_July_21.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ECB Ashes tickets: How to book Oval Ashes tickets 2023?

During the second ODI of India Women’s tour of England 2022 in Canterbury, India captain Harmanpreet Kaur has scored her sixth century in international cricket. In what is the right-handed batter’s fifth ODI century, it is her fourth at No. 4, second against England, in England, as captain and in 2022. Coming in to bat at No. 4 in the 12th over, Kaur bettered her form from the first WODI in Hove to convert a half-century into a century to power her team to 333/5 in 50 overs after being asked to bat first by England captain Amy Jones. It was on the 18th delivery that Kaur faced that she hit her first boundary by pulling England pacer Freya Kemp through the square leg region. Having just found her feat, Kaur was immediately required to build a partnership as her deputy Smriti Mandhana (40) missed a sweep off spinner Sophie Ecclestone to be found wanting in front of the stumps. What followed was a 125-ball 113-run fourth-wicket partnership between Kaur and Harleen Deol (58). Kaur, who played the role of a quintessential senior batter in the stand, had crossed the 50-run mark by the time Deol was dismissed at the brink of the third powerplay. Having also dominated a 36-ball 50-run fifth-wicket partnership alongside all-rounder Pooja Vastrakar (18), Kaur had provided signs of reaching the three-figure mark at the St Lawrence Ground today. Kaur, who hit six boundaries in this partnership, managed to bring up a 100-ball century by running a single off Ecclestone in the 47th over. The 33-year old player ended up scoring 143* (111) with the help of 18 fours and four sixes to register a fantastic knock.
