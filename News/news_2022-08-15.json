It‚Äôs the same surface, the conditions are pretty much the same, we want to make the first use of it. We want to keep improving and adjusting,‚Äù remarked Williamson post winning the Toss. The West Indies, on the other hand, have made as many as four changes to their squad, with the hard-hitting all-rounder Rovman Powell appointed as the stand-in West Indian captain for the match. Despite having lost two consecutive T20I series against India and now New Zealand, the West Indian management has decided to rest Pooran for the ongoing third T20I, perhaps keeping in view his workload management, having constantly played continuously off-late. Pacer Obed McCoy, opener batter Kyle Mayers, and all-rounder Jason Holden have also made way for Alzarri Joseph, Brandon King, and Dominic Drakes respectively. New Zealand, on the other hand, have made a solitary change by including Lockie Ferguson in place of their seasoned left-arm pacer Trent Boult, who has been rested as well for the dead rubber today. It is worth of a mention that Boult has been rested today despite having played only two T20Is this year, both of them during the ongoing series.

The excitement amongst the Indian and Pakistani Cricket fans is unsurprisingly apparent as the two Asian arch-rivals are bound to face each other during the Asia Cup 2022, set to commence from August 27. A slight tweak in the scheduling of matches, which has made way for a maximum of three clashes between the two teams (provided they reach the final), has added yet another exotic flavour to the lip-smacking contest. With the tournament‚Äôs commencement just a couple of weeks shy, the build-up continues to be hyped-up. While India continue to boast of their successful record against Pakistan in ICC tournaments, Pakistan‚Äôs 10-wicket victory versus India during the 2021 T20 World Cup last year, was a bitter pill to swallow for them as well. With former cricketers from both the countries revisiting some of the memorable moments of an India-Pakistan clash, former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh managed to recollect an interesting anecdote involving former India skipper MS Dhoni and team Pakistan during the 2011 World Cup semi-final. While Cricket fans across the globe are no strangers to the calculated risks and tactical brilliance put on show by MS Dhoni while on the field as the skipper, Harbhajan recollected a crucial decision taken by his skipper during the high-octance clash versus Pakistan during the 2011 World Cup semi-final. As per the former off-spinner, who was having an ordinary day with the ball after bowling half of his Overs of the quota, Dhoni‚Äôs decision to ask him to bowl from around the wicket helped him and the team get rid of the dangerous looking Umar Akmal, who was stitching a crucial partnership alongside Misbah-ul-Haq en route the chase of 261 runs. The ball to Umar Akmal in the #CWC11 Semi Final will always be @harbhajan_singh ‚Äòs most memorable & best delivery for me. Don‚Äôt know how he got him out there. Brilliant, brilliant delivery! ‚Äî Gurkirat Singh Gill (@gurkiratsgill) March 30, 2020 ‚ÄúIt was one of those games where I felt I was getting a bit numb. I had bowled five overs, conceded around 26-27 runs. It was a water break, and Dhoni told me, ‚ÄòBhajju pa, aap vahan se daaloge‚Äô (around the wicket). Kamran (Umar) was playing good, so was Misbah. And they were scoring runs and the partnership was getting dangerous,‚Äù said Harbhajan as he recalled the moment on Star Sports‚Äô Dil se India show ahead of India‚Äôs 75th Independence day. India eventually won the match by 29 runs, and progressed through to the grand finale clash versus Sri Lanka.","pubDate":"2022-08-14 16:37:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Royal London One Day Cup: Cheteshwar Pujara smashes 174 of 131 balls, registers twin centuries","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/royal-london-one-day-cup-cheteshwar-pujara-smashes-174-of-131-balls-registers-twin-centuries-11057601.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Royal London One Day Cup: Cheteshwar Pujara smashes 174 of 131 balls, registers twin centuries","content":"Cheteshwar Pujara leading the English county Sussex in the Royal London One Day Cup, smashed another century, bettering the one in the previous match, with an astonishing 174 runs of just 131 deliveries in the Group A match against Surrey on Sunday.Pujara, considered to be a Test match specialist, tore the bowlers apart and scored at a strike rate of 132.82 after Sussex had lost two quick wickets for just nine runs inside four overs.Pujara punished the Surrey bowlers as he hit 20 4s and five 6s in his innings, sending the ball to all parts of the Hove cricket ground.P H E N O M E N A L1‚É£5‚É£0‚É£ @cheteshwar1 pic.twitter.com/5wAq1t346T‚Äî Sussex Cricket (@SussexCCC) August 14, 2022The right-hander also surpassed his List A highest score of 158 with this innings of 174.With such a swashbuckling inning of Pujara, Sussex managed to reach 378 in 50 overs for the loss of just six wickets.

Many expected for his glittering run to continue in India's T20I series against South Africa in June. But a hand injury kept him out of the series as well as from the trips to Ireland and England as well as the ODIs against the West Indies. He finally got a chance in the fifth T20I against the West Indies at Lauderhill, taking three scalps in a superb bowling show where spinners took all 10 wickets. Former India left-arm spinner Maninder Singh believes Kuldeep's recent great showings have been a huge positive and if the left-arm wrist-spinner continues to put in consistent performances, he can be in India's squad for the ODI World Cup next year in the country. \" Kuldeep Yadav 's performance had started to go down. But the way he made a comeback while playing for Delhi Capitals this year, it was showing that he had worked hard. Seeing a player's expressions when on the field and body language is enough to say that the player had worked hard when coming back to playing cricket. The great performance he had for Delhi Capitals and the confidence he got from there was there to see on the field in the (recent) international cricket match (fifth T20I against West Indies).\" \"I still think he needs to perform consistently and if he does that constantly on the field, then he can be in the ODI World Cup which will happen in India in 2023. He brings a different variety as he's a left-arm chinaman (wrist-spin) and has the knack of picking wickets when he started out in international cricket, which is very important in the middle overs to stem the run-rate of the opposition,\" said Maninder in an exclusive interaction with IANS organized by Sony Sports Network. Maninder further called Kuldeep's recent performances as a huge positive, especially when he had gone out of favour due to a mix of lean form and knee injury sustained while being with Kolkata Knight Riders during the second half of IPL 2021.

The touring side's top four batters delivered to put up a strong total of 189/5, and Ireland were quickly reduced to 36/4 in their run chase. The hosts looked down and out at 85/7 in the 13th over, but Dockrell (58 not out off 37 balls) and debutant Fionn Hand (36 off 18) kept Ireland's hopes alive with an eighth-wicket partnership worth 74 ‚Äî just six runs short of a world-record eighth wicket stand in T20I cricket, according to Cricket Ireland. In the end, though, Afghanistan held on to celebrate their first win of the series to make it 1-2 after three games. Afghanistan were quick to put aside a difficult performance with the bat in the second T20I ‚Äî 11 runs from Mark Adair's opening over set the base for a 90-run opening partnership between Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Hazratullah Zazai.

However, Chahal has made an excellent comeback since then and the selectors might not want to take such a weird decision this time around.Chopra, while speaking on his YouTube channel said, ‚ÄúLet's start with Yuzi Chahal. His name should have one-hundred percent been there in the last World Cup as well. It was not there, you were surprised, I was also surprised. It was shocking for me.\"Chahal has picked up 15 wickets in 12 T20Is in 2022 at an average of 18.13. Chopra said that Chahal has been very consistent after his comeback. He has been wicket-less only in one match in 2022.‚ÄúAs soon as we lost the World Cup, we said that it is necessary to play Yuzi Chahal. He has picked up 16 wickets in the 13 matches he has played since then in T20 internationals, at an average of 18 and an economy of 7.1, which means he has been very very good.\"Yuzi is a wicket-taker, no doubt. These were international numbers. IPL numbers, the Purple Cap numbers - 27 wickets in 17 matches at an average of 19, an economy of 7.7, and a strike rate of 15. He picked up a five-wicket haul and a hat-trick as well,\" Chopra added.Chahal has been well-known for his wicket-taking abilities in the middle overs.Considering his recent performances, Chopra believes that Chahal will not miss the marquee event this year in Australia.\"He is the No. 1 genuine wicket-taker that you have. In my opinion, when you play a spinner, he can have two roles - one is economical if your fast bowlers are wicket-takers else you want your spinners to control the middle overs and pick up wickets.

Batting first, Mysore Warriors lost skipper Karun Nair for 1, but that hardly set them back as Nihal Ullal and Pavan Deshpande got their act going. A 59-run stand between them gave the Warriors some breathing space before Nihal was gone for 23. Deshpande completed 50 with a six over midwicket in the 12th over. Later, Deshpande was caught ball-watching, and was run out for 55, having hit 7 fours and 2 sixes in his 36-ball knock.

All four broadcasters have the same reasons for writing to the ICC - absolute lack of clarity on the process - and have indicated (not verbatim) that they may not turn up at the bidding table. Ugliness, along with some potential for future litigation and quite a bit of antagonism enveloped the air this week after the ICC sent out a huge list of clarifications to the broadcasters, answering their questions in detail, but not making any major changes to the tender process. \"All four broadcasters have written to the ICC. We've been reading media reports on how Amazon wants to be in the fray too, which is fine. But there's no clue if Amazon is 'happy' with this process. If they are, even I'd love to know the whys and hows of what they're seeing here that we're missing. As far as we are concerned, it's clear - the current process doesn't encourage us to submit a bid,\" a leading broadcaster told TOI . The tender process requires the broadcasters to submit a closed bid to bag rights for ICC's global events for the India markets. The ICC has invited bids for four as well as eight years, without explaining the metrics behind it or without determining how it will evaluate the bids. \"They've asked us to participate in a mock-auction this week (between 16th & 17th). We're yet to confirm the same, don't know about the others. What I can tell you is, we'll be watching this till the final hour,\" another broadcaster said. BCCI secretary Jay Shah , also the India representative at the ICC's all-important Chief Executives Committee ( CEC ), has categorically requested the parent body to consider the e-auction process, simply for the reason that it guarantees transparency in the process. \"BCCI's decision to conduct the same of IPL rights through e-auction not just helped them with great price-discovery but also, and more importantly, ensured that all the bidders enjoyed a level-playing field. ICC's refusal to take this into consideration raises a lot of questions on the process. Even if they didn't want to consider an e-auction, what we can't understand is, why should the closed bids not be opened on the day of submissions, in front of all the bidders? \"Also, what are the metrics behind these four, and eight-year bids? There must be method being applied, right? I personally don't agree with them asking for an eight-year number, but even if some others find logic on it, on what basis will these rights be awarded?\" says another leading broadcaster. The bids have to be submitted in two parts: A) Technical; B) Financial. \"Now, once the technical bids have been submitted, shouldn't the financial bid be awarded to the party that presents the highest number? Technically, if everyone's qualified then it's only about the per-match number, right? And there again, there's an issue. What's the guarantee whose number is the highest if the bids are not being opened in front of everyone?\" the broadcasters say. Meanwhile, the ugliness in the air has a lot to do with silent murmurs doing the rounds about how the entire process - highly convoluted, as most see it - favours one potential bidder more than the rest, because of the eight-year option. \"Nobody will talk about it and it's understandable. But there are these underlying fears,\" industry executives say. And to add to all this, the ICC has said that should it remain \"unsatisfied\" with the 'closed bids' that come in, it will call for an e-auction after 48 hours, without mentioning what will determine the terms of 'satisfaction'. \"Let's see what they have to say about the letters that have been written,\" broadcasters say. As far as the ICC itself is concerned, the governing body - to be fair - met up with all potential broadcasters on multiple occasions in the run-up to the tender process and explained how it would be going about with the process, apropos of the changes that were being requested. \"Well, we can't do much if certain individuals or companies are still 'unconvinced'. There are a set of processes that we have identified, and we feel it's the best possible recourse for us, in terms of deriving optimum value.

Though Thompson does not officially start a five-year term until 1 September, there is plenty waiting for the 55-year-old in his in-tray. What are the most pressing items? Appoint a new chief executive and review the ECB Thompson fills only part of the leadership vacuum at the ECB, with a permanent chief executive still required after Tom Harrison signed off in May and Clare Connor took the reins temporarily. It is inevitable Richard Gould, Thompson‚Äôs chief executive at Surrey, will be linked given the success the pair had in turning the county into a financial powerhouse with a growing membership. Whether Gould can be tempted back into cricket after moving to Bristol City last year is another matter. Johnny Grave, in charge at Cricket West Indies, and Wasim Khan, now at the International Cricket Council , would be strong candidates, while Tim Bostock, the chief executive of Durham, is highly regarded. Others will emerge when Thompson begins a process that is top of his to-do list. Though the ECB is financially strong, there is an expectation its structures will be reviewed, both culturally and with regards to its current, some would say bloated, size. The ECB employs 458 people with an annual payroll of ¬£54m, which exceeds the ¬£38m passed down to the recreational game upon which the sport, ultimately, is built. Richard Thompson speaks during Surrey‚Äôs AGM in April. Photograph: Ben Hoskins/Getty Images for Surrey CCC The makeup of the ECB board from which Thompson stood down in 2018 will probably also be assessed in light of last year‚Äôs aborted tour of Pakistan , the (mis)handling of the Yorkshire affair and concerns over a lack of cricket experience. A voice for the domestic game is set to return, at least, with two first-class chairs to attend board meetings in a non-voting capacity from next month. The ICEC report and EDI Perhaps the biggest iceberg on the horizon comes when the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket publishes its report on discrimination this autumn. In response to the fallout from Azeem Rafiq‚Äôs allegations of racism at Yorkshire, the English game has already set in motion a 12-point plan to tackle racism and promote inclusion and diversity, with a focus on education, dressing room culture, talent pathways and governance. However, the ICEC is reviewing more than 4,000 submissions of evidence from all levels of the pyramid and though conclusions are yet to be formed, a damning verdict is expected after Cindy Butts, its chair, said the sport is ‚Äúfacing a reckoning‚Äù . Thompson‚Äôs successes at Surrey include stewardship of the African-Caribbean engagement programme and he has stated he will work tirelessly to make cricket ‚Äúthe most inclusive sport in the country‚Äù. The ECB‚Äôs response to the ICEC report will be among the first stress tests of this pledge, as well as the disciplinary proceedings that resulted from the Yorkshire situation and are likely to come to a head around the same time.

The Hundred Thompson voted against the Hundred as Surrey chair but will now lead a governing body that has locked in the tournament‚Äôs future until 2028, with an extension to the Sky deal. Only the terrestrial rights from 2025 onwards are outstanding. As such, he will need to make the Hundred work and find a way to heal the obvious division it has sown. Even as a champion of the counties, his stated desire for ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù and ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù will be challenged significantly. There are positives. The women‚Äôs game has been handed a fitting stage ‚Äì notwithstanding the wage gap ‚Äì and there has been some early evidence to suggest a new (or at least previously lapsed) audience has been energised by the heavy lick of marketing paint and terrestrial coverage. Trent Rockets‚Äô Alana King celebrates her hat-trick in the Hundred against Manchester Originals. The increased spotlight for the women‚Äôs game is one of the positives of the tournament, but there are divisions that need to be healed. Photograph: Jan Kruger/ECB/Getty Images But anger remains, with English cricket having twisted itself into a pretzel for a tournament that was supposed to promote the entire sport. The previously thriving T20 Blast has been squeezed, the Royal London Cup devalued and the County Championship still a predominantly spring/autumn endeavour; any new converts via the Hundred find themselves walking into a bitter, unresolved argument. Greater alignment of the short-form competitions appears essential, such as more player deals in the Hundred being contingent on performances in the Blast. Thompson will also need to address concerns about the financial imbalance of staging revenues for host counties, worth up to ¬£800,000 a year. Then there is the question of whether the ECB will resist or embrace investment into the Hundred from outside as the Indian Premier League team owners build empires. It is a weighty decision given there will be no way of putting the toothpaste back in the tube once private money enters the equation. The high performance review While the Hundred‚Äôs continuation appears assured, there is further fear and loathing in the shires about the high performance review chaired by Andrew Strauss and, chiefly, talk of a cut to the County Championship. Could counties have their current 14 red-ball fixtures (down from 16 in 2016) become 12 or even just 10? Nothing has been decided and the review will only provide recommendations for the future domestic structure; any changes would still have to be approved by 12 of the 18 first-class chairs in September. Nevertheless, it is unlikely to conclude the status quo is working for all and Strauss has gone on record to state that the recent uptick from England‚Äôs men in Test cricket has not remotely diminished the need for reform. Thompson, who has sat on the review, said in the past: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt allow red-ball cricket to become diminished any further.‚Äù Whatever the next configuration, he is expected to increase centralised promotion of the county competitions to ensure the Hundred isn‚Äôt the only shop window. The global game Thompson‚Äôs tenure comes at a time of existential angst for the sport worldwide. The rise of domestic T20 leagues (including the expansion of the Indian Premier League) and annual global events are shrinking opportunities for bilateral international cricket. Like the extension to Sky‚Äôs coverage of English cricket, the future tours programme for the 2023-27 period has been agreed before Thompson‚Äôs start date, however, and means the two spheres are vying for players and space. What shape the sport emerges in at the end of this period is the big question. The recent decision by Ben Stokes to retire from ODI cricket, Trent Boult stepping away from his New Zealand contract and South Africa cancelling an ODI series in Australia to stage their new T20 league in January have all highlighted the tension.

Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images The ICC seldom leads on such matters but as the representative of the ECB, one of the more powerful member boards, Thompson is among those charged with forging a balanced, more equitable landscape that prevents cricket from cannibalising itself and protects the primary of Test cricket. Thompson may also wish to assess England‚Äôs central contracts system for the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams to ensure they adequately reflect this.","pubDate":"2022-08-14 07:00:04","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b83fb26a5dc2296075dbb8b6e48b1aef5a261a8/527_1312_3673_2204/master/3673.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=328fb869c98e25aef616d0126b03d6f0","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
