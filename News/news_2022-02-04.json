Cricket Australia confirmed the fixtures for the rest of the domestic season on Friday, with some teams to play just seven Shield matches while one will contest nine -- after COVID-19 caused chaos with the summer's schedule. Under the revised Shield format, the ladder positions will be determined by average points scored per game, with the top two still to progress to a final from March 31. The four-day competition will resume on Thursday, with Queensland to host NSW and Victoria to visit South Australia. Tasmania will return to the field against NSW on February 18, while WA will have wait until March 15 for their next match -- due to the state's hard border Test players from other states will be free to play in the first round back, while there is also some possibility they could feature in the second before flying to Pakistan in the last week of the month. It means the likes of Cameron Green and Mitch Marsh won't have more game time before the tour of Pakistan, with a squad to be announced next week. \"Following a fairly challenging BBL period, the medical advice we received recommended a short break post BBL, along with a break somewhere within the remaining fixtures,\" CA's head of operations Peter Roach said. \"Whilst Cricket Australia want to maximise the number of matches played in pivotal domestic competitions, the health and wellbeing of participants is a priority. \"For these reasons, the decision was made and supported unanimously by stakeholders to complete the domestic competitions under the revised playing conditions and schedule.\" It means NSW, Victoria and WA will finish the season after playing seven games, with South Australia and Tasmania on eight and Queensland on nine. All teams will play each other at least once, with NSW and Victoria's schedule made up of three games already completed against each other and one game against each other state. The changes mean Victoria move up to first on the ladder ahead of WA, after winning two of their opening three games against NSW. The 50-over competition will, meanwhile, have all teams play six games before the March 11 final, but with NSW and WA not meeting throughout the entire fixture. WA have already played five games, with their only remaining match against Victoria. CA are yet to sort the fixtures for the WNCL, with the competition to resume on February 22 but without Australia's World Cup players for its duration.","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5565825/94e31b40127fd04c278955cf48afde0a4c81970a-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Who will win today Pakistan Super League match: Who is expected to win Karachi Kings vs Peshawar Zalmi PSL 2022 match?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-who-will-win-today-pakistan-super-league-match-who-is-expected-to-win-karachi-kings-vs-peshawar-zalmi-psl-2022-match/","keywords":["Cricket","Karachi vs Peshawar","PSL 2022","PSL Match Prediction"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Karachi Kings vs Peshawar Zalmi: The SportsRush brings you the analysis and match-prediction of the Pakistan Super League game.

Who will win today PSL 2022 match: Karachi Kings vs Peshawar Zalmi Pitch Report The pitch has been excellent for batting this season. There is an even bounce on the track, whereas the boundaries are small as well. Both teams would want to chase because of the dew factor. Karachi Kings preview Karachi Kings have lost all three of their games, and they are in desperate need of a win. Sharjeel Khan has been their best batter, whereas Joe Clarke and Babar Azam are clearly struggling. The middle-order of this side is also not looking great at the moment. Mohammad Nabi has scalped three wickets, whereas the rest of the bowlers have struggled too. This side needs to turn the tides soon in their favour.

Many current and former cricketers have suggested that the Indian team should drop the veteran duo, urging the management to look ahead to the future. However, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly has a different suggestion for India's Test veterans. The former India skipper feels both Rahane and Pujara shouldn't mind going back to playing domestic cricket, having played so much international cricket. \"Yeah, they are very good players. Hopefully, they will go back to Ranji Trophy and score a lot of runs, which I am sure they will. I don't see any problem [for them to go back to domestic cricket after playing so much international cricket],\" Ganguly said during an interview with Sportstar. Ganguly also said that since Rahane and Pujara are not a part of India's white-ball setup, they should go back and test themselves in Ranji Trophy and other domestic competitions. \"Ranji Trophy is a huge tournament, and we have all played the tournament. So, they, too, will go back there and perform. They have played the tournament in the past when they were only playing Test cricket and were not part of the ODI or limited-overs team. So, that won't be a problem,\" he added. Promoted While Rahane last reached triple figures during the Boxing Day Test against Australian in December 2020, Pujara hasn't scored a ton in over three years -- the Sydney Test against Australia in January 2019. It will be interesting to see whether both players will find a place in Indian team for their next Test assignment, which will be against Sri Lanka during a two-match series in March on home soil.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-01/55ls4lo_pujara-rahane-afp_625x300_04_January_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England head coach Silverwood steps down after Ashes humiliation","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/ashes/england-head-coach-silverwood-steps-down-after-ashes-humiliation-eng-vs-aus-cricket-news/article38374908.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Reuters"],"video_url":null,"description":"England head coach Chris Silverwood has stepped down following the team's meek surrender in the Ashes series against Australia, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Thursday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-04 03:01:35","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SYL vs FBA Dream11 Team Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Hints: Captain, Probable Playing 11s, Team News; Injury Updates For Today’s BPL 2022 Match No. 19 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, Mirpur, 1 PM IST February 4","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/syl-vs-fba-dream11-team-prediction-fantasy-cricket-hints-captain-probable-playing-11s-team-news-injury-updates-for-today-s-bpl-2022-match-no-19-at-sher-e-bangla-national-stadium-mirpur-1-pm-ist-february-4-2433361.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sylhet Sunrisers vs Fortune Barishal Dream11 Team Prediction Sylhet Sunrisers vs Fortune Barishal Match No. 18 - Check My Dream11 Team, Best players list of SYL vs FBA, Sylhet Sunrisers Dream11 Team Player List, Fortune Barishal Dream11 Team Player List, Dream11 Guru Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips Bangladesh Premier League 2022, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Playing Tips.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-04 02:49:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"U19 World Cup: Pakistan, South Africa Finish Their Journey On A High","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/u19-world-cup-pakistan-south-africa-finish-their-journey-on-a-high-2748255","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan and South Africa both signed off their ICC U19 Men's Cricket World Cup campaigns on a positive note with victories on Thursday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-04 02:35:35","full_description":"Pakistan and South Africa both signed off their ICC U19 Men's Cricket World Cup campaigns on a positive note with victories on Thursday. Two-time champions Pakistan eased past Sri Lanka in the fifth-placed playoff after the two sides chances of lifting the trophy ended at the quarter-final stage last week. Pakistan were in command from the off at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Ground, with openers Muhammad Shehzad and Haseebullah Khan dominating the Sri Lanka attack. The pair led Pakistan to 100 without loss, Shehzad eventually made 73 off just 69 deliveries before he was dismissed by vice-captain Raveen de Silva. But Khan was joined at the crease by the impressive skipper Qasim Akram and the two took the game away from Sri Lanka, putting on a superb stand. Both made centuries and took Pakistan beyond 350, Khan was finally gone when trapped by Matheesha Pathirana ending on 136. Akram remained unbeaten as his side closed on 365/3, setting their opponents a daunting task to claim fifth place. And the Sri Lankan response was in tatters after just two overs with Akram wreaking havoc with the new ball. The talented all-rounder removed openers Chamindu Wickramasinghe and Pawan Pathiraja for a combined total of just one, with Shevon Daniel also falling between the two. Ranuda Somarathna also went for a duck with Akram single-handedly reducing Sri Lanka to 4-15. From then on Sri Lanka were purely batting for pride. Their captain Dunith Wellalage didn't go without a fight and made a brave 40, which included five boundaries. Vinuja Ranpul was in similarly defiant mood hitting 53 not out and his sides only two sixes of the match. But it wasn't enough and Pakistan cleaned up a 238 run victory when Treveen Mathew was hit on the pads by Zeeshan Zameer's full delivery, bowling out the Sri Lanka team inside 35 overs to secure fifth place. Meanwhile, Coolidge Cricket Ground, South Africa were also aiming to end their time in the Caribbean on a high, taking on Bangladesh in the seventh place playoff. After winning the toss and electing to bat, Bangladesh made a strong start reaching 50 without loss only for Mahfijul Islam to fall to Liam Alder in the 10th over. But fourth man in Ariful Islam kept maximum pressure on the South African attack, smashing 102 from 103 balls and finding the boundary on 12 separate occasions. The 17-year-old looked untouchable for so much of the Bangladeshi innings, right until the 47th over when Mathew Boast found a good line and Islam pulled his shot to South Africa captain George Van Heerden. The Bengal Tigers eventually reached a strong total of 293-8 at the end of their 50 overs. In reply, South Africa lost Jade Smith in the sixth over when outside edging Musfik Hasan's delivery. But Dewald Brevis, who hit 97 in the quarter-final defeat to England, offered some hope for his team with a century eventually finishing with 138 off 130 balls. The other end was less reliable, Van Heerden and Gerhardus Maree both going cheaply, however, Mathew Boast's quickfire 41 from 22 kept them on track. In a nervy finale, it looked like Andile Simelane would take South Africa over the line, but he was run-out after tidy fielding from Ripon Mondol. But eventually, they got the win, and seventh place, in fine style when Alder punched a big drive down the leg side that went for six, securing a two-wicket victory in the process. Promoted This bettered their final placing at the 2020 tournament where they finished eighth, but for defending champions Bangladesh a difficult three weeks ended in defeat.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-01/637nsgk8_pakistan-u19-icc_625x300_21_January_22.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Test cricket is under threat and the game needs strong administrators to save it","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/test-cricket-is-under-threat-and-the-game-needs-strong-administrators-to-save-it-20220204-p59tqq.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"If Test cricket becomes a format that is only considered important to a handful of countries, it will be as good as dead.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-04 02:14:39","full_description":"For centuries, the armoured knights on horseback were unchallenged on the European battlefield.

Fast bowlers have been the equivalent of cricket’s armoured knights ever since Harold Larwood laid waste to the Australian footmen in the Ashes series of 1932-33. The team with the best pace attack has usually held sway since. The various iterations of the four horsemen of the apocalypse from the West Indies absolutely decimated their opposition, in all conditions, from the late 1970s until the late ’90s. Alas, the days of the West Indies producing a constant battery of tall pace bowlers have long gone, and pitch conditions in the region are more conducive to producing spin bowlers than pace anyway. The ascendancy of the Australian pace attack this summer was the decisive factor in the Ashes. Nothing separates the men from the boys in Test cricket more than genuine pace. Only a quartet of quality spinners in turning conditions have ever caused as much discombobulation among batsmen, though the risk to life and limb, and the raw emotion that pace engenders is in a different league. It has been interesting to watch the Under-19 World Cup in the Caribbean, which will come to a climax in the early hours of Sunday morning when England take on the might of India – who are in their fourth consecutive final – at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Ground in Antigua. The usual protagonists have risen to the top of the table at the youth World Cup. Apart from India and England, Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan finished in the top six. The one surprising result was Afghanistan finishing in the top four. It is not quite so surprising when one considers the quality of their spinners, at that level. The disappointments in the Caribbean have been the hosts themselves, who finished 11th, and Bangladesh (seventh) and South Africa (eighth). At least the West Indies and South Africa produce quality fast bowlers, which keep them competitive at the Test level. While the recent Ashes series was great, Test cricket is struggling in many parts of the world. Credit: Getty Other participating countries included Ireland, Scotland, UAE, Canada, Papua New Guinea and Uganda. Sadly, none of them are going to be a force in Test cricket any time soon, until they have a viable and vibrant domestic first-class competition. Afghanistan will also struggle to be a force, for the same reason. It is hard enough for established Test-playing countries like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, where cricket is the dominant sport, because their domestic first-class competition is more akin to Premier League cricket in Australia. Without bowlers of express pace they will rarely win away from home. It is no coincidence that India’s improved performances overseas in the past 15 years have been on the back of developing a battery of fast bowlers. Indeed, fast bowlers are the not-so-secret ingredient of champion teams who win at home and away. Despite the disruption to their cricket, Pakistan continue to produce quality pace bowlers. However, top-quality batsmen are thin on the ground there. To be fair, reaching the top as a bowler, where one mistake is not terminal, is arguably easier than it is for a batsman. But, I would say that, wouldn’t I? I do expect a couple of indignant phone calls today from Messrs DK Lillee and SK Warne. Surprisingly, the T20 format has been a renaissance of sorts for canny spin bowlers. Leg-spinners are like gold in the shortest format, but I am bewildered by them getting the cold shoulder in Test cricket.

I would like to see the ICC representatives from each country be chosen from the ranks of former Test captains, so that the integrity of the game in all its forms is zealously guarded and steered by those who understand its nuances and value best. If we continue to populate the ranks of administration with those from the business and the political world, money and power will always be the winner.

Bumrah has established himself as the linchpin of India's pace attack not just in Test cricket but across formats. Former India bowling coach Bharat Arun pointed out one particular incident which played a part in Bumrah's ascension in Test cricket. Arun revealed that Virat Kohli was impressed with Bumrah in the nets, which prompted the management to hand the pacer his Test debut in Johannesburg. \"We had 10-12 days for practice before the start of that South Africa series in 2018. During that period, Virat was extremely impressed with Bumrah in the nets - he said, 'Bumrah is the most difficult to face amongst all the bowlers we have.' So, he instantly decided that Bumrah would be playing in the first Test, and his career took off from there,\" Arun told Sportstar. While recalling his chat with the-then head coach Ravi Shastri, Arun highlighted how Bumrah, who had become a mainstay in India's ODI and T20I team by then, always wanted to represent India in red-ball cricket. \"Bumrah, previously, when he was part of the ODI teams, constantly told me that his dream was to be a successful Test cricketer. I told Ravi about this, he said Bumrah adds a huge dimension to the bowling. He was keen on unleashing him in South Africa.

Other items on the agenda are the fast-approaching historic tour of Pakistan and the next full-time chairperson too. While Langer’s contract extends until June, whether he tours with the Australian squad will likely be determined by the result of the board meeting. Should the board not wish to extend his contract, it is more than likely the former Australian opener, who only a week ago was inducted to the Hall of Fame, will stand down and an interim coach announced. More than likely that interim coach would be assistant Andrew McDonald. Langer’s role as Australian coach has been the subject of much discussion over the past year, with reports about his personality surfacing ever since their 2-1 home series loss to India in January, 2021.

Silverwood's departure came a day after Ashley Giles, who appointed him in 2019, was sacked from his role of England managing director men's cricket. England's 4-0 reverse in Australia means they have now won just one of their last 14 Tests, albeit Silverwood's tenure coincided with the coronavirus pandemic. Former England captain Andrew Strauss has replaced Giles on a temporary basis and will oversee the appointment of an interim coach for the tour of the West Indies in March \"in the coming days\", according to ECB chief executive Tom Harrison. Harrison said Silverwood had given \"absolutely everything\" to make a success of the job, pointing to Test series wins in South Africa and Sri Lanka, and that he was a man of \"great integrity\". \"He has led the England men's team with great resilience and empathy through an incredibly challenging period for English cricket, and he deserves our sincere thanks and gratitude,\" insisted Harrison. Former England left-arm spinner Giles received fresh criticism during the Ashes for giving Silverwood sole authority to pick the side after being behind the sacking of national selector Ed Smith. Silverwood, having been involved in a controversial rest and rotation policy during series losses away to India and at home to New Zealand in 2021, found himself under fire again following several bizarre selection decisions in Australia. For all the strain of a gruelling schedule and 'bubble' cricket, it was hard to explain, for example, why England dropped James Anderson and Stuart Broad, their two most successful Test bowlers of all time, from the series opener in Brisbane. England were 3-0 down in a five-match series within 12 days of cricket, making a mockery of Silverwood's remark that the \"Ashes are a marathon not a sprint\". They only avoided a whitewash with a draw in the fourth Test when Silverwood was in Covid-enforced isolation. The 46-year-old former Test paceman joined England's backroom staff in 2018 as a bowling coach before succeeding Trevor Bayliss as head coach after a drawn home Ashes series the following year. Silverwood was tasked with improving England's Test record after their white-ball form had improved so spectacularly under Australian coach Bayliss that Eoin Morgan's men won the 50-over World Cup three years ago. But not even the runs of England star batsman Joe Root, who appears set to remain as Test captain, could prevent a succession of damaging collapses. \"It's been an absolute honour to be England head coach and I'm extremely proud to have worked alongside our players and staff,\" said Silverwood in the ECB statement. \"The last two years have been very demanding but I have really enjoyed my time with the team. I am very proud of this group considering the challenges.\" Among those touted as possible successors to Silverwood are Gary Kirsten, a former South Africa opener who has coached both the Proteas and India, and Alec Stewart, an ex-England captain who has overseen the development of several members of the current Test side at Surrey. Australia great Ricky Ponting has also been linked with the job. Promoted And while both the managing director and head coach have now left, Harrison -- under fire for both presiding over the current set-up and the ECB's response to a racism scandal sparked by revelations from former Yorkshire spinner Azeem Rafiq -- remains in his position.

Channel 7 hosts Nat Barr and David Koch tried to get an answer out of Cummins about whether he wants Langer to continue as coach of the national team but the fast bowler once again played a straight bat. Watch The Dettol T20 Series Australia vs Sri Lanka. Every Game Live & On-Demand on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > Cummins has refused to publicly endorse Langer as the Aussie legend waits to see whether Cricket Australia will extend his contract, which expires in the middle of the year. The 51-year-old faced a player mutiny in mid-2021 as dressing room leaks revealed unhappiness over his mood swings and intense management style. Despite leading Australia to a recent T20 World Cup win and 4-0 Ashes sweep during Cummins’ first Test series as captain, there is speculation Langer will be ousted. Barr broached the topic with Cummins in a Sunrise interview on Friday morning, asking: “Now Pat, if it was your call, would you sign Justin Langer as coach again?” He replied: “In this case, it isn’t my call, so I’m going to leave the speculation to one side. He has done fantastic.” But Koch wasn’t going to let Cummins off the hook that easily. Koch: Pat, Pat, Pat. We know in cricket, more than any other sport, the captain has an enormous say. Are you happy to have Justin re-sign? Cummins: Absolutely, I’ve been a part of the evaluation process, but I know my place. My place isn’t to make the end call. He’s been fantastic. I really do love JL, he’s been great for our team. Koch: So you want him to re-sign? Cummins: I’m not adding to any speculation. Koch: Come on, Pat! Cricket was in tatters three years ago, he took the reins, yes he’s a fairly intense guy, everyone in sport knows that and sometimes the intensity can be a bit wearing, but you’ve all got the success, why break up the team? Cummins: That’s 100 per cent fact, he’s been great, the results have been excellent especially the last six months. But it’s also fact we’re in a high-performance scenario where everyone gets evaluated all the time. His contract is up so they’re just running the process at the moment which I think is incredibly healthy and fair. I know everyone is wanting an urgent decision but I’m sure Cricket Australia will make that soon.” Barr joked Cummins was “pretty good at being diplomatic” while Koch said the paceman “is going into politics after cricket”. Cummins’ comments come after he tried to duck and weave questions about Langer at a press conference on Thursday. “It’s in Cricket Australia’s hands,” the skipper said. “JL’s been doing a fantastic job, he’s been there for four years, his contract is obviously up soon, they’re just going through an evaluation process at the moment, which I think is fair, the right thing to do. We all get evaluated all the time as cricketers. It’s part of a high-performance environment. “That process is happening, it’s a decision for Cricket Australia and we just have to wait.” Cummins said the speculation was “not healthy” and he didn’t want to add to it by giving a public opinion that could hold little weight. “That’s Cricket Australia’s job, it’s not my job,” he said. “There’s been a process, I’ve been part of that, a lot of other players have been part of that. It’s just like when we get evaluated. “I’ve got huge respect for JL, I’ve really liked working with him, but it’s not my call.” On Monday, foxsports.com.au reported Langer reacted angrily when the possibility of him reapplying for the coaching role was raised by CA chief executive Nick Hockley and high performance manager Ben Oliver during a “heated” meeting last Friday morning. According to the report, Langer is refusing to accept anything less than a full contract renewal, arguing his record warrants another multi-year deal. A Cricket Australia board meeting is scheduled to take place on Friday, where Langer’s future will be a hot topic. A crisis meeting between CA chiefs and senior players last year was needed to address the issues between team and coach, sparking suggestions Langer was in danger of not having his contract renewed. The former Australian Test opener has since taken a step back and delegated more responsibility to his support staff, which has seemingly helped improve the team’s performance. Several high-profile former cricketers have jumped to Langer’s defence, including long-time friend and West Australian teammate Damien Martyn, as well as Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. Heads continue to roll within England cricket as yet another leader bites the dust after a horrendous Ashes tour of Australia. The Aussies retained the urn by claiming victory over their most bitter rival in the first of three Women’s Ashes ODIs.

Although Langer’s four-year contract, worth an estimated $900,000 per-year, does not expire until June, it is likely he will either be reappointed long-term or leave early with his position untenable. All the indications are that Langer will be forced out of his dream role, weeks after retaining the Ashes and months after spearheading Australia’s maiden T20 World Cup campaign.

You have to be flamboyant, fearless and carefree. But in Test cricket it is about discipline and delivering over long periods of time.

That stems from training and a strong work ethic around the team. “You also have to get rid of excuses such as blaming bubbles and schedules. Langer would clear away excuses.

Yorkshire were forced to cancel a meeting on Wednesday night which had been seen as key in bringing about a culture change in the wake of the Azeem Rafiq racism crisis and prompting the England and Wales Cricket Board to restore their right to host international matches at Headingley. The extraordinary general meeting of members was due to include a vote on significant changes to the board structure, but was cancelled because the club discovered it had not been properly called. A club statement issued on Wednesday said the former leadership had failed to file amended club rules with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Robin Smith, the former county chair, told the Yorkshire Post that he believed that same failure to file the updated rules to the FCA meant Lord Patel’s chairmanship was also invalid, something which is now the subject of a legal dispute. Smith, who served as Yorkshire chair between 2002 and 2005 and again between 2018 and 2020 and was chair of the Yorkshire Cricket Foundation until late last year, also said Patel could be personally liable financially for the settlement paid to Rafiq and for any costs arising from the dismissal of a group of staff in December . Patel said in a statement issued to the PA news agency: “It is plain that, when I joined the club in November, it had a wealth of legacy problems inherited from previous leadership, of which former chairman Robin Smith was a part. “I made a conscious decision that we would focus on a positive future for Yorkshire and remediate the inherited issues. For me and others at the club, this was part of a positive programme for change as there is no benefit to Yorkshire CCC in arguing about the past. That is a block to reform. There is emerging, however, a clear agenda to undermine the club, driven by opposition to our progress and a desire to maintain an outdated status quo. It is disheartening and pernicious in equal manner. “We have become aware of a small group of individuals who have indicated a belief that, by looking to make progress and change for the better, ‘the lamb that is Yorkshire Cricket Club is to be sacrificed on the altar of Black Lives Matter’. This is unacceptable in every possible way. “This group is actively seeking to delay and derail the essential reforms and consequently the return of international cricket by litigating process issues, without presenting any positive alternative.” Patel’s statement said the club plans to discuss with members whether registering the amended rules with the FCA had the effect of validating actions back to the date of the changes, or only from the date of registration – 31 January 2022. He added: “We do not wish to waste our time or money on unnecessary litigation and are now having to take a longer route to passing the necessary reforms which cannot be derailed. “Yorkshire County Cricket Club is moving forward with all deliberate speed to make the appropriate reforms, and we have no doubt these will occur because the majority of members clearly want them. The small group can now only delay, and not prevent, reform. Robin Smith states he wishes to see Test cricket returned to Headingley, but in my opinion he is actively working with the sole intention to destabilise and even destroy this club rather than see it change. “Conversely, we believe that only by listening and learning can we improve as a club, and create a scalable template for progress which the sport as a whole can follow. We are determined not to be diverted from this course, because it is the right thing to do.” Smith said in a written statement: “Lord Patel’s comments seek to damage me for drawing attention to his own failures. The members will in due course have an opportunity to pass judgement on Lord Patel’s actions since November last year and their enormous financial consequences for the club (currently rumoured to be more than £3m). In the meantime he should focus on getting the club’s legal position corrected in timely fashion. As to the majority of members wanting his reforms, we shall see in due course. The reality, though, is that all Yorkshire members wish to see Test cricket returned to Headingley and have been threatened that that will not happen unless they support the reforms. “That is no way to ascertain members’ true views. Yorkshire members are true lovers of the game and are entitled to more respect than Lord Patel is showing them.” Asked why, as chair in March 2020, he had not flagged up the failure to file the 2020 and 2021 rule changes to the FCA until last month, he said: “I retired as chairman and from the board at the AGM on March 21, 2020. The rule amendments passed at that meeting, and at the AGM a year later, fell to be registered in the normal way by the club after I had departed, not before. “I was unaware that the amendments had not been registered until that fact was drawn to my attention by a club member some three weeks ago. I knew that the consequences were potentially serious (including possible personal liability of Lord Patel) and so I immediately drew the matter to his attention and that of the club secretary.” Responding to Lord Patel’s statement, the digital, culture, media and sport committee chair Julian Knight told PA: “It is deeply concerning if what is being reported is an accurate picture of what’s happening at Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Lord Patel talks of an agenda to undermine the progress that’s being driven by him to tackle racism. Anyone seeking to subvert his work must be called out and held to account. “The experience of Azeem Rafiq represented a watershed moment for cricket in England – it cannot be lost because of the unacceptable motivations of individuals who appear to be prepared to go to great lengths to preserve the status quo. The future of Yorkshire County Cricket Club now hangs in the balance.” Members were to be asked at Wednesday’s EGM to vote on changes to club rules which would allow up to eight non-members to join the board as independent non-executive directors. An email to members seen by the PA news agency says that a change to allow an ECB representative to sit on the club’s nominations committee, which recommends potential board members, had been dropped following feedback from the membership. The email also said it was intended to remove the observer and veto powers of the Colin Graves Trust contained within the rules “at the next available opportunity”. Lord Patel told MPs on the DCMS committee last week that the Trust had been “incredibly supportive” of making the change. His predecessor as chair, Roger Hutton, told the same committee last November that the Trust had blocked his attempt to remove Mark Arthur and Martyn Moxon – the previous chief executive and director of cricket – over their response to the findings of the report into allegations of racial harassment and bullying by Rafiq.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d32327886c5f7f071f636b296005ca0706389fc2/0_451_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3bf2891a97289609ee362a3ae4b657e","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“A Women’s IPL should be top priority now”: Michael Vaughan adds pressure on Sourav Ganguly for organizing the Women’s IPL","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-a-womens-ipl-should-be-top-priority-now-michael-vaughan-adds-pressure-on-sourav-ganguly-for-organizing-the-womens-ipl/","keywords":["Cricket","Indian Premier League","IPL","Michael vaughan","Sourav Ganguly","Women's IPL"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Michael Vaughan adds pressure on Sourav Ganguly for the initiation of long overdue Women’s Indian Premier League.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in general, and its President Sourav Ganguly in particular, have come under the scanner off-late for their alleged lackadaisical attitude towards the initiation prospect of a women’s Indian Premier League (IPL) in the country. Ganguly, during an interaction with the Sportstar magazine on Thursday, invited some fresh criticism his way after him implying that a dearth of player pool count in India is the roadblock for the organization of a Women’s IPL. “The Women’s T20 Challenge will again be back this year in the month of May. Hopefully, in the future, we will be able to host a bigger women’s IPL once the number of women players [player pool] goes up. But this year, the Women’s T20 Challenge will happen during the IPL playoffs,” remarked Ganguly after being asked on his plans for the Women’s IPL. Michael Vaughan adds pressure on Sourav Ganguly Former England batter and skipper Michael Vaughan too, has come up with a message for the BCCI President, suggesting him that it is high time that a Women’s IPL is prioritized. A Womens #IPL should be top priority now @SGanguly99 !! Let’s get it sorted .. — Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) February 3, 2022 The calls for a Women’s IPL gained momentum ever since India finished as runners-up at the 2017 ODI World Cup losing against England, and then again when they finished second again during the 2020 T20 World Cup against Australia. The success of Indian players like Harmanpreet Kaur, Poonam Yadav, Smriti Mandhana, and Jemimah Rodrigues for their respective franchises in the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) and ‘The Hundred’ have further made case for an introduction of the IPL before the world’s richest board. It is also worth reminiscing that Ganguly had, even in December 2019, cited a ‘lack of depth’ as the reason why the BCCI is not keen to give a ‘go ahead’ to the women’s IPL. “You need to understand the practicality of it,” he told India Today. “You need a lot more women players. I see that in four years’ time, to get a seven-team IPL with the best women players [in participation],” Ganguly had remarked back then. Former Indian skipper’s aforementioned statements have been countered by a section of fans on social media, who have argued that there is, in fact, more than an enough pool of players available in the country. Can this tweet get more shares, please? https://t.co/gUkh3qVn2S — Abhishek Mukherjee (@ovshake42) February 3, 2022 Presently, it is the Women’s T20 Challenge- a three-team, four-match event, which is the lone T20 competition for India’s women cricketers. It is set to return back in May this year, after the previous season was called-off due to COVID-19.

Former England left-arm spinner Giles’ position was widely regarded as untenable following the Ashes defeat, where for all the problems of touring Australia during the Covid-19 pandemic, he was criticised for giving under-pressure head coach Chris Silverwood sole authority for picking the side after being behind the sacking of national selector Ed Smith. Wednesday’s statement saw both Giles and the ECB acknowledge the highlights of his reign, which included a maiden 50-over world title in 2019, rising to the top of the top of the Twenty20 rankings and a current position of fourth in the Test standings. It added Strauss will “put in place arrangements for the forthcoming West Indies tour, while the search begins for a full-time replacement.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England's Ashes indignity claims another scalp","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/england-coach-silverwood-leaves-after-ashes-humiliation/d077852b-a329-4856-b2fc-df800767f293","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ashley Giles, England’s director of cricket, left his role on Wednesday, and now another head has rolled after The Ashes debacle.","content":"Chris Silverwood stepped down as England cricket coach on Thursday, becoming the second significant departure amid the fallout from the team's humiliating Ashes series loss in Australia.Ashley Giles, England’s director of cricket, left his role on Wednesday in the wake of the men's team losing 4-0 to Australia.READ MORE: Verstappen reveals message from Mercedes boss after F1 finaleREAD MORE: Hamilton claims Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was 'manipulated'READ MORE: Truth behind exiled NRL star John Asiata's anti-vax stance“The last two years have been very demanding but I have really enjoyed my time with the team,\" Silverwood said. “I leave with fond memories and I am now looking forward to spending some quality time at home with my family and embracing the next chapter.”An interim coach will be appointed ahead of next month’s three tests in the West Indies.“During his time in the role Chris has given absolutely everything to make a success of it,\" England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive officer Tom Harrison said. \"He is a man of great integrity, who players and staff alike have enjoyed working with.“Under Chris, England Men’s white ball teams have been ranked first and second in the world while he also led the Test team to a number of series wins including away in South Africa and Sri Lanka.

During the 10th match of the ongoing seventh season of the Pakistan Super League between Quetta Gladiators and Islamabad United in Karachi, Islamabad United beat Quetta Gladiators by 43 runs to become the second-ranked team on the points table. Chasing a mammoth 230-run target, Gladiators were bundled out for 186 in 19.3 overs. Despite opening batter Ahsan Ali providing a brisk start by scoring 50 (27), Quetta successfully managed to lose their way in the chase by losing six wickets in as many overs for just 43 runs. A record 76-run partnership for the eighth wicket between all-rounders Mohammad Nawaz (47) and James Faulkner (30*) saved QG from one of the biggest PSL defeats but never really made them worthy of sealing the chase despite the duo hitting a combined of five fours and seven sixes. Earlier, Gladiators captain Sarfaraz Ahmed’s decision of electing to field first after winning the toss wasn’t justified by his bowlers as they conceded a fourth-highest innings total in the PSL. Veteran Gladiators spinner Shahid Afridi, who was playing his first match for this franchise and his first T20 in almost a year, bagged an unwanted record of registering worst bowling figures in both the PSL and his 18-year T20 career. United, on the other hand, made optimum advantage of the conditions thriving on the back of individual half-centuries from Colin Munro (72*), Azam Khan (65) and Paul Stirling (58). Highest score in PSL 2022 PSL 7, which has become a hunting ground for high-scoring encounters, witnessed another one at the National Stadium tonight as both the teams accumulated a combined total of 415 runs. Barring two out of the first three matches of the season, all other matches have been witness to teams scoring in excess of 165 runs. Out of the first 20 completed innings of PSL 2022, 170-run mark has been touched or surpassed on as many as 14 occasions. While the 190-run mark has been achieved eight times, there have already been four 200+ innings total.

Both men have paid the price for Test results that produced only one win from the team’s past 14 outings and ended with the failure in Australia. “It’s been an absolute honour to be England head coach, and I’m extremely proud to have worked alongside our players and staff,” Silverwood said. “I want to thank them all for the hard work and commitment they have given during my time in the role and I wish them all the very best moving forward.” “The last two years have been very demanding but I have really enjoyed my time with the team and working with Rooty and Morgs, and I am very proud of this group considering the challenges. I leave with fond memories and I am now looking forward to spending some quality time at home with my family and embracing the next chapter.” Silverwood joined the England setup as a bowling coach in 2018, and replaced Trevor Bayliss as head coach in October 2019. He came under renewed pressure as England’s attempt to regain the Ashes floundered within 12 days and they subsequently concluded their third consecutive tour Down Under without winning a Test. Amid batting travails, questionable selections and tactical errors, Giles had publicly sought to blame exhausting scheduling and Covid bubbles for the poor performances. But following the panel’s review, and with a Test squad needing to be picked for the forthcoming tour of the Caribbean next week, the end has come swiftly on Silverwood’s two-year tenure. The ECB has yet to announce whether Silverwood’s assistant and batting coach, Graham Thorpe, will stay in the England setup or join the head coach in leaving.
