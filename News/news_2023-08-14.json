Motts is also planning to take a gamble on fast bowler Jofra Archer amid his fitness vows, as he is ‘a proven performer.’ English selectors are expected to announce an 18-player squad for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 in India this Tuesday, which will be further trimmed down to the final 15 prior to September 28, as per ICC rules. Matthew Mott has told the media that there are two elements, ‘a call from Jos Buttler to his fellow England captain Stokes’ and ‘an updated medical report on another hero of 2019 in Archer’ would be crucial before the selectors finalise the squad. “Jos will probably lead the way on that communication (with Ben Stokes), but Ben’s pretty straight with all of us. We will see if he’s keen,” Mott said. He further emphasized Stokes’s importance to the team in all three aspects of the game. “There has not been a clear direction on what he’s going to do yet, but we are still hopeful. I’ve always said his bowling would be a bonus, but just look at what he brings with the bat, even in the field,” said Mott. “Watching him throughout the whole Ashes series, he had such a great presence. He’s done it for years when it comes to performing in one-day cricket and so he’s an invaluable commodity,” he concluded. Ben Stokes, announced his retirement from ODI cricket during the home series against South Africa last year. He made his ODI debut in 2011 and represented England in 105 ODI games. The decorated all-rounder scored 2919 runs, including three centuries, and took 74 wickets in his glittering ODI career. He played a vital role for England with his unbeaten 84 in the 2019 ODI World Cup against New Zealand and forced the match into a super over before Jofra Archer’s super over helped England lift their maiden ODI World Cup title by ‘the barest of margins’. Jofra Archer was also a hero for England in their successful World Cup campaign in 2019. However, his career has been plagued with injuries as he managed to play only seven games since the World Cup final against New Zealand in 2019. However, the English coach is ready to take a risk, as Archer has been a ‘match-winner’ for the English side. “There is a high chance that we will take a risk on a proven performer that has done it on the world stage,” “We are planning for him to be available. Obviously, a lot of things have to go his way and it will be a tight timeline but with players like that you are going to give them every opportunity to prove their fitness, and so we will keep an open mind.” The England selection committee will also announce ODI and T20I squads to face New Zealand and Ireland in limited-overs series from August 30 to September 26. World champions England will kick off their World Cup campaign in the opening game against 2019 finalists New Zealand on October 5 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.","pubDate":"2023-08-13 17:46:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kohli lauds Babar as ‘the top batsman in the world’","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/kohli-lauds-babar-as-the-top-batsman-in-the-world/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI (Agencies): Former Indian captain Virat Kohli spoke highly of Pakistan’s all-format captain Babar Azam, and termed him “the top batsman in the world”.Virat Kohli shared his first encounter in Manchester with Babar Azam when Imad Wasim introduced Babar to Kohli.“The first interaction I had with him [Babar] was during the 2019 [ODI] World […]","content":"NEW DELHI (Agencies): Former Indian captain Virat Kohli spoke highly of Pakistan’s all-format captain Babar Azam, and termed him “the top batsman in the world”.

He performs so consistently and I’ve always enjoyed watching him play.” Babar Azam is currently sitting at the top of the ODI batting ranking, the position which was once held by Virat Kohli.

Motts is also planning to take a gamble on fast bowler Jofra Archer amid his fitness vows, as he is ‘a proven performer.’ English selectors are expected to announce an 18-player squad for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 in India this Tuesday, which will be further trimmed down to the final 15 prior to September 28, as per ICC rules. Matthew Mott has told the media that there are two elements, ‘a call from Jos Buttler to his fellow England captain Stokes’ and ‘an updated medical report on another hero of 2019 in Archer’ would be crucial before the selectors finalise the squad. “Jos will probably lead the way on that communication (with Ben Stokes), but Ben’s pretty straight with all of us. We will see if he’s keen,” Mott said. He further emphasized Stokes’s importance to the team in all three aspects of the game. “There has not been a clear direction on what he’s going to do yet, but we are still hopeful. I’ve always said his bowling would be a bonus, but just look at what he brings with the bat, even in the field,” said Mott. “Watching him throughout the whole Ashes series, he had such a great presence. He’s done it for years when it comes to performing in one-day cricket and so he’s an invaluable commodity,” he concluded. Ben Stokes, announced his retirement from ODI cricket during the home series against South Africa last year. He made his ODI debut in 2011 and represented England in 105 ODI games. The decorated all-rounder scored 2919 runs, including three centuries, and took 74 wickets in his glittering ODI career. He played a vital role for England with his unbeaten 84 in the 2019 ODI World Cup against New Zealand and forced the match into a super over before Jofra Archer’s super over helped England lift their maiden ODI World Cup title by ‘the barest of margins’. Jofra Archer was also a hero for England in their successful World Cup campaign in 2019. However, his career has been plagued with injuries as he managed to play only seven games since the World Cup final against New Zealand in 2019. However, the English coach is ready to take a risk, as Archer has been a ‘match-winner’ for the English side. “There is a high chance that we will take a risk on a proven performer that has done it on the world stage,” “We are planning for him to be available. Obviously, a lot of things have to go his way and it will be a tight timeline but with players like that you are going to give them every opportunity to prove their fitness, and so we will keep an open mind.” The England selection committee will also announce ODI and T20I squads to face New Zealand and Ireland in limited-overs series from August 30 to September 26. World champions England will kick off their World Cup campaign in the opening game against 2019 finalists New Zealand on October 5 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.","pubDate":"2023-08-13 17:46:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kohli lauds Babar as ‘the top batsman in the world’","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/kohli-lauds-babar-as-the-top-batsman-in-the-world/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI (Agencies): Former Indian captain Virat Kohli spoke highly of Pakistan’s all-format captain Babar Azam, and termed him “the top batsman in the world”.Virat Kohli shared his first encounter in Manchester with Babar Azam when Imad Wasim introduced Babar to Kohli.“The first interaction I had with him [Babar] was during the 2019 [ODI] World […]","content":"NEW DELHI (Agencies): Former Indian captain Virat Kohli spoke highly of Pakistan’s all-format captain Babar Azam, and termed him “the top batsman in the world”.

He further talked about the meeting and the friendship they shared since that first meeting. “I saw a lot of regard and respect from him from day one, and that hasn’t changed,” he added. Kohli then termed Babar as the top batter across the globe and claimed that he enjoys watching Babar play. “He is so down to earth character, he will go a long way as a player. He is probably the top batsman right now across all formats. He performs so consistently and I’ve always enjoyed watching him play.” Babar Azam is currently sitting at the top of the ODI batting ranking, the position which was once held by Virat Kohli. Both batters are celebrated across the globe as the best batters of this era. However, despite the comparison and debates regarding who is better, the cricketers always displayed mutual respect for each other. Last year, in July Babar came out in support of Virat with a motivating tweet, “This too shall pass. Stay strong” and received an overwhelming response from the cricket fans. Virat, also responded to Babar’s supportive tweet for him in a challenging phase of his career, while also wishing latter the luck. “Thank you. Keep shining and rising. Wish you all the best,” Virat replied to Babar in his tweet. They will come face to face in the Asia Cup, when Pakistan and India will collide at Kandy on September 2. The Asia Cup is scheduled to treat the fans with as many as three India-Pakistan games if both teams reach the final. The arch-rivals will also feature in the most anticipated clash of the ODI World Cup at Narendra Modi Stadium on October 14.","pubDate":"2023-08-13 17:44:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Red Card In Cricket: ఇకపై క్రికెట్‌లో కొత్త రూల్స్‌, స్లో ఓవర్ రేట్‌కు శిక్షల కోసం రూల్స్‌ మార్పు, రెడ్‌కార్డ్ ప్రవేశపెట్టిన కరీబియన్‌ ప్రీమియర్ లీగ్","link":"https://telugu.latestly.com/sports/cricket/red-card-in-cricket-cpl-introduces-new-rules-to-contain-slow-over-rate-105264.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"క్రికెట్‌లో ఫుట్‌బాల్ త‌ర‌హాలో రెడ్ కార్డ్ (Red card )నిబంధ‌న‌ను తీసుకువ‌స్తున్నారు. ఒక జ‌ట్టు నిర్ణీత స‌మ‌యంలోగా 20వ ఓవ‌ర్‌ను వేయ‌క‌పోతే 11 మంది ఆట‌గాళ్ల‌లోంచి ఒక ప్లేయ‌ర్ మైదానం వీడి వెళ్లాల్సి ఉంటుంది. అంతేకాదు.. స్లో ఓవ‌ర్ రేటు(slow over rate)ను 18 ఓవ‌ర్‌ను నుంచి కౌంట్ చేస్తూ ఆ ఓవ‌ర్ నుంచే శిక్ష‌లు విధించేలా కొత్త రూల్స్‌ను తెస్తున్నారు.","content":"New Delhi, AUG 13: క్రికెట్‌లో ఫుట్‌బాల్ త‌ర‌హాలో రెడ్ కార్డ్ (Red card )నిబంధ‌న‌ను తీసుకువ‌స్తున్నారు. ఒక జ‌ట్టు నిర్ణీత స‌మ‌యంలోగా 20వ ఓవ‌ర్‌ను వేయ‌క‌పోతే 11 మంది ఆట‌గాళ్ల‌లోంచి ఒక ప్లేయ‌ర్ మైదానం వీడి వెళ్లాల్సి ఉంటుంది. అంతేకాదు.. స్లో ఓవ‌ర్ రేటు(slow over rate)ను 18 ఓవ‌ర్‌ను నుంచి కౌంట్ చేస్తూ ఆ ఓవ‌ర్ నుంచే శిక్ష‌లు విధించేలా కొత్త రూల్స్‌ను తెస్తున్నారు. అయితే.. ఇది అంత‌ర్జాతీయ క్రికెట్ కౌన్సిల్ (ICC) తీసుకురాలేదు. కరీబియన్ కరీబియన్ ప్రీమియ‌ర్ లీగ్ (CPL) నిర్వాహ‌కులు తీసుకువ‌చ్చారు. ఆగ‌స్టు 17 నుంచి కరీబియన్ ప్రీమియ‌ర్ లీగ్ కొత్త సీజ‌న్ ప్రారంభం కానుంది. ఈ సీజ‌న్ నుంచి స్లో ఓవ‌ర్‌పై నూత‌న రూల్స్ తీసుకువ‌స్తున్న‌ట్లు CPL యొక్క టోర్నమెంట్ ఆపరేషన్స్ డైరెక్టర్ మైఖేల్ హాల్ తెలిపారు. ప్ర‌తీ సీజ‌న్‌లో మ్యాచ్‌లు ముగిసేందుకు చాలా ఎక్కువ స‌మ‌యం ప‌డుతుండ‌డం ఆందోళ‌న క‌లిగిస్తోంది. స్లో ఓవ‌ర్ రేటును నివారించేందుకు కొత్త నిబంధ‌న‌లు తీసుకువ‌చ్చాము. ఈ సీజ‌న్ నుంచే ఈ రూల్స్ అమ‌లు అవుతాయని చెప్పారు.

Motts is also planning to take a gamble on fast bowler Jofra Archer amid his fitness vows, as he is ‘a proven performer.’ English selectors are expected to announce an 18-player squad for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 in India this Tuesday, which will be further trimmed down to the final 15 prior to September 28, as per ICC rules. Matthew Mott has told the media that there are two elements, ‘a call from Jos Buttler to his fellow England captain Stokes’ and ‘an updated medical report on another hero of 2019 in Archer’ would be crucial before the selectors finalise the squad. “Jos will probably lead the way on that communication (with Ben Stokes), but Ben’s pretty straight with all of us. We will see if he’s keen,” Mott said. He further emphasized Stokes’s importance to the team in all three aspects of the game. “There has not been a clear direction on what he’s going to do yet, but we are still hopeful. I’ve always said his bowling would be a bonus, but just look at what he brings with the bat, even in the field,” said Mott. “Watching him throughout the whole Ashes series, he had such a great presence. He’s done it for years when it comes to performing in one-day cricket and so he’s an invaluable commodity,” he concluded. Ben Stokes, announced his retirement from ODI cricket during the home series against South Africa last year. He made his ODI debut in 2011 and represented England in 105 ODI games. The decorated all-rounder scored 2919 runs, including three centuries, and took 74 wickets in his glittering ODI career. He played a vital role for England with his unbeaten 84 in the 2019 ODI World Cup against New Zealand and forced the match into a super over before Jofra Archer’s super over helped England lift their maiden ODI World Cup title by ‘the barest of margins’. Jofra Archer was also a hero for England in their successful World Cup campaign in 2019. However, his career has been plagued with injuries as he managed to play only seven games since the World Cup final against New Zealand in 2019. However, the English coach is ready to take a risk, as Archer has been a ‘match-winner’ for the English side. “There is a high chance that we will take a risk on a proven performer that has done it on the world stage,” “We are planning for him to be available. Obviously, a lot of things have to go his way and it will be a tight timeline but with players like that you are going to give them every opportunity to prove their fitness, and so we will keep an open mind.” The England selection committee will also announce ODI and T20I squads to face New Zealand and Ireland in limited-overs series from August 30 to September 26. World champions England will kick off their World Cup campaign in the opening game against 2019 finalists New Zealand on October 5 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.","pubDate":"2023-08-13 17:46:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kohli lauds Babar as ‘the top batsman in the world’","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/kohli-lauds-babar-as-the-top-batsman-in-the-world/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI (Agencies): Former Indian captain Virat Kohli spoke highly of Pakistan’s all-format captain Babar Azam, and termed him “the top batsman in the world”.Virat Kohli shared his first encounter in Manchester with Babar Azam when Imad Wasim introduced Babar to Kohli.“The first interaction I had with him [Babar] was during the 2019 [ODI] World […]","content":"NEW DELHI (Agencies): Former Indian captain Virat Kohli spoke highly of Pakistan’s all-format captain Babar Azam, and termed him “the top batsman in the world”. Virat Kohli shared his first encounter in Manchester with Babar Azam when Imad Wasim introduced Babar to Kohli. “The first interaction I had with him [Babar] was during the 2019 [ODI] World Cup after the game in Manchester. I’ve known Imad [Wasim] since the Under-19 World Cup, and he said Babar wanted to have a chat,” Kohli said. He further talked about the meeting and the friendship they shared since that first meeting. “I saw a lot of regard and respect from him from day one, and that hasn’t changed,” he added. Kohli then termed Babar as the top batter across the globe and claimed that he enjoys watching Babar play. “He is so down to earth character, he will go a long way as a player. He is probably the top batsman right now across all formats. He performs so consistently and I’ve always enjoyed watching him play.” Babar Azam is currently sitting at the top of the ODI batting ranking, the position which was once held by Virat Kohli. Both batters are celebrated across the globe as the best batters of this era. However, despite the comparison and debates regarding who is better, the cricketers always displayed mutual respect for each other. Last year, in July Babar came out in support of Virat with a motivating tweet, “This too shall pass. Stay strong” and received an overwhelming response from the cricket fans. Virat, also responded to Babar’s supportive tweet for him in a challenging phase of his career, while also wishing latter the luck. “Thank you. Keep shining and rising. Wish you all the best,” Virat replied to Babar in his tweet. They will come face to face in the Asia Cup, when Pakistan and India will collide at Kandy on September 2. The Asia Cup is scheduled to treat the fans with as many as three India-Pakistan games if both teams reach the final. The arch-rivals will also feature in the most anticipated clash of the ODI World Cup at Narendra Modi Stadium on October 14.","pubDate":"2023-08-13 17:44:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Red Card In Cricket: ఇకపై క్రికెట్‌లో కొత్త రూల్స్‌, స్లో ఓవర్ రేట్‌కు శిక్షల కోసం రూల్స్‌ మార్పు, రెడ్‌కార్డ్ ప్రవేశపెట్టిన కరీబియన్‌ ప్రీమియర్ లీగ్","link":"https://telugu.latestly.com/sports/cricket/red-card-in-cricket-cpl-introduces-new-rules-to-contain-slow-over-rate-105264.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"క్రికెట్‌లో ఫుట్‌బాల్ త‌ర‌హాలో రెడ్ కార్డ్ (Red card )నిబంధ‌న‌ను తీసుకువ‌స్తున్నారు. ఒక జ‌ట్టు నిర్ణీత స‌మ‌యంలోగా 20వ ఓవ‌ర్‌ను వేయ‌క‌పోతే 11 మంది ఆట‌గాళ్ల‌లోంచి ఒక ప్లేయ‌ర్ మైదానం వీడి వెళ్లాల్సి ఉంటుంది. అంతేకాదు.. స్లో ఓవ‌ర్ రేటు(slow over rate)ను 18 ఓవ‌ర్‌ను నుంచి కౌంట్ చేస్తూ ఆ ఓవ‌ర్ నుంచే శిక్ష‌లు విధించేలా కొత్త రూల్స్‌ను తెస్తున్నారు.","content":"New Delhi, AUG 13: క్రికెట్‌లో ఫుట్‌బాల్ త‌ర‌హాలో రెడ్ కార్డ్ (Red card )నిబంధ‌న‌ను తీసుకువ‌స్తున్నారు. ఒక జ‌ట్టు నిర్ణీత స‌మ‌యంలోగా 20వ ఓవ‌ర్‌ను వేయ‌క‌పోతే 11 మంది ఆట‌గాళ్ల‌లోంచి ఒక ప్లేయ‌ర్ మైదానం వీడి వెళ్లాల్సి ఉంటుంది. అంతేకాదు.. స్లో ఓవ‌ర్ రేటు(slow over rate)ను 18 ఓవ‌ర్‌ను నుంచి కౌంట్ చేస్తూ ఆ ఓవ‌ర్ నుంచే శిక్ష‌లు విధించేలా కొత్త రూల్స్‌ను తెస్తున్నారు. అయితే.. ఇది అంత‌ర్జాతీయ క్రికెట్ కౌన్సిల్ (ICC) తీసుకురాలేదు. కరీబియన్ కరీబియన్ ప్రీమియ‌ర్ లీగ్ (CPL) నిర్వాహ‌కులు తీసుకువ‌చ్చారు. ఆగ‌స్టు 17 నుంచి కరీబియన్ ప్రీమియ‌ర్ లీగ్ కొత్త సీజ‌న్ ప్రారంభం కానుంది. ఈ సీజ‌న్ నుంచి స్లో ఓవ‌ర్‌పై నూత‌న రూల్స్ తీసుకువ‌స్తున్న‌ట్లు CPL యొక్క టోర్నమెంట్ ఆపరేషన్స్ డైరెక్టర్ మైఖేల్ హాల్ తెలిపారు. ప్ర‌తీ సీజ‌న్‌లో మ్యాచ్‌లు ముగిసేందుకు చాలా ఎక్కువ స‌మ‌యం ప‌డుతుండ‌డం ఆందోళ‌న క‌లిగిస్తోంది. స్లో ఓవ‌ర్ రేటును నివారించేందుకు కొత్త నిబంధ‌న‌లు తీసుకువ‌చ్చాము. ఈ సీజ‌న్ నుంచే ఈ రూల్స్ అమ‌లు అవుతాయని చెప్పారు.
