However, there is a pattern. CHENNAI: On Friday night, the BCCI announced the India squads for the Asian Games, where they will be making their debut. While the men’s will be a second-string side, it is the Harmanpreet Kaur-led women’s team that raised eyebrows for the players named and left out. And as is the case often, no explanations were given for the same. In the 48 hours since, India have failed to chase 153 against Bangladesh — their first loss against the hosts in the format — in the rain-curtailed first ODI in Mirpur on Sunday. From the outset, one might wonder about the relation between a T20 squad selection and an ODI performance. However, there is a pattern. The selections, the rotation of players, the roles they have in the playing XI and the tactics. As for selections, in the Asiad squad four players, who were not a part of the Bangladesh tour, have been brought back or called up into the 15, including Rajeshwari Gayakwad who was not a part of the NCA camp as well. And five have been either left out or kept on standby, including the quickest pacer in the squad — Pooja Vastrakar. Renuka Singh and Radha Yadav are injured and Shikha Pandey still seems to be out of favour. For the Bangladesh ODIs, they had picked Priya Punia on Sunday in place of Shafali Verma, one of the few in the squad who can take on spinners on turning tracks. What's more, the other spin-hitter Vastrakar came in to bat at No. 10. Apart from that, India had eleven players who are a key part of their respective domestic batting units. And yet, as they fell short by 40 runs, skipper Kaur said that they gave away 20 extra runs. “We bowled many loose balls and were not up to the mark. Obviously, in the batting department, nobody took responsibility,” she said after the match. As for roles, their T20I No. 3 Jemimah Rodrigues batted at No. 5 for the first time in her career. If her wicket all but ended the hopes on Sunday, in the third T20I, they had collapsed after Kaur got out. Through the T20I series, India had used a lot of part-time spin and on Sunday, they bowled 25 overs (of 43) of spin while Marufa Akter, a genuine pacer, ran through the middle-order to hand them their first defeat of this ODI championship cycle. Perhaps, the only positive from the loss was the performance of debutant Amanjot Kaur who took a four-fer. That being said, the Championship points would seem inconsequential as they qualify as hosts for the next World Cup. India might still come back to claim the series, but this loss should come as a wake-up call as such inconsistencies aren’t going to help when they play England and Australia at home later this year. Nor is it helping to build on the momentum created by the inaugural Women’s Premier League.

Warner’s torrid run with the willow continued during the Third Test at Headingley as he registered a combined five runs across both innings. Stream Over 50 Sports Live & On-Demand with Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > His wretched run against Stuart Broad continued as the English quick collected him on both occasions, making it 17 times in Test cricket he’s claimed his wicket. The dire returns have seen the knives come out in recent times, but they were amplified after England’s win in Leeds. Australian selectors are faced with a daunting task of whether or not to drop Warner, a move that would all but bring an end to his Test career. With all rounder Cameron Green declaring himself fit and ready to go, the only potential hole is Warner’s at the top of the order. Footage from England posted by Cricbuzz journalist Bharat Sundaresan showed the embattled opener in the nets alongside Usman Khawaja and potential replacement Marcus Harris. All three were the only Australian batsmen to face new ball conditions in the nets, further fuelling speculation of Warner’s future. Interesting that David Warner, Marcus Harris and Usman Khawaja were the only batters to face the new ball three days out from the fourth Test. Should seem likely that they stick with the Warner-Khawaja combination on top #Ashes pic.twitter.com/qau8aBnY3e — Bharat Sundaresan (@beastieboy07) July 16, 2023 The video seems to rule out the possibility of Australia thrusting Mitchell Marsh into the opening role alongside Khawaja. Green was touted as a potential man to take the top of the order spot, but his return to the team will more likely than not come in the middle order. Harris said attempting to put a middle order batsman into an opening role would only have a detrimental effect. “I think it depends on the conditions and where you are,” Harris said. “Like you saw in the subcontinent, it is probably the best time so to have someone destructive like Heady, he can open the batting there. “But I think probably in England and Australia, the way the wickets have been the last couple of years and New Zealand, those sort of wickets, it’s more of a specialist position. “And you want your destructive players like Greeny or Mitch or Travis to be coming in against a bit more of an older ball.” Harris added: “My experiences from county cricket (are) if you cop the wrong time of the day to open the batting, especially if you’re a destructive batsman it’s probably not ideal.” It hasn’t been pretty for Warner. (Photo by Ashley Allen/Getty Images) Former Australian Test captain Michael Clarke called time on Warner’s position at the top of the order given his established technical and mental woes against Stuart Broad. “Tell me what must they do now,” Clarke said on Sky Sports Cricket. “The No. 1 issue is you are sticking with Warner, giving him every opportunity, and Broad’s still got his number. Is it time? If it’s time, I wouldn’t even be worried about who opens the batting because you’ve got options. “I reckon Mitch Marsh is in fine form. If he had to do it, he could do it. “Alex Carey probably won’t because he’s got to keep, but Travis Head could do it. Marnus Labuschagne isn’t making as many runs as he should at number three. He could open, Smithy could go to number 3, and Head to number four.” The Fourth Ashes Test gets underway at Old Trafford on July 19 at 8pm AEST.

Followed categories will be added to My News. The AFL will finally release its AFLW fixture on Monday afternoon after coming to an agreement with the playing group on a new 10-week home-and-away season. The Herald Sun understands the upcoming season will start on September 1 after players agreed on a 10-week draw despite demands for 12 weeks or more . The AFLPA agreed to that 10-week season to provide certainty for players and as part of negotiations on how the season length could expand over coming seasons. The Herald Sun revealed last month the league was keen to free the fixture from ongoing pay negotiations so it could expand the season length under growth metrics agreed to by the league and players. Under a rebranding of the AFLW the league is keen to incentivise scoring amid a worrying fall-off in attendances and TV ratings. Ratings are down 70 per cent on the inaugural season and attendances are down 60 per cent after an expansion to 18 teams. AFL clubs had been given draft fixtures that included only their own games for the upcoming season to allow them to plan for home matches. The league is determined to finish the upcoming season in mid-December before cricket starts its Test series, to maximise the exposure for its athletes. But negotiations continue on a pay deal for the men and women, with AFLW players wanting full-time contracts and a 17-game season in future years. More Coverage AFLW anger: ‘It’s as if they’re wanting it to fail’ At one stage Western Bulldogs coach Nathan Burke said players might be prepared to strike to secure a longer season. The four expansion clubs and many AFLW coaches are happy with the 10-week length given there are so many new players in the league after four new teams played their first season.

Mail Sport has learned that Jo Faragher, who was elected to the Essex Board in a vote of members last November, was prevented from representing the county at Twenty20 finals day at Edgbaston on Saturday and has received several emails and text messages from the club's chairman Sir Stephen O'Brien instructing her to quit. Faragher attended Board meetings and was fully involved in the running of the club for five months after being elected until receiving an email from O'Brien at the start of May, in which he asked her to voluntarily stand down. In addition other counties have been asked not to entertain Faragher in their Boardrooms, a ban she only found out about by talking to officials at other clubs. She has also been denied access to Board papers despite being told that Essex are still seeking legal advice over her position. An executive at another county told Mail Sport: 'We were told in no uncertain terms that Joanne was not welcome due to an internal issue at Essex. Essex have been accused of bullying a female director by excluding her from meetings and ordering her to resign 'From what I have been told she has effectively been excluded from all Board matters for the last two months. They clearly want her out and it amounts to bullying. I gather that the situation has affected her quite badly and members of the family are concerned about her health.' O'Brien's justification for seeking to force out Faragher is an alleged conflict of interest as her father, John Faragher, was previously chairman of Essex until being asked to resign for the alleged use of a historic racist phrase two years ago. That matter will feature in the long-awaited report from Katharine Newton KC into the club's culture which is due to be released imminently. O'Brien told Mail Sport that Faragher had simply been asked to stay away from Board meetings and denied access to papers pertaining to her father. Mail Sport understands Jo Faragher received emails instructing her to quit and was prevented from representing Essex at finals day Jo Faragher was already recusing herself from all Board meetings relating to her father however, and is understood to have obtained legal advice stating there is no conflict of interest. Mail Sport has been told that some members of the Essex Board have already seen the full version of the Newton Report, and have suggested that O'Brien's actions are motivated by a desire to keep its contents from Faragher. Mail Sport published extracts from the interim report last month, which was strongly critical of the ECB's handling of allegations of racism at Essex, with Newton concluding that the governing body broke their own governance rules by ordering Essex to sack John Faragher in November 2021. The Newton report was commissioned by Essex later that month and had been completed by the following March, but it has yet to be published 15 months later. Several sources at Essex have raised concerns that the full report will never be made public.

As Stuart Broad's grip on David Warner tightens, batting greats reveal the mental torture of knowing a bowler's got your number Stuart Broad has now dismissed Australia's David Warner 17 times in Test cricket Two more will equal the record, set by Glenn McGrath against Michael Atherton Here, batting greats recall the feeling of knowing a bowler has your number By David Coverdale For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:39, 16 July 2023 e-mail View comments When David Warner trudged towards the Headingley pavilion following his second-innings dismissal in the third Ashes Test, he knowingly raised his bat to the barracking Barmy Army. He may as well have raised a white flag. Stuart Broad had just taken his wicket for the second time in the match, the third time in the series and the 17th time in Test cricket. Warner became a meme that night — his face photoshopped on to Bart Simpson’s body, writing on a chalkboard, ‘Stuart Broad has got me out again’, which even Broad’s father Chris, an ICC match referee, posted before hastily deleting. At Old Trafford on Wednesday, Broad is set to renew his battle with his bunny, knowing two more dismissals would equal the most by any bowler against one batsman. That record is currently held by Australia legend Glenn McGrath, who removed Michael Atherton 19 times. Here, former England captain and Mail Sport columnist NASSER HUSSAIN analyses why Broad has the wood over Warner, while GRAHAM GOOCH, ALLAN LAMB and ALEC STEWART all reveal how it feels when a bowler has the better of you. Stuart Broad has now dismissed David Warner 17 times in Test cricket NASSER HUSSAIN Dismissed by Shane Warne 11 times If you are batting at the top of the order and a bowler has your number, it becomes technical, psychological and repetitive. There is no hiding place. You are always opening the batting, they are always opening the bowling and you are not ‘in’ when they come running in. If it is Stuart Broad versus David Warner again on that first morning at Old Trafford, the crowd will be revved up. Broad to Warner sets the tone for any Test. It is theatre — and that is what Broad absolutely thrives on. He will love it if Warner keeps his place because he loves that battle. No doubt, Warner will be thinking about the fact Broad has got him 17 times. You can see that from his wry smile when he walks off. That is a smile to say, ‘Oh my god, he has got me again’. He is nicknamed the Bull and he is always trying to set the tone and be attacking. Usually if your nemesis is on, you try and see him off. Against Broad, Warner no longer knows whether to stick or twist. I don’t know if we made enough of his first-innings dismissal at Edgbaston. He almost threw himself off his feet. It was ungainly and it showed where he is against Broad mentally. At Headingley, the way Broad got him out in both innings was exactly the same — angling the ball in, nipping it away and getting him caught at second slip. When it starts to become repetitive, it is a worry for the batter. Warner has tried things. He has been batting out of his crease. He started on middle and leg at Edgbaston. He is now batting towards off stump — or even outside off stump. So he has tinkered, but when you are in that slump, it becomes an absolute nightmare. The Australian opener was dismissed cheaply by Broad in both innings during the third Test at Headingley Nasser Hussain fell victim to the late Shane Warne 11 times in his Ashes career As for Broad, he has changed the way he has bowled against Warner over the years. When Ottis Gibson was England’s bowling coach, he convinced Broad to go round the wicket and start pitching it up, which brings in many more modes of dismissal. The other thing is the wobble seam delivery. I was speaking to England batting coach Marcus Trescothick, another left-hander, about that last summer. He said that if they’d had that delivery when he was playing, it would have been a nightmare for him. It’s not like swing. You don’t know which way it’s going. It comes in on the angle, but it can hit that seam and go either way. As a left-hander, you are exposed when it’s doing that because it is challenging both edges of the bat. If Broad takes it away from him, either with seam or swing, that brings in Warner’s outside edge as we saw at Headingley. But if he brings it in and Warner misses on the inside edge, he can be out lbw, as was often the case in the last Ashes series here. Umpires used to be very wary of giving left-handers out from round the wicket. They always felt it either hit you outside the line or was going down the leg side. But with the advances of DRS, they have seen that quite a few bowlers from round the wicket can get it spot on and produce lbws. Match-ups like Broad and Warner are why five-match Test series are the best. Your challenge is there day after day, week after week. It keeps coming at you. Even in between Tests, you are thinking about it. If you have a nemesis, you go in to bat and there will be words. Pat Cummins has now got Joe Root out 11 times and that will be on Root’s mind as well. He does have the comfort of that big hundred against him at Edgbaston. But the great rhythm player that is Root doesn’t quite get his rhythm against Cummins. He gets a bit stuck in his crease. At Lord’s and in the first innings at Headingley, he got out to back-of-the-length deliveries that he could have left on length. Cummins and Josh Hazlewood both bowl that in-between length that Root finds difficult at times. Australia captain Pat Cummins has now got Joe Root 11 times in his career Glenn McGrath holds the record after dismissing Michael Atherton 19 times But he must not go into his shell. He is at his best when he is trying to score and it was noticeable how much busier he was in the second innings at Headingley before he was strangled down the leg side off Cummins again. As a batter, there are always certain bowlers you struggle against more than others. Shane Warne got me out 11 times, more than anyone. When I went out to bat, he would remind me of that. But I used to find Courtney Walsh the most difficult to pick up because of his angles. He used to go wide of the crease, lean away and angle it in. I used to think it was coming in at me and then it would nip away and I would nick it every time. The batter who has got out to the same bowler the most is, of course, Michael Atherton against Glenn McGrath. Ath was technically gifted but a little glitch came into his batting where his bat used to come from gully towards mid-on. Once that glitch came in, he had a problem against great line bowlers like McGrath and Curtly Ambrose. They had metronomic accuracy and if there was any technical failing, they would expose it. In fairness to Ath, England played Australia and West Indies a lot in those days and he was at the top of the order against bowlers who are all-time greats. Still, we have a laugh in the commentary box whenever that graphic of bunnies comes up and Ath holds three of the top five spots. Even his son texted him the other day taking the mick out of him, saying, ‘You’re on that table a lot, Dad’. Ath doesn’t know which is better — for Warner to play and keep getting out to Broad so he goes past him, or for Warner not to play so we don’t keeping putting that table up. Either way, that table is going up! GRAHAM GOOCH Dismissed by Malcolm Marshall 16 times It could have been a few bowlers with me, couldn’t it? But Malcolm is my No 1 fast bowler. He was the best one I ever faced. My top three in order would be: 1. Malcolm Marshall. 2. Dennis Lillee. 3. Wasim Akram. Others will go different ways because everyone has their favourites but Malcolm had the lot. He was quick, swung it both ways with no change of action, was very intelligent and knew exactly what he was doing. He didn’t need the captain to help him much. He had great stamina and could bowl all day. Without parallel if you ask me. The thing is, when you come up against someone who’s got you a lot of times, you can’t think negatively. You have to believe you can get runs against them. I know it’s a bit of kidology but you can’t think, ‘This bloke has got me 10 times’. You have to think about the hundred you scored against him or the runs you’ve made. I can get runs against this guy and I can handle him. I don’t know what David Warner is thinking but you can’t let this sort of thing bother you. You just accept there’s been an issue in the past but put the positive things at the front of your mind. Warner has scored runs against Broad and that’s what he has to remember at Old Trafford. The great Malcolm Marshall dismissed Graham Gooch 16 times in his Test career ALEC STEWART Dismissed by Shane Warne 14 times I probably wasn’t aware of the number of times Warnie had got me out before I packed in playing. The media back then wasn’t what it is now. Now there is more analysis, more statistics. He was a once-in-a-generation cricketer, but walking out to bat, did I think, ‘Oh no, I am facing Shane Warne’? No, not at any stage. Did I know I was in for a challenge? 100 per cent, yes. He had one of the best cricket brains I came across. He worked out a batsman’s strengths and weaknesses and he had the ability to set you up. He bowled me out in Brisbane with his flipper. He says it was one of the best three balls he bowled. The ball he had bowled before was a long hop, which I cut for four. The next ball looked very similar, just a bit straighter. But by the time I realised it was the flipper, my middle stump had been knocked back. He didn’t actually have a lot of variety. He used to say he had a new ball every series. Well, he didn’t. There was always a lot of kidology. But it was his accuracy, control and his big drift. The big thing is, which I was taught from a young age, you have to play the ball and not the man. Is David Warner looking at Stuart Broad or is he looking at the ball? With the media coverage now, today’s players are fully aware of the stats and therefore England will be reminding Warner how fallible he is against Broad. Warne had a penchant for getting England captain's out and also got Alec Stewart 14 times ALLAN LAMB Dismissed by Malcolm Marshall 13 times Malcolm Marshall was the greatest bowler I played against by far. He could bowl as quick as anyone, but he could also swing the ball both ways, hit the seam and he was skiddy. He got me out lbw seven times with his late inswinger, with the ball skidding on. But when I was padding up, I wasn’t thinking, ‘Bloody Malcolm Marshall, I’ve got to be careful’. I just went out and played normally and looked to score runs. Of course, he got me out 13 times but I also got a couple of hundreds against him, so that sort of makes up for it! I always had a challenge against him but he knew it was a challenge to get me out. I think I had the better of him in county cricket and we won a few games. I loved playing against him — you always wanted to have that success. West Indies had four people bowling at 95mph, so where do you hide? I didn’t have the sort of problem that Warner has against Broad. It has to be a mental issue. He gets out in stupid ways. It must be difficult when you get into a situation like that. Thank god, I’ve never been in that situation. Allan Lamb was another who struggled against Marshall in his England career STUART BROAD Dismissed David Warner 17 times The truth is I’ve always found it difficult bowling to Davey, and I still do. By going round the wicket, I’ve tried to minimise the width that he loves outside off stump, but also bowl a fuller length and make him play at 80-85 per cent of deliveries. Despite his excellent record, Stuart Broad still finds it difficult bowling to David Warner In 2019, when I got him seven times, the pitches were very dry after the World Cup, and I used the wobble seam to scoot the ball back towards the stumps. This summer, I’ve bowled more for the outside edge, because the pitches have been a bit fresher in June and July — even if Edgbaston and Lord’s didn’t offer much. You have to be adaptable as a bowler. We’ve played a lot against each other down the years. I think we can both agree I’d rather bowl to him in England, and he’d rather bat against me in Australia. I imagine he’ll play at Old Trafford this week. One of Australia’s greatest strengths is their consistency in selection, and I’m certainly preparing to bowl at him and Usman Khawaja.

In what would be a considerable coup for the broadcaster, the former Sky Sports Soccer Saturday host, who left the station at the end of last season following 25 years in the role, is close to agreeing a deal that would take him onto the nation’s airwaves . It is thought that Stelling’s potential arrival would not impact on Alan Brazil, who would continue to present on Thursdays and Fridays. Award-winning Woods will front ITV ’s coverage of the upcoming women’s World Cup and is rumoured to be in line to replace TNT presenter Jake Humphrey . Meanwhile, Ally McCoist – also of the talkSPORT stable - is to join TNT for the forthcoming season in another significant swoop. It remains to be seen what impact – if any – the move will have on McCoist’s other work with the radio station, Amazon Prime, Sky and ITV. Covering a Champions League match and then being on air early the following morning, for example, may be a tough ask for the Rangers legend.

Insiders have disclosed that terms were agreed around nine days before big-spending Arsenal’s official declaration that they had landed the West Ham midfielder in a £105m record deal. The swoop, which takes the England man across London, is the Gunners’ third of a statement summer, following the arrivals of Chelsea forward Kai Havertz, for a fee that could reach £65m and defender Jurrien Timber from Ajax in a deal that may end up costing £38.6m. Arsenal confirmed the club record £105m signing of Declan Rice from West Ham on Saturday The deal was confirmed the day after the receipt of Premier League television money ECB's highlights software struggles to catch drops England's cricketers are not the only ones missing catches. Eagle-eyed viewers who watched the ECB’s highlights of the first day’s play at Headingley noted that not one of England’s four dropped chances – which included Joe Root shelling Mitchell Marsh on 12 before he went on to make 112 – featured in the 15-minute package. Some wondered if the ECB were attempting to airbrush history but it would appear that not catching is catching. The ECB use automated software to capture highlights and one of the sticking points they currently have is that the technology struggles to pick up drops. Hence the missed opportunities were subsequently missed. Their supplier is currently working on the issue. The ECB's automated software to capture highlights has struggled to pick up dropped catches Bahrain eyed as a base for Saudi-bound players Bahrian is emerging as a potential base for the families of some of those heading to Saudi Arabia. Agenda understands that players and agents are looking into the possibility of situating their relatives and close friends in the neighbouring country thanks in no small part to its more tolerant stance on alcohol. While drunken behaviour in public is against the law, booze is legal in Bahrain, with a number of bars, licensed restaurants and off-licences. That is not the case in Saudi, where booze is off limits, although there have been reports that this stance may be relaxed at certain resorts in the near future. Barnsley's pre-season trouncing exposed by fans Barnsley's decision to hold their friendly against Leeds at Oakwell behind closed doors may have seemed like a good idea, especially when the hosts were trounced 9-1. However, word of the fixture, on the League One club’s practice facility, got out and a group of fans gathered on a hillside overlooking the pitch to take in the one-sided action, before news of the result was broken online. For their visitors and new manager Daniel Farke it was a positive afternoon with club record signing Georginio Rutter netting twice along with a goal from ex-Manchester United winger Dan James. Both are expected to play a key role as the Yorkshire giants look to secure an immediate return to the top flight. Meanwhile, Leeds’s takeover by 49ers Enterprises is set to finally confirmed by the EFL in the near future. Anderson gives up The Open invite ahead of fourth Ashes Test Jimmy Anderson was due to play in The Open Invitational golf tournament on Sunday but gave up his place ahead of a potentially crucial fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. The Lancashire seamer was set to join the likes of Everton keeper Jordan Pickford, boxer Tony Bellew and former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh at the Royal Liverpool. However, with England 2-0 down ahead of their victory at Headingley Anderson, perhaps wisely, decided that his appearance may not be a good look and was replaced by Jermaine Jenas. With the Lancastrian set for a recall at his home venue on Wednesday , it may well have been the right call. Jimmy Anderson gave up his place in The Open Invitational golf tournament on Sunday Anderson was replaced at the event by former footballer turned pundit Jermaine Jenas Former FIFA ref who clashed with George Best dies The FIFA referee Norman Burtenshaw has died at the age of 97. Burtenshaw was known as one of the fittest officials and was no stranger to confrontation, once being attacked by a mob of Millwall supporters. A strict disciplinarian, he also sent off George Best for calling him a ‘clown’ amid an expletive rant during a match at Chelsea. An FA disciplinary hearing later accepted Best’s story that he had actually sworn at team-mate Willie Morgan – which the Manchester United legend would later admit in his autobiography was a version of events that he had made up. Burtenshaw had a newsagents in Great Yarmouth and the following morning was asked by a small boy if he was the man who had sent Best off. Burtenshaw said he had no option, to which the boy replied ‘My dad told me not to come in again’ before departing.

In the first final-ball finish of what has been a thrilling series, Australia denied Nat Sciver-Brunt’s bid to pull off a chase of 283 at Southampton. Watch, Stream & Catch Up with Australia's Home of Cricket on Needing 15 to win off Jess Jonassen’s final over, Sciver-Brunt got the equation down to five runs off one ball before she failed to find the boundary and England finished 7-279. Australia’s spinners were the heroes for the visitors, with Ashleigh Gardner and Alana King both claiming three wickets after Ellyse Perry top-scored with 91. Georgia Wareham’s effort with the bat also proved decisive for Australia, slamming 26 off the final six balls from Lauren Bell to boost the target. The result means even a loss in the final ODI on Tuesday would allow them to keep hold of the Ashes for a fifth straight time with a drawn series. But this success has been far from comfortable for an Australian team that has traditionally been all-conquering. After winning the series-opening Test and first Twenty20, Australia needed only one win from the next five games to keep hold of the Ashes. However, England claimed victory in the next three matches to go into the Southampton clash with the scoreline at 6-6 and with the series on the line. Australia still need victory in Tuesday’s final ODI to claim the series outright, but some pressure is now off after this result. “It’s not a relief,” captain Alyssa Healy insisted. “We still haven’t played our best cricket yet, which is a bit scary at times. “We are obviously really chuffed. We came here to win the Ashes, and we’ve retained them so far. “There is still one game to go, and we’ll be putting our best foot forward. But to know the Ashes are coming back with us is really exciting.” The win keeps Australia’s record of holding every major trophy available to them, having not dropped one since the 2017 World Cup. But at times on Sunday, it looked as if Healy’s team would be pushed all the way to the final match of the series at Taunton on Tuesday. After being sent in, Australia slumped to 2-27 early and were 4-102 before Perry dug them out of a hole alongside Gardner (33) and Annabel Sutherland (50). And at stages in the chase, England were in control. It took a great ball from King to bowl Tammy Beaumont on 60 and with England 2-107 after 21 overs, as the spinner pitched it on leg and hit the top of off. And while King (3-44) and Gardner (3-54) struck again through the middle overs, England appeared on track for victory at 5-201 with 12 overs remaining. It was at that point Gardner stood up, having Amy Jones caught reverse-sweeping on 37 and removing Sophie Ecclestone lbw in the same over. From there, Sciver-Brunt was always fighting up hill. And while her and Sarah Glenn (22no) got the equation down to nine off three balls and seven off two, England’s incredible fightback to try and win back the Ashes was over. “I thought we had it, Nat played an outstanding innings,” England captain Heather Knight said. “It’s been an outstanding series, the best series ever in women’s cricket in my opinion.”","pubDate":"2023-07-16 20:37:36","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-11295279/6eef25c4cf6e7267ab63a1ba3c2136d96b7ab5b3-16x9-x0y0w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India women get reality check after first-ever ODI loss to B’desh","link":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/cricket/2023/jul/17/india-women-get-reality-check-after-first-ever-odi-loss-to-bdesh-2595674.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"From the outset, one might wonder the relation between a T20 squad selection and a ODI performance. However, there is a pattern. CHENNAI: On Friday night, the BCCI announced the India squads for the Asian Games, where they will be making their debut. While the men’s will be a second-string side, it is the Harmanpreet Kaur-led women’s team that raised eyebrows for the players named and left out. And as is the case often, no explanations were given for the same. In the 48 hours since, India have failed to chase 153 against Bangladesh — their first loss against the hosts in the format — in the rain-curtailed first ODI in Mirpur on Sunday. From the outset, one might wonder about the relation between a T20 squad selection and an ODI performance. However, there is a pattern. The selections, the rotation of players, the roles they have in the playing XI and the tactics. As for selections, in the Asiad squad four players, who were not a part of the Bangladesh tour, have been brought back or called up into the 15, including Rajeshwari Gayakwad who was not a part of the NCA camp as well. And five have been either left out or kept on standby, including the quickest pacer in the squad — Pooja Vastrakar. Renuka Singh and Radha Yadav are injured and Shikha Pandey still seems to be out of favour. For the Bangladesh ODIs, they had picked Priya Punia on Sunday in place of Shafali Verma, one of the few in the squad who can take on spinners on turning tracks. What's more, the other spin-hitter Vastrakar came in to bat at No. 10. Apart from that, India had eleven players who are a key part of their respective domestic batting units. And yet, as they fell short by 40 runs, skipper Kaur said that they gave away 20 extra runs. “We bowled many loose balls and were not up to the mark. Obviously, in the batting department, nobody took responsibility,” she said after the match. As for roles, their T20I No. 3 Jemimah Rodrigues batted at No. 5 for the first time in her career. If her wicket all but ended the hopes on Sunday, in the third T20I, they had collapsed after Kaur got out. Through the T20I series, India had used a lot of part-time spin and on Sunday, they bowled 25 overs (of 43) of spin while Marufa Akter, a genuine pacer, ran through the middle-order to hand them their first defeat of this ODI championship cycle. Perhaps, the only positive from the loss was the performance of debutant Amanjot Kaur who took a four-fer. That being said, the Championship points would seem inconsequential as they qualify as hosts for the next World Cup. India might still come back to claim the series, but this loss should come as a wake-up call as such inconsistencies aren’t going to help when they play England and Australia at home later this year. Nor is it helping to build on the momentum created by the inaugural Women’s Premier League. Brief scores: Bangladesh 152/9 in 43 ovs (Nigar 39; Amanjot 4/31) bt India 113 all out in 35.5 ovs (Deepti 20; Marufa 4/29) DLS method.","content":"CHENNAI: On Friday night, the BCCI announced the India squads for the Asian Games, where they will be making their debut.

Obviously, in the batting department, nobody took responsibility,” she said after the match. As for roles, their T20I No. 3 Jemimah Rodrigues batted at No. 5 for the first time in her career. If her wicket all but ended the hopes on Sunday, in the third T20I, they had collapsed after Kaur got out. Through the T20I series, India had used a lot of part-time spin and on Sunday, they bowled 25 overs (of 43) of spin while Marufa Akter, a genuine pacer, ran through the middle-order to hand them their first defeat of this ODI championship cycle. Perhaps, the only positive from the loss was the performance of debutant Amanjot Kaur who took a four-fer. That being said, the Championship points would seem inconsequential as they qualify as hosts for the next World Cup. India might still come back to claim the series, but this loss should come as a wake-up call as such inconsistencies aren’t going to help when they play England and Australia at home later this year. Nor is it helping to build on the momentum created by the inaugural Women’s Premier League.","pubDate":"2023-07-17 02:13:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"newindianexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Footage pours fuel on Warner speculation","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/david-warner-footage-provides-major-clue-ahead-of-fourth-ashes-test/news-story/30190adecc01ea9a00a6f5569c584596","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"David Warner’s place in the Australian side remains a hot topic of conversation as the fourth Ashes Test draws closer.","content":"Cricket Don't miss out on the headlines from Cricket.

Warner’s torrid run with the willow continued during the Third Test at Headingley as he registered a combined five runs across both innings. Stream Over 50 Sports Live & On-Demand with Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > His wretched run against Stuart Broad continued as the English quick collected him on both occasions, making it 17 times in Test cricket he’s claimed his wicket. The dire returns have seen the knives come out in recent times, but they were amplified after England’s win in Leeds. Australian selectors are faced with a daunting task of whether or not to drop Warner, a move that would all but bring an end to his Test career. With all rounder Cameron Green declaring himself fit and ready to go, the only potential hole is Warner’s at the top of the order. Footage from England posted by Cricbuzz journalist Bharat Sundaresan showed the embattled opener in the nets alongside Usman Khawaja and potential replacement Marcus Harris. All three were the only Australian batsmen to face new ball conditions in the nets, further fuelling speculation of Warner’s future. Interesting that David Warner, Marcus Harris and Usman Khawaja were the only batters to face the new ball three days out from the fourth Test. Should seem likely that they stick with the Warner-Khawaja combination on top #Ashes pic.twitter.com/qau8aBnY3e — Bharat Sundaresan (@beastieboy07) July 16, 2023 The video seems to rule out the possibility of Australia thrusting Mitchell Marsh into the opening role alongside Khawaja. Green was touted as a potential man to take the top of the order spot, but his return to the team will more likely than not come in the middle order. Harris said attempting to put a middle order batsman into an opening role would only have a detrimental effect. “I think it depends on the conditions and where you are,” Harris said. “Like you saw in the subcontinent, it is probably the best time so to have someone destructive like Heady, he can open the batting there. “But I think probably in England and Australia, the way the wickets have been the last couple of years and New Zealand, those sort of wickets, it’s more of a specialist position. “And you want your destructive players like Greeny or Mitch or Travis to be coming in against a bit more of an older ball.” Harris added: “My experiences from county cricket (are) if you cop the wrong time of the day to open the batting, especially if you’re a destructive batsman it’s probably not ideal.” It hasn’t been pretty for Warner. (Photo by Ashley Allen/Getty Images) Former Australian Test captain Michael Clarke called time on Warner’s position at the top of the order given his established technical and mental woes against Stuart Broad. “Tell me what must they do now,” Clarke said on Sky Sports Cricket. “The No. 1 issue is you are sticking with Warner, giving him every opportunity, and Broad’s still got his number. Is it time? If it’s time, I wouldn’t even be worried about who opens the batting because you’ve got options. “I reckon Mitch Marsh is in fine form. If he had to do it, he could do it. “Alex Carey probably won’t because he’s got to keep, but Travis Head could do it. Marnus Labuschagne isn’t making as many runs as he should at number three. He could open, Smithy could go to number 3, and Head to number four.” The Fourth Ashes Test gets underway at Old Trafford on July 19 at 8pm AEST.

Followed categories will be added to My News. The AFL will finally release its AFLW fixture on Monday afternoon after coming to an agreement with the playing group on a new 10-week home-and-away season. The Herald Sun understands the upcoming season will start on September 1 after players agreed on a 10-week draw despite demands for 12 weeks or more . The AFLPA agreed to that 10-week season to provide certainty for players and as part of negotiations on how the season length could expand over coming seasons. The Herald Sun revealed last month the league was keen to free the fixture from ongoing pay negotiations so it could expand the season length under growth metrics agreed to by the league and players. Under a rebranding of the AFLW the league is keen to incentivise scoring amid a worrying fall-off in attendances and TV ratings. Ratings are down 70 per cent on the inaugural season and attendances are down 60 per cent after an expansion to 18 teams. AFL clubs had been given draft fixtures that included only their own games for the upcoming season to allow them to plan for home matches. The league is determined to finish the upcoming season in mid-December before cricket starts its Test series, to maximise the exposure for its athletes. But negotiations continue on a pay deal for the men and women, with AFLW players wanting full-time contracts and a 17-game season in future years. More Coverage AFLW anger: ‘It’s as if they’re wanting it to fail’ At one stage Western Bulldogs coach Nathan Burke said players might be prepared to strike to secure a longer season. The four expansion clubs and many AFLW coaches are happy with the 10-week length given there are so many new players in the league after four new teams played their first season.

Mail Sport has learned that Jo Faragher, who was elected to the Essex Board in a vote of members last November, was prevented from representing the county at Twenty20 finals day at Edgbaston on Saturday and has received several emails and text messages from the club's chairman Sir Stephen O'Brien instructing her to quit. Faragher attended Board meetings and was fully involved in the running of the club for five months after being elected until receiving an email from O'Brien at the start of May, in which he asked her to voluntarily stand down. In addition other counties have been asked not to entertain Faragher in their Boardrooms, a ban she only found out about by talking to officials at other clubs. She has also been denied access to Board papers despite being told that Essex are still seeking legal advice over her position. An executive at another county told Mail Sport: 'We were told in no uncertain terms that Joanne was not welcome due to an internal issue at Essex. Essex have been accused of bullying a female director by excluding her from meetings and ordering her to resign 'From what I have been told she has effectively been excluded from all Board matters for the last two months. They clearly want her out and it amounts to bullying. I gather that the situation has affected her quite badly and members of the family are concerned about her health.' O'Brien's justification for seeking to force out Faragher is an alleged conflict of interest as her father, John Faragher, was previously chairman of Essex until being asked to resign for the alleged use of a historic racist phrase two years ago. That matter will feature in the long-awaited report from Katharine Newton KC into the club's culture which is due to be released imminently. O'Brien told Mail Sport that Faragher had simply been asked to stay away from Board meetings and denied access to papers pertaining to her father. Mail Sport understands Jo Faragher received emails instructing her to quit and was prevented from representing Essex at finals day Jo Faragher was already recusing herself from all Board meetings relating to her father however, and is understood to have obtained legal advice stating there is no conflict of interest. Mail Sport has been told that some members of the Essex Board have already seen the full version of the Newton Report, and have suggested that O'Brien's actions are motivated by a desire to keep its contents from Faragher. Mail Sport published extracts from the interim report last month, which was strongly critical of the ECB's handling of allegations of racism at Essex, with Newton concluding that the governing body broke their own governance rules by ordering Essex to sack John Faragher in November 2021. The Newton report was commissioned by Essex later that month and had been completed by the following March, but it has yet to be published 15 months later. Several sources at Essex have raised concerns that the full report will never be made public.

As Stuart Broad's grip on David Warner tightens, batting greats reveal the mental torture of knowing a bowler's got your number Stuart Broad has now dismissed Australia's David Warner 17 times in Test cricket Two more will equal the record, set by Glenn McGrath against Michael Atherton Here, batting greats recall the feeling of knowing a bowler has your number By David Coverdale For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:39, 16 July 2023 e-mail View comments When David Warner trudged towards the Headingley pavilion following his second-innings dismissal in the third Ashes Test, he knowingly raised his bat to the barracking Barmy Army. He may as well have raised a white flag. Stuart Broad had just taken his wicket for the second time in the match, the third time in the series and the 17th time in Test cricket. Warner became a meme that night — his face photoshopped on to Bart Simpson’s body, writing on a chalkboard, ‘Stuart Broad has got me out again’, which even Broad’s father Chris, an ICC match referee, posted before hastily deleting. At Old Trafford on Wednesday, Broad is set to renew his battle with his bunny, knowing two more dismissals would equal the most by any bowler against one batsman. That record is currently held by Australia legend Glenn McGrath, who removed Michael Atherton 19 times. Here, former England captain and Mail Sport columnist NASSER HUSSAIN analyses why Broad has the wood over Warner, while GRAHAM GOOCH, ALLAN LAMB and ALEC STEWART all reveal how it feels when a bowler has the better of you. Stuart Broad has now dismissed David Warner 17 times in Test cricket NASSER HUSSAIN Dismissed by Shane Warne 11 times If you are batting at the top of the order and a bowler has your number, it becomes technical, psychological and repetitive. There is no hiding place. You are always opening the batting, they are always opening the bowling and you are not ‘in’ when they come running in. If it is Stuart Broad versus David Warner again on that first morning at Old Trafford, the crowd will be revved up. Broad to Warner sets the tone for any Test. It is theatre — and that is what Broad absolutely thrives on. He will love it if Warner keeps his place because he loves that battle. No doubt, Warner will be thinking about the fact Broad has got him 17 times. You can see that from his wry smile when he walks off. That is a smile to say, ‘Oh my god, he has got me again’. He is nicknamed the Bull and he is always trying to set the tone and be attacking. Usually if your nemesis is on, you try and see him off. Against Broad, Warner no longer knows whether to stick or twist. I don’t know if we made enough of his first-innings dismissal at Edgbaston. He almost threw himself off his feet. It was ungainly and it showed where he is against Broad mentally. At Headingley, the way Broad got him out in both innings was exactly the same — angling the ball in, nipping it away and getting him caught at second slip. When it starts to become repetitive, it is a worry for the batter. Warner has tried things. He has been batting out of his crease. He started on middle and leg at Edgbaston. He is now batting towards off stump — or even outside off stump. So he has tinkered, but when you are in that slump, it becomes an absolute nightmare. The Australian opener was dismissed cheaply by Broad in both innings during the third Test at Headingley Nasser Hussain fell victim to the late Shane Warne 11 times in his Ashes career As for Broad, he has changed the way he has bowled against Warner over the years. When Ottis Gibson was England’s bowling coach, he convinced Broad to go round the wicket and start pitching it up, which brings in many more modes of dismissal. The other thing is the wobble seam delivery. I was speaking to England batting coach Marcus Trescothick, another left-hander, about that last summer. He said that if they’d had that delivery when he was playing, it would have been a nightmare for him. It’s not like swing. You don’t know which way it’s going. It comes in on the angle, but it can hit that seam and go either way. As a left-hander, you are exposed when it’s doing that because it is challenging both edges of the bat. If Broad takes it away from him, either with seam or swing, that brings in Warner’s outside edge as we saw at Headingley. But if he brings it in and Warner misses on the inside edge, he can be out lbw, as was often the case in the last Ashes series here. Umpires used to be very wary of giving left-handers out from round the wicket. They always felt it either hit you outside the line or was going down the leg side. But with the advances of DRS, they have seen that quite a few bowlers from round the wicket can get it spot on and produce lbws. Match-ups like Broad and Warner are why five-match Test series are the best. Your challenge is there day after day, week after week. It keeps coming at you. Even in between Tests, you are thinking about it. If you have a nemesis, you go in to bat and there will be words. Pat Cummins has now got Joe Root out 11 times and that will be on Root’s mind as well. He does have the comfort of that big hundred against him at Edgbaston. But the great rhythm player that is Root doesn’t quite get his rhythm against Cummins. He gets a bit stuck in his crease. At Lord’s and in the first innings at Headingley, he got out to back-of-the-length deliveries that he could have left on length. Cummins and Josh Hazlewood both bowl that in-between length that Root finds difficult at times. Australia captain Pat Cummins has now got Joe Root 11 times in his career Glenn McGrath holds the record after dismissing Michael Atherton 19 times But he must not go into his shell. He is at his best when he is trying to score and it was noticeable how much busier he was in the second innings at Headingley before he was strangled down the leg side off Cummins again. As a batter, there are always certain bowlers you struggle against more than others. Shane Warne got me out 11 times, more than anyone. When I went out to bat, he would remind me of that. But I used to find Courtney Walsh the most difficult to pick up because of his angles. He used to go wide of the crease, lean away and angle it in. I used to think it was coming in at me and then it would nip away and I would nick it every time. The batter who has got out to the same bowler the most is, of course, Michael Atherton against Glenn McGrath. Ath was technically gifted but a little glitch came into his batting where his bat used to come from gully towards mid-on. Once that glitch came in, he had a problem against great line bowlers like McGrath and Curtly Ambrose. They had metronomic accuracy and if there was any technical failing, they would expose it. In fairness to Ath, England played Australia and West Indies a lot in those days and he was at the top of the order against bowlers who are all-time greats. Still, we have a laugh in the commentary box whenever that graphic of bunnies comes up and Ath holds three of the top five spots. Even his son texted him the other day taking the mick out of him, saying, ‘You’re on that table a lot, Dad’. Ath doesn’t know which is better — for Warner to play and keep getting out to Broad so he goes past him, or for Warner not to play so we don’t keeping putting that table up. Either way, that table is going up! GRAHAM GOOCH Dismissed by Malcolm Marshall 16 times It could have been a few bowlers with me, couldn’t it? But Malcolm is my No 1 fast bowler. He was the best one I ever faced. My top three in order would be: 1. Malcolm Marshall. 2. Dennis Lillee. 3. Wasim Akram. Others will go different ways because everyone has their favourites but Malcolm had the lot. He was quick, swung it both ways with no change of action, was very intelligent and knew exactly what he was doing. He didn’t need the captain to help him much. He had great stamina and could bowl all day. Without parallel if you ask me. The thing is, when you come up against someone who’s got you a lot of times, you can’t think negatively. You have to believe you can get runs against them. I know it’s a bit of kidology but you can’t think, ‘This bloke has got me 10 times’. You have to think about the hundred you scored against him or the runs you’ve made. I can get runs against this guy and I can handle him. I don’t know what David Warner is thinking but you can’t let this sort of thing bother you. You just accept there’s been an issue in the past but put the positive things at the front of your mind. Warner has scored runs against Broad and that’s what he has to remember at Old Trafford. The great Malcolm Marshall dismissed Graham Gooch 16 times in his Test career ALEC STEWART Dismissed by Shane Warne 14 times I probably wasn’t aware of the number of times Warnie had got me out before I packed in playing. The media back then wasn’t what it is now. Now there is more analysis, more statistics. He was a once-in-a-generation cricketer, but walking out to bat, did I think, ‘Oh no, I am facing Shane Warne’? No, not at any stage. Did I know I was in for a challenge? 100 per cent, yes. He had one of the best cricket brains I came across. He worked out a batsman’s strengths and weaknesses and he had the ability to set you up. He bowled me out in Brisbane with his flipper. He says it was one of the best three balls he bowled. The ball he had bowled before was a long hop, which I cut for four. The next ball looked very similar, just a bit straighter. But by the time I realised it was the flipper, my middle stump had been knocked back. He didn’t actually have a lot of variety. He used to say he had a new ball every series. Well, he didn’t. There was always a lot of kidology. But it was his accuracy, control and his big drift. The big thing is, which I was taught from a young age, you have to play the ball and not the man. Is David Warner looking at Stuart Broad or is he looking at the ball? With the media coverage now, today’s players are fully aware of the stats and therefore England will be reminding Warner how fallible he is against Broad. Warne had a penchant for getting England captain's out and also got Alec Stewart 14 times ALLAN LAMB Dismissed by Malcolm Marshall 13 times Malcolm Marshall was the greatest bowler I played against by far. He could bowl as quick as anyone, but he could also swing the ball both ways, hit the seam and he was skiddy. He got me out lbw seven times with his late inswinger, with the ball skidding on. But when I was padding up, I wasn’t thinking, ‘Bloody Malcolm Marshall, I’ve got to be careful’. I just went out and played normally and looked to score runs. Of course, he got me out 13 times but I also got a couple of hundreds against him, so that sort of makes up for it! I always had a challenge against him but he knew it was a challenge to get me out. I think I had the better of him in county cricket and we won a few games. I loved playing against him — you always wanted to have that success. West Indies had four people bowling at 95mph, so where do you hide? I didn’t have the sort of problem that Warner has against Broad. It has to be a mental issue. He gets out in stupid ways. It must be difficult when you get into a situation like that. Thank god, I’ve never been in that situation. Allan Lamb was another who struggled against Marshall in his England career STUART BROAD Dismissed David Warner 17 times The truth is I’ve always found it difficult bowling to Davey, and I still do. By going round the wicket, I’ve tried to minimise the width that he loves outside off stump, but also bowl a fuller length and make him play at 80-85 per cent of deliveries. Despite his excellent record, Stuart Broad still finds it difficult bowling to David Warner In 2019, when I got him seven times, the pitches were very dry after the World Cup, and I used the wobble seam to scoot the ball back towards the stumps. This summer, I’ve bowled more for the outside edge, because the pitches have been a bit fresher in June and July — even if Edgbaston and Lord’s didn’t offer much. You have to be adaptable as a bowler. We’ve played a lot against each other down the years. I think we can both agree I’d rather bowl to him in England, and he’d rather bat against me in Australia. I imagine he’ll play at Old Trafford this week. One of Australia’s greatest strengths is their consistency in selection, and I’m certainly preparing to bowl at him and Usman Khawaja.

In what would be a considerable coup for the broadcaster, the former Sky Sports Soccer Saturday host, who left the station at the end of last season following 25 years in the role, is close to agreeing a deal that would take him onto the nation’s airwaves . It is thought that Stelling’s potential arrival would not impact on Alan Brazil, who would continue to present on Thursdays and Fridays. Award-winning Woods will front ITV ’s coverage of the upcoming women’s World Cup and is rumoured to be in line to replace TNT presenter Jake Humphrey . Meanwhile, Ally McCoist – also of the talkSPORT stable - is to join TNT for the forthcoming season in another significant swoop. It remains to be seen what impact – if any – the move will have on McCoist’s other work with the radio station, Amazon Prime, Sky and ITV. Covering a Champions League match and then being on air early the following morning, for example, may be a tough ask for the Rangers legend.

Insiders have disclosed that terms were agreed around nine days before big-spending Arsenal’s official declaration that they had landed the West Ham midfielder in a £105m record deal. The swoop, which takes the England man across London, is the Gunners’ third of a statement summer, following the arrivals of Chelsea forward Kai Havertz, for a fee that could reach £65m and defender Jurrien Timber from Ajax in a deal that may end up costing £38.6m. Arsenal confirmed the club record £105m signing of Declan Rice from West Ham on Saturday The deal was confirmed the day after the receipt of Premier League television money ECB's highlights software struggles to catch drops England's cricketers are not the only ones missing catches. Eagle-eyed viewers who watched the ECB’s highlights of the first day’s play at Headingley noted that not one of England’s four dropped chances – which included Joe Root shelling Mitchell Marsh on 12 before he went on to make 112 – featured in the 15-minute package. Some wondered if the ECB were attempting to airbrush history but it would appear that not catching is catching. The ECB use automated software to capture highlights and one of the sticking points they currently have is that the technology struggles to pick up drops. Hence the missed opportunities were subsequently missed. Their supplier is currently working on the issue. The ECB's automated software to capture highlights has struggled to pick up dropped catches Bahrain eyed as a base for Saudi-bound players Bahrian is emerging as a potential base for the families of some of those heading to Saudi Arabia. Agenda understands that players and agents are looking into the possibility of situating their relatives and close friends in the neighbouring country thanks in no small part to its more tolerant stance on alcohol. While drunken behaviour in public is against the law, booze is legal in Bahrain, with a number of bars, licensed restaurants and off-licences. That is not the case in Saudi, where booze is off limits, although there have been reports that this stance may be relaxed at certain resorts in the near future. Barnsley's pre-season trouncing exposed by fans Barnsley's decision to hold their friendly against Leeds at Oakwell behind closed doors may have seemed like a good idea, especially when the hosts were trounced 9-1. However, word of the fixture, on the League One club’s practice facility, got out and a group of fans gathered on a hillside overlooking the pitch to take in the one-sided action, before news of the result was broken online. For their visitors and new manager Daniel Farke it was a positive afternoon with club record signing Georginio Rutter netting twice along with a goal from ex-Manchester United winger Dan James. Both are expected to play a key role as the Yorkshire giants look to secure an immediate return to the top flight. Meanwhile, Leeds’s takeover by 49ers Enterprises is set to finally confirmed by the EFL in the near future. Anderson gives up The Open invite ahead of fourth Ashes Test Jimmy Anderson was due to play in The Open Invitational golf tournament on Sunday but gave up his place ahead of a potentially crucial fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. The Lancashire seamer was set to join the likes of Everton keeper Jordan Pickford, boxer Tony Bellew and former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh at the Royal Liverpool. However, with England 2-0 down ahead of their victory at Headingley Anderson, perhaps wisely, decided that his appearance may not be a good look and was replaced by Jermaine Jenas. With the Lancastrian set for a recall at his home venue on Wednesday , it may well have been the right call. Jimmy Anderson gave up his place in The Open Invitational golf tournament on Sunday Anderson was replaced at the event by former footballer turned pundit Jermaine Jenas Former FIFA ref who clashed with George Best dies The FIFA referee Norman Burtenshaw has died at the age of 97. Burtenshaw was known as one of the fittest officials and was no stranger to confrontation, once being attacked by a mob of Millwall supporters. A strict disciplinarian, he also sent off George Best for calling him a ‘clown’ amid an expletive rant during a match at Chelsea. An FA disciplinary hearing later accepted Best’s story that he had actually sworn at team-mate Willie Morgan – which the Manchester United legend would later admit in his autobiography was a version of events that he had made up. Burtenshaw had a newsagents in Great Yarmouth and the following morning was asked by a small boy if he was the man who had sent Best off. Burtenshaw said he had no option, to which the boy replied ‘My dad told me not to come in again’ before departing.

In the first final-ball finish of what has been a thrilling series, Australia denied Nat Sciver-Brunt’s bid to pull off a chase of 283 at Southampton. Watch, Stream & Catch Up with Australia's Home of Cricket on Needing 15 to win off Jess Jonassen’s final over, Sciver-Brunt got the equation down to five runs off one ball before she failed to find the boundary and England finished 7-279. Australia’s spinners were the heroes for the visitors, with Ashleigh Gardner and Alana King both claiming three wickets after Ellyse Perry top-scored with 91. Georgia Wareham’s effort with the bat also proved decisive for Australia, slamming 26 off the final six balls from Lauren Bell to boost the target. The result means even a loss in the final ODI on Tuesday would allow them to keep hold of the Ashes for a fifth straight time with a drawn series. But this success has been far from comfortable for an Australian team that has traditionally been all-conquering. After winning the series-opening Test and first Twenty20, Australia needed only one win from the next five games to keep hold of the Ashes. However, England claimed victory in the next three matches to go into the Southampton clash with the scoreline at 6-6 and with the series on the line. Australia still need victory in Tuesday’s final ODI to claim the series outright, but some pressure is now off after this result. “It’s not a relief,” captain Alyssa Healy insisted. “We still haven’t played our best cricket yet, which is a bit scary at times. “We are obviously really chuffed. We came here to win the Ashes, and we’ve retained them so far. “There is still one game to go, and we’ll be putting our best foot forward. But to know the Ashes are coming back with us is really exciting.” The win keeps Australia’s record of holding every major trophy available to them, having not dropped one since the 2017 World Cup. But at times on Sunday, it looked as if Healy’s team would be pushed all the way to the final match of the series at Taunton on Tuesday. After being sent in, Australia slumped to 2-27 early and were 4-102 before Perry dug them out of a hole alongside Gardner (33) and Annabel Sutherland (50). And at stages in the chase, England were in control. It took a great ball from King to bowl Tammy Beaumont on 60 and with England 2-107 after 21 overs, as the spinner pitched it on leg and hit the top of off. And while King (3-44) and Gardner (3-54) struck again through the middle overs, England appeared on track for victory at 5-201 with 12 overs remaining. It was at that point Gardner stood up, having Amy Jones caught reverse-sweeping on 37 and removing Sophie Ecclestone lbw in the same over. From there, Sciver-Brunt was always fighting up hill. And while her and Sarah Glenn (22no) got the equation down to nine off three balls and seven off two, England’s incredible fightback to try and win back the Ashes was over. “I thought we had it, Nat played an outstanding innings,” England captain Heather Knight said. “It’s been an outstanding series, the best series ever in women’s cricket in my opinion.”","pubDate":"2023-07-16 20:37:36","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-11295279/6eef25c4cf6e7267ab63a1ba3c2136d96b7ab5b3-16x9-x0y0w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India women get reality check after first-ever ODI loss to B’desh","link":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/cricket/2023/jul/17/india-women-get-reality-check-after-first-ever-odi-loss-to-bdesh-2595674.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"From the outset, one might wonder the relation between a T20 squad selection and a ODI performance.

Through the T20I series, India had used a lot of part-time spin and on Sunday, they bowled 25 overs (of 43) of spin while Marufa Akter, a genuine pacer, ran through the middle-order to hand them their first defeat of this ODI championship cycle. Perhaps, the only positive from the loss was the performance of debutant Amanjot Kaur who took a four-fer.

New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > His wretched run against Stuart Broad continued as the English quick collected him on both occasions, making it 17 times in Test cricket he’s claimed his wicket. The dire returns have seen the knives come out in recent times, but they were amplified after England’s win in Leeds. Australian selectors are faced with a daunting task of whether or not to drop Warner, a move that would all but bring an end to his Test career. With all rounder Cameron Green declaring himself fit and ready to go, the only potential hole is Warner’s at the top of the order. Footage from England posted by Cricbuzz journalist Bharat Sundaresan showed the embattled opener in the nets alongside Usman Khawaja and potential replacement Marcus Harris. All three were the only Australian batsmen to face new ball conditions in the nets, further fuelling speculation of Warner’s future. Interesting that David Warner, Marcus Harris and Usman Khawaja were the only batters to face the new ball three days out from the fourth Test. Should seem likely that they stick with the Warner-Khawaja combination on top #Ashes pic.twitter.com/qau8aBnY3e — Bharat Sundaresan (@beastieboy07) July 16, 2023 The video seems to rule out the possibility of Australia thrusting Mitchell Marsh into the opening role alongside Khawaja. Green was touted as a potential man to take the top of the order spot, but his return to the team will more likely than not come in the middle order. Harris said attempting to put a middle order batsman into an opening role would only have a detrimental effect. “I think it depends on the conditions and where you are,” Harris said. “Like you saw in the subcontinent, it is probably the best time so to have someone destructive like Heady, he can open the batting there. “But I think probably in England and Australia, the way the wickets have been the last couple of years and New Zealand, those sort of wickets, it’s more of a specialist position. “And you want your destructive players like Greeny or Mitch or Travis to be coming in against a bit more of an older ball.” Harris added: “My experiences from county cricket (are) if you cop the wrong time of the day to open the batting, especially if you’re a destructive batsman it’s probably not ideal.” It hasn’t been pretty for Warner. (Photo by Ashley Allen/Getty Images) Former Australian Test captain Michael Clarke called time on Warner’s position at the top of the order given his established technical and mental woes against Stuart Broad. “Tell me what must they do now,” Clarke said on Sky Sports Cricket. “The No. 1 issue is you are sticking with Warner, giving him every opportunity, and Broad’s still got his number. Is it time? If it’s time, I wouldn’t even be worried about who opens the batting because you’ve got options. “I reckon Mitch Marsh is in fine form. If he had to do it, he could do it. “Alex Carey probably won’t because he’s got to keep, but Travis Head could do it. Marnus Labuschagne isn’t making as many runs as he should at number three. He could open, Smithy could go to number 3, and Head to number four.” The Fourth Ashes Test gets underway at Old Trafford on July 19 at 8pm AEST.

Followed categories will be added to My News. The AFL will finally release its AFLW fixture on Monday afternoon after coming to an agreement with the playing group on a new 10-week home-and-away season. The Herald Sun understands the upcoming season will start on September 1 after players agreed on a 10-week draw despite demands for 12 weeks or more . The AFLPA agreed to that 10-week season to provide certainty for players and as part of negotiations on how the season length could expand over coming seasons. The Herald Sun revealed last month the league was keen to free the fixture from ongoing pay negotiations so it could expand the season length under growth metrics agreed to by the league and players. Under a rebranding of the AFLW the league is keen to incentivise scoring amid a worrying fall-off in attendances and TV ratings. Ratings are down 70 per cent on the inaugural season and attendances are down 60 per cent after an expansion to 18 teams. AFL clubs had been given draft fixtures that included only their own games for the upcoming season to allow them to plan for home matches. The league is determined to finish the upcoming season in mid-December before cricket starts its Test series, to maximise the exposure for its athletes. But negotiations continue on a pay deal for the men and women, with AFLW players wanting full-time contracts and a 17-game season in future years. More Coverage AFLW anger: ‘It’s as if they’re wanting it to fail’ At one stage Western Bulldogs coach Nathan Burke said players might be prepared to strike to secure a longer season. The four expansion clubs and many AFLW coaches are happy with the 10-week length given there are so many new players in the league after four new teams played their first season.

Mail Sport has learned that Jo Faragher, who was elected to the Essex Board in a vote of members last November, was prevented from representing the county at Twenty20 finals day at Edgbaston on Saturday and has received several emails and text messages from the club's chairman Sir Stephen O'Brien instructing her to quit. Faragher attended Board meetings and was fully involved in the running of the club for five months after being elected until receiving an email from O'Brien at the start of May, in which he asked her to voluntarily stand down. In addition other counties have been asked not to entertain Faragher in their Boardrooms, a ban she only found out about by talking to officials at other clubs. She has also been denied access to Board papers despite being told that Essex are still seeking legal advice over her position. An executive at another county told Mail Sport: 'We were told in no uncertain terms that Joanne was not welcome due to an internal issue at Essex. Essex have been accused of bullying a female director by excluding her from meetings and ordering her to resign 'From what I have been told she has effectively been excluded from all Board matters for the last two months. They clearly want her out and it amounts to bullying. I gather that the situation has affected her quite badly and members of the family are concerned about her health.' O'Brien's justification for seeking to force out Faragher is an alleged conflict of interest as her father, John Faragher, was previously chairman of Essex until being asked to resign for the alleged use of a historic racist phrase two years ago. That matter will feature in the long-awaited report from Katharine Newton KC into the club's culture which is due to be released imminently. O'Brien told Mail Sport that Faragher had simply been asked to stay away from Board meetings and denied access to papers pertaining to her father. Mail Sport understands Jo Faragher received emails instructing her to quit and was prevented from representing Essex at finals day Jo Faragher was already recusing herself from all Board meetings relating to her father however, and is understood to have obtained legal advice stating there is no conflict of interest. Mail Sport has been told that some members of the Essex Board have already seen the full version of the Newton Report, and have suggested that O'Brien's actions are motivated by a desire to keep its contents from Faragher. Mail Sport published extracts from the interim report last month, which was strongly critical of the ECB's handling of allegations of racism at Essex, with Newton concluding that the governing body broke their own governance rules by ordering Essex to sack John Faragher in November 2021. The Newton report was commissioned by Essex later that month and had been completed by the following March, but it has yet to be published 15 months later. Several sources at Essex have raised concerns that the full report will never be made public.

As Stuart Broad's grip on David Warner tightens, batting greats reveal the mental torture of knowing a bowler's got your number Stuart Broad has now dismissed Australia's David Warner 17 times in Test cricket Two more will equal the record, set by Glenn McGrath against Michael Atherton Here, batting greats recall the feeling of knowing a bowler has your number By David Coverdale For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:39, 16 July 2023 e-mail View comments When David Warner trudged towards the Headingley pavilion following his second-innings dismissal in the third Ashes Test, he knowingly raised his bat to the barracking Barmy Army. He may as well have raised a white flag. Stuart Broad had just taken his wicket for the second time in the match, the third time in the series and the 17th time in Test cricket. Warner became a meme that night — his face photoshopped on to Bart Simpson’s body, writing on a chalkboard, ‘Stuart Broad has got me out again’, which even Broad’s father Chris, an ICC match referee, posted before hastily deleting. At Old Trafford on Wednesday, Broad is set to renew his battle with his bunny, knowing two more dismissals would equal the most by any bowler against one batsman. That record is currently held by Australia legend Glenn McGrath, who removed Michael Atherton 19 times. Here, former England captain and Mail Sport columnist NASSER HUSSAIN analyses why Broad has the wood over Warner, while GRAHAM GOOCH, ALLAN LAMB and ALEC STEWART all reveal how it feels when a bowler has the better of you. Stuart Broad has now dismissed David Warner 17 times in Test cricket NASSER HUSSAIN Dismissed by Shane Warne 11 times If you are batting at the top of the order and a bowler has your number, it becomes technical, psychological and repetitive. There is no hiding place. You are always opening the batting, they are always opening the bowling and you are not ‘in’ when they come running in. If it is Stuart Broad versus David Warner again on that first morning at Old Trafford, the crowd will be revved up. Broad to Warner sets the tone for any Test. It is theatre — and that is what Broad absolutely thrives on. He will love it if Warner keeps his place because he loves that battle. No doubt, Warner will be thinking about the fact Broad has got him 17 times. You can see that from his wry smile when he walks off. That is a smile to say, ‘Oh my god, he has got me again’. He is nicknamed the Bull and he is always trying to set the tone and be attacking. Usually if your nemesis is on, you try and see him off. Against Broad, Warner no longer knows whether to stick or twist. I don’t know if we made enough of his first-innings dismissal at Edgbaston. He almost threw himself off his feet. It was ungainly and it showed where he is against Broad mentally. At Headingley, the way Broad got him out in both innings was exactly the same — angling the ball in, nipping it away and getting him caught at second slip. When it starts to become repetitive, it is a worry for the batter. Warner has tried things. He has been batting out of his crease. He started on middle and leg at Edgbaston. He is now batting towards off stump — or even outside off stump. So he has tinkered, but when you are in that slump, it becomes an absolute nightmare. The Australian opener was dismissed cheaply by Broad in both innings during the third Test at Headingley Nasser Hussain fell victim to the late Shane Warne 11 times in his Ashes career As for Broad, he has changed the way he has bowled against Warner over the years. When Ottis Gibson was England’s bowling coach, he convinced Broad to go round the wicket and start pitching it up, which brings in many more modes of dismissal. The other thing is the wobble seam delivery. I was speaking to England batting coach Marcus Trescothick, another left-hander, about that last summer. He said that if they’d had that delivery when he was playing, it would have been a nightmare for him. It’s not like swing. You don’t know which way it’s going. It comes in on the angle, but it can hit that seam and go either way. As a left-hander, you are exposed when it’s doing that because it is challenging both edges of the bat. If Broad takes it away from him, either with seam or swing, that brings in Warner’s outside edge as we saw at Headingley. But if he brings it in and Warner misses on the inside edge, he can be out lbw, as was often the case in the last Ashes series here. Umpires used to be very wary of giving left-handers out from round the wicket. They always felt it either hit you outside the line or was going down the leg side. But with the advances of DRS, they have seen that quite a few bowlers from round the wicket can get it spot on and produce lbws. Match-ups like Broad and Warner are why five-match Test series are the best. Your challenge is there day after day, week after week. It keeps coming at you. Even in between Tests, you are thinking about it. If you have a nemesis, you go in to bat and there will be words. Pat Cummins has now got Joe Root out 11 times and that will be on Root’s mind as well. He does have the comfort of that big hundred against him at Edgbaston. But the great rhythm player that is Root doesn’t quite get his rhythm against Cummins. He gets a bit stuck in his crease. At Lord’s and in the first innings at Headingley, he got out to back-of-the-length deliveries that he could have left on length. Cummins and Josh Hazlewood both bowl that in-between length that Root finds difficult at times. Australia captain Pat Cummins has now got Joe Root 11 times in his career Glenn McGrath holds the record after dismissing Michael Atherton 19 times But he must not go into his shell. He is at his best when he is trying to score and it was noticeable how much busier he was in the second innings at Headingley before he was strangled down the leg side off Cummins again. As a batter, there are always certain bowlers you struggle against more than others. Shane Warne got me out 11 times, more than anyone. When I went out to bat, he would remind me of that. But I used to find Courtney Walsh the most difficult to pick up because of his angles. He used to go wide of the crease, lean away and angle it in. I used to think it was coming in at me and then it would nip away and I would nick it every time. The batter who has got out to the same bowler the most is, of course, Michael Atherton against Glenn McGrath. Ath was technically gifted but a little glitch came into his batting where his bat used to come from gully towards mid-on. Once that glitch came in, he had a problem against great line bowlers like McGrath and Curtly Ambrose. They had metronomic accuracy and if there was any technical failing, they would expose it. In fairness to Ath, England played Australia and West Indies a lot in those days and he was at the top of the order against bowlers who are all-time greats. Still, we have a laugh in the commentary box whenever that graphic of bunnies comes up and Ath holds three of the top five spots. Even his son texted him the other day taking the mick out of him, saying, ‘You’re on that table a lot, Dad’. Ath doesn’t know which is better — for Warner to play and keep getting out to Broad so he goes past him, or for Warner not to play so we don’t keeping putting that table up. Either way, that table is going up! GRAHAM GOOCH Dismissed by Malcolm Marshall 16 times It could have been a few bowlers with me, couldn’t it? But Malcolm is my No 1 fast bowler. He was the best one I ever faced. My top three in order would be: 1. Malcolm Marshall. 2. Dennis Lillee. 3. Wasim Akram. Others will go different ways because everyone has their favourites but Malcolm had the lot. He was quick, swung it both ways with no change of action, was very intelligent and knew exactly what he was doing. He didn’t need the captain to help him much. He had great stamina and could bowl all day. Without parallel if you ask me. The thing is, when you come up against someone who’s got you a lot of times, you can’t think negatively. You have to believe you can get runs against them. I know it’s a bit of kidology but you can’t think, ‘This bloke has got me 10 times’. You have to think about the hundred you scored against him or the runs you’ve made. I can get runs against this guy and I can handle him. I don’t know what David Warner is thinking but you can’t let this sort of thing bother you. You just accept there’s been an issue in the past but put the positive things at the front of your mind. Warner has scored runs against Broad and that’s what he has to remember at Old Trafford. The great Malcolm Marshall dismissed Graham Gooch 16 times in his Test career ALEC STEWART Dismissed by Shane Warne 14 times I probably wasn’t aware of the number of times Warnie had got me out before I packed in playing. The media back then wasn’t what it is now. Now there is more analysis, more statistics. He was a once-in-a-generation cricketer, but walking out to bat, did I think, ‘Oh no, I am facing Shane Warne’? No, not at any stage. Did I know I was in for a challenge? 100 per cent, yes. He had one of the best cricket brains I came across. He worked out a batsman’s strengths and weaknesses and he had the ability to set you up. He bowled me out in Brisbane with his flipper. He says it was one of the best three balls he bowled. The ball he had bowled before was a long hop, which I cut for four. The next ball looked very similar, just a bit straighter. But by the time I realised it was the flipper, my middle stump had been knocked back. He didn’t actually have a lot of variety. He used to say he had a new ball every series. Well, he didn’t. There was always a lot of kidology. But it was his accuracy, control and his big drift. The big thing is, which I was taught from a young age, you have to play the ball and not the man. Is David Warner looking at Stuart Broad or is he looking at the ball? With the media coverage now, today’s players are fully aware of the stats and therefore England will be reminding Warner how fallible he is against Broad. Warne had a penchant for getting England captain's out and also got Alec Stewart 14 times ALLAN LAMB Dismissed by Malcolm Marshall 13 times Malcolm Marshall was the greatest bowler I played against by far. He could bowl as quick as anyone, but he could also swing the ball both ways, hit the seam and he was skiddy. He got me out lbw seven times with his late inswinger, with the ball skidding on. But when I was padding up, I wasn’t thinking, ‘Bloody Malcolm Marshall, I’ve got to be careful’. I just went out and played normally and looked to score runs. Of course, he got me out 13 times but I also got a couple of hundreds against him, so that sort of makes up for it! I always had a challenge against him but he knew it was a challenge to get me out. I think I had the better of him in county cricket and we won a few games. I loved playing against him — you always wanted to have that success. West Indies had four people bowling at 95mph, so where do you hide? I didn’t have the sort of problem that Warner has against Broad. It has to be a mental issue. He gets out in stupid ways. It must be difficult when you get into a situation like that. Thank god, I’ve never been in that situation. Allan Lamb was another who struggled against Marshall in his England career STUART BROAD Dismissed David Warner 17 times The truth is I’ve always found it difficult bowling to Davey, and I still do. By going round the wicket, I’ve tried to minimise the width that he loves outside off stump, but also bowl a fuller length and make him play at 80-85 per cent of deliveries. Despite his excellent record, Stuart Broad still finds it difficult bowling to David Warner In 2019, when I got him seven times, the pitches were very dry after the World Cup, and I used the wobble seam to scoot the ball back towards the stumps. This summer, I’ve bowled more for the outside edge, because the pitches have been a bit fresher in June and July — even if Edgbaston and Lord’s didn’t offer much. You have to be adaptable as a bowler. We’ve played a lot against each other down the years. I think we can both agree I’d rather bowl to him in England, and he’d rather bat against me in Australia. I imagine he’ll play at Old Trafford this week. One of Australia’s greatest strengths is their consistency in selection, and I’m certainly preparing to bowl at him and Usman Khawaja.

In what would be a considerable coup for the broadcaster, the former Sky Sports Soccer Saturday host, who left the station at the end of last season following 25 years in the role, is close to agreeing a deal that would take him onto the nation’s airwaves . It is thought that Stelling’s potential arrival would not impact on Alan Brazil, who would continue to present on Thursdays and Fridays. Award-winning Woods will front ITV ’s coverage of the upcoming women’s World Cup and is rumoured to be in line to replace TNT presenter Jake Humphrey . Meanwhile, Ally McCoist – also of the talkSPORT stable - is to join TNT for the forthcoming season in another significant swoop. It remains to be seen what impact – if any – the move will have on McCoist’s other work with the radio station, Amazon Prime, Sky and ITV. Covering a Champions League match and then being on air early the following morning, for example, may be a tough ask for the Rangers legend.

Insiders have disclosed that terms were agreed around nine days before big-spending Arsenal’s official declaration that they had landed the West Ham midfielder in a £105m record deal. The swoop, which takes the England man across London, is the Gunners’ third of a statement summer, following the arrivals of Chelsea forward Kai Havertz, for a fee that could reach £65m and defender Jurrien Timber from Ajax in a deal that may end up costing £38.6m. Arsenal confirmed the club record £105m signing of Declan Rice from West Ham on Saturday The deal was confirmed the day after the receipt of Premier League television money ECB's highlights software struggles to catch drops England's cricketers are not the only ones missing catches. Eagle-eyed viewers who watched the ECB’s highlights of the first day’s play at Headingley noted that not one of England’s four dropped chances – which included Joe Root shelling Mitchell Marsh on 12 before he went on to make 112 – featured in the 15-minute package. Some wondered if the ECB were attempting to airbrush history but it would appear that not catching is catching. The ECB use automated software to capture highlights and one of the sticking points they currently have is that the technology struggles to pick up drops. Hence the missed opportunities were subsequently missed. Their supplier is currently working on the issue. The ECB's automated software to capture highlights has struggled to pick up dropped catches Bahrain eyed as a base for Saudi-bound players Bahrian is emerging as a potential base for the families of some of those heading to Saudi Arabia. Agenda understands that players and agents are looking into the possibility of situating their relatives and close friends in the neighbouring country thanks in no small part to its more tolerant stance on alcohol. While drunken behaviour in public is against the law, booze is legal in Bahrain, with a number of bars, licensed restaurants and off-licences. That is not the case in Saudi, where booze is off limits, although there have been reports that this stance may be relaxed at certain resorts in the near future. Barnsley's pre-season trouncing exposed by fans Barnsley's decision to hold their friendly against Leeds at Oakwell behind closed doors may have seemed like a good idea, especially when the hosts were trounced 9-1. However, word of the fixture, on the League One club’s practice facility, got out and a group of fans gathered on a hillside overlooking the pitch to take in the one-sided action, before news of the result was broken online. For their visitors and new manager Daniel Farke it was a positive afternoon with club record signing Georginio Rutter netting twice along with a goal from ex-Manchester United winger Dan James. Both are expected to play a key role as the Yorkshire giants look to secure an immediate return to the top flight. Meanwhile, Leeds’s takeover by 49ers Enterprises is set to finally confirmed by the EFL in the near future. Anderson gives up The Open invite ahead of fourth Ashes Test Jimmy Anderson was due to play in The Open Invitational golf tournament on Sunday but gave up his place ahead of a potentially crucial fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. The Lancashire seamer was set to join the likes of Everton keeper Jordan Pickford, boxer Tony Bellew and former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh at the Royal Liverpool. However, with England 2-0 down ahead of their victory at Headingley Anderson, perhaps wisely, decided that his appearance may not be a good look and was replaced by Jermaine Jenas. With the Lancastrian set for a recall at his home venue on Wednesday , it may well have been the right call. Jimmy Anderson gave up his place in The Open Invitational golf tournament on Sunday Anderson was replaced at the event by former footballer turned pundit Jermaine Jenas Former FIFA ref who clashed with George Best dies The FIFA referee Norman Burtenshaw has died at the age of 97. Burtenshaw was known as one of the fittest officials and was no stranger to confrontation, once being attacked by a mob of Millwall supporters. A strict disciplinarian, he also sent off George Best for calling him a ‘clown’ amid an expletive rant during a match at Chelsea. An FA disciplinary hearing later accepted Best’s story that he had actually sworn at team-mate Willie Morgan – which the Manchester United legend would later admit in his autobiography was a version of events that he had made up. Burtenshaw had a newsagents in Great Yarmouth and the following morning was asked by a small boy if he was the man who had sent Best off. Burtenshaw said he had no option, to which the boy replied ‘My dad told me not to come in again’ before departing.

In the first final-ball finish of what has been a thrilling series, Australia denied Nat Sciver-Brunt’s bid to pull off a chase of 283 at Southampton. Watch, Stream & Catch Up with Australia's Home of Cricket on Needing 15 to win off Jess Jonassen’s final over, Sciver-Brunt got the equation down to five runs off one ball before she failed to find the boundary and England finished 7-279. Australia’s spinners were the heroes for the visitors, with Ashleigh Gardner and Alana King both claiming three wickets after Ellyse Perry top-scored with 91. Georgia Wareham’s effort with the bat also proved decisive for Australia, slamming 26 off the final six balls from Lauren Bell to boost the target. The result means even a loss in the final ODI on Tuesday would allow them to keep hold of the Ashes for a fifth straight time with a drawn series. But this success has been far from comfortable for an Australian team that has traditionally been all-conquering. After winning the series-opening Test and first Twenty20, Australia needed only one win from the next five games to keep hold of the Ashes. However, England claimed victory in the next three matches to go into the Southampton clash with the scoreline at 6-6 and with the series on the line. Australia still need victory in Tuesday’s final ODI to claim the series outright, but some pressure is now off after this result. “It’s not a relief,” captain Alyssa Healy insisted. “We still haven’t played our best cricket yet, which is a bit scary at times. “We are obviously really chuffed. We came here to win the Ashes, and we’ve retained them so far. “There is still one game to go, and we’ll be putting our best foot forward. But to know the Ashes are coming back with us is really exciting.” The win keeps Australia’s record of holding every major trophy available to them, having not dropped one since the 2017 World Cup. But at times on Sunday, it looked as if Healy’s team would be pushed all the way to the final match of the series at Taunton on Tuesday. After being sent in, Australia slumped to 2-27 early and were 4-102 before Perry dug them out of a hole alongside Gardner (33) and Annabel Sutherland (50). And at stages in the chase, England were in control. It took a great ball from King to bowl Tammy Beaumont on 60 and with England 2-107 after 21 overs, as the spinner pitched it on leg and hit the top of off. And while King (3-44) and Gardner (3-54) struck again through the middle overs, England appeared on track for victory at 5-201 with 12 overs remaining. It was at that point Gardner stood up, having Amy Jones caught reverse-sweeping on 37 and removing Sophie Ecclestone lbw in the same over. From there, Sciver-Brunt was always fighting up hill. And while her and Sarah Glenn (22no) got the equation down to nine off three balls and seven off two, England’s incredible fightback to try and win back the Ashes was over. “I thought we had it, Nat played an outstanding innings,” England captain Heather Knight said. “It’s been an outstanding series, the best series ever in women’s cricket in my opinion.”","pubDate":"2023-07-16 20:37:36","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-11295279/6eef25c4cf6e7267ab63a1ba3c2136d96b7ab5b3-16x9-x0y0w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"}]}
