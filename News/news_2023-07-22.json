Jonny Bairstow hit an unbeaten 99 before Mark Wood struck with three wickets to leave England six wickets away from levelling the series. Rain is the only hope for Australia , who were poor again throughout the third day, with the forecast not looking too positive for England over the weekend. Nonetheless, in such a strong position , it's likely Ben Stokes ' side will only need a few more sessions to secure victory. Here, Mail Sport's Richard Gibson takes you through some of the stories you might have missed from a thrilling third day of the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. Marnus Labuschagne made his first half-century of the series after changing the colour of his bat grip again The Australia No 3 sported a green bat grip after going through pink and white this series SHADES OF MARNUS'S BATTING Marnus Labuschagne's idiosyncrasies appear to have gone to another level this Ashes, with Australia’s No 3 regularly changing the colour of his grips on his Kookaburra Ghost Pro bats. Labuschagne had revealed superstitious tendencies on a journey to becoming the world’s No 1 Test batter — a title he held at the start of this series but has since lost due to a struggle for runs. The 29-year-old has flicked through the colour chart in a bid to change his fortunes. He began with a salmon pink grip in the first innings at Edgbaston, reverted to white for the second, went back to the pink during scores of 47 and 30 at Lord’s, went white and then black for the two Headingley innings and has sported a green handle here, where he made his first half-century of the series. THE WRIGHT ROLE ECB men’s selector Luke Wright will have his role redefined, allowing him to take on coaching responsibilities with England Lions this winter. Wright, 38, was chosen for the reintroduced position last November, but has pushed for it to be modernised so he can develop a different kind of relationship with the players to the ones formed by predecessors such as Ed Smith, Geoff Miller and David Graveney. Wright, who has worked as a coach with Auckland and Melbourne Stars, is set to be involved with a Lions training camp in the UAE. England men's selector Luke Wright (left) will have his role defined to allow him to coach the England Lions this winter The former Sussex batter has pushed for the role to be modernised to allow for different responsibilities TEEING OFF Saturday's horrendous weather forecast has encouraged Sky Sports to send two of its cricket team — Ricky Ponting and Mark Butcher — to the Open for a golf feature. The pair will take part in a driving challenge at Hoylake this morning using Sky’s range technology. Meanwhile, another Sky pundit, Gary Neville, was among the sell-out crowd here in Manchester on Friday. MAYORS DEMAND NORTHERN TEST The mayors of Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire have urged the ECB to change the 2027 men’s Ashes schedule and allocate one of the five Tests to a northern ground. England captain Ben Stokes said this week that he is ‘devastated’ there will be no match against Australia north of Nottingham in four years’ time. Ben Stokes has spoken of his disappointment that the north has not been handed an Ashes Test in 2027 And in a joint letter to ECB chair Richard Thompson criticising the southern bias, Andy Burnham and Tracy Brabin wrote: ‘Headingley and Old Trafford are two of England’s most iconic cricket grounds, and home to historic Ashes moments. Very few grounds attract support as passionate or indeed as diverse.’ GATTING GETS ANOTHER GO Mike Gatting fared much better against Shane Warne’s ball of the century 30 years on. He survived six replica deliveries on a simulator, raising £9,000 to improve club net facilities around the country in the process.

With only a cameo appearance from the world’s best player, no less. Going through their lineup, watching them, you quickly forget Spain is making only its third Women’s World Cup appearance. The tournament in Canada was their first, and they didn’t win a match. Four years later in France, they beat South Africa in the group stage. Friday’s 3-0 win over Costa Rica, then, was La Roja’s second victory in the history of its participation at this competition. A third will likely follow on Wednesday when Spain faces Zambia in Auckland (2:30 a.m., all matches on TSN); a fourth in Wellington on July 31 (2:00 a.m.), although 2011 champions Japan could provide a difficult test. John Cowpland / The Associated Press With or without Alexia Putellas on the pitch, Spain is a force to be reckoned with at the Women’s World Cup. For a program ranked 13th in the world only two years ago, it’s quite the trajectory. They’ve since risen to sixth–one place above Olympic gold medalists Canada — and aspire to nothing less than lifting the World Cup in Sydney next month. It would be a monumental triumph, not only for the obvious footballing reasons but also the country’s unique cultural ones. Women’s football was essentially banned under Franco, and even now, almost 50 years after the dictator’s death, it remains a subject of suspicion among Spain’s stodgy sporting establishment. Though not among its clubs, incidentally. Since professionalizing in 2015, Barcelona have perhaps been the biggest driver of women’s football in Spain. While it might be tempting to suggest the promotion of their Femení section has been enhanced because it’s the right thing to do, the reality is rather less moralistic: it’s simply good for business. Record attendance numbers continue to be set at Barça, and last autumn DAZN picked up Liga F broadcasting rights — something that wouldn’t have been possible, or at least as lucrative, had traditionalists Real Madrid not reluctantly bolstered their own women’s setup if for no other reason than to keep up with their Catalonian archrivals. The resulting pay-offs have come at the turnstiles, on streaming services, in player salaries and, evidently, with the national team. Since losing in extra time to eventual champions England at the quarter-final stage of last summer’s Euros, Spain has failed to win only twice in 14 matches, drawing Sweden 1-1 in October and losing 3-2 to World Cup co-hosts Australia in a February invitational. Over the same period they’ve defeated Norway, Japan and the United States — all previous world champions — as well as Denmark and China. Incredibly, it’s a run they put together in the absence of reigning two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas, who spent 10 months on the sidelines after tearing her ACL last July. Still widely considered the best player in the world, the 29-year-old was introduced as a 77th-minute substitute against Costa Rica as she continues to train up to full fitness. That there’s not a whole lot of urgency in Putellas’ return speaks to the quality of the Spain squad and the luxury manager Jorge Vilda can take in slowly building up her minutes as a result. Aitana Bonmatí, who like Putellas plays her club football at Barcelona, shone against Las Ticas, who were flattered by a scoreline largely kept respectable by heroic goalkeeper Daniela Solera. Left-back Olga Carmona will have also impressed Vilda; ditto Ona Battle and Esther González. By the time Putellas is ready to play from the start, look out. Spain should have little difficulty advancing to a prospective semi-final against the United States. And while Germany, England and France, and maybe Canada, will likely provide the other World Cup finalist, the Spain-USA tilt might end up being the actual final. With Spain the prohibitive favourites. Fridays The Free Press sports editor keeps you up to date on all that’s happening on the ice, the field, the court, and places in between. — Must-win matches come quickly at World Cups — on Wednesday if you’re Canada. The Nigeria draw might have been a decent result, what with the lack of competitive pre-tournament preparation, but while it kept the Canadian women alive in Group B it also produced a do-not-lose scenario for next week’s contest with Ireland (7 a.m.). The two sides have met just once before, when Canada prevailed 2-1 at the 2014 Cyprus Cup, and they really should be coming out on top in their second encounter as well. Win, and a spot in the round of 16 is all but locked up. Lose, and they won’t have deserved that knockout berth, anyway. — Jessie Fleming was quite clearly missed against Nigeria. The Chelsea midfielder is Canada’s engine, and in a team already challenged offensively her creative contributions cannot be overstated. Manager Bev Priestman confirmed Thursday the 25-year-old had “felt something” in training. If Fleming is unable to start against Ireland we’ll know the injury is more serious than initially thought, which would be a massive blow. So here’s hoping we see her name on the team-sheet early Wednesday morning. — Australia and New Zealand might be FIFA Women’s World Cup co-hosts, but they’re also hotbeds of rugby and, as the Netherlands has been reminded, cricket. The 2019 runners-up were already in tough without injured superstar Vivianne Miedema, and their preparations for Sunday’s match against Portugal (2:30 a.m.) were further hampered by the conditions of their Bay Oval training base. As its name suggests, Tauranga’s Bay Oval is a cricket ground, and one, apparently, with the sort of dry pitch that favours spin bowling. In other words, it’s a health hazard. It’s also inevitably, and unfortunately, the sort of story we still encounter far too often at women’s tournaments. jerradpeters@gmail.com Threads @JerradPeters Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-21 23:10:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["sports"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI 2nd Test Day 2 Stumps: दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म, वेस्टइंडीज ने एक विकेट खोकर 86 रन बनाए, टीम इंडिया को दूसरे विकेट की तलाश","link":"https://hindi.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/ind-vs-wi-2nd-test-day-2-stumps-end-of-second-day-west-indies-scored-86-runs-losing-one-wicket-team-india-looking-for-second-wicket-1872390.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"टीम इंडिया और वेस्टइंडीज के बीच 2 टेस्ट मैचों की सीरीज का दूसरा मुकाबला क्वींस पार्क ओवल स्टेडियम में खेला जा रहा हैं. टीम इंडिया ने दो मैचों की सीरीज में 1-0 से बढ़त बना ली है. टीम इंडिया ने पहला मैच पारी और 141 रनों से जीता था. दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म हो गया हैं.","content":"टीम इंडिया और वेस्टइंडीज के बीच 2 टेस्ट मैचों की सीरीज का दूसरा मुकाबला क्वींस पार्क ओवल स्टेडियम में खेला जा रहा हैं. टीम इंडिया ने दो मैचों की सीरीज में 1-0 से बढ़त बना ली है. टीम इंडिया ने पहला मैच पारी और 141 रनों से जीता था. दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म हो गया हैं. दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म होने तक वेस्टइंडीज ने 41 ओवर में एक विकेट खोकर 86 रन बना लिए थे. वेस्टइंडीज अभी इससे पहले वेस्टइंडीज के कप्तान क्रैग ब्रैथवेट ने टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी करने का फैसला किया. टॉस गवांने के बाद पहले बल्लेबाजी करने उतरी टीम इंडिया 128 ओवरों में 473 रन बनाकर सिमट गई. टीम इंडिया की तरफ से स्टार बल्लेबाज विराट कोहली ने सबसे ज्यादा 121 रन बनाए.

England are on the verge of levelling the Ashes after dominating day three Australia haven't picked a spinner on the ground of Warne's Ball of the Century Jonny Bairstow pulled off an great catch on day one and scored runs on Friday By David Lloyd for the Daily Mail Updated: 22:52 BST, 21 July 2023 e-mail View comments England are in a dominant position against Australia at the end of day three in the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. Some big hitting from Jonny Bairstow followed by some smart bowling from Mark Wood put Ben Stokes ' side in control of the game, with only rain now able to save Australia from defeat. A win would set up a thrilling final test at the Oval, but England must first wrap things up and pick up the final six wickets in the last two days. Friday played host to one of the best days of the series for the hosts as they dominated proceedings and reminded their opponents what they're about under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum. Here, Mail Sport columnist David 'Bumble' Lloyd cast his eye on a thrilling third day of the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford . Some big hitting from Jonny Bairstow means England moved closer to levelling the Ashes series The late Australia great Shane Warne would be seething at an Australia team without a spinner Australia captain Pat Cummins (pictured) has seemed bereft of ideas throughout the Test SHANE WOULD BE SEETHING I have never seen an Australia team so bereft of ideas — though I do have some sympathy for captain Pat Cummins because the injured Nathan Lyon was pivotal to their plans. But let me tell you something, not playing a frontline spinner at the venue where we saw the Ball of the Century would have made the great Shane Warne apoplectic! NO GRASSING UP STARC THIS TIME What about the dismissal of Harry Brook? He was caught on the boundary by Mitchell Starc, with his foot in the shadows of the boundary sponges. Boos reverberated around the ground because the spectators thought he was touching the boundary. But Brook was clearly out. No dramas. Obviously, Starc’s hands were not in contact with the grass! Mitchell Starc caught Harry Brook on the boundary - though close, there was no debate over the decision this time WHY IT'S SHADES OF GREY The new hotel at Old Trafford, which is grey, has caused a bit of a stir as the Point is red and the existing hotel is red, but I can exclusively reveal why. If you look from the air, you will see that the old pavilion in between the Point and the existing hotel is grey. They want to keep it symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing, which is marvellous if you’re paragliding in from the Trafford Centre… BE HERE NOW, NOEL... So the music battle moves on to Manchester. In third place were The Smiths — heaven knows they must be miserable now because they came behind The Fall. The winners were the Gallagher brothers, though Oasis won’t play here as it’s red and called Old Trafford. Ridiculous! Jonny Bairstow's spectacular catch to dismiss Mitchell Marsh paved the way for first innings runs for the England wicketkeeper MY SMOKING GUN There is a new Sustainability Terrace here which has solar lighting, a bat house (for the things that fly, not the ones you hit cricket balls with) and living walls. An unnamed media bod was sustaining himself out there with 20 Benson & Hedges as I walked past! I think he took it literally. BREATHTAKING BAIRSTOW Jonny Bairstow took a stunning catch to dismiss Mitchell Marsh in Australia’s first innings and then Stuart Broad said a great catch usually brings runs for Jonny. And so it did. What a breathtaking knock as Bairstow showed his true value to this side. He is such a confidence player.

Ben Stokes and England's style cannot help but be infectious England are on the verge of levelling the Ashes after dominating Australia again Jonny Bairstow took the Australia attack to the sword before Mark Wood struck Memories will live long in the memory even if England go onto lose the series By Oliver Holt For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:31, 21 July 2023 e-mail View comments What the great Spurs Double-winning captain, Danny Blanchflower, said about the essence of football is often recalled wistfully by romantics now that we live in a sporting age that sometimes feels as if it is under siege from cynicism, commercialism and pragmatism. On Friday, after another day when watching an England cricket team play the game made everyone inside Old Trafford feel glad to be alive , another day when sport lifted the soul with its joy and its derring-do, his words bore repeating. ‘The great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning,’ Blanchflower said. ‘It’s nothing of the kind. The game is about glory. It is about doing things in style, with a flourish, about going out and beating the other lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom.’ If he were alive now, we would probably call his philosophy Blanch-ball, because everything has to have a name so that we can more easily lionise it or ridicule it. If he were alive now, he would love this England team and he would recognise in their captain, Ben Stokes, a kindred spirit. Ben Stokes' England have gripped the nation with their style of play throughout the Ashes Jonny Bairstow's batting and Mark Wood's bowling meant England once again dominated at Old Trafford Stokes led his side off at the end of the day with the outfit in a position to level the series What a day. Again. What a day in an Ashes series that has gripped the nation like few others. What a day to be an England supporter and to see its team playing so audaciously and expressively and with a joie de vivre that cannot help but be infectious. What you call it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t have to have a name but it is wonderful to watch. Jonny Bairstow was central to the story and that made the narrative even more delicious. The England wicketkeeper was prey to Australian cynicism at Lord’s when he was the victim of the most controversial stumping in Ashes history and his assault on Australia’s bowling attack felt like a measure of sweet revenge. Bairstow was magnificent. He came to the crease with England at 437 for five and propelled them towards 500, past 500 and towards 600 with beautiful stroke play and power-hitting that was so brutal it even made Stokes’s jaw hit the floor as he watched from the England dressing room. One six, hoisted high over deep midwicket, and far into the stands, brought gasps from the crowd as well as roars of celebration. That took Bairstow to 86 off 71 balls, within sight of Gilbert Jessop’s quickest-ever England Test century, scored off 76 balls in 1902. ‘A cyclone of batting,’ the great Manchester Guardian cricket correspondent, Neville Cardus, called that innings and now journalists watched from the press gallery named after him at Old Trafford as Bairstow gave a passable impression of a tornado, scattering Australia and leaving the wreckage of them all around. Part of the magic of the day was seeing how boldly England went about their business, how fearlessly and with such joy in the game. Not for the first time in this series, the Australians were reduced to ringing the boundary with all of their outfielders. Their attitude screamed defeatism and bewilderment. England toyed with them, running quick singles even when the ball went through to the wicketkeeper. Alex Carey might have ‘stumped’ Bairstow at Lord’s but he couldn’t hit a barn door with a banjo at Old Trafford. Bairstow must have enjoyed that, too. The crowd certainly did. There was something strangely fitting about Bairstow, a man who has a complicated relationship with fortune, finally being left stranded on 99 not out. By then, England had reached 592, their eighth-highest Ashes total. To nobody’s great surprise, they had scored those runs faster than in any other of the biggest innings in Ashes history. The only other team to have scored at anything near this rate was Steve Waugh’s great Australia team. Stokes’s England outscore them easily. England, and Bairstow, went about their business boldly and fearlessly, enjoying the game Bairstow smashed an unbeaten 99 from 81 balls that included 10 fours and four sixes Alex Carey was humbled at Old Trafford after allowing Bairstow to run several byes Wood took three top-order Australian wickets to leave England needing just six more for victory The day ended with Mark Wood tearing in from the James Anderson End and snaring Steve Smith, still Australia’s most prized wicket, half an hour before the close and then Travis Head with 10 minutes to spare. With the Australians still 2-1 up, England are closing in on the greatest comeback in the annals even of this storied old contest. Only the weather can stop them here now. The rain will come on Saturday and give Australia respite. Maybe the bad weather will linger on Sunday and deliver them from their torture. Maybe Pat Cummins’s team will crawl over the line on bloodied hands and knees, giving thanks for Manchester’s dark clouds and dark mills, and retain the Ashes with a Test to spare, making the Oval an irrelevance. If the Australians survive, it will be a victory for pragmatism and conservatism. That will not change the way it looks in the history books but it will not steal away our memories of days like these, either. Days when England did things with style and with a flourish, days when they thrilled us with their determination to prove that the game is about glory.

Paceman Wood took three wickets to leave the tourists reeling on 113 for four in their second innings, still 162 behind England, who plundered 592 thanks to Jonny Bairstow ’s quick-fire 99. It now seems that only the heavy rain forecast over the weekend can prevent Ben Stokes ’ side from a commanding fourth Test victory that would take the series into a decider at the Oval next week. And Australia bowler Josh Hazlewood admitted: ‘I’d be very pleased if it rains. It would be great to lose a few overs. It would make our job a little easier of hanging in there. It is obviously forecast but forecasts can change all the time.’ England’s day-three hero Bairstow added: ‘We’ve done everything we can in the game and to get four wickets tonight puts them under pressure. Mark Wood took three wickets as England moved a step closer to levelling the series Jonny Bairstow took Australia to the sword as England dominated day three of the fourth Test ‘The weather is the weather. I am not Michael Fish. The weathermen have been right and they have been wrong. We will still turn up with the mindset of taking six wickets.’ England’s utter dominance at Old Trafford continued on Friday, as they added another 208 runs to their overnight score of 384 for four to give them a huge first-innings lead of 275. Bairstow smashed 99 off 81 balls, including four sixes, before he was left stranded one short of a thrilling century when Jimmy Anderson was trapped lbw to Cameron Green. It was the Yorkshireman’s highest score since breaking his leg and dislocating his ankle in a freak incident last August – and he was quick to take aim at those who have criticised his Ashes displays. ‘To score 99, you’re pretty happy, aren’t you?’ said Bairstow. ‘Everyone thinks I play better when people have a go at me. It gets a bit tiresome. I’ve played a lot of cricket now. To keep being told you’re rubbish… if I was that rubbish I wouldn’t have played 94 Tests. Australia's Josh Hazlewood admitted he would be happy to watch it rain at Old Trafford ‘There's been some chitter-chatter that has been rather interesting at times, especially when there's not been many conversations around how my ankle is. ‘I’m a proud man to be taking the field after that injury. When you have an injury of that significance, there's a chance you don't play sport again.’ On criticism of his wicketkeeping, he added: ‘There have been a couple that have gone down, but I’ve not kept wicket for three years. I’ve got nine pins, a plate and a wire that goes through my ankle. I’m delighted to be where I’m at.’ Bairstow was also asked about his controversial dismissal in the second innings at Lord’s and said: ‘It wasn’t the way I wanted to be out. I’ve even heard about it in club cricket, which is not necessarily the example you want to set. You want to play it tough but fair. On a different day, it doesn’t happen.’ Share or comment on this article: Josh Hazlewood admits Australia are praying for rain to help them 'hang on' after paceman Mark Wood struck three crucial blows to put England on the brink of Ashes-levelling win e-mail Add comment Comments 6 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Jonny Bairstow hit an unbeaten 99 before Mark Wood struck with three wickets to leave England six wickets away from levelling the series. Rain is the only hope for Australia , who were poor again throughout the third day, with the forecast not looking too positive for England over the weekend. Nonetheless, in such a strong position , it's likely Ben Stokes ' side will only need a few more sessions to secure victory. Here, Mail Sport's Richard Gibson takes you through some of the stories you might have missed from a thrilling third day of the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. Marnus Labuschagne made his first half-century of the series after changing the colour of his bat grip again The Australia No 3 sported a green bat grip after going through pink and white this series SHADES OF MARNUS'S BATTING Marnus Labuschagne's idiosyncrasies appear to have gone to another level this Ashes, with Australia’s No 3 regularly changing the colour of his grips on his Kookaburra Ghost Pro bats. Labuschagne had revealed superstitious tendencies on a journey to becoming the world’s No 1 Test batter — a title he held at the start of this series but has since lost due to a struggle for runs. The 29-year-old has flicked through the colour chart in a bid to change his fortunes. He began with a salmon pink grip in the first innings at Edgbaston, reverted to white for the second, went back to the pink during scores of 47 and 30 at Lord’s, went white and then black for the two Headingley innings and has sported a green handle here, where he made his first half-century of the series. THE WRIGHT ROLE ECB men’s selector Luke Wright will have his role redefined, allowing him to take on coaching responsibilities with England Lions this winter. Wright, 38, was chosen for the reintroduced position last November, but has pushed for it to be modernised so he can develop a different kind of relationship with the players to the ones formed by predecessors such as Ed Smith, Geoff Miller and David Graveney. Wright, who has worked as a coach with Auckland and Melbourne Stars, is set to be involved with a Lions training camp in the UAE. England men's selector Luke Wright (left) will have his role defined to allow him to coach the England Lions this winter The former Sussex batter has pushed for the role to be modernised to allow for different responsibilities TEEING OFF Saturday's horrendous weather forecast has encouraged Sky Sports to send two of its cricket team — Ricky Ponting and Mark Butcher — to the Open for a golf feature. The pair will take part in a driving challenge at Hoylake this morning using Sky’s range technology. Meanwhile, another Sky pundit, Gary Neville, was among the sell-out crowd here in Manchester on Friday. MAYORS DEMAND NORTHERN TEST The mayors of Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire have urged the ECB to change the 2027 men’s Ashes schedule and allocate one of the five Tests to a northern ground. England captain Ben Stokes said this week that he is ‘devastated’ there will be no match against Australia north of Nottingham in four years’ time. Ben Stokes has spoken of his disappointment that the north has not been handed an Ashes Test in 2027 And in a joint letter to ECB chair Richard Thompson criticising the southern bias, Andy Burnham and Tracy Brabin wrote: ‘Headingley and Old Trafford are two of England’s most iconic cricket grounds, and home to historic Ashes moments. Very few grounds attract support as passionate or indeed as diverse.’ GATTING GETS ANOTHER GO Mike Gatting fared much better against Shane Warne’s ball of the century 30 years on. He survived six replica deliveries on a simulator, raising £9,000 to improve club net facilities around the country in the process.

With only a cameo appearance from the world’s best player, no less. Going through their lineup, watching them, you quickly forget Spain is making only its third Women’s World Cup appearance. The tournament in Canada was their first, and they didn’t win a match. Four years later in France, they beat South Africa in the group stage. Friday’s 3-0 win over Costa Rica, then, was La Roja’s second victory in the history of its participation at this competition. A third will likely follow on Wednesday when Spain faces Zambia in Auckland (2:30 a.m., all matches on TSN); a fourth in Wellington on July 31 (2:00 a.m.), although 2011 champions Japan could provide a difficult test. John Cowpland / The Associated Press With or without Alexia Putellas on the pitch, Spain is a force to be reckoned with at the Women’s World Cup. For a program ranked 13th in the world only two years ago, it’s quite the trajectory. They’ve since risen to sixth–one place above Olympic gold medalists Canada — and aspire to nothing less than lifting the World Cup in Sydney next month. It would be a monumental triumph, not only for the obvious footballing reasons but also the country’s unique cultural ones. Women’s football was essentially banned under Franco, and even now, almost 50 years after the dictator’s death, it remains a subject of suspicion among Spain’s stodgy sporting establishment. Though not among its clubs, incidentally. Since professionalizing in 2015, Barcelona have perhaps been the biggest driver of women’s football in Spain. While it might be tempting to suggest the promotion of their Femení section has been enhanced because it’s the right thing to do, the reality is rather less moralistic: it’s simply good for business. Record attendance numbers continue to be set at Barça, and last autumn DAZN picked up Liga F broadcasting rights — something that wouldn’t have been possible, or at least as lucrative, had traditionalists Real Madrid not reluctantly bolstered their own women’s setup if for no other reason than to keep up with their Catalonian archrivals. The resulting pay-offs have come at the turnstiles, on streaming services, in player salaries and, evidently, with the national team. Since losing in extra time to eventual champions England at the quarter-final stage of last summer’s Euros, Spain has failed to win only twice in 14 matches, drawing Sweden 1-1 in October and losing 3-2 to World Cup co-hosts Australia in a February invitational. Over the same period they’ve defeated Norway, Japan and the United States — all previous world champions — as well as Denmark and China. Incredibly, it’s a run they put together in the absence of reigning two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas, who spent 10 months on the sidelines after tearing her ACL last July. Still widely considered the best player in the world, the 29-year-old was introduced as a 77th-minute substitute against Costa Rica as she continues to train up to full fitness. That there’s not a whole lot of urgency in Putellas’ return speaks to the quality of the Spain squad and the luxury manager Jorge Vilda can take in slowly building up her minutes as a result. Aitana Bonmatí, who like Putellas plays her club football at Barcelona, shone against Las Ticas, who were flattered by a scoreline largely kept respectable by heroic goalkeeper Daniela Solera. Left-back Olga Carmona will have also impressed Vilda; ditto Ona Battle and Esther González. By the time Putellas is ready to play from the start, look out. Spain should have little difficulty advancing to a prospective semi-final against the United States. And while Germany, England and France, and maybe Canada, will likely provide the other World Cup finalist, the Spain-USA tilt might end up being the actual final. With Spain the prohibitive favourites. Fridays The Free Press sports editor keeps you up to date on all that’s happening on the ice, the field, the court, and places in between. — Must-win matches come quickly at World Cups — on Wednesday if you’re Canada. The Nigeria draw might have been a decent result, what with the lack of competitive pre-tournament preparation, but while it kept the Canadian women alive in Group B it also produced a do-not-lose scenario for next week’s contest with Ireland (7 a.m.). The two sides have met just once before, when Canada prevailed 2-1 at the 2014 Cyprus Cup, and they really should be coming out on top in their second encounter as well. Win, and a spot in the round of 16 is all but locked up. Lose, and they won’t have deserved that knockout berth, anyway. — Jessie Fleming was quite clearly missed against Nigeria. The Chelsea midfielder is Canada’s engine, and in a team already challenged offensively her creative contributions cannot be overstated. Manager Bev Priestman confirmed Thursday the 25-year-old had “felt something” in training. If Fleming is unable to start against Ireland we’ll know the injury is more serious than initially thought, which would be a massive blow. So here’s hoping we see her name on the team-sheet early Wednesday morning. — Australia and New Zealand might be FIFA Women’s World Cup co-hosts, but they’re also hotbeds of rugby and, as the Netherlands has been reminded, cricket. The 2019 runners-up were already in tough without injured superstar Vivianne Miedema, and their preparations for Sunday’s match against Portugal (2:30 a.m.) were further hampered by the conditions of their Bay Oval training base. As its name suggests, Tauranga’s Bay Oval is a cricket ground, and one, apparently, with the sort of dry pitch that favours spin bowling. In other words, it’s a health hazard. It’s also inevitably, and unfortunately, the sort of story we still encounter far too often at women’s tournaments. jerradpeters@gmail.com Threads @JerradPeters Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-21 23:10:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["sports"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI 2nd Test Day 2 Stumps: दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म, वेस्टइंडीज ने एक विकेट खोकर 86 रन बनाए, टीम इंडिया को दूसरे विकेट की तलाश","link":"https://hindi.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/ind-vs-wi-2nd-test-day-2-stumps-end-of-second-day-west-indies-scored-86-runs-losing-one-wicket-team-india-looking-for-second-wicket-1872390.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"टीम इंडिया और वेस्टइंडीज के बीच 2 टेस्ट मैचों की सीरीज का दूसरा मुकाबला क्वींस पार्क ओवल स्टेडियम में खेला जा रहा हैं. टीम इंडिया ने दो मैचों की सीरीज में 1-0 से बढ़त बना ली है. टीम इंडिया ने पहला मैच पारी और 141 रनों से जीता था. दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म हो गया हैं.","content":"टीम इंडिया और वेस्टइंडीज के बीच 2 टेस्ट मैचों की सीरीज का दूसरा मुकाबला क्वींस पार्क ओवल स्टेडियम में खेला जा रहा हैं. टीम इंडिया ने दो मैचों की सीरीज में 1-0 से बढ़त बना ली है. टीम इंडिया ने पहला मैच पारी और 141 रनों से जीता था. दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म हो गया हैं. दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म होने तक वेस्टइंडीज ने 41 ओवर में एक विकेट खोकर 86 रन बना लिए थे. वेस्टइंडीज अभी इससे पहले वेस्टइंडीज के कप्तान क्रैग ब्रैथवेट ने टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी करने का फैसला किया. टॉस गवांने के बाद पहले बल्लेबाजी करने उतरी टीम इंडिया 128 ओवरों में 473 रन बनाकर सिमट गई. टीम इंडिया की तरफ से स्टार बल्लेबाज विराट कोहली ने सबसे ज्यादा 121 रन बनाए.

England are on the verge of levelling the Ashes after dominating day three Australia haven't picked a spinner on the ground of Warne's Ball of the Century Jonny Bairstow pulled off an great catch on day one and scored runs on Friday By David Lloyd for the Daily Mail Updated: 22:52 BST, 21 July 2023 e-mail View comments England are in a dominant position against Australia at the end of day three in the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. Some big hitting from Jonny Bairstow followed by some smart bowling from Mark Wood put Ben Stokes ' side in control of the game, with only rain now able to save Australia from defeat. A win would set up a thrilling final test at the Oval, but England must first wrap things up and pick up the final six wickets in the last two days. Friday played host to one of the best days of the series for the hosts as they dominated proceedings and reminded their opponents what they're about under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum. Here, Mail Sport columnist David 'Bumble' Lloyd cast his eye on a thrilling third day of the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford . Some big hitting from Jonny Bairstow means England moved closer to levelling the Ashes series The late Australia great Shane Warne would be seething at an Australia team without a spinner Australia captain Pat Cummins (pictured) has seemed bereft of ideas throughout the Test SHANE WOULD BE SEETHING I have never seen an Australia team so bereft of ideas — though I do have some sympathy for captain Pat Cummins because the injured Nathan Lyon was pivotal to their plans. But let me tell you something, not playing a frontline spinner at the venue where we saw the Ball of the Century would have made the great Shane Warne apoplectic! NO GRASSING UP STARC THIS TIME What about the dismissal of Harry Brook? He was caught on the boundary by Mitchell Starc, with his foot in the shadows of the boundary sponges. Boos reverberated around the ground because the spectators thought he was touching the boundary. But Brook was clearly out. No dramas. Obviously, Starc’s hands were not in contact with the grass! Mitchell Starc caught Harry Brook on the boundary - though close, there was no debate over the decision this time WHY IT'S SHADES OF GREY The new hotel at Old Trafford, which is grey, has caused a bit of a stir as the Point is red and the existing hotel is red, but I can exclusively reveal why. If you look from the air, you will see that the old pavilion in between the Point and the existing hotel is grey. They want to keep it symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing, which is marvellous if you’re paragliding in from the Trafford Centre… BE HERE NOW, NOEL... So the music battle moves on to Manchester. In third place were The Smiths — heaven knows they must be miserable now because they came behind The Fall. The winners were the Gallagher brothers, though Oasis won’t play here as it’s red and called Old Trafford. Ridiculous! Jonny Bairstow's spectacular catch to dismiss Mitchell Marsh paved the way for first innings runs for the England wicketkeeper MY SMOKING GUN There is a new Sustainability Terrace here which has solar lighting, a bat house (for the things that fly, not the ones you hit cricket balls with) and living walls. An unnamed media bod was sustaining himself out there with 20 Benson & Hedges as I walked past! I think he took it literally. BREATHTAKING BAIRSTOW Jonny Bairstow took a stunning catch to dismiss Mitchell Marsh in Australia’s first innings and then Stuart Broad said a great catch usually brings runs for Jonny. And so it did. What a breathtaking knock as Bairstow showed his true value to this side. He is such a confidence player.

Ben Stokes and England's style cannot help but be infectious England are on the verge of levelling the Ashes after dominating Australia again Jonny Bairstow took the Australia attack to the sword before Mark Wood struck Memories will live long in the memory even if England go onto lose the series By Oliver Holt For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:31, 21 July 2023 e-mail View comments What the great Spurs Double-winning captain, Danny Blanchflower, said about the essence of football is often recalled wistfully by romantics now that we live in a sporting age that sometimes feels as if it is under siege from cynicism, commercialism and pragmatism. On Friday, after another day when watching an England cricket team play the game made everyone inside Old Trafford feel glad to be alive , another day when sport lifted the soul with its joy and its derring-do, his words bore repeating. ‘The great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning,’ Blanchflower said. ‘It’s nothing of the kind. The game is about glory. It is about doing things in style, with a flourish, about going out and beating the other lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom.’ If he were alive now, we would probably call his philosophy Blanch-ball, because everything has to have a name so that we can more easily lionise it or ridicule it. If he were alive now, he would love this England team and he would recognise in their captain, Ben Stokes, a kindred spirit. Ben Stokes' England have gripped the nation with their style of play throughout the Ashes Jonny Bairstow's batting and Mark Wood's bowling meant England once again dominated at Old Trafford Stokes led his side off at the end of the day with the outfit in a position to level the series What a day. Again. What a day in an Ashes series that has gripped the nation like few others. What a day to be an England supporter and to see its team playing so audaciously and expressively and with a joie de vivre that cannot help but be infectious. What you call it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t have to have a name but it is wonderful to watch. Jonny Bairstow was central to the story and that made the narrative even more delicious. The England wicketkeeper was prey to Australian cynicism at Lord’s when he was the victim of the most controversial stumping in Ashes history and his assault on Australia’s bowling attack felt like a measure of sweet revenge. Bairstow was magnificent. He came to the crease with England at 437 for five and propelled them towards 500, past 500 and towards 600 with beautiful stroke play and power-hitting that was so brutal it even made Stokes’s jaw hit the floor as he watched from the England dressing room. One six, hoisted high over deep midwicket, and far into the stands, brought gasps from the crowd as well as roars of celebration. That took Bairstow to 86 off 71 balls, within sight of Gilbert Jessop’s quickest-ever England Test century, scored off 76 balls in 1902. ‘A cyclone of batting,’ the great Manchester Guardian cricket correspondent, Neville Cardus, called that innings and now journalists watched from the press gallery named after him at Old Trafford as Bairstow gave a passable impression of a tornado, scattering Australia and leaving the wreckage of them all around. Part of the magic of the day was seeing how boldly England went about their business, how fearlessly and with such joy in the game. Not for the first time in this series, the Australians were reduced to ringing the boundary with all of their outfielders. Their attitude screamed defeatism and bewilderment. England toyed with them, running quick singles even when the ball went through to the wicketkeeper. Alex Carey might have ‘stumped’ Bairstow at Lord’s but he couldn’t hit a barn door with a banjo at Old Trafford. Bairstow must have enjoyed that, too. The crowd certainly did. There was something strangely fitting about Bairstow, a man who has a complicated relationship with fortune, finally being left stranded on 99 not out. By then, England had reached 592, their eighth-highest Ashes total. To nobody’s great surprise, they had scored those runs faster than in any other of the biggest innings in Ashes history. The only other team to have scored at anything near this rate was Steve Waugh’s great Australia team. Stokes’s England outscore them easily. England, and Bairstow, went about their business boldly and fearlessly, enjoying the game Bairstow smashed an unbeaten 99 from 81 balls that included 10 fours and four sixes Alex Carey was humbled at Old Trafford after allowing Bairstow to run several byes Wood took three top-order Australian wickets to leave England needing just six more for victory The day ended with Mark Wood tearing in from the James Anderson End and snaring Steve Smith, still Australia’s most prized wicket, half an hour before the close and then Travis Head with 10 minutes to spare. With the Australians still 2-1 up, England are closing in on the greatest comeback in the annals even of this storied old contest. Only the weather can stop them here now. The rain will come on Saturday and give Australia respite. Maybe the bad weather will linger on Sunday and deliver them from their torture. Maybe Pat Cummins’s team will crawl over the line on bloodied hands and knees, giving thanks for Manchester’s dark clouds and dark mills, and retain the Ashes with a Test to spare, making the Oval an irrelevance. If the Australians survive, it will be a victory for pragmatism and conservatism. That will not change the way it looks in the history books but it will not steal away our memories of days like these, either. Days when England did things with style and with a flourish, days when they thrilled us with their determination to prove that the game is about glory.

Paceman Wood took three wickets to leave the tourists reeling on 113 for four in their second innings, still 162 behind England, who plundered 592 thanks to Jonny Bairstow ’s quick-fire 99. It now seems that only the heavy rain forecast over the weekend can prevent Ben Stokes ’ side from a commanding fourth Test victory that would take the series into a decider at the Oval next week. And Australia bowler Josh Hazlewood admitted: ‘I’d be very pleased if it rains. It would be great to lose a few overs. It would make our job a little easier of hanging in there. It is obviously forecast but forecasts can change all the time.’ England’s day-three hero Bairstow added: ‘We’ve done everything we can in the game and to get four wickets tonight puts them under pressure. Mark Wood took three wickets as England moved a step closer to levelling the series Jonny Bairstow took Australia to the sword as England dominated day three of the fourth Test ‘The weather is the weather. I am not Michael Fish. The weathermen have been right and they have been wrong. We will still turn up with the mindset of taking six wickets.’ England’s utter dominance at Old Trafford continued on Friday, as they added another 208 runs to their overnight score of 384 for four to give them a huge first-innings lead of 275. Bairstow smashed 99 off 81 balls, including four sixes, before he was left stranded one short of a thrilling century when Jimmy Anderson was trapped lbw to Cameron Green. It was the Yorkshireman’s highest score since breaking his leg and dislocating his ankle in a freak incident last August – and he was quick to take aim at those who have criticised his Ashes displays. ‘To score 99, you’re pretty happy, aren’t you?’ said Bairstow. ‘Everyone thinks I play better when people have a go at me. It gets a bit tiresome. I’ve played a lot of cricket now. To keep being told you’re rubbish… if I was that rubbish I wouldn’t have played 94 Tests. Australia's Josh Hazlewood admitted he would be happy to watch it rain at Old Trafford ‘There's been some chitter-chatter that has been rather interesting at times, especially when there's not been many conversations around how my ankle is. ‘I’m a proud man to be taking the field after that injury. When you have an injury of that significance, there's a chance you don't play sport again.’ On criticism of his wicketkeeping, he added: ‘There have been a couple that have gone down, but I’ve not kept wicket for three years. I’ve got nine pins, a plate and a wire that goes through my ankle. I’m delighted to be where I’m at.’ Bairstow was also asked about his controversial dismissal in the second innings at Lord’s and said: ‘It wasn’t the way I wanted to be out. I’ve even heard about it in club cricket, which is not necessarily the example you want to set. You want to play it tough but fair. On a different day, it doesn’t happen.’ Share or comment on this article: Josh Hazlewood admits Australia are praying for rain to help them 'hang on' after paceman Mark Wood struck three crucial blows to put England on the brink of Ashes-levelling win e-mail Add comment Comments 6 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Jonny Bairstow hit an unbeaten 99 before Mark Wood struck with three wickets to leave England six wickets away from levelling the series. Rain is the only hope for Australia , who were poor again throughout the third day, with the forecast not looking too positive for England over the weekend. Nonetheless, in such a strong position , it's likely Ben Stokes ' side will only need a few more sessions to secure victory. Here, Mail Sport's Richard Gibson takes you through some of the stories you might have missed from a thrilling third day of the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. Marnus Labuschagne made his first half-century of the series after changing the colour of his bat grip again The Australia No 3 sported a green bat grip after going through pink and white this series SHADES OF MARNUS'S BATTING Marnus Labuschagne's idiosyncrasies appear to have gone to another level this Ashes, with Australia’s No 3 regularly changing the colour of his grips on his Kookaburra Ghost Pro bats. Labuschagne had revealed superstitious tendencies on a journey to becoming the world’s No 1 Test batter — a title he held at the start of this series but has since lost due to a struggle for runs. The 29-year-old has flicked through the colour chart in a bid to change his fortunes. He began with a salmon pink grip in the first innings at Edgbaston, reverted to white for the second, went back to the pink during scores of 47 and 30 at Lord’s, went white and then black for the two Headingley innings and has sported a green handle here, where he made his first half-century of the series. THE WRIGHT ROLE ECB men’s selector Luke Wright will have his role redefined, allowing him to take on coaching responsibilities with England Lions this winter. Wright, 38, was chosen for the reintroduced position last November, but has pushed for it to be modernised so he can develop a different kind of relationship with the players to the ones formed by predecessors such as Ed Smith, Geoff Miller and David Graveney. Wright, who has worked as a coach with Auckland and Melbourne Stars, is set to be involved with a Lions training camp in the UAE. England men's selector Luke Wright (left) will have his role defined to allow him to coach the England Lions this winter The former Sussex batter has pushed for the role to be modernised to allow for different responsibilities TEEING OFF Saturday's horrendous weather forecast has encouraged Sky Sports to send two of its cricket team — Ricky Ponting and Mark Butcher — to the Open for a golf feature. The pair will take part in a driving challenge at Hoylake this morning using Sky’s range technology. Meanwhile, another Sky pundit, Gary Neville, was among the sell-out crowd here in Manchester on Friday. MAYORS DEMAND NORTHERN TEST The mayors of Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire have urged the ECB to change the 2027 men’s Ashes schedule and allocate one of the five Tests to a northern ground. England captain Ben Stokes said this week that he is ‘devastated’ there will be no match against Australia north of Nottingham in four years’ time. Ben Stokes has spoken of his disappointment that the north has not been handed an Ashes Test in 2027 And in a joint letter to ECB chair Richard Thompson criticising the southern bias, Andy Burnham and Tracy Brabin wrote: ‘Headingley and Old Trafford are two of England’s most iconic cricket grounds, and home to historic Ashes moments. Very few grounds attract support as passionate or indeed as diverse.’ GATTING GETS ANOTHER GO Mike Gatting fared much better against Shane Warne’s ball of the century 30 years on. He survived six replica deliveries on a simulator, raising £9,000 to improve club net facilities around the country in the process.

With only a cameo appearance from the world’s best player, no less. Going through their lineup, watching them, you quickly forget Spain is making only its third Women’s World Cup appearance. The tournament in Canada was their first, and they didn’t win a match. Four years later in France, they beat South Africa in the group stage. Friday’s 3-0 win over Costa Rica, then, was La Roja’s second victory in the history of its participation at this competition. A third will likely follow on Wednesday when Spain faces Zambia in Auckland (2:30 a.m., all matches on TSN); a fourth in Wellington on July 31 (2:00 a.m.), although 2011 champions Japan could provide a difficult test. John Cowpland / The Associated Press With or without Alexia Putellas on the pitch, Spain is a force to be reckoned with at the Women’s World Cup. For a program ranked 13th in the world only two years ago, it’s quite the trajectory. They’ve since risen to sixth–one place above Olympic gold medalists Canada — and aspire to nothing less than lifting the World Cup in Sydney next month. It would be a monumental triumph, not only for the obvious footballing reasons but also the country’s unique cultural ones. Women’s football was essentially banned under Franco, and even now, almost 50 years after the dictator’s death, it remains a subject of suspicion among Spain’s stodgy sporting establishment. Though not among its clubs, incidentally. Since professionalizing in 2015, Barcelona have perhaps been the biggest driver of women’s football in Spain. While it might be tempting to suggest the promotion of their Femení section has been enhanced because it’s the right thing to do, the reality is rather less moralistic: it’s simply good for business. Record attendance numbers continue to be set at Barça, and last autumn DAZN picked up Liga F broadcasting rights — something that wouldn’t have been possible, or at least as lucrative, had traditionalists Real Madrid not reluctantly bolstered their own women’s setup if for no other reason than to keep up with their Catalonian archrivals. The resulting pay-offs have come at the turnstiles, on streaming services, in player salaries and, evidently, with the national team. Since losing in extra time to eventual champions England at the quarter-final stage of last summer’s Euros, Spain has failed to win only twice in 14 matches, drawing Sweden 1-1 in October and losing 3-2 to World Cup co-hosts Australia in a February invitational. Over the same period they’ve defeated Norway, Japan and the United States — all previous world champions — as well as Denmark and China. Incredibly, it’s a run they put together in the absence of reigning two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas, who spent 10 months on the sidelines after tearing her ACL last July. Still widely considered the best player in the world, the 29-year-old was introduced as a 77th-minute substitute against Costa Rica as she continues to train up to full fitness. That there’s not a whole lot of urgency in Putellas’ return speaks to the quality of the Spain squad and the luxury manager Jorge Vilda can take in slowly building up her minutes as a result. Aitana Bonmatí, who like Putellas plays her club football at Barcelona, shone against Las Ticas, who were flattered by a scoreline largely kept respectable by heroic goalkeeper Daniela Solera. Left-back Olga Carmona will have also impressed Vilda; ditto Ona Battle and Esther González. By the time Putellas is ready to play from the start, look out. Spain should have little difficulty advancing to a prospective semi-final against the United States. And while Germany, England and France, and maybe Canada, will likely provide the other World Cup finalist, the Spain-USA tilt might end up being the actual final. With Spain the prohibitive favourites. Fridays The Free Press sports editor keeps you up to date on all that’s happening on the ice, the field, the court, and places in between. — Must-win matches come quickly at World Cups — on Wednesday if you’re Canada. The Nigeria draw might have been a decent result, what with the lack of competitive pre-tournament preparation, but while it kept the Canadian women alive in Group B it also produced a do-not-lose scenario for next week’s contest with Ireland (7 a.m.). The two sides have met just once before, when Canada prevailed 2-1 at the 2014 Cyprus Cup, and they really should be coming out on top in their second encounter as well. Win, and a spot in the round of 16 is all but locked up. Lose, and they won’t have deserved that knockout berth, anyway. — Jessie Fleming was quite clearly missed against Nigeria. The Chelsea midfielder is Canada’s engine, and in a team already challenged offensively her creative contributions cannot be overstated. Manager Bev Priestman confirmed Thursday the 25-year-old had “felt something” in training. If Fleming is unable to start against Ireland we’ll know the injury is more serious than initially thought, which would be a massive blow. So here’s hoping we see her name on the team-sheet early Wednesday morning. — Australia and New Zealand might be FIFA Women’s World Cup co-hosts, but they’re also hotbeds of rugby and, as the Netherlands has been reminded, cricket. The 2019 runners-up were already in tough without injured superstar Vivianne Miedema, and their preparations for Sunday’s match against Portugal (2:30 a.m.) were further hampered by the conditions of their Bay Oval training base. As its name suggests, Tauranga’s Bay Oval is a cricket ground, and one, apparently, with the sort of dry pitch that favours spin bowling. In other words, it’s a health hazard. It’s also inevitably, and unfortunately, the sort of story we still encounter far too often at women’s tournaments. jerradpeters@gmail.com Threads @JerradPeters Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-21 23:10:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["sports"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI 2nd Test Day 2 Stumps: दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म, वेस्टइंडीज ने एक विकेट खोकर 86 रन बनाए, टीम इंडिया को दूसरे विकेट की तलाश","link":"https://hindi.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/ind-vs-wi-2nd-test-day-2-stumps-end-of-second-day-west-indies-scored-86-runs-losing-one-wicket-team-india-looking-for-second-wicket-1872390.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"टीम इंडिया और वेस्टइंडीज के बीच 2 टेस्ट मैचों की सीरीज का दूसरा मुकाबला क्वींस पार्क ओवल स्टेडियम में खेला जा रहा हैं. टीम इंडिया ने दो मैचों की सीरीज में 1-0 से बढ़त बना ली है. टीम इंडिया ने पहला मैच पारी और 141 रनों से जीता था. दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म हो गया हैं.","content":"टीम इंडिया और वेस्टइंडीज के बीच 2 टेस्ट मैचों की सीरीज का दूसरा मुकाबला क्वींस पार्क ओवल स्टेडियम में खेला जा रहा हैं. टीम इंडिया ने दो मैचों की सीरीज में 1-0 से बढ़त बना ली है. टीम इंडिया ने पहला मैच पारी और 141 रनों से जीता था. दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म हो गया हैं. दूसरे दिन का खेल ख़त्म होने तक वेस्टइंडीज ने 41 ओवर में एक विकेट खोकर 86 रन बना लिए थे. वेस्टइंडीज अभी इससे पहले वेस्टइंडीज के कप्तान क्रैग ब्रैथवेट ने टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी करने का फैसला किया. टॉस गवांने के बाद पहले बल्लेबाजी करने उतरी टीम इंडिया 128 ओवरों में 473 रन बनाकर सिमट गई. टीम इंडिया की तरफ से स्टार बल्लेबाज विराट कोहली ने सबसे ज्यादा 121 रन बनाए.

England are on the verge of levelling the Ashes after dominating day three Australia haven't picked a spinner on the ground of Warne's Ball of the Century Jonny Bairstow pulled off an great catch on day one and scored runs on Friday By David Lloyd for the Daily Mail Updated: 22:52 BST, 21 July 2023 e-mail View comments England are in a dominant position against Australia at the end of day three in the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. Some big hitting from Jonny Bairstow followed by some smart bowling from Mark Wood put Ben Stokes ' side in control of the game, with only rain now able to save Australia from defeat. A win would set up a thrilling final test at the Oval, but England must first wrap things up and pick up the final six wickets in the last two days. Friday played host to one of the best days of the series for the hosts as they dominated proceedings and reminded their opponents what they're about under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum. Here, Mail Sport columnist David 'Bumble' Lloyd cast his eye on a thrilling third day of the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford . Some big hitting from Jonny Bairstow means England moved closer to levelling the Ashes series The late Australia great Shane Warne would be seething at an Australia team without a spinner Australia captain Pat Cummins (pictured) has seemed bereft of ideas throughout the Test SHANE WOULD BE SEETHING I have never seen an Australia team so bereft of ideas — though I do have some sympathy for captain Pat Cummins because the injured Nathan Lyon was pivotal to their plans. But let me tell you something, not playing a frontline spinner at the venue where we saw the Ball of the Century would have made the great Shane Warne apoplectic! NO GRASSING UP STARC THIS TIME What about the dismissal of Harry Brook? He was caught on the boundary by Mitchell Starc, with his foot in the shadows of the boundary sponges. Boos reverberated around the ground because the spectators thought he was touching the boundary. But Brook was clearly out. No dramas. Obviously, Starc’s hands were not in contact with the grass! Mitchell Starc caught Harry Brook on the boundary - though close, there was no debate over the decision this time WHY IT'S SHADES OF GREY The new hotel at Old Trafford, which is grey, has caused a bit of a stir as the Point is red and the existing hotel is red, but I can exclusively reveal why. If you look from the air, you will see that the old pavilion in between the Point and the existing hotel is grey. They want to keep it symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing, which is marvellous if you’re paragliding in from the Trafford Centre… BE HERE NOW, NOEL... So the music battle moves on to Manchester. In third place were The Smiths — heaven knows they must be miserable now because they came behind The Fall. The winners were the Gallagher brothers, though Oasis won’t play here as it’s red and called Old Trafford. Ridiculous! Jonny Bairstow's spectacular catch to dismiss Mitchell Marsh paved the way for first innings runs for the England wicketkeeper MY SMOKING GUN There is a new Sustainability Terrace here which has solar lighting, a bat house (for the things that fly, not the ones you hit cricket balls with) and living walls. An unnamed media bod was sustaining himself out there with 20 Benson & Hedges as I walked past! I think he took it literally. BREATHTAKING BAIRSTOW Jonny Bairstow took a stunning catch to dismiss Mitchell Marsh in Australia’s first innings and then Stuart Broad said a great catch usually brings runs for Jonny. And so it did. What a breathtaking knock as Bairstow showed his true value to this side. He is such a confidence player.

On Friday, after another day when watching an England cricket team play the game made everyone inside Old Trafford feel glad to be alive , another day when sport lifted the soul with its joy and its derring-do, his words bore repeating. ‘The great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning,’ Blanchflower said. ‘It’s nothing of the kind. The game is about glory. It is about doing things in style, with a flourish, about going out and beating the other lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom.’ If he were alive now, we would probably call his philosophy Blanch-ball, because everything has to have a name so that we can more easily lionise it or ridicule it. If he were alive now, he would love this England team and he would recognise in their captain, Ben Stokes, a kindred spirit. Ben Stokes' England have gripped the nation with their style of play throughout the Ashes Jonny Bairstow's batting and Mark Wood's bowling meant England once again dominated at Old Trafford Stokes led his side off at the end of the day with the outfit in a position to level the series What a day. Again. What a day in an Ashes series that has gripped the nation like few others. What a day to be an England supporter and to see its team playing so audaciously and expressively and with a joie de vivre that cannot help but be infectious. What you call it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t have to have a name but it is wonderful to watch. Jonny Bairstow was central to the story and that made the narrative even more delicious. The England wicketkeeper was prey to Australian cynicism at Lord’s when he was the victim of the most controversial stumping in Ashes history and his assault on Australia’s bowling attack felt like a measure of sweet revenge. Bairstow was magnificent. He came to the crease with England at 437 for five and propelled them towards 500, past 500 and towards 600 with beautiful stroke play and power-hitting that was so brutal it even made Stokes’s jaw hit the floor as he watched from the England dressing room. One six, hoisted high over deep midwicket, and far into the stands, brought gasps from the crowd as well as roars of celebration. That took Bairstow to 86 off 71 balls, within sight of Gilbert Jessop’s quickest-ever England Test century, scored off 76 balls in 1902. ‘A cyclone of batting,’ the great Manchester Guardian cricket correspondent, Neville Cardus, called that innings and now journalists watched from the press gallery named after him at Old Trafford as Bairstow gave a passable impression of a tornado, scattering Australia and leaving the wreckage of them all around. Part of the magic of the day was seeing how boldly England went about their business, how fearlessly and with such joy in the game. Not for the first time in this series, the Australians were reduced to ringing the boundary with all of their outfielders. Their attitude screamed defeatism and bewilderment. England toyed with them, running quick singles even when the ball went through to the wicketkeeper. Alex Carey might have ‘stumped’ Bairstow at Lord’s but he couldn’t hit a barn door with a banjo at Old Trafford. Bairstow must have enjoyed that, too. The crowd certainly did. There was something strangely fitting about Bairstow, a man who has a complicated relationship with fortune, finally being left stranded on 99 not out. By then, England had reached 592, their eighth-highest Ashes total. To nobody’s great surprise, they had scored those runs faster than in any other of the biggest innings in Ashes history. The only other team to have scored at anything near this rate was Steve Waugh’s great Australia team. Stokes’s England outscore them easily. England, and Bairstow, went about their business boldly and fearlessly, enjoying the game Bairstow smashed an unbeaten 99 from 81 balls that included 10 fours and four sixes Alex Carey was humbled at Old Trafford after allowing Bairstow to run several byes Wood took three top-order Australian wickets to leave England needing just six more for victory The day ended with Mark Wood tearing in from the James Anderson End and snaring Steve Smith, still Australia’s most prized wicket, half an hour before the close and then Travis Head with 10 minutes to spare. With the Australians still 2-1 up, England are closing in on the greatest comeback in the annals even of this storied old contest. Only the weather can stop them here now. The rain will come on Saturday and give Australia respite. Maybe the bad weather will linger on Sunday and deliver them from their torture. Maybe Pat Cummins’s team will crawl over the line on bloodied hands and knees, giving thanks for Manchester’s dark clouds and dark mills, and retain the Ashes with a Test to spare, making the Oval an irrelevance. If the Australians survive, it will be a victory for pragmatism and conservatism. That will not change the way it looks in the history books but it will not steal away our memories of days like these, either. Days when England did things with style and with a flourish, days when they thrilled us with their determination to prove that the game is about glory.

Paceman Wood took three wickets to leave the tourists reeling on 113 for four in their second innings, still 162 behind England, who plundered 592 thanks to Jonny Bairstow ’s quick-fire 99. It now seems that only the heavy rain forecast over the weekend can prevent Ben Stokes ’ side from a commanding fourth Test victory that would take the series into a decider at the Oval next week. And Australia bowler Josh Hazlewood admitted: ‘I’d be very pleased if it rains. It would be great to lose a few overs. It would make our job a little easier of hanging in there. It is obviously forecast but forecasts can change all the time.’ England’s day-three hero Bairstow added: ‘We’ve done everything we can in the game and to get four wickets tonight puts them under pressure. Mark Wood took three wickets as England moved a step closer to levelling the series Jonny Bairstow took Australia to the sword as England dominated day three of the fourth Test ‘The weather is the weather. I am not Michael Fish. The weathermen have been right and they have been wrong. We will still turn up with the mindset of taking six wickets.’ England’s utter dominance at Old Trafford continued on Friday, as they added another 208 runs to their overnight score of 384 for four to give them a huge first-innings lead of 275. Bairstow smashed 99 off 81 balls, including four sixes, before he was left stranded one short of a thrilling century when Jimmy Anderson was trapped lbw to Cameron Green. It was the Yorkshireman’s highest score since breaking his leg and dislocating his ankle in a freak incident last August – and he was quick to take aim at those who have criticised his Ashes displays. ‘To score 99, you’re pretty happy, aren’t you?’ said Bairstow. ‘Everyone thinks I play better when people have a go at me. It gets a bit tiresome. I’ve played a lot of cricket now. To keep being told you’re rubbish… if I was that rubbish I wouldn’t have played 94 Tests. Australia's Josh Hazlewood admitted he would be happy to watch it rain at Old Trafford ‘There's been some chitter-chatter that has been rather interesting at times, especially when there's not been many conversations around how my ankle is. ‘I’m a proud man to be taking the field after that injury. When you have an injury of that significance, there's a chance you don't play sport again.’ On criticism of his wicketkeeping, he added: ‘There have been a couple that have gone down, but I’ve not kept wicket for three years. I’ve got nine pins, a plate and a wire that goes through my ankle. I’m delighted to be where I’m at.’ Bairstow was also asked about his controversial dismissal in the second innings at Lord’s and said: ‘It wasn’t the way I wanted to be out. I’ve even heard about it in club cricket, which is not necessarily the example you want to set. You want to play it tough but fair. On a different day, it doesn’t happen.’ Share or comment on this article: Josh Hazlewood admits Australia are praying for rain to help them 'hang on' after paceman Mark Wood struck three crucial blows to put England on the brink of Ashes-levelling win e-mail Add comment Comments 6 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.
