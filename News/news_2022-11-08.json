Taylor's comments follow a disappointing group-stage exit from Australia at the T20 World Cup at the weekend, with New Zealand, England, India and Pakistan qualifying for the semi finals.

Taylor was full of praise for Australia's neighbours and suggested that they could learn a thing or two from the Black Caps. ﻿\"T﻿hey do it better than any team in the world at the moment, to be totally honest,\" he told 2GB's Wide World of Sports Radio . \"To play in each format of the game ... they've got us covered in that regard. New Zealand is a smaller nation with less people playing the game, they do it better than just about anyone at the moment. \"Somehow they've been able to put three different teams on the park, obviously there's players who play the three formats, but they're able to put them on the park and be up there with the world's best. \"They won the inaugural Test championship where they beat India at Lord's, they lost the (50 over) World Cup final in 2019 to England which they probably should've won, and once again they were in the T20 final last year and they're in the semi finals this week. \"Every tournament, they're there or thereabouts, so they're doing something better than Australian cricket is doing, India, England. They're doing it better than we are, and that's the facts.\" Australia's current T20 outfit is an ageing one, with ﻿ Cameron Green the only member of the World Cup squad currently aged below 25. Eleven members of the squad are aged 30 or over, and Taylor suggested that it was time to start grooming young players through the T20 side. \"I think they've got to look at all the players,\" he said. \"﻿If you look at our T20 side, we've got Davey (Warner) who's 36, Aaron Finch is 36, Matty Wade who's 34, Steve Smith 33.

In two years' time, do we want them to be our best T20 bowlers? I don't think we do. \"If we want them to still be our best Test match bowlers in two years' time, it's going to be very difficult for them to be our best T20 bowlers at the same time. \"So we've got to start thinking about the various teams and who is going to be the make-up of those teams.﻿\" For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here !","pubDate":"2022-11-07 20:43:30","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2022/11/464644/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Star’: Cricket legend Chris Gayle impressed by Aston Villa player after recent display","link":"https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2022/11/07/star-cricket-legend-chris-gayle-impressed-by-aston-villa-player-after-recent-display/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=star-cricket-legend-chris-gayle-impressed-by-aston-villa-player-after-recent-display","keywords":["Aston Villa","Competitions","Football","Premier League","Teams","leon bailey"],"creator":["Amir Mir"],"video_url":null,"description":"West Indies cricket legend Chris Gayle labelled Leon Bailey a ‘star athlete’ on Instagram after Aston Villa’s 3-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday.

The post ‘Star’: Cricket legend Chris Gayle impressed by Aston Villa player after recent display appeared first on HITC.","content":"Amir Mir West Indies cricket legend Chris Gayle labelled Leon Bailey a ‘star athlete’ on Instagram after Aston Villa’s 3-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday. The Villa winger scored the first goal of the Unai Emery reign, which started with a deserved three points, and also saw the Midlands side win their first game against Man United on home soil in the Premier League since 1995. That’s some start for the 51-year-old, who has another test against the same opposition coming up on Thursday night in the EFL Cup at Old Trafford. Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images It will be interesting to see how that game starts because, on Sunday, the home team were out of the blocks from the get-go, not letting Man United breathe. Bailey was unplayable in the first half and he danced on the ball like the big-money signing fans were expecting to see when he first arrived. When the Jamaica international stated on Instagram that he ‘loves scoring in front of the Holte End’, several players responded to his post in the comments. Emery has already made enormous change for 'amazing' Aston Villa ace 'I couldn't breathe': Leon Bailey shares what linesman said after being elbowed by Martinez As well as being praised by Chris Gayle, his fellow teammate Jan Bednerak added ‘what a player’, whilst his stepdad Craig Butler told him ‘we dreamt about this day’. This content could not be loaded See more View Instagram Post BAILEY COOKING SINCE GERRARD’S EXIT It just goes to show when you put a player in his natural position, whether it’s out wide, or in the case, on Sunday, as a striker, he will produce the goods. Under Steven Gerrard, Bailey was way too narrow and he wasn’t provided with the space to dance with the ball, because when he does, the opposition hate playing against him. Even during Villa’s 4-0 defeat to Newcastle last week, he was one of the very few positives. But with Emery now in the dugout, it wouldn’t be a surprise if a player like Bailey is the one who benefits most because he’s the Spaniard’s type of player.

Mumbai Indians superstar Suryakumar Yadav in particular has been nothing short of spectacular. SKY is representing the country in his second T20 World Cup and he is also playing in Australia for the first time, but his 360-degree shot-making capabilities has taken the world by storm and has left the opposition speechless on numerous occasions. The Board of Control for Cricket in India has recently posted a video with both Ravichandran Ashwin and Suryakumar Yadav speaking their hearts out. In the video, Ashwin asked Surya about how he decides his shots and Surya explained his thought process behind it. It was Surya's turn now as he asked Ashwin about his mindset before going into the all-important semi-finals.

He had played astonishing knocks in various seasons of IPL and T20Is for India since his debut in March 2021. But the doubts about him faring in the bouncy conditions of Australia, a country where he had never played before have been thrown in the bin at the end of the Super 12 stage, where India topped Group 2 and have entered the semifinals. In India being table-toppers in their group, Suryakumar had a major role to play, hitting an astonishing 61 not out off 25 balls, bringing out his audacious scoops, silken wrist work, constant usage of the crease and magnificent lofts to propel India to 186/5. After India's 71-run win over Zimbabwe at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , head coach Rahul Dravid attributed Suryakumar's scintillating run to the absolute clarity he has had in his processes as well as strategies ever since he burst on the international scene. \"It's incredible. That's why he is the No.1 T20 player in the world at the moment, because of that consistency in a format where scoring at a strike rate that he does. It's not easy to be consistent with the kind of strike rate he's going at. So, it's just fantastic the way he's playing. I think he's been very clear in his processes. He's very clear about his tactics. \"He's been absolutely phenomenal for us. He's just a joy to watch. It's a pleasure to watch him bat when he's in that kind of form. Every time it's like he puts on a show, without a doubt,\" said Dravid in the post-match press conference. In Sydney, against the Netherlands, Suryakumar changed the tempo of the innings with a quickfire 25-ball fifty. In Perth, against South Africa, where everyone fell apart, he stood tall on a pacy, bouncy pitch to get a fighting fifty. In Melbourne, against Zimbabwe, he put a masterclass in death overs batting to get India to a mammoth total and become the third-highest run-scorer in the tournament. While acknowledging the hard yards put in by the right-hander, Dravid also noted the work in fitness put in by Suryakumar, which has helped India get singles and doubles with quick running between the wickets. \"He's worked very hard. One of the things about Surya is just the amount of hard work that he's put in the nets, in thinking about his game, his fitness. If I look at Surya from a couple of years ago, just to see how he takes care of his body and the amount of time he spends on his fitness. He's just really earning the reward for a lot of the hard work that he's put in on and off the field, and long may it continue.\" (IANS) Also Read: T20I record for Star Indian batter Suryakumar Yadav Also Watch:","pubDate":"2022-11-07 16:31:02","image_url":"https://assets.sentinelassam.com/h-upload/2022/11/07/410146-408904-suryakumar-yadav-1.avif","source_id":"sentinel","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20I record for Star Indian batter Suryakumar Yadav","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/t20i-record-for-star-indian-batter-suryakumar-yadav-622100","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Yadav accomplished this feat in his side's final Super 12 stage match against Zimbabwe at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG)","content":"MELBOURNE: Star Indian batter Suryakumar Yadav on Sunday became the first Indian player to score 1,000 T20I runs in a calendar year. The batter accomplished this feat in his side's final Super 12 stage match against Zimbabwe at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). In the match, Suryakumar put his perfect finishing touches to make sure India finished their innings on a high. He scored 61* off just 25 balls, consisting of six fours and four sixes.

The unpredictable nature of the tournament meant that this clash became a virtual knockout game as Netherlands shocked South Africa by 13 runs at the same venue earlier in the day. With the winner to go into the semifinals, Pakistan made the most of the unexpected lifeline as luck smiled on them to enter the last-four for the second time in as many editions of the tournament. Afridi took four wickets while conceding 22 runs in his four overs to restrict Bangladesh to 127/8, after being 70/1 at one point. In reply, Pakistan chased down the total with 11 balls remaining despite some wobbles along the way to complete an entry into the semifinals after losing their first two matches in the tournament. Pushed into bowling first, Pakistan looked a little jittery inside the powerplay despite Shaheen taking out Litton Das. There were some dropped catches and leg-spinner Shadab Khan struggled to find his rhythm against the left-handed pair of Najmul Hossain Shanto and Soumya Sarkar. Things changed drastically in the 11th over when Sarkar's reverse sweep went straight to point off Shadab. One immediately brought two as Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan was trapped lbw in controversial circumstances. After being lbw by on-field umpire Adrian Holdstock when he missed the line of a leg-break from Shadab, Shakib immediately took the DRS. But the DRS didn't help him in reversing the decision as it didn't spot the inside edge that he was sure to get. Shakib was left heartbroken when the TV umpire did not change the on-field decision and had to go reluctantly off the field. From there, Shanto got his fifty and was out for 54 off 48 balls. But there was no coming back for Bangladesh from that Shakib dismissal as their lack of clarity in batting through middle-overs hurt them yet again. Shaheen came back to pick out Mosaddek Hossain, Nurul Hasan and Taskin Ahmed in quick succession to get his career-best figures in T20I cricket, restricting Bangladesh to an under-par total. In the chase, Mohammad Rizwan was dropped for nought by Hasan on the third ball. He made Bangladesh pay by sharing an opening stand of 56 in 10.3 overs with captain Babar Azam, who was out of touch in his knock of 25. But Bangladesh came back to remove Azam and Rizwan (32 off 32 balls) in quick succession, followed by Litton Das' direct hit catching Mohammad Nawaz short of his crease in a spectacular run-out. But with 52 needed from 42 balls, Mohammad Haris hit an 18-ball 31, hitting two sixes and a four while Shan Masood slammed two fours in three balls off Shakib to ease the pressure. Though Haris and Iftikhar Ahmed fell quickly, Masood and Shadab ensured the chase was completed for Pakistan to enter the semifinals. Brief scores: Bangladesh 127/8 in 20 overs (Najmul Hossain Shanto 54, Afif Hossain 24 not out; Shaheen Shah Afridi 4/22, Shadab Khan 2/30) lost to Pakistan 128/5 in 18.1 overs (Mohammad Rizwan 32, Mohammad Haris 31, Nasum Ahmed 1/14, Mustafizur Rahman 1/21) by five wickets.

After K.L Rahul gave India a good start with his 35-ball 51, his second consecutive fifty in the tournament, and Suryakumar Yadav smacked a whirlwind 61 not out off just 25 balls, they reached a mammoth 186/5 in 20 overs, the bowlers made short work of the Zimbabwe batters to bowl them out for 115 in 17.2 overs. It meant India finished on top of Group 2 with eight points and will meet England in the second semifinal at Adelaide Oval on November 10, while Pakistan will face off against New Zealand in the first semifinal at Sydney Cricket Ground on November 9. After Zimbabwe began with nine dot balls, Rohit Sharma got India's first boundary by presenting the full face of the bat for a gorgeous straight drive off Tendai Chatara in the second over. In the next over, KL Rahul swivelled Richard Ngarava for a six over deep square leg. After Rohit placed a cut wide of backward point off Blessing Muzarabani in the fourth over, the tall pacer bowled a short ball to the Indian skipper, who pulled it straight to the fielder at deep square leg, departing for 15. Kohli got off the mark on the very first delivery by clipping Muzarabani through fine-leg for four and whipping Wellington Masakadza wide of mid-on later apart from finding the singles very quickly. Rahul, who played out a maiden opening over, was timing his cuts, lofts, swipes against the turn and pulls off the backfoot with class to fetch boundaries quickly. But Zimbabwe made a comeback by picking three wickets in 11 balls. Kohli holed out to long-off off Sean Williams, as the 60-run stand for the second wicket was broken. Rahul, after launching Sikandar Raza down the ground for a six to complete his fifty in 34 balls, holed out to long-off on the very next ball. Rishabh Pant played a flat slog-sweep off Williams, but Ryan Burl ran full tilt to his left from long-on and flung himself to take a superb diving catch. But Suryakumar got India moving by smacking Muzarabani for a brace of fours -- scoop over fine-leg was followed by lofting over mid-off. Two balls later, Hardik Pandya flicked superbly through backward square leg for four as India ended 16th over with 18 runs. Suryakumar stepped up the attack by placing full tosses from Ngarava for four and six to take 12 runs off the 17th over. Suryakumar continued to toy with the field and bowlers' minds, scooping and lofting Chatara for four and six respectively in the 18th over. Against Muzarabani in the 19th over, he beautifully timed a straight drive that oozed elegance of the highest quality. Though Pandya fell, Suryakumar continued to play jaw-dropping shots in the final over off Ngarava. He moved way across the off-stump to whip off his wrists over backward square leg for six. After reaching his fifty in 23 balls, he repeated the swipe wide of off-stump again to pick another four and ended the innings by scooping over fine-leg for six as India got 79 runs in the last five overs. In defence of 186, India had success on the very first ball as Wesley Madhevere tried to reach out for a drive on a swinging away delivery from Bhuvneshwar Kumar, but was caught by a diving short cover. In the next over, Arshdeep Singh lured Regis Chakabva for a drive, but the late swing in off a fuller length meant the ball went through the gate to hit the stumps. With Bhuvneshwar and Arshdeep getting the new ball to swing, it made life difficult for Zimbabwe. Sean Williams swung away from the body and was caught at the third man on the last ball of power-play off Mohammed Shami. Ervine chipped in the air off Hardik Pandya and was caught by the bowler stretching his right hand. Shami struck again by trapping Tony Munyonga plumb lbw. Burl was impressive with his sweep and reverse-sweeps, one of which got him a six off Ravichandran Ashwin apart from smashing anything with width for boundaries off the off-spinner, Pandya and Axar Patel. But Ashwin struck to break the 60-run partnership, forcing Burl to go for an on-drive on a fuller ball and rattle the stumps. He then took out Wellington Masakadza and Richard Ngarava in quick succession to bag a three-fer. Raza holed out on a pull in the deep off Pandya while Tendai Chatara gave Axar Patel a simple catch off his bowling to give India a huge win. Brief scores: India 186/5 in 20 overs (Suryakumar Yadav 61 not out, KL Rahul 51; Sean Williams 2-9, Sikandar Raza 1-18) beat Zimbabwe (Ryan Burl 35, Sikandar Raza 34; Ravichandran Ashwin 3-22, Mohammed Shami 2-14) by 71 runs.

Gunathilaka was arrested from the team's hotel in Sydney's central business district, while the rest of side has flown back to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) president Shammi Silva has said \"we are supporting [Gunathilaka], definitely,\" according to ESPNCricinfo, but then declined to elaborate further. However, soon after that, the cricket board issued a fresh statement suspending Gunathilaka \"from all forms of cricket with immediate effect... after being informed that Mr. Gunathilaka was arrested and charged with sexual assault of a woman in Australia.\" The SLC statement also said it will \"will take the necessary steps to promptly carry out an inquiry into the alleged offense and, upon conclusion of the court case in Australia, steps will be taken to penalise the said player if found guilty\". The statement further read that it \"adopts a \"zero tolerance\" policy for any such conduct by a player and will provide all the required support to the Australian law enforcement authorities to carry out an impartial inquiry into the incident\". Magistrate Robert Williams in Sydney stated that Gunathilaka had no criminal history, but the bail bid was refused. Gunathilaka's lawyer Anand Amaranath called the decision \"disappointing\" and confirmed that his client would be appealing to the Supreme Court, the ESPNCricnfo report further revealed. Even though Gunathilaka would be released from custody - he is currently in a correctional facility - if granted bail, he will have to stay put in Australia \"until the case is finalised\", Amaranath said. As the charges are serious, the process could even take longer than a year. The lawyer also said SLC would be footing Gunathilaka's legal expenses, at least for now. \"I've been communicating with people from all levels at the board,\" Amaranath added.

The former World No. 1 T20I batsman Malan picked up a groin injury and was forced to limp off the field during England's final Super 12 fixture against Sri Lanka last week. The 2010 champions defeated Sri Lanka by four wickets at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) and qualified for the last four on a superior net run-rate. \"He has been one of our best players for a number of years. I don't know but to be honest with you it is not looking great. He went for scans yesterday and when he arrived, we don't really know much but it is not looking great,\" Moeen told BBC. The 2010 champions, England, have not been at their best form in the T20 World Cup 2022 , having lost to Ireland in the Super 12s and clinched an unconvincing win over Sri Lanka. Malan also has not been in great touch, returning with scores of 18, 35, and 3 not out in the three games he batted. Because of the injury, he couldn't bat against Sri Lanka. In the same interview, if England would be underdogs against India in Adelaide on Thursday (Nov. 9), Moeen agreed to the same, saying his side has not played to its potential this tournament. \"England are the underdogs. India have been playing fantastic over the last year and even if you look at the tournament they have been playing really well. I don't think we have to be honest, we have been a little behind,\" Moeen added further. England, who lost to West Indies in the T20 World Cup final in 2016, have now made it to the semi-final for the second straight year, while India had crashed out after the group stage in 2021. Nevertheless, India are being considered as favourites to win the semi-final 2 at Adelaide Oval on Thursday, especially since they are coming off a massive 71-run victory over Zimbabwe. India secured a close win in Adelaide earlier in the tournament when they took on Bangladesh and Virat Kohli, who has an excellent record on the ground, was the Player of the Match for scoring a match-winning knock of 64. In a post-match interview, Kohli said that whenever he plays at Adelaide Oval, he is \"meant to enjoy and keep batting.\" \"As soon as I knew the World Cup is in Australia, I was grinning from ear to ear. Good cricketing shots will be the key here is what I know. Hitting through the line is what I do in every format. It is just an extension for me. I love playing at this ground. This makes me feel at home. When I come to Adelaide, I am meant to enjoy myself and keep batting,\" added Kohli.

Their love story between the countries of India and Pakistan has been something to brag about. They got married in 2010, and in 2018 they welcomed their gorgeous son Izhaan into the world. There have been numerous rumors that Sania Mirza and Shoaib Mallik are on the verge of divorcing each other, and their relationship is in trouble. The ace tennis player's latest cryptic post has only served to feed the rumors of her impending divorce. She posted this on her Instagram stories: \"Where do shattered hearts go? to locate Allah \". Sania and Shoaib wed in April 2010, and even then, the announcement of their union stirred up a lot of debate because Shoaib is Pakistani and Sania is Indian. When Shoaib Malik and Sania Mirza announced their engagement, they came under a lot of criticism from people who questioned why she was marrying a Pakistani and said the union wouldn't last. And now, 12 years after getting married, there are reports of their divorce. Izhaan Mirza Malik's birthday was recently celebrated by the pair in Dubai, and the cricketer released images of the event rather than Sania. Since the news of Shoaib Malik cheating on Sania, while he was filming a show broke, it has been widely reported in Pakistani media online. Through their cryptic post, the couple's fans are attempting to figure out whether things are going well between them. Even with all the speculations, Shoaib and Sania haven't publicly addressed the reports of their separation, which have been making headlines every day. And only if they are splitting up and it will break the hearts of their admirers. Sania is one of the most renowned athletes in India since she has brought honor to her country by playing brilliantly and winning significant accolades.

Set a testing 159 to reach the semi-finals, South Africa lost regular wickets on a tricky pitch and were tied down by an inspired Dutch side. The defeat means Pakistan, who beat Bangladesh by five wickets in the game that followed at the Adelaide Oval, leapfrog the Proteas and progress with India, who have qualified courtesy of South Africa’s defeat. After a tournament packed full of surprises, this stunning result is possibly the biggest shock of them all. South Africa were seen as one of the tournament favourites while Netherlands are the lowest-ranked side in the Super 12 stage. “We played well up until this point in the tournament,” captain Temba Bavuma said. “Again, we faltered when it really mattered. It will be a hard one to swallow. “At the end of the day it just was not good enough.”","pubDate":"2022-11-07 13:46:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"leadership","country":["nigeria"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup 2022: Ricky Ponting is in awe of Virat Kohli, reveals his favourite Kohli memory | READ","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup-2022-ricky-ponting-is-in-awe-of-virat-kohli-reveals-his-favourite-kohli-memory-ind-vs-eng-semifinals-adelaide-2022-11-07-822039","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"T20 World Cup 2022: India vs Pakistan, whenever this happens, it is more than a match.

India, Pakistan, New Zealand, and England qualified for the final four but not before plenty of drama, upsets, and shocking results. New Zealand and India qualified for the semi-finals after relatively straightforward results. England were shocked by Ireland in the Super 12 stage but Jos Buttler's men managed to sneak through to the final four, thanks to their big win over Sri Lanka in their final group game. England, New Zealand, and defending champions Australia were tied on 7 points each but Aaron Finch's men were ousted due to an inferior Net Run Rate. On the other hand, Pakistan looked dead and buried after they began their Super 12 campaign on a poor note, losing to arch-rivals India and being upset by Zimbabwe. However, Babar Azam's men managed to sneak through to the semi-final, beating Bangladesh on the final matchday of Group 2. Pakistan were hugely helped by South Africa losing to the Netherlands as the Proteas ended the group stage with just 5 points, one less than Babar's men. Not many expected South Africa to slip in their final Super 12 match but the shock result opened the doors for Pakistan, who defeated Bangladesh in a virtual quarter-final in Adelaide. History seems to be repeating itself. There have been plenty of similarities between Pakistan's triumphant 1992 World Cup campaign and their run in the ongoing T20 World Cup. India's campaign and the events around the team have also resembled their triumphant run in 2011. Pakistan won their maiden 50-over World Cup under Imran Khan's captaincy in 1992 and India went on to win their 2nd 50-over World Cup crown under MS Dhoni's captaincy. Here are some striking similarities between Pakistan's 1992 and 2022 campaigns. Fun facts aside, the semi-finals are expected to be fiercely-contested with all 4 teams looking to peak at the right time. India, who have put behind the disappointment of the T20 World Cup 2021 early exit, have ticked all the right boxes in the lead-up to the big-ticket clash in Adelaide. On the other hand, Pakistan will be charged up to not let go of the hard-earned opportunity to go the distance Down Under.","pubDate":"2022-11-07 11:59:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka suspend Gunathilaka from all forms of cricket following arrest","link":"https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/sri-lanka-suspend-gunathilaka-forms-115745458.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-07 11:57:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Danushka Gunathilaka: Sri Lanka star banned from all forms of cricket","link":"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/sri-lanka-danushka-gunathilaka-banned-cricket-b2219361.html","keywords":["Cricket","Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The 31-year-old Sri Lankan batter was arrested from the team hotel in Sydney on Sunday morning","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-07 11:53:53","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/11/06/10/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"I used to play rubber-ball cricket...: Suryakumar Yadav reveals how he developed 'SCOOP SHOT' - Check","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-vs-eng-semi-final-t20-world-cup-2022-suryakumar-yadav-reveals-how-he-developed-scoop-shot-check-2532240.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"On the last ball of India innings, having enthralled the 82,000 crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Richard Ngarava had attempted to bowl a wide yorker.
