She’s worked hard on developing that side of her game and thoroughly deserves the opportunity.”Litchfield, who made her WBBL debut in 2019 as a 16-year-old, was earmarked as a future Australian cricketer from a young age.The left-hander became a stalwart for the Thunder and the Breakers while juggling school and university commitments, earning a call-up to the Australia A squad earlier this year.The teenager proved her worth by finishing the three-match series against England A as the highest run-scorer, cracking back-to-back fifties in Canberra.“I look at the top-order for Australia, and they’re amazing,” Litchfield told news.com.au earlier this year.“It’s going to take a lot more runs to put my name up, or for a few people to retire I think for me to get an opportunity.“I’d love to be playing cricket for Australia. It’s one of my goals, and I think if I can keep getting better, opportunities will come up.”Litchfield was the Thunder’s highest run-scorer this season, plundering 280 runs at 23.33 with two fifties.“The really pleasing thing for Pheobes is she’s not getting too distracted or caught up in all the commentary,” Haynes told news.com.au last month.“It’s speaking for itself at the moment, in terms of her putting some performances on the board. She’s certainly not alone in doing that, and that’s really exciting for the game.”Garth, born in Dublin, made her international debut in 2010 as a 14-year-old before becoming a stalwart of the Irish national team.The right-hander, named Ireland‘s women’s player of the decade, scored 1210 runs and claimed 65 wickets for the country of her birth before relocating to Australia in 2020.Garth obtained permanent residency soon after, making her eligible to represent Australia under International Cricket Council regulations.“The ultimate reason I made the decision (to move to Australia) was because I wanted to play cricket for a living,” she told cricket.com.au last year.“To be on a full-time contract and play WNCL and WBBL as a local and play cricket for a living so I didn’t have to have another job like I did back home.“If there comes a time where I’ve had a couple of good seasons and I’ve qualified as a local, if an opportunity came (to play for Australia) that’d be awesome.”Garth, named the Stars’ Player of the Year in 2021, scored 115 runs and claimed 12 wickets in the WBBL this summer.The first T20 between India and Australia gets underway at Mumbai’s D.Y.

Tasmanian all-rounder Heather Graham also earned a call-up on the back of 237 runs and eight wickets for the Hobart Hurricanes in the WBBL. National selection chief Shawn Flegler said Litchfield had taken her game “to another level” in the WBBL this season for the Sydney Thunder, finish the season as the team’s leading run-scorer with 280 runs and two half-centuries. The selections, for five T20 games India, come just over two months before Australia heads to South Africa to defend the T20 World Cup title Lanning’s team won in 2020. “We’ve had an eye on Phoebe for a while and she’s really taken her game to the next level this summer,” Flegler said. “She’s made her mark at the top of the order for the Sydney Thunder and we’re looking forward to seeing what she can do in Australian colours.“These five matches form an important part of the team’s preparations for the upcoming T20 World Cup in South Africa as well as providing an opportunity for some players to gain some experience in Indian conditions.”Veteran all-rounder Ellyse Perry held her spot after a bumper WBBL with the bat but there will be no Lanning, who remains on a self-imposed break, with vice-captain Rachael Haynes also moving in to retirement. Healy will lead the team having been elevated to vice-captaincy after Haynes announcement. “Without Meg and Rachael, this series will provide opportunities for players particularly in the top order, so we’re looking forward to seeing who puts their hand up,” Flegler said. “It’s pleasing to have been able to reward Phoebe, Kim and Heather for strong form throughout the WBBL and hopefully they get the chance to show what they can do at some stage during the series.”Garth, an opening bowler, could get her first turn in Australian colours having begun her international career with Ireland as a 14-year-old, before going on to play more than 100 games for her country of birth. Now 26 and an Australian citizen, she has been starring for Victoria and the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash.“Kim’s another who’s been in our thinking, she’s had a couple of strong seasons with the ball and adds extra depth to our pace bowling stocks,” Flegler said. . “Heather hasn’t had many opportunities to break into the side, but she’s toiled away with both bat and ball in domestic cricket. She adds depth to the middle order and provides Shelley and Alyssa with another pace bowling option.”The Australians will play five T2os in India from December 9-20AUSTRALIAN SQUADAlyssa Healy (C), Tahlia McGrath, Darcie Brown, Nicola Carey, Ashleigh Gardner, Kim Garth, Heather Graham, Grace Harris, Jess Jonassen, Alana King, Phoebe Litchfield, Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Megan Schutt, Annabel Sutherland AUSTRALIAN TOUR OF INDIA1st T20I: Friday, 9 December, DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai, 7pm local time/12:30am AEDT2nd T20I: Sunday, 11 December, DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai, 7pm local time/12:30am AEDT3rd T20I: Wednesday, 14 December, Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai, 7pm local time/12:30am AEDT4th T20I: Saturday, 17 December, Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai, 7pm local time/12:30am AEDT5th T20I: Tuesday, 20 December, Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai, 7pm local time/12:30am AEDT","pubDate":"2022-11-21 21:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: Black Caps captain Kane Williamson to miss third T20 against India to attend medical appointment","link":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/sport/cricket-black-caps-captain-kane-williamson-to-miss-third-t20-against-india-to-attend-medical-appointment/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Black Caps captain Kane Williamson will miss the third T20 against India in Napier on Tuesday to attend a pre-arranged medical appointment.

India were expected to try out a bunch of players after another World Cup debacle but if the team combination for the second T20 was any indication, they seemed reluctant to start with a clean slate. Take out the individual brilliance of Suryakumar Yadav, the team would have struggled to post 160 on Sunday, a grim reminder of its travails in the World Cup Down Under. India’s powerplay approach has been a major concern. Rishabh Pant was tried at the top with Ishan Kishan in the second game but the move did not work. Considering Pant’s class, one can expect him to fire in the series-decider. Samson is another batter who can make instant impact but the team did not start with him. Going by skipper Hardik Pandya’s post match comments, the management is unlikely to make too many changes for the third T20. India lead the series 1-0 with the series opener washed out. “I don’t know (about changes for the next game). I’d like to give everyone in the squad a chance but it’s just one more game, so it’s a bit tough,” said Hardik, who is seen as the next full captain in the shortest format. Shubman Gill was in the running for opening too in the absence of senior players but the team went ahead with two left-handers. He is likely to get his chances only in the ODI series to follow. Pandya is keen on having more batters who can bowl in the playing eleven and Deepak Hooda has given him one option. However, the biggest disappointment was the non-inclusion of Umran Malik in the first game. It has been proved that there is a pressing needed for an out and out pace bowler in T20 cricket and the New Zealand series is crucial to the development of the Jammu and Kashmir-based tearaway pacer. In Jasprit Bumrah’s absence, Malik, who played three T20s earlier this year, should be exposed to the pressure of playing a top team and given a long run. Playing his first game in a while, Yuzvendra Chahal showed why he should be a regular in the team but fellow wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav might only get to play the ODIs. Facing a must win scenario, New Zealand will take the field without their skipper Kane Williamson who will miss the game to due to a pre-arranged medical appointment. In his absence, the team will rely even more on opener Finn Allen and Glenn Phillips down the order to put the opposition under pressure. The home bowlers leaked way too many runs in the death overs and they will be looking to correct that. New Zealand will also have to find a way to stop Surya, who is in the form of his life. “Suryakumar played an in incredible innings out there. Everyone watched in amazement, some of the shots be played. We have had a few discussions already and we will have few more tomorrow before the game around how to combat him,” said New Zealand head coach Gary Stead.

Five games, five tons and N Jagadeesan has owned the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy with bucket loads of runs for Tamil Nadu at top of the order. While the four hundreds on the trot had everyone talking, it was the domination against Arunachal Pradesh that made him the toast of social media on Monday afternoon.277 runs off 141 balls in an innings laced with 25 4s and 15 6s is no ordinary feat. Even if it came against Arunachal Pradesh. The right-hander rewrote record books during the knock and became the only player to hit five List A hundreds on the trot. He overtook Kumar Sangakkara, Alviro Petersen, and Devdutt Padikkal who had earlier managed four consecutive hundreds in the format. Jagadeesan’s 277 is also the highest individual score in men’s List A cricket as the previous best was 268 by Alistair Brown back in 2002. Yes, 20 years ago!The wicketkeeper-batter got out in the 42nd over and certainly had lot of time and deliveries to overhaul the 300-run mark. It’s not every day that a player accumulates these many runs in a single innings, that too in a 50-over format, and the disappointment of missing the milestone was evident in his voice after a record-breaking day.“The ball was there… I went with my instinct and went through with the shot. It is going to haunt me for a very long time but I am really happy with the effort,” N Jagadeesan tells cricketnext.com in an exclusive chat.The contest between Tamil Nadu and Arunachal Pradesh was the 100th fixture of the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy and it was a memorable day for Jagadeesan, and Tamil Nadu. The 26-year-old has been on song this season and he says it’s been the pre-season work and the outings with his team India Cements in the Chennai league which helped him hit the right zone before the domestic season got underway.“I feel it was the Chennai league which kind of put me in the right zone. In the five matches I played, I had two hundreds and three fifties which kind of put me in the right zone. A lot of work, continuous work, has happened behind the scene and I am extremely proud to see the results. My TN coach, coach Prasanna, my father, and everyone has put in a lot of work with me. It’s been a disciplined and cautious effort which I have put in, day in and day out with them, and now the results are coming my way,” says a very proud Jagadeesan.#Jagadeesan (277) misses out on triple hundred. Gets a big ovation from teammates after world record List A score. @sportstarweb #VijayHazareTrophy2022 pic.twitter.com/s8CKYgUXsc— Ashwin Achal (@AshwinAchal) November 21, 2022 Control the controllableJust a few days back, CSK decided to release N Jagadeesan but the “bad news” didn’t affect his preparations and mindset for the ongoing season as he went about scoring runs with a lot of consistency and domination. The stumper has been around the circuit for a long time and always had the reputation of clearing the ropes with ease and hitting the ball really long and far, but this season saw a very patient and composed Jagadeesan in the middle.“The franchise decided to release me and it was something not in my hands. Obviously, it is bad news for a cricketer to be released by a franchise but I have no control over that. What I do have control over is my process, my preparation, and my cricket. I cautiously wanted to bat with the mindset of batting long this season and am very proud to see it come off so well. My mindset was to just focus on the present and what I can control, so it was only my batting and how I can do my best there. The ball does a bit early on here in Bengaluru so I cautiously wanted to see off the first few overs and then build my innings from there on, and bat deep and long,” reveals Jagadeesan.It is not just Jagadeesan who was happy to see the way things have come off for him this season. Baba Aparajith, who has also led Tamil Nadu in the past, was very proud of his teammate’s run and was quick to point out the change he has seen this year.“I think the biggest change I would say, from the outside which I have seen, is the way he is building and controlling the innings. That has been brilliant and the manner in which he is pacing his knocks has been really good,” says Aparajith.Aparajith, who bats in the middle order in the fifty-over format, has not had a good hit in the middle yet because of the consistency shown by the pair of Jagadeesan and Sai Sudarshan at top of the order. The all-rounder isn’t complaining and is very pleased with the openers’ show.“It’s good for the team, no? I mean it’s so good to have the kind of starts they have given us this season and put us in such a good position. And to be honest Jagadeesan’s record will be here for a very long time. It’s not easy to score five hundreds on the trot in the format. The consistency has been absolutely brilliant and am very happy and proud of his efforts,” says Aparajith.While spirits were very high in the Tamil Nadu camp, opposition Arunachal Pradesh were on a leather hunt as the Baba Indrajith-led unit scored a mammoth 501. As many as 45 boundaries and 17 sixes were hit during TN’s innings. Arunachal Pradesh batsman Techi Doria saw the carnage from close quarters and noted that Jagadeesan was in a destructive mood right from the word go.‘Wo maarne hi aaya tha’“Wo maarne hi aaya tha (he came with a mindset to go after the bowling) and played his shots. The wicket was good for batting and he kept scoring runs with ease,” says Doria after a long day in the field. Did Doria keep count of the balls lost? “(laughs) bahut bhar gaya, itna dhyaan nahi diya (quite a few went missing but didn’t really keep count)”.Arunachal Pradesh failed to up a fight against Tamil Nadu but Doria feels the side will only learn from these experiences and more games against top teams will give them invaluable experience.“Even Tamil Nadu would have started someday, right? So the same is for us. They have been playing for a long time and we will only get better playing games and learning from the players we see. The more games we play on turf, the better we will get. It’s a matter of time and more game time and we will be up there with these teams,” says Doria.Business as usualAfter a record-shattering day, Jagadeesan has returned to his room and will repeat the process before prepping for the next fixture. With not much time between games, the right-hander prefers to rest and sleep well to be in the right zone before taking the field. So 100 No.6 loading?“(laughs) As I said I will stay in the present and just keep repeating what I have been doing. I would say I’m in a really good space at the moment and enjoying my cricket. The whole idea is to keep it moving,” says Jagadeesan.The stumper was disappointed to fall just 23 runs short of what would have been the first triple hundred in the format but is not losing too much sleep over it and signs off on an optimistic note.“If this has happened, that would too”.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

This is the game, this is what we lost in the T20 World Cup. And Suryakumar Yadav’s type of batting is something Test cricket needs. Regarding this, Suryakumar Yadav said in a brief interview with ‘ESPN Cric Info’, “I will come, the time has come. In first-class cricket, he has considerable experience with the red ball. So I will come… I will come and leave,” he hinted. Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul showed bravery in speech. Bhammy was the reason for his exit from the 2021 T20. A new age was born in 2022. Captain Rohit Sharma was issuing slogans like ‘Padayana Ghaziyum’. In the end, he could only see that he was unable to hit. No wonder Rohit Sharma was stumped; Because here in the IPL series itself, we have seen left-arm fast bowlers including Mosin Khan take him down. After talking about acha pocha, the world cup went like a Vadivelu joke called ‘sona mutha pocha’. Now, it’s nice to see the youngsters playing under the leadership of Hardik Pandya. T20 cricket is for them. The commercial potential of T20 cricket will quickly become popular all over the world. It’s nature also holds the veteran players in so easily that they can’t get rid of it. We are watching Kane Williamson play. It’s time for him, in fact, to retire from T20. Rohit Sharma has also come of age to retire from T20 cricket. Even though Virat Kohli has been mixed in the T20 World Cup, yesterday we got a glimpse of the score we would get if Suryakumar Yadav comes in at No. 3. Virat Kohli, in the same down, scores his first 20 runs in just 24-25 balls. If he then stands till the end, he raises the strike rate. But he ends up scoring 50 off 40 balls and 60 off 50 balls. But Suryakumar scored 111 runs off 51 balls with 11 fours and 7 sixes in the same down. That too in the last stage he blasted 17, 18, 22 in 3 overs. Hardik Pandya’s biggest ego was scoring 2 runs twice in the last over. It was because of his mistake that Saudi scored a hat-trick. Suryakumar Yadav did not come to strike in the last over. Is this how a captain thinks? We have already seen that he bowled without giving a strike to Dinesh Karthik. Netizens have started talking about the popularity of fellow player Hardik Pandya. So Suryakumar will score more than 100 runs in 50 balls. Others can score only 60 runs. This is the benefit of dropping Suryakumar in front. This is what we have lost in World Cup T20 cricket. It can be said that Virat Kohli is the reason why we were able to win some matches in the World Cup. But, it is a matter of talking about what happened. But our fear is that if he had dropped Suryakumar down, maybe Kohli and Rohit would have started and Suryakumar Yadav would have taken the score to 200 in the semi-final against England. Because against England, Suryakumar chased down a big target and scored an impressive century. Watching Suryakumar’s game, it is clear that we have left some such tricks in the World Cup. Taking this as an example, the bowlers of the world will surely tremble if they try Suryakumar in Test matches soon. He can’t stop the fielders at the places where he hits shots. Suryakumar’s stunning shots at such places makes it impossible not to consider that he will shine in Test cricket as well.","pubDate":"2022-11-21 13:23:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Suryakumar's exceptional innings was the difference: Tim Southee","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/suryakumars-exceptional-innings-was-the-difference-tim-southee-624504","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Senior New Zealand pacer Tim Southee praised India’s in-form batter Suryakumar Yadav for shining in the visitors’ 65-run win in the second T20I at Bay Oval","content":"MOUNT MAUNGANUI: Senior New Zealand pacer Tim Southee praised India's in-form batter Suryakumar Yadav for shining in the visitors' 65-run win in the second T20I at Bay Oval, calling his unbeaten 111 an 'exceptional innings' which eventually made a difference to the first innings total.From being 57 off 35 balls at the end of the 16th over, Suryakumar smacked 54 runs off his last 16 balls to propel India to a challenging score. Eventually, the bowlers came to the party to bowl out New Zealand for 126 all out in 18.5 overs. \"Anytime a player gets a hundred in a T20 match, it's quite often the difference. You look at the rest of the side, and how the others battled, his innings was a class apart. He got them to a score which was more than what we had hoped for. But it was an exceptional innings and was the difference between restricting India to 175-180 and them getting above 190,\" said Southee in the post-match press conference. Further talking about Suryakumar's knock, where he reached the three-figure mark in 49 balls, Southee remarked, \"He's a player who can hit you in a number of areas. So, he's had a great 12-18 months in IPL and international cricket. He put up a pretty impressive knock today. The guys have now got 48 hours to re-assess and come up with something for Napier.\" In a forgettable day for New Zealand, Southee brought some cheer by picking his second T20I hat-trick, taking out Hardik Pandya, Deepak Hooda and Washington Sundar on consecutive deliveries to achieve the landmark in the final over of India's innings. \"I guess got a bit lucky there with bowling the last over and couple of those found the fielders. Feels really well as sometimes you bowl well and not get the rewards, and then there are times like today where you bowl and get couple of them at the end. On another day, that would go over the fence for six. Makes the day a bit better,\" he added. New Zealand's bowlers didn't have a great outing as a collective, with Suryakumar taking boundaries off every bowler, including Southee. But the senior right-arm fast-bowler refused to delve deep into the indifferent bowling performance from the Blackcaps.

Karthik was unhappy with the grouping of the teams and took to Twitter to express his disappointment.Karthik in a tweet, wrote, “Does it make sense to have the northeast teams play the elite teams in the league phase. It just topples the run rates of teams and imagine if a match against one of these teams gets rained off! Can’t they have a separate group and then qualify ?”Also on another side noteDoes it make sense to have the north east teams play the elite teams in the league phase .

He finished the T20 World Cup as the third-highest individual run-scorer, and the right-handed batter once again showcased his brilliance in the ongoing bilateral series against New Zealand. He stole the show in the second T20 International with a blistering century, scoring an unbeaten 111 runs off 51 deliveries. After registering his second T20I hundred in style, Yadav featured in a friendly ground interview with teammate Yuzvender Chahal for a special show, ‘Chahal TV’. Now, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has uploaded a part of the interview on their official Twitter handle, where the duo can be spotted sharing some light moments.From receiving appreciation from the likes of @sachin_rt & @imVkohli to answering the question of one lucky fan 🙌🏻 #NZvIND | @yuzi_chahalThe latest episode of Chahal TV features centurion @Surya_14kumar 😎 – By @ameyatilakFull interview🔽https://t.co/Q1VRn7xrVW pic.twitter.com/dRNWJZJZh4— BCCI (@BCCI) November 21, 2022 During the chat, Chahal heaped praise on Yadav for delivering a crucial knock on such a difficult pitch where the other batters were struggling. Then, the Indian spinner mentioned the appreciative tweets by India greats Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli after Yadav’s swashbuckling innings. Tendulkar wrote, “The night sky has been lit up by Surya,” while Kohli commented, “Numero Uno showing why he’s the best in the world. Didn’t watch it live but I’m sure this was another video game innings by him.”The night sky has been lit up by Surya! 🔥What a blinder @surya_14kumar! #INDvsNZ pic.twitter.com/bt7IHCBofs— Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) November 20, 2022Numero Uno showing why he’s the best in the world. Didn’t watch it live but I’m sure this was another video game innings by him. 😂 @surya_14kumar— Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) November 20, 2022 Referring to the tweets, the right-handed batter said, “It feels good to receive such messages. I have learnt a lot from Sachin sir while playing franchise cricket with him. And, now I definitely learn from Virat Bhai whenever we play together.”As Chahal asked about his aggressive mentality during batting, Yadav only talked about being calm and composed. “If you can reduce the percentage of fear of failure, it reduces your burden. Thus, you can enjoy your cricket,” he noted.In the end, Yadav took out some time for his fans who had gathered at the Bay Oval in huge numbers to cheer for India’s very-own ‘Mr 360’. Yadav picked one of the supporters from the stands and asked him to reveal his query in front of the camera. When the fan went on to call him “Mr 360,” the Indian batter could not agree with him. “There is only one Mr 360 in the world, you know. I can never be that but I always want to become the next Suryakumar Yadav,” he added further.Yadav’s dominating knock helped the Hardik Pandya-led side win the match by 65 runs. The Indian bowling department also contributed well to the victory as the youngsters like Deepak Hooda and Mohammad Siraj put up commendable pressure on the Kiwi batters. India and New Zealand will play the third and final T20I of the series on 22 November at Napier’s McLean Park.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
