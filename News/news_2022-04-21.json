Se trata de la cuenta oficial de Twitter del Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), un estadio multiusos con aforo para 100.000 espectadores, el más grande Australia y en el que se practica críquet, fútbol, fútbol australiano y rugby. “¡Los fanáticos del fútbol se preparan para presenciar las asombrosas habilidades de los gigantes de FIFA Brasil y Argentina en vivo cuando los dos equipos se enfrenten para el Superclásico 2022 en el MCG este junio!”, señala el mensaje de MCG en la red social, replicado por el portal brasileño Globo Esporte. El partido se suspendió el pasado 5 de septiembre en San Pablo, a los cinco minutos de juego con el marcador 0 a 0, cuando autoridades sanitarias brasileñas ingresaron a la cancha para objetar la participación de cuatro futbolistas argentinos acusados de no cumplir con las normas vigentes en Brasil por la pandemia de Covid-19. A pesar del anuncio, todavía hay expectativa por la confirmación del compromiso por parte de la FIFA, ya que Argentina jugará el 1 de junio contra Italia, en el duelo entre campeones de cada continente, y el cuerpo técnico que encabeza Lionel Scaloni liberaría a sus jugadores el 7 de junio. Por su parte, Brasil, dirigido técnicamente por Tite, tiene negociaciones muy avanzadas para enfrentar a Corea del Sur y Japón en Asia, y quería jugar ante Argentina el 11 de junio, la fecha anunciada hoy por los australianos. Pero Argentina desea jugar ante Brasil el 4 de junio, lo que haría inviables los otros compromisos de la selección brasileña contra coreanos y japoneses. Argentina presentó un recurso ante la FIFA para que le quiten a Brasil los puntos del partido suspendido por las Eliminatorias, pero aún no hay una decisión de la corte suiza sobre el caso. Brasil ganó la eliminatoria con 45 puntos, seguido por Argentina con 39, Uruguay con 28, Ecuador con 26 (clasificados para Qatar 2022), mientras que Perú -con 24 unidades- jugará el repechaje ante Nueva Zelanda, que ganó la zona de Oceanía, en el RCDE Stadium, del Espanyol de Barcelona entre 5 y 7 de junio.

El encuentro, conocido como el «Superclásico de las Américas«, servirá para que ambos conjuntos sudamericanos preparen el Mundial de Fútbol, que se disputará a partir de noviembre en Catar, apuntó en un comunicado la federación australiana de fútbol. Esta será la tercera ocasión en la que estas selecciones se midan en Australia, después de los partidos celebrados en 1988 y 2017 también en Melbourne; el primero terminó con empate a cero, el segundo con victoria para el cuadro albiceleste por 1-0. «Tener dos de los equipos de fútbol más exitosos del mundo de nuevo en el Melbourne Cricket Ground para continuar con su rivalidad de largo historial refuerza nuestra posición como una de las grandes ciudades deportivas del mundo y como la capital de eventos de Australia», comentó Martin Pakula, responsable del estado Victoria -cuya capital es Melbourne- para Turismo y Deportes.

During the 32nd match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Delhi Capitals and Punjab Kings at the Brabourne Stadium, Delhi Capitals captain Rishabh Pant has won the toss and chose to bowl. “We are going to bowl first. It [positive COVID-19 cases] is an unfortunate thing. We are not going to think about it. We will find strength among ourselves,” Pant told Star Sports at the toss. With all-rounder Mitchell Marsh contacting the virus, Delhi have brought back uncapped Indian batter Sarfaraz Khan into their Playing XI for this match. Time to put up a show in #DCvPBKS Just the one change in the XI as Sarfaraz Khan comes in for Mitchell Marsh. #YehHaiNayiDilli | #IPL2022 |#TATAIPL | #IPL | #DelhiCapitals pic.twitter.com/X7XZlI7Tq6 — Delhi Capitals (@DelhiCapitals) April 20, 2022 Why is Odean Smith not playing vs Delhi Capitals today? Meanwhile, Punjab Kings have received a shot in the arm as captain Mayank Agarwal has returned after recovering from a toe injury. While Agarwal has replaced opening batter Prabhsimran Singh, Punjab have included fast bowler Nathan Ellis to their Playing XI for the first time this season. “I am fine now, just getting some protection for the shoe. I am in, [Nathan] Ellis comes in for Odean Smith. It’s more of a strategic change. We need to put up our best foot forward and play some good cricket. We have an opportunity to bat first and put up a big score on the board and defend it,” Agarwal told Star Sports at the toss. In six matches this season, all-rounder Odean Smith has picked as many wickets at an average of 29.66, an economy rate of 11.86 and a strike rate of 15. With the bat in hand, Smith’s 51 runs came at an average and strike rate of 17 and 115.90 respectively. Not been able to contribute across divisions as well as Kings would’ve liked, Smith has been left out for a specialist bowler in Ellis. Having made his debut for PBKS last season, Ellis will be playing his fourth IPL match at the Brabourne Stadium tonight. In the 11 overs that Ellis has bowled across three innings, his solitary wicket has come at an economy rate of 8.18. Ellis, who has played six white-ball matches for Australia in the last one year, has picked 54 wickets in 45 T20s at an average of 24.46, an economy rate of 8.03 and a strike rate of 18.2.

Mayank Agarwal and Shikhar Dhawan are the openers for Punjab. Shardul Thakur will begin the proceedings with the ball. Here we go... Jonny Bairstow is down for a chat. He says that they have played some good cricket together but they have just not clicked. There have been close games but unfortunately, they were on the other side of the result. Adds that there is always room for improvement and they need to improve in all the departments of the game. Mentions that he is coming from Test cricket, and then was in quarantine so it's been tough for him. But he has been striking the ball well and it takes two-three games to find the rhythm. Informs that he is happy to bat at whatever number the team wants him to bat at. Mayank Agarwal, the skipper of Punjab says he is fine now and will play with some protection on the shoe. Informs that he and Ellis come in and informs it is a strategic change. They need to put up the best foot forward and play some good cricket. Adds that they have an opportunity to bat first and put up a big score on the board and defend it. Rishabh Pant, the skipper of Delhi, says they will bowl first, there were unfortunate things happening around but they will not think about that much. Tells that there were parts where they bowled and batted well previously. Informs that as Marsh tested positive for Covid, Sarfaraz Khan comes in. Punjab (Playing XI) - Shikhar Dhawan, Mayank Agarwal (C) (In for Prabhsimran Singh), Jonny Bairstow, Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Shahrukh Khan, Nathan Ellis (In for Odean Smith), Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Vaibhav Arora, Arshdeep Singh Delhi (Playing XI) - Prithvi Shaw, David Warner, Rishabh Pant (C/WK), Rovman Powell, Lalit Yadav, Sarfaraz Khan (In for Mitchell Marsh), Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav, Mustafizur Rahman, Khaleel Ahmed. TOSS - Delhi have won the toss and they have elected to BOWL first! PITCH REPORT - Simon Doull is down near the pitch. He says that it is the same surface where Kolkata and Rajasthan played a few nights back and it produced over 400 runs and again the batters will look to attack the shorter side. Adds that it is a beautiful surface, plenty of runs again, just a touch dry this time and so the spinners will come into play this time and he thinks it's still a 180-190 surface. Punjab have a strong batting line up filled with attacking minded players but they need someone like Mayank Agarwal who gently anchors the innings, which they missed last time around. His availability will bring some stability. Punjab are coming with a loss on their back and their season till now can be seen just how a see-saw works. They look unstable and will hope to find their winning formula soon. Team and toss news coming up. Let's talk about Delhi first, they are in the bottom half with just two wins for them. It was Mitchell Marsh first and now Tim Seifert has tested positive for Covid, Delhi will hope to strengthen the XI by shuffling the pack. Openers are not the issue but they fail to control the middle phase and will hope to find the solution against the attenuated Punjab side. Hello darkness my old friend. You know whom we are all talking about. Covid has haunted Indian T20 League again but this time the precautions are taken and we are all set for the action. Let's not talk about that and rather focus on the game. Hello and a warm welcome to the coverage of the clash between Delhi and Punjab. This match was floating on thin air as there were Covid cases in Delhi's camp but now the game is shifted from Pune to Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai and we are all set for yet another intriguing contest. ...

That's why the news isn't addressed here. • If you missed it, here’s Simon Briggs on the secret society of tennis umpires.• Hat tips to Kim Clijsters (see reader riff at the end) and Tommy Robredo, who recently closed out their careers. J-W Tsonga is next.• Sung Woo has a new tennis book.A spring has sprung Mailbag….MailbagI think it is way too early to write off Djokovic, but his post match interview, where he said that he ran out of gas in the third set of Monte Carlo, made me wonder— could he have long COVID? Here is an unvaccinated athlete who claims to have had COVID twice. Vaccines not only decrease the risk of serious disease but also the risk of long COVID. Just a thought—time will tell…—Anna, Longmeadow, MA• I had not thought of that. Let’s put aside another disquisition about public health and social responsibility and risk assessment and work on the assumption that his slow start owes simply to a lack of match play.My tepid take goes like this: “In a weird way, this is such tribute to Djokovic. He has barely played in the last six months. He has had all sorts of stressors in his life, yes, many of them of his own creation. His “flow” is nil. His match play has been minimal. Regardless of his fitness level, it hasn’t been tested in competition. He is almost 35 and playing opponents half his age. The idea that we expected him to resume blitzkrieging through draws says a lot about the standard he’s set and our expectations of him.\"Want a real hot take? “In a weird way, he benefits from this blip insofar as we all now can admit that perhaps we took him for granted. He didn’t just roll out of bed and win matches. He was a precise machine; and we see just how much so, when he drops a gear and needs an oil change. We also see how good the competition was/is. One level from peak and even the best players are vulnerable.”I am with you. I don’t think Djokovic is done. I don’t think he’s done playing top-shelf tennis. I don’t think he’s done winning Majors. But I do think that he could take a while to gear back up. That this rust he is trying to deoxidize—is that the right science term?—did not owe to physical injury or mental health crisis, but was caused by his own volitional decision-making….well that only adds a level to it all.Disagree. Russians are causing pain and suffering across Europe. Go watch the video of the mother identifying her son that Russian soldiers threw in a well. If Medvedev can't condemn that then I say enjoy playing tennis in Moscow against your fellow Russians.—@markhershey7• Again, immorally and amorally and inhumanely as Russia is acting….do we really want to make individuals disavow or repudiate someone or something when doing so threatens the safety of the athletes and their families? Also, let’s be careful about making equivalencies that are not the false variety. “You want to know about hardship? Ask the Ukrainians. Medvedev can survive without playing a few lousy tournaments.” Those instincts and impulses are understandable. But it’s not really relevant. This isn’t an either/or. This isn’t a suffering Olympics. What’s happening in Ukraine is horrific and vile and tragic. It doesn’t mean that visiting smaller hardship on Russian citizens is therefore okay.Steffi Graf absolutely does not get the recognition she deserves. I wished she would attend more events to keep her name in the discussion, but of all the GOATs, she is the one who has cared the least about records and numbers. She strictly focused on being the best competitor.—@drderekpricedba• More than two decades after her retirement—and nearly three days (to the day) after the dark episode in Hamburg—Steffi Graf, her legacy and her place in history remains a hot topic. I was astonished not only by how many of you weighed in but how widely divergent the responses were. From GOAT to asterisk. I want to sidestep the GOAT argument and focus on the other point. Unless there is something patently unfair and statistically dirty—comparing a record amassed over 162 games of baseball versus 156; comparing a time posted by an athlete later revealed to be doping—there are seldom asterisks in sports. You play the hand you’re dealt. You can only beat the players put before you in a draw. You can only control what you can control. The Graf/Seles rivalry—and its historical implications—remains tennis’ tragic counterfactual. How would it have played out had it not been snuffed out by a madman and incompetent security. Seles was 19 (!) at the time of the incident. She had won nine Majors already. You can note the head-to-head trends here. That Seles was—and is—an absolutely delightful human being only adds more emotion to this. Yet none of this ought to count against Graf or undermine what she achieved. It’s unfair to her. It sets a terrible precedent. What if Federer hits that first serve in the 2019 Wimbledon final? What if the lineswoman is a foot to the left and Djokovic doesn’t hit her at the 2020 U.S. Open? What if Nadal closes out Federer in the 2017 Aussie Open final? What if Serena had delayed childbirth? What if she had decided at a young age to aspire to the WNBA? What if Venus gets her autoimmune diagnoses earlier? What if Player X had stayed healthy or Player Y had not fallen in love. Sports (life?) are filled with unexpected tests and butterfly effects and fluke occurrences and randomness and sliding doors and small moments that become seismic. We can ask ourselves hypotheticals and wonder. But we can’t assume facts not in evidence to make judgements about want DID actually occur.Graf would have nowhere near the titles she does now if Monica Seles wasn’t brutally sidelined at her peak. Graf couldn’t touch her at the time. It would likely be Seles as part of the GOAT conversation instead.—@redredwein• Perhaps so. And perhaps Graf would have risen to the challenge and never lost again. And perhaps both would have discovered cricket the next week and quit tennis. Who knows? We can entertain all sorts of possibilities. And we should. It’s fun. It’s healthy. It underscores the role of luck. But it’s hard to take the hypotheticals and use them to dilute what actually happened.Jon, I didn’t see the Boris Becker news until now. Did people in the tennis world know about this all along?—Charles T.• This story has popped in and out of the news for years. You sensed this was trouble when one of his defenses entailed seeking diplomatic immunity against a creditor by claiming he was a cultural attache to the Central African Republic. I remember this story about Becker, illustrative in retrospect. This isn’t verbatim but it’s close: It’s the 90s and Becker is in the locker room in Monte Carlo telling a top American player about his private flight. The player is thinking, Damn, big spender. I am ranked higher than you are, I’ve made just as much money, and you’re flying private. Becker cuts the conversation short. “I have to meet the helicopter.” “What are you talking about?” the player asks. “Oh,” said Becker. “I flew on one flight. I sent my bags on a later flight.” When you are flying your suitcases on a separate charter, odds are good your personal finances could stand to be tighter.Tsitsipas is the early French Open favorite considering his great run last year, unknown impact of injury to Nadal and Djoker's relative lack of competitiveness due to vax status?—@vicktorious• “Broken record” is one of those retronyms, a phrase in need of updating. (“Spotify track stuck on repeat?”) We talk about this all the time, but the distinction between best-of-three and best-of-five is so severe. It’s a check on my optimism for Alcaraz, at least in the near term. It’s why I will take a dinged-up Nadal and a rusty Djokovic over the field. It’s why I don’t think you can be a favorite to win a Slam until you’ve first won a Slam. In Tsitisipas’ case, he is 23 now and has played more than 50 best-of-five matches. But, well, read this FiveThirtyEight piece: Here’s One More Reason It Might Be Tough To Stop Novak Djokovic’s Calendar-Year Grand Slam.You wrote \"Martina and Chris Evert never bothered venturing to Australia.\" Really JW? Yes, there were a few years in the late 1970s when they skipped the Australian Open and the draw was relatively weak. But Martina won three Aussie singles titles, Chris won two. Both of them lost championship finals to Evonne Goolagong down under before winning there. There's more but you get the point.—D. Rabbitt, Morrisville, NC • Yeah, that was meant as an exaggeration, but it was sloppy and a few of you (rightly) called me out. Here, for the record, are the stats: Borg: one appearanceMcEnroe: five appearancesConnors: two appearance (won in 1974)Martina: three titles in 10 appearances (for comparison, she played Wimbledon 23 times and the U.S. Open 21 times)Chris: six appearances (two titles)Read your column as I faithfully do. You noted, as I've heard others state, that \"Chris and Martina rarely ventured to Australia.\" I would love it if we could have a discussion about that, because I feel like that's a misappropriated sentiment that may have been true in the 1970s that followed that generation of pros until their retirement. However, during the peak of the Chris and Martina show such a sentiment isn't fair to them or the tournament. No one-hit wonders winning here.1980 — Mandlikova d Wendy Turnbull1981 — Navratilova d Evert1982 — Evert d. Navratilova1983 — Navratilova d Jordan1984 — Evert d Sukova (who beat Navratilova in the SF)1985 — Navratilova d Evert in what may one of their most underappreciated matches -- Look for it on YouTube -- it's high quality!1986 — tournament not held1987 — Mandlikova d Navratilova1988 -- Graf d Evert (who beat Navratilova in the SF)1989 -- Graf d Sukova (who beat Navratilova in the QF)• I have a great deal of sympathy for Chrissy and Martina especially here. If they complain about this, it’s perceived as sour grapes. But they got a raw deal here. At some point the metrics changed retroactively and “Majors won” became THE benchmark for measuring a career. Quite apart from their sporadically entering Australia, even when they played they did not build it up as one of the year’s four tentpoles, tailoring their schedule accordingly. If I were them I’m be muttering to myself, “Shit, now you tell me Slams would be the end-all, be-all. Would have been nice to know in advance. Maybe I would have played less doubles. Maybe I would have trained to peak four times a year. Maybe I would have played a lighter schedule. You’re judging me on today’s standards and not the standards of my time.”Shots• FINALLY…The Tennis Hall of Fame has created an Iconic Moments poll for Fans. The first category “Most Epic Rivalries.” Play along here. These are their options for Most Epic Rivalry:1. Jimmy Connors – John McEnroe – Bjorn Borg2. Rafa Nadal – Roger Federer – Novak Djokovic 3. Chris Evert – Martina Navratilova 4. Steffi Graf – Monica Seles 5. Pete Sampras — Andre Agassi6. Billie Jean King – Margaret Court7. Rod Laver – Ken Rosewall 8. Venus Williams – Serena Williams • I’ll distinguish between a men’s and women’s. For the women, I’ll take No. 3. And I’m not sure there’s much of another choice. The contrasts. The durability. The ebbs and flows. The fact that they landed, fittingly, with the same count of Majors and a head-to-head of 43-37. I would add that their post-career friendship says a lot about the binding powers of rivalry. For the men, how do you not pick No. 2?Take us out, Robert of NY:When Kim Clijsters announced her comeback in 2019, I was admittedly very confused by her decision. I thought there's no way after three kids she could contend for majors. I further worried she would be setting herself up for colossal disappointment, and that she could tarnish her legacy. Of course, her return ultimately proved to be short-lived, as it coincided exactly with the pandemic, coupled with a spate of injuries.Still, I find myself now reconsidering her comeback, and I think we can all learn from her brief return to the game. There's something to be said about living free of the opinion of others—not worrying about \"tarnishing one's legacy,\" which really is such a ridiculous idea—and doing something you love as a challenge to yourself. As Kim described it, this was her \"marathon.\" While she may not have the wins to show for it, I greatly admire her effort to pursue what she loved and challenge herself in new ways, all while carrying herself with her signature humility and grace. We should all be so brave. Here's hoping she sticks around the tennis world in her next chapter—the sport is better with her in its orbit.More Tennis Coverage:Wimbledon Shouldn’t Ban Russian AthletesAlex Dolgopolov, From ATP to Defending Ukraine: ‘Maybe I’ll Be Killed, Maybe I Have to Kill’How Good Can Carlos Alcaraz Get?","pubDate":"2022-04-20 13:00:00","full_description":"Hey everyone: • I'll have a separate column coming on Wimbledon's ban of Russian players.

The idea that we expected him to resume blitzkrieging through draws says a lot about the standard he’s set and our expectations of him.\" Want a real hot take? “In a weird way, he benefits from this blip insofar as we all now can admit that perhaps we took him for granted. He didn’t just roll out of bed and win matches. He was a precise machine; and we see just how much so, when he drops a gear and needs an oil change. We also see how good the competition was/is. One level from peak and even the best players are vulnerable.” I am with you. I don’t think Djokovic is done. I don’t think he’s done playing top-shelf tennis. I don’t think he’s done winning Majors. But I do think that he could take a while to gear back up. That this rust he is trying to deoxidize—is that the right science term?—did not owe to physical injury or mental health crisis, but was caused by his own volitional decision-making….well that only adds a level to it all. Disagree. Russians are causing pain and suffering across Europe. Go watch the video of the mother identifying her son that Russian soldiers threw in a well. If Medvedev can't condemn that then I say enjoy playing tennis in Moscow against your fellow Russians. —@markhershey7 • Again, immorally and amorally and inhumanely as Russia is acting….do we really want to make individuals disavow or repudiate someone or something when doing so threatens the safety of the athletes and their families? Also, let’s be careful about making equivalencies that are not the false variety. “ You want to know about hardship? Ask the Ukrainians. Medvedev can survive without playing a few lousy tournaments .” Those instincts and impulses are understandable. But it’s not really relevant. This isn’t an either/or. This isn’t a suffering Olympics. What’s happening in Ukraine is horrific and vile and tragic. It doesn’t mean that visiting smaller hardship on Russian citizens is therefore okay. Steffi Graf absolutely does not get the recognition she deserves. I wished she would attend more events to keep her name in the discussion, but of all the GOATs, she is the one who has cared the least about records and numbers. She strictly focused on being the best competitor. —@drderekpricedba • More than two decades after her retirement—and nearly three days (to the day) after the dark episode in Hamburg—Steffi Graf, her legacy and her place in history remains a hot topic. I was astonished not only by how many of you weighed in but how widely divergent the responses were. From GOAT to asterisk. I want to sidestep the GOAT argument and focus on the other point. Unless there is something patently unfair and statistically dirty—comparing a record amassed over 162 games of baseball versus 156; comparing a time posted by an athlete later revealed to be doping—there are seldom asterisks in sports. You play the hand you’re dealt. You can only beat the players put before you in a draw. You can only control what you can control. The Graf/Seles rivalry—and its historical implications—remains tennis’ tragic counterfactual. How would it have played out had it not been snuffed out by a madman and incompetent security. Seles was 19 (!) at the time of the incident. She had won nine Majors already. You can note the head-to-head trends here . That Seles was—and is—an absolutely delightful human being only adds more emotion to this. Yet none of this ought to count against Graf or undermine what she achieved. It’s unfair to her. It sets a terrible precedent. What if Federer hits that first serve in the 2019 Wimbledon final? What if the lineswoman is a foot to the left and Djokovic doesn’t hit her at the 2020 U.S. Open? What if Nadal closes out Federer in the 2017 Aussie Open final? What if Serena had delayed childbirth? What if she had decided at a young age to aspire to the WNBA? What if Venus gets her autoimmune diagnoses earlier? What if Player X had stayed healthy or Player Y had not fallen in love. Sports (life?) are filled with unexpected tests and butterfly effects and fluke occurrences and randomness and sliding doors and small moments that become seismic. We can ask ourselves hypotheticals and wonder. But we can’t assume facts not in evidence to make judgements about want DID actually occur. Graf would have nowhere near the titles she does now if Monica Seles wasn’t brutally sidelined at her peak. Graf couldn’t touch her at the time. It would likely be Seles as part of the GOAT conversation instead. —@redredwein • Perhaps so. And perhaps Graf would have risen to the challenge and never lost again. And perhaps both would have discovered cricket the next week and quit tennis. Who knows? We can entertain all sorts of possibilities. And we should. It’s fun. It’s healthy. It underscores the role of luck. But it’s hard to take the hypotheticals and use them to dilute what actually happened. Jon, I didn’t see the Boris Becker news until now. Did people in the tennis world know about this all along? —Charles T. • This story has popped in and out of the news for years. You sensed this was trouble when one of his defenses entailed seeking diplomatic immunity against a creditor by claiming he was a cultural attache to the Central African Republic . I remember this story about Becker, illustrative in retrospect. This isn’t verbatim but it’s close: It’s the 90s and Becker is in the locker room in Monte Carlo telling a top American player about his private flight. The player is thinking, Damn, big spender. I am ranked higher than you are, I’ve made just as much money, and you’re flying private. Becker cuts the conversation short. “I have to meet the helicopter.” “What are you talking about?” the player asks. “Oh,” said Becker. “I flew on one flight. I sent my bags on a later flight.” When you are flying your suitcases on a separate charter, odds are good your personal finances could stand to be tighter. Tsitsipas is the early French Open favorite considering his great run last year, unknown impact of injury to Nadal and Djoker's relative lack of competitiveness due to vax status? —@vicktorious • “Broken record” is one of those retronyms, a phrase in need of updating. (“Spotify track stuck on repeat?”) We talk about this all the time, but the distinction between best-of-three and best-of-five is so severe. It’s a check on my optimism for Alcaraz, at least in the near term. It’s why I will take a dinged-up Nadal and a rusty Djokovic over the field. It’s why I don’t think you can be a favorite to win a Slam until you’ve first won a Slam. In Tsitisipas’ case, he is 23 now and has played more than 50 best-of-five matches. But, well, read this FiveThirtyEight piece: Here’s One More Reason It Might Be Tough To Stop Novak Djokovic’s Calendar-Year Grand Slam . You wrote \"Martina and Chris Evert never bothered venturing to Australia.\" Really JW? Yes, there were a few years in the late 1970s when they skipped the Australian Open and the draw was relatively weak. But Martina won three Aussie singles titles, Chris won two. Both of them lost championship finals to Evonne Goolagong down under before winning there. There's more but you get the point. —D. Rabbitt, Morrisville, NC • Yeah, that was meant as an exaggeration, but it was sloppy and a few of you (rightly) called me out. Here, for the record, are the stats: Borg: one appearance McEnroe: five appearances Connors: two appearance (won in 1974) Martina: three titles in 10 appearances (for comparison, she played Wimbledon 23 times and the U.S. Open 21 times) Chris: six appearances (two titles) Read your column as I faithfully do. You noted, as I've heard others state, that \"Chris and Martina rarely ventured to Australia.\" I would love it if we could have a discussion about that, because I feel like that's a misappropriated sentiment that may have been true in the 1970s that followed that generation of pros until their retirement. However, during the peak of the Chris and Martina show such a sentiment isn't fair to them or the tournament. No one-hit wonders winning here. 1980 — Mandlikova d Wendy Turnbull 1981 — Navratilova d Evert 1982 — Evert d. Navratilova 1983 — Navratilova d Jordan 1984 — Evert d Sukova (who beat Navratilova in the SF) 1985 — Navratilova d Evert in what may one of their most underappreciated matches -- Look for it on YouTube -- it's high quality! 1986 — tournament not held 1987 — Mandlikova d Navratilova 1988 -- Graf d Evert (who beat Navratilova in the SF) 1989 -- Graf d Sukova (who beat Navratilova in the QF) • I have a great deal of sympathy for Chrissy and Martina especially here. If they complain about this, it’s perceived as sour grapes. But they got a raw deal here. At some point the metrics changed retroactively and “Majors won” became THE benchmark for measuring a career. Quite apart from their sporadically entering Australia, even when they played they did not build it up as one of the year’s four tentpoles, tailoring their schedule accordingly. If I were them I’m be muttering to myself, “ Shit, now you tell me Slams would be the end-all, be-all. Would have been nice to know in advance. Maybe I would have played less doubles. Maybe I would have trained to peak four times a year. Maybe I would have played a lighter schedule. You’re judging me on today’s standards and not the standards of my time.” • FINALLY…The Tennis Hall of Fame has created an Iconic Moments poll for Fans. The first category “Most Epic Rivalries.” Play along here . These are their options for Most Epic Rivalry: 1. Jimmy Connors – John McEnroe – Bjorn Borg 2. Rafa Nadal – Roger Federer – Novak Djokovic 3. Chris Evert – Martina Navratilova 4. Steffi Graf – Monica Seles 5. Pete Sampras — Andre Agassi 6. Billie Jean King – Margaret Court 7. Rod Laver – Ken Rosewall 8. Venus Williams – Serena Williams • I’ll distinguish between a men’s and women’s. For the women, I’ll take No. 3. And I’m not sure there’s much of another choice. The contrasts. The durability. The ebbs and flows. The fact that they landed, fittingly, with the same count of Majors and a head-to-head of 43-37. I would add that their post-career friendship says a lot about the binding powers of rivalry. For the men, how do you not pick No. 2? Take us out, Robert of NY: When Kim Clijsters announced her comeback in 2019, I was admittedly very confused by her decision. I thought there's no way after three kids she could contend for majors. I further worried she would be setting herself up for colossal disappointment, and that she could tarnish her legacy. Of course, her return ultimately proved to be short-lived, as it coincided exactly with the pandemic, coupled with a spate of injuries. Still, I find myself now reconsidering her comeback, and I think we can all learn from her brief return to the game. There's something to be said about living free of the opinion of others—not worrying about \"tarnishing one's legacy,\" which really is such a ridiculous idea—and doing something you love as a challenge to yourself. As Kim described it, this was her \"marathon.\" While she may not have the wins to show for it, I greatly admire her effort to pursue what she loved and challenge herself in new ways, all while carrying herself with her signature humility and grace. We should all be so brave. Here's hoping she sticks around the tennis world in her next chapter—the sport is better with her in its orbit.

England wicket-keeper batter Jos Buttler has a 110-run lead in the list of highest run-scorer at (almost) the halfway mark of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League. Rajasthan Royals, who made amends from last season by not starting with Buttler in the middle-order, have been witness to their premier overseas batter scoring most centuries and hitting most sixes in the season till now. In the process, Buttler has also become only the sixth cricketer to score multiple centuries in an IPL season. Others who’ve done the same before him are Chris Gayle (Royal Challengers Bangalore, 2011), Virat Kohli (Royal Challengers Bangalore, 2016), Hashim Amla (Kings XI Punjab, 2017), Shane Watson (Chennai Super Kings, 2018) and Shikhar Dhawan (Delhi Capitals, 2020). What a game of cricket! pic.twitter.com/5yPWJUcSGX — Jos Buttler (@josbuttler) April 19, 2022 Jos Buttler IPL 2022 runs In six innings thus far, Buttler has scored 375 runs at an average of 75 and a strike rate of 156.90 including two centuries and half-centuries each. The next on the list is Lucknow Super Giants captain KL Rahul (265). Buttler, who had made his IPL debut for Mumbai Indians in 2016, has been with Rajasthan since 2018. Out of his six previous IPL seasons, there have been three instances (2017, 2019 and 2021) of him playing 10 or less matches in an IPL season. As far as runs scored are concerned, Buttler has returned from IPL seasons after scoring 255 (2016), 272 (2017), 548 (2018), 311 (2019), 328 (2020) and 254 (2021) runs. Buttler’s best IPL season till date was his first once at Royals where his 548 runs in 13 innings had come at an average and strike rate of 54.80 and 155.24 respectively. The right-hand batter had scored as many as five half-centuries that season. 173 runs short of his best-ever IPL season mark, Buttler should easily be able to surpass his previous best in IPL 2022 considering that he still has a minimum of eight innings remaining this season. Therefore, it shouldn’t be surprising if IPL 2022 becomes the first 600+ season for Buttler.
