PCB Chairman Ramiz Raja has slammed Peshawar Zalmi owner Javed Afridi for declaring Arbab Niaz Stadium as one of the venues for the upcoming 8th edition of the PSL and nullified his claims saying Arbab Niaz Stadium Peshawar is not fit to hold PSL-8 matches. Sources revealed that Raja has made it clear that Peshawar will not be hosting matches of the next edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL). It has further been learnt that security forces have not yet declared the venue suitable for international matches. Ramiz said during a meeting that Javed Afridi had told him that the new stadium will be of the highest standard but the overall quality of the stadium was less than satisfactory. He added that it is not possible to hold the matches at the stadium. He revealed that the entire PSL-8 will be held in Lahore, Karachi, and Rawalpindi. Multan is also a potential venue, he said. He further stated that Multan Cricket Stadium has the potential to host further international matches. He also hinted that some matches of the upcoming tours of England and New Zealand can also be played at the Multan cricket stadium. Ramiz has, meanwhile, indicated that the international career of former captain Sarfaraz Ahmad might be over. The PCB has found a most probable replacement for the position in Mohammad Haris. It has been learnt that Raja in a meeting with Chief Selector Mohammad Wasim said, “We have a new wicketkeeper-batter in the shape of Muhammad Haris. It seems that the career of Sarfraz Ahmed is almost over.” Haris, a young wicket-keeper batter, played for Peshawar Zalmi in the PSL and had an outstanding season. He also made his international debut in the first One-Day International against the West Indies. Hailing from Mushtarzai, the suburbs of Peshawar, 21-year-old Haris had two forgettable years at the Regional U19 level, but he excelled the third time around to compel the Junior Selection Committee to induct him into Pakistan’s squad for the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2020 in South Africa.","pubDate":"2022-06-11 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Root gives Stokes a helping hand","link":"https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/2324088/root-gives-stokes-a-helping-hand","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England's new cricket regime of captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum got off to a winning start at Lord's last week although they had to thank former skipper Joe Root for getting them over the line.","content":"England's new cricket regime of captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum got off to a winning start at Lord's last week although they had to thank former skipper Joe Root for getting them over the line. A five-wicket victory over New Zealand sounds comfortable enough, but the match was up for grabs until Root bailed England out with a magnificent 115 not out. Root was ably supported by Stokes and wicketkeeper Ben Foakes who contributed 32 not out in a 120-run match-winning partnership. Root had only recently resigned the captaincy after a run of poor results, although throughout that time his batting had been of the highest standard. When he reached his century last Sunday he also notched 10,000 runs for his career. By a strange coincidence he achieved this at the age of 31 years and 157 days, exactly the same age as Alastair Cook when he reached the same milestone. The Lord's Test was an extraordinary match with fortunes swinging from one side to the other. New Zealand, who were a bit rusty after not having played for a while, were at a precarious 45-7 on the opening day before being bowled out for 132. England's batters didn't fare much better and they only managed a nine-run lead. When the Kiwis scored 285 in their second innings thanks to fine knocks from Mitchell (108) and Blundell (96), they appeared to have taken control. With England's notoriously fragile batting, the target of 277 looked like a challenging task even more so when the top order collapsed once again. But Root, first with a partnership with Stokes and then Foakes saw the hosts home. Although the result was an important psychological boost for England, it did not disguise the fact that the batting is highly reliant on Root, Stokes and Jonny Bairstow. The openers still look short of confidence, although Zak Crawley top-scored with 43 in the first innings, while Ollie Pope did not look comfortable in the crucial No.3 spot, a position he had never batted in before. There were no complaints about England's bowlers and the team was clearly boosted by the return of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. They were ably supported by Durham newcomer Matt Potts who enjoyed a marvelous debut taking 4-13 in the first innings and seven wickets in all. Stokes was naturally delighted with the result. \"To come away with the win after the game ebbed and flowed was brilliant,\" he said. Calling Root's performance \"amazing,\" Stokes said: \"I am so pleased for him.\" Stokes was also pleased to see Anderson and Broad back in action commenting ''they are such an inspiration.\" The second Test is already underway at Trent Bridge and the talented New Zealand side are likely to produce a much stronger batting performance in Nottingham, while Kyle Jamieson looks to be a formidable form with the ball. Stokes has played many times under Root and has witnessed at close quarters that being captain of England can be a thankless task, even if you are successful. It's the sort of job that can drive even the strongest characters to despair. When he was skipper, Michael Atherton often appeared to be brooding on the field, possibly pondering how he was going to handle the press whom he termed \"gloom and doom merchants\". Probably the worst period occurred in the summer of 1988 when England got through four captains in just one series against the West Indies. Mike Gatting, John Emburey and Chris Cowdrey all fell by the wayside until Graham Gooch was brought in for the final match and kept the job despite England losing the series 5-0. So what is it that makes the job so difficult? The recently commented on the demands of being a cricket captain: \"Unlike his football counterpart who is only required to call the toss and shout encouragement a cricket captain must be permanently alert. Cricket presents tactical complexities undreamt of on the football pitch: it is chess compared to tiddlywinks.\" So over to you Ben… let's hope your brain is in a chess mode this weekend.","pubDate":"2022-06-10 21:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"bangkokpost","country":["thailand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ben Stokes makes things happen before his well of miracles runs dry | Jonathan Liew","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/10/ben-stokes-makes-things-happen-before-his-well-of-miracles-runs-dry","keywords":["England v New Zealand 2022","Ben Stokes","Cricket","England cricket team","New Zealand cricket team","Sport"],"creator":["Jonathan Liew at Trent Bridge"],"video_url":null,"description":"England’s captain lives up to his cliche against New Zealand but cricket remains a secret party in apathetic NottinghamIn Gedling, an unnamed resident was awarded £100 in compensation by the council over missed garden waste collections.

So it was that the second Test between England and New Zealand was demoted to a pitiful blob on an inside sports page. New Zealand take charge of second Test with England left to rue missed chances Read more If ever you wanted an idea of cricket’s place in the culture, then here it was. Trent Bridge was full on a glorious June day, but once you stepped beyond the ground perimeter you would scarcely have had a clue anything was happening at all. Most of the time, this is how Test cricket happens: hiding in plain sight, walled off in all directions, a secret party nobody knows about. And so, half an hour before lunch, with New Zealand 64 without loss, Ben Stokes decides to give himself a bowl. Stokes, we are frequently told, is one of those players with the happy knack of making things happen. The ball seems to find him. You can’t keep him out of the action. These are some of the oldest and most mocked cliches in the book, tired aphorisms with no basis in measurable reality, beloved by bad commentators and abhorred by serious, proper cricket people. They are, in short, nonsense. And yet somehow, they are also true. The pitch is flat. Not just flat, but slow. There is a translucent greenish tinge to the surface, the sort you find on ham that has been left in the fridge for a month. Perhaps this is what tempted Stokes to put New Zealand into bat when winning the toss. Perhaps it was one of those calls made on pure vibes and two breakfast cans of Red Bull. Either way, any suggestion of lavish lateral movement is quickly exposed as a chimera. There is precious little off the seam. Apart from a little spell in the afternoon – a spell abruptly ended when Daryl Mitchell hits a six into a spectator’s pint, there is precious little swing either. ‘Trent Bridge was full, but outside the ground you would scarcely know a game was happening’ Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images But Stokes makes things happen. Very few cricketers are ascribed this gift. Matt Potts makes things happen. Sam Curran makes things happen. Chris Woakes does not make things happen. Nor, for all his searing pace, does Mark Wood. Craig Overton is pretty much a cast-iron guarantee of things not happening. Jasprit Bumrah makes things happen, Mohammed Shami doesn’t. Shane Warne made things happen , Glenn McGrath didn’t. Those are the rules. I didn’t make them. Everyone just knows them, a strange code that over time becomes self-prophesying, almost by the very fact of being evoked. Almost immediately, Stokes makes things happen. He extracts some life from the surface, commands the ball to dart off the seam, finds Will Young’s edge. The very next ball, Jimmy Anderson gets Tom Latham caught with a filthy long hop. Stokes is ticking now, raps Devon Conway on the pads, fires one down the leg side, gets driven and cut for four. By lunch Stokes’s figures read 4-0-26-1. But somehow he has managed to warp reality to his will, inhabit the situation, turn the whole game a shade of Stokesy. You can’t measure this sort of talent. You can’t plot it on a graph or compile it in an almanack or sell it as a premium data package to the Lahore Qalandars. But it is talent all the same, and one borne of personality as much as persistence, of temperament as much as technique. Cricket , when you boil it down, is a game of psychology and momentum wrapped up in a burrito of numbers. Few players explore or express that duality as perfectly as Stokes, a man who can embody the insipid and the inspired in the same game, sometimes even the same over. Half an hour after lunch, things have calmed down. Stokes returns. He bowls Conway a thigh-high full toss. A searing leg-stump yorker. A couple of half-paced bouncers. And then he gets Henry Nicholls out, luring him into an indiscriminate fiddle outside off stump. Anderson rides the wave to dismiss Conway. On an immaculate, untroubled day for batting, New Zealand have lost four wickets out of nowhere. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Yet ultimately, this would not be Stokes’s day. As Mitchell and Tom Blundell piled on the runs in the evening, he charged in with the same indefatigable courage, hurled the ball down with the same scorching certainty, put it in pretty much the same places. But the well of miracles had run dry. And seen in the context of the day, it was his earlier heroics that were the aberration: the oasis of hope in a desert of apathy, a man screaming forlornly at the tide, trying with all his might to make something happen. Which, as the people of Nottingham carried on their daily business, certainly felt like a metaphor for something.","pubDate":"2022-06-10 19:45:09","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/622b0e1738318eaf45aa182e84ae961b12f61a2e/202_141_2975_1784/master/2975.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1b3a441be6fd0057f13b820b3d83b93","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Nawaz picks four as Pakistan beat West Indies to seal ODI series","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/06/11/cricket-nawaz-picks-four-as-pakistan-beat-west-indies-to-seal-odi-series","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - All-rounder Mohammad Nawaz bagged four wickets as Pakistan defeated West Indies by 120 runs in the second one-day international on Friday to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

On the night Simon Katich grabbed then vice-captain Michael Clarke by the throat in the SCG dressing room in January 2009, McDonald was a Test-match debutant watching wide-eyed with everyone else, first at the confrontation, then at Clarke’s quick exit.

Credit: Scott McNaughton As reality dawned that the Australian team song would have to be sung minus one member of the team present - breaking all tradition - a remorseful Katich apologised to McDonald and Doug Bollinger for ruining their first Test match victory celebration. It fell to McDonald to break the ice, quipping “oh mate, don’t worry, this happens all the time in Victoria”. In that moment, the mood lifted. “It was a throwaway line - I wasn’t suggesting that does happen that way all the time for Victoria, but I think within any team there’s friction at times and it was a way to make light of the mood,” McDonald tells The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald . “So I did say it. “Kato felt as though he’d compromised what should have been a really good moment, and the night went on and there’s always a lingering thought as to where Michael had gone and what had happened. I’m big on enjoying moments, enjoying wins in cricket and my focus was to have fun that night.” Andrew McDonald after taking a caught and bowled on debut to dismiss Jacques Kallis at the SCG in 2009. Credit: Steve Christo Lightening the mood and letting the Australian men’s team breathe a little easier was always going to be part of McDonald’s commission as the man to replace Justin Langer. But after a messy transition ahead of the Pakistan tour, McDonald was characterised by some as the amiable “yes man” at odds with the hard-driving, hot gospel approach of Langer. Following his resignation in February, Langer’s close friend, Alan Jones, fired from the hip at the players and the support staff around the ex-coach. “Easy to be an assistant coach, all care and no responsibility,” Jones thundered on his Facebook page. “Easy to drink with the boys and share the view that the coach is a demanding bastard and things could be done differently. But the only transition out of success, when you turn your back on it, is failure. “It was Justin Langer who said when he became coach that he wanted ‘character over cover drives’. It is obviously not good enough for the leaderless mob at Cricket Australia, or is the game now being run by players? And if so, what fate awaits the next coach if things get difficult in Pakistan?” McDonald (right) talks to Nathan Lyon during a training session in Pakistan. Credit: AP Of course, what happened in Pakistan was Australia’s first Test series victory there in 24 years, their first in any part of Asia in 11 years, and a contest played in perhaps the best spirit involving a winning Australian team overseas in decades. Jones has not revisited the topic since. Asked about the “yes man” tag, McDonald deftly flips perspective. Why, after all, shouldn’t a coach accentuate the positives of his charges? “I would say most times in any team, the positive conversations happen more often, because there are far more positives than negatives within most games,” he says. “Whereas if you want to get caught up in how your team’s running ... you use the terminology of being a yes man, where you give more positive reinforcement than negative. But I like to see it, the way we play as the Australian cricket team, there’s a lot of positives that go within that. It’d be remiss of our coaching staff not to focus on those.” Away from cricket, McDonald is a follower of the Boston Red Sox, a team he picked up from the Carlton Fisk scene in Good Will Hunting , his favourite film. Looking at Australia’s sporting conversation, something he too indulges in as a Geelong resident who spends time with the Cats and their coaching staff, McDonald notes the dominance of football codes in forming the way many see the role of the coach. Cricket, McDonald is at pains to make clear, has to be different. “We’re in a country that’s driven by football codes and that’s probably what’s underpinned our assumptions about what cricket coaches do,” he says. “But we have a clear handover to a captain, who becomes the person who implements strategies on the field in the hours of play. “Test cricket lends itself to allowing the coach to assist the captain with advice during the hours of play - lunch and tea breaks, sleep on it and chat in the morning as the conditions change too. But in T20 the game’s a little bit too quick to even contemplate that. So a lot of work is done in the preparation phase to make sure we’re covering off all the options that players will need, to deal with the problems thrown at them.” McDonald with Ricky Ponting and Marcus North as Australia seal victory in the first Test against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2009. Credit: Getty Images One of McDonald’s formative experiences was to watch Ricky Ponting as captain of Australia in South Africa in 2009, one of the notable successes of a difficult era. Then coach Tim Nielsen worked faithfully as his lieutenant, while an effective strategy was formulated to beat the Proteas at home. McDonald’s role as a seam-bowling allrounder and stock bowler was significant in the result. Members of that touring party remember McDonald as an intelligent, thoughtful contributor, whose own career might easily have been more substantial. “A really good cricketer, very well-liked, extremely good character, a good, solid human - he could have had a greater career, but it didn’t turn out,” says one. A point of commonality for McDonald and the current crop of players is that none were part of the era of Australian exceptionalism that ended more or less with the retirements of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Langer in January 2007. They share a sense of admiration for those days, but also a desire to step out of their giant shadow by doing things differently. “The memory from that South African tour was that we were no good, we were one of the worst teams to leave these shores and it was a bit of an eye opener that, ‘Wow, ok, this is people talking about the Australian team,’ ” McDonald recalls. “But I remember Ricky’s amazing leadership, cobbling that team together. “The team gelled quite quickly overseas, and Ricky’s ability to get around to everyone and be clear on the role he and Tim Nielsen saw them playing, I saw a captain clearly leading and a coach clearly supporting the captain, with clarity the whole way through, and investment from everyone to buy into the roles they were to play. “The environment on that tour was one where we were going to have fun playing for Australia - there’ll be some tough times, but we want this to be a great experience for you, and that’s something I’ve held on to right through my career to today. It’s a sport, it’s there to be enjoyed, it’s not always going to be enjoyable on the field, but the environment you can create off the field is really important, especially when you’re touring.” So it was with the Pakistan tour earlier this year, a triumphant result in both cricketing and diplomatic terms. On the field, captain Pat Cummins led a group who endeavoured to work with, not against, the prevailing conditions, typified by Usman Khawaja’s calm accumulation of 496 runs. Off it, McDonald drove a set-up where every effort was made to park the cricket at the ground, and allow the team hotels to be places of sanctuary, relaxation, coffees and golf simulations. At times, players had to get used to the fact the new coach was not angling for moments to address the team, instead leaving them to carry out the plans agreed at the outset, when the slow conditions and attritional cricket were characterised as a “15-day Test match”. “It’s no slight on other Australian teams that have been to Pakistan, but you can’t play in spite of the conditions,” McDonald says. “You have to embrace them, you’ve got to find ways of winning because the opposition will line up against you in the way they think will make you less comfortable. We’ve got to be a team that travels well. “The key thing is to manage our resources, whether they be players or coaches, to be at their best in those environments. So prioritising the key series where we want to have ultimate success, and then for other series be mindful we’re allowing our players some time and space away, so that when the key moments we’re going to be judged on come up, they’re fresh in mind and body. “The environment you create can help you have your players at their best for longer, can help your staff be at their best for longer, and if we’ve got that attitude then hopefully that translates into performance. That’s not to dismiss the fact you need skills and capabilities to perform, but we think we’ve got a squad that has enough capability to be successful around the world.” With Cummins, who McDonald terms a “connector of people” with “genuine curiosity about people and life”, the team’s emphasis is on not making life any more stressful or difficult for players than it needs to be. Watching the team play, McDonald’s visage will be more inscrutable than his predecessor - don’t expect any bin kicking. “The ability to de-stress players is pivotal to sustained success.” “I’ll probably be criticised at times in the hours of play for not showing that emotion,” he says. “But it’s about us getting information to present options so the players are ready to go. I will struggle and wrestle more during the preparation phase than during the hours of play because ultimately you’ve handed that over to the captain to go out and perform. “It’s very difficult to hang onto that and ride that because you’ll probably exhaust yourself by the time your role really kicks in. The ability to de-stress players is pivotal to sustained success. You can get a performance spike no doubt [by increasing stress], but how sustainable is that? You don’t want players to feel like they’re drained by the time they come into a Test summer. You want them to be at their best or close to it for the tour that’s after a Test summer.” And as much as McDonald is planning for the sustainability of the Australian men’s team across a surfeit of matches and formats, he is also wary of keeping his own life in perspective. He will make few, if any, mentions of his young family, and there is very little likelihood McDonald will do the job any longer than four years before moving on. The next transition will be smoother than this one. A big role, then, but a supporting one relative to the players given clear top billing. “I don’t want it,” McDonald concludes, “to be all about me.” Sports news, results and expert commentary.

With opening batter Fakhar Zaman (17) getting out in the seventh over, Haq and Azam joined hands to bail out Pakistan on yet another occasion.

In what was their eighth 100+ partnership as a pair, Haq and Azam now have the joint 13th highest century partnerships in ODIs. Having joined the likes of Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf (8), Haq and Azam are only behind Yousuf and Younis Khan (9) among Pakistani batters with most hundred partnerships in ODIs. It goes without saying that the pair has a long way to go in terms of matching the below mentioned Top Five in this list. @babarazam258 🤜🤛 @ImamUlHaq12 #PAKvWI | #KhelAbhiBaqiHai pic.twitter.com/AhZdzukRzk — Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) June 10, 2022","pubDate":"2022-06-10 18:32:47","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"EXCLUSIVE | Pant can't be Dhoni this early, says coach Raju Sharma","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/pant-can-t-be-dhoni-this-early-says-coach-raju-sharma-after-south-africa-beat-india-by-7-wickets-in-first-t20-2022-06-10-783667","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In an exclusive interview with India TV, Raju Sharma, who coached Rishabh Pant in his early days, and is also a coach at Sehwag Cricket Academy, talked about Rishabh Pant as a batter and captain, the inclusion of Umran Malik and Arshdeep Singh, India's performance vs South Africa in the first T20 and much more.","content":"In an exclusive interview with India TV, Raju Sharma, who coached Rishabh Pant in his early days, and is also a coach at Sehwag Cricket Academy, talked about Rishabh Pant as a batter and captain, the inclusion of Umran Malik and Arshdeep Singh, India's performance vs South Africa in the first T20 and much more. - Pant is new to captaincy. Playing is different than international cricket. You need to lead from the front at this stage. He will mature slowly. But again, Kotla's wicket got better as the match progressed. - Pant got out at the wrong stage, should have stayed till the end. You can't be Dhoni this early. He should play value shots and not just look to hit it powerfully. That kind of shot shows his immaturity. - The keeper in my opinion is the best captain. Pant will mature slowly. He will need to be a lot more responsible. If someone else gets his place, it will be difficult for him to get back. But this is his first match, he has captained well in IPL, just give him a few more matches, and then we'll see. - Shreyas Iyer played well. But he should have converted it to a fifty. He should have stayed, shouldn't have left the team hanging in the middle. - The only difference between David Miller and Pant or Iyer is his maturity and, the way he finished the game. This is international cricket and you need to play with maturity to succeed. - Patel has done well in IPL. Everyone has seen him perform. So, they have done their homework. They used the crease well against Harshal. - They were bowling safe. They need to Bowl all sic balls with strong conviction. Only then they can succeed on flat tracks. Rabada gave away too much yesterday, and so did Nortje. We hit them and we were very good. But considering Kotla, the target should have been around 230-250. He performed well in the IPL, made 23 runs yesterday, but couldn't just get going. Again, once you get to 20-25, you should stay and make it big. See, Umran should be given a chance, he is young and should be unleashed. Both Umran and Arshdeep should be given a chance and the bowlers should be rotated to build the bench strength.","pubDate":"2022-06-10 18:02:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New Zealand take charge of second Test with England left to rue missed chances","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/10/cricket-england-new-zealand-day-one-report-second-test","keywords":["England v New Zealand 2022","England cricket team","New Zealand cricket team","Sport","Cricket","Australia sport"],"creator":["Ali Martin at Trent Bridge"],"video_url":null,"description":"Second Test, Trent Bridge: New Zealand 318-4 v EnglandMitchell and Blundell make unbroken stand of 149The psychology of the toss in Test cricket is a curious thing and on the opening day at Trent Bridge never more so.

On a delightful opening day at Trent Bridge, New Zealand positively cantered to 318 for four by stumps but while the run-rate was too high for England’s liking, the hosts could have kidded themselves this was only slightly above par had they been asked to field. Instead, Ben Stokes was the captain given the choice when the coin landed first thing, meaning that for all of his side’s upbeat perspiration and those four breakthroughs, their returns can only be viewed less favourably. Their catching also resumed normal service after last week’s uptick, four chances going down and Joe Root’s drop off Daryl Mitchell, three runs into an unbeaten 81, the most costly. As tends to be the case when these sides meet on a cricket field, the entertainment levels were high and sliding doors moments plentiful. England v New Zealand: second Test, day one – live! Read more The Nottingham crowd was treated to bright sunshine and some wonderfully crisp strokeplay from the tourists, not least during the unbroken fifth-wicket stand of 149 between Mitchell and Tom Blundell that rekindled their bromance from Lord’s and saw the latter cruise his way to 67 not out. And Stokes was not without his reasons. There was a tinge of green on the pitch and the New Zealand top order that failed twice in last week’s five-wicket defeat had lost Kane Williamson to a positive Covid-19 test overnight. Tom Latham, deputising for the sixth time in seven Tests, said he would have bowled first too and had an all-seam attack that suggested no attempt at kidology. Until a ball is bowled, fingers are always crossed to some degree. The surface, however, was also dry, hard and, despite some decent carry, on the slow side. New Zealand are such a phlegmatic bunch too that the loss of Williamson – a player grappling for form as it was – had little effect. The tourists took a wonderfully positive approach to their insertion and over the course of the three sessions sent 43 fours racing across a fast outfield, as well as clearing the rope twice. With 26 from Latham the lowest score among New Zealand’s top six, needless to say this was not the day that Stokes had in mind. England’s captain was the bowler to make things happen along the way, claiming figures of two for 40, while Jimmy Anderson picked up a couple himself and was, predictably, the most parsimonious on show. Stuart Broad tried to orchestrate some energy from his home supporters and, though expensive, was unfortunate not to claim a wicket during a devilish five-over burst after lunch when Zak Crawley put down Henry Nicholls on 17. Matt Potts was used curiously at times – he is not an enforcer, we learned – while Jack Leach, back from concussion, enjoyed some early turn but saw a tough chance off Blundell put down by Root. Daryl Mitchell top-scored for the tourists with an unbeaten 81. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images There were no early signs that a cascade of wickets would be possible and by the 20th over, Stokes had played all five cards in his hand. Root’s trousers already featured a heavy smear of crimson from his attempts to get some swing but it was not forthcoming, Latham and Will Young instead setting the tone with a sprightly 84-run opening stand. Young was the chief instigator, creaming nine fours and two in succession off Stokes to get within one blow of his first half-century in six innings. Instead the aggression instantly made way for a tentative defensive shot and Crawley clung on at second slip. With Anderson then returning to the Pavilion end and getting Latham caught at midwicket via a long-hop the very next ball, England finally had cause for celebration. One of the more amusing subplots of the morning had been England’s attempts to get the ball changed. Weirdly, this died down after New Zealand resumed on 108 for two in the afternoon and suddenly the original started to move. After a ding-dong battle between Broad and Nicholls it was Stokes who profited from the ball’s new lease of life, New Zealand’s No 4 edging a beautiful outswinger behind on 30 and trudging off. New Zealand batters thrive without Williamson and teach England lesson Read more At the other end Devon Conway was playing a princely little innings, the newly-promoted No 3 unfurling a succession of crisp cover drives. But just four runs away from his half-century he played for swing from Anderson, only for the ball to hold its line and flick the inside edge. Ben Foakes, on a personally excellent day, made no mistake. The scoreboard read 169 for four but should have been 170 for five moments later. Mitchell, new to the crease, was put down by Root at second slip on three to deny Stokes his third. It was a simple low pouch and one that would be heavily punished, Mitchell rolling over his form from that memorable century at Lord’s. Reaching 195 for four at tea, Mitchell and Blundell then plundered 123 runs in a final session that saw three overs disappear into the ether at the close. The former also killed off any swing when he launched Leach for a mighty six down the ground and the ball gloriously plopped into the pint glass of an unsuspecting punter.

But when it came a fourth opportunity went to ground, Broad teasing an edge from Blundell on 63 only to see it fly at catchable height between Crawley at second slip and Jonny Bairstow at third. According to Andy Zaltzman on Test Match Special, this was the 30th time since 1993 that England had inserted a team at home but only the second their visitors had passed the 300-mark just four wickets down. New Zealand, 1-0 down in the series and without Williamson here, had unquestionably won the day.","pubDate":"2022-06-10 18:01:30","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eacbaab8245244474a695a2ac63fb5edb79196f2/0_0_3570_2143/master/3570.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=065c02f57be9a1d6771034657c0e588a","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Former Test opener Graeme Wood quits WACA board amid divide between member and board-elected directors","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/former-test-opener-graeme-wood-quits-waca-board-amid-divide-between-member-and-board-elected-directors-c-7123079","keywords":null,"creator":["Braden Quartermaine"],"video_url":null,"description":"Graeme Wood says his decision to walk from the WA Cricket Association board was due to meetings becoming futile’ amid management interference and a divide between member and board-elected directors.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-10 18:00:00","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-7123079/83c3c8dff9fa38fc693e178b0fd9c5997e991728-16x9-x979y992w1096h616.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How Ashwin Began Preparations For England Test By Playing Club Cricket","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/how-ravichandran-ashwin-began-preparations-for-england-test-by-playing-club-cricket-3057136","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ravichandran Ashwin turned up for his club team days after a gruelling IPL season and the star India spinner says he did that to get into the red ball cricket mode ahead of the rescheduled fifth Test...","content":"Ravichandran Ashwin turned up for his club team days after a gruelling IPL season and the star India spinner says he did that to get into the red ball cricket mode ahead of the rescheduled fifth Test in England beginning July 1. The Indian Test team is likely to depart for England on June 15. They will play a warm up game ahaomst Leicestershire before the Test at Edgbaston. Ashwin chose to turn out for his club side MRC 'A' in the TNCA First Division semifinal and final just days after being part of the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL final. \"The purpose of playing these games (First Division) is to shift from 20 overs to this (red-ball) format...

I want to keep ticking on my fitness and keep working,\" the 35-year old spinner told reporters after leading MRC 'A' to their maiden First Division title. Asked if he had set any targets for himself, Ashwin, who recently overtook the legendary Kapil Dev (434) to become the second highest wicket-taker for India (with 442 scalps) behind ace leg-spinner Anil Kumble (619), he said: \"I have worked incredibly hard on my game. I think a lot. \"I have done all these things over the years that I feel I am in a position where I can take it as it comes. I am happy playing the kind of cricket I am playing. I do not want to think too far ahead.\" Ashwin, who has been keen to ensure Tamil Nadu get back to their dominant ways in the Ranji Trophy, said steps need to be taken to revive the red-ball culture in the state and wished to see the TNCA revert to the three-day or four-day format for the First Division league next year. It is now played on a two-day format. \"I would like to see the First Division go back to the days when I started playing. There was seriously good quality. I wish the TNCA pushes the game to three or four days next year. \"Only if these quality players play back to back against each other, there will be more competition for places. Tamil Nadu cricket, yes, we have done superbly well in the white-ball game. \"If we have to revive the red-ball culture, the First Division is the place where we start. I believe I am giving my 1 per cent by coming back and playing here. With our team, there has been a lot of hard work. There have been a lot of disappointments,\" he added. Tamil Nadu, though successful in the white-ball formats (T20 and 50-overs) have not been able to get past the league stage in the last couple of Ranji seasons. Promoted \"If you are serious about playing good red-ball cricket, both our fast bowling and our batting against fast bowling definitely need to go up. There are no two ways about it. \"At the moment, there is intent. Our fast bowlers are struggling to find the right length and balance. We have got spin by a dozen; we can manage and all that. In the Ranji Trophy also, when spin comes into play, we come to our own. We know how to do it. Fast bowling is something that we definitely need to work on,\" he added.","pubDate":"2022-06-10 17:49:38","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/akdts12o_ravichandran-ashwin-afp_625x300_01_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Most consecutive centuries in ODI: Which batter holds records for highest ODI consecutive centuries?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-most-consecutive-centuries-in-odi-which-batter-holds-records-for-highest-odi-consecutive-centuries/","keywords":["Cricket","babar azam","Kumar Sangakkara","Pakistan","West Indies","West Indies tour of Pakistan 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Most consecutive centuries in ODI: The Pakistani captain narrowly missed out on equaling a world record at the Multan Cricket Stadium tonight.

After the end of this stand, wickets fell quickly for England, sinking them to 4/98. Agencies Kapil Dev was adjudged as the 'Man of the Match' for his 1/67, 4/52 and 23*. On this day in 1986, India made history at the Lord's and clinched their first-ever Test victory at the venue, defeating England by five wickets at the historic venue in the first match of their three-match series against the Englishmen. India won the toss and elected to field first, England put up 294 on the board in their 128.2 overs. England had got off a great start, with openers Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson (35) stitching a 66-run stand for the first wicket. After the end of this stand, wickets fell quickly for England, sinking them to 4/98. Gooch then stitched a valuable 147-run stand with Derek Pringle (63) and went on to make 114. However, the rest of the batters could not provide much resistance to Indian bowling. Chetan Sharma (5/64) and Roger Binny (3/55) were the stars for India with the ball and stopped England from posting an intimidating total. In the second innings, India gained a 47-run lead over their opposition thanks to the efforts of Dilip Vengsarkar (126*), Mohinder Amarnath (69), Sunil Gavaskar (34) and Mohammad Azharuddin (33). Other batters could not do much for India and England dominated them. Vengsarkar had also become the first-ever overseas cricketer to score three hundreds at the historic venue. Pacers Graham Dilley (4/146) and Derek Pringle (3/58) did a great job of not letting the match slip out of England's hands entirely by letting India gain a huge lead after the second innings. In the third innings, It was in hands of the English to gain a lead and also post an intimidating total on the board that would translate into an intimidating target. However, Indian bowlers completely dominated the English. Other than Mike Gatting (40), Allan Lamb (39) and Paul Downton (29), batters let the English down. Kapil Dev (4/52), Maninder Singh (3/9) terrorised their opposition with their mix of spin and pace. England were restricted to 180/10. With a lead of just 133, Indians were given a target of 134. Though wickets kept falling for India regularly and reduced India to 110/5, it chased down the target. Contributions from Sunil Gavaskar (22), Dilip Vengsarkar (33), Ravi Shastri (20*) and Kapil Dev (23*) were sufficient for India. India achieved their historic first-ever Test win at the venue and went on to win the series 2-0, clinching their second series against England at England. Kapil Dev was adjudged as the 'Man of the Match' for his 1/67, 4/52 and 23*. As of now, India has played 19 Tests at Lord's, winning three and losing 12. 4 matches have ended in a draw. Read the now!

Bengal is currently playing with Jharkhand in the Ranji Trophy quarter-finals and it has posted a large score ridding on the performance of Tiwary. By the end of the second day's play, Manoj returned unbeaten after scoring a half-century. Manoj Tiwary and Abhishek Porel helped Bengal to reach 577 runs for five against Jharkhand on the second day of the Ranji Trophy quarter-finals. Jharkhand's Sushant Mishra dismissed Abhishek Porel as behind the wickets. Porel scored 68 runs off 111 balls with the help of included 11 fours. As Mishra went back to the pavilion, Tiwary continued his innings and thrashed Jharkhand's bowlers fiercely, at the end of the second day's play. Manoj Tiwary is unbeaten and playing on 54 runs off 146 balls. Manoj has hit three fours and one six in his innings so far. Notably, Tiwary's last triple-digit score was an unbeaten 303 against Hyderabad in the 2019-20 season. Notably, Tiwary has been a prominent figure for the Bengal team for years when he has been guiding the team's batting line-up as well as the youngsters in the team. There was a time when the 36-year-old former Bengal captain was considered a strong contender for Team India. However, he couldn't succeed much at the international level. Eventually, Manoj lost his association with Team India long ago, but he couldn't refrain from playing cricket.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is expecting a windfall from the telecast and streaming rights deal, with several networks, such as Sony Sports Network, global giants Disney Star Network, Reliance-Viacom 18 and Amazon among others, in the fray to grab the rights for the 2023-2027 cycle. Reports have suggested that the BCCI could earn almost three times the sum it grossed for the 2018-2022 cycle, when Star India bought the media rights for more than Rs 16,347 crore. Before Star India, Sony Pictures Network had held media rights for a decade for a sum of Rs 8,200 crore. Media reports on Friday suggested that American giant, Amazon, was planning to pull out of the fierce competition. Reports, quoting a source on condition of anonymity, said that Amazon had already invested USD six billion in the country, and spending more for IPL's online streaming rights didn't make great business sense. The reports added that Amazon had not responded to a request for comment. With Amazon reportedly planning to pull out, three major players -- Reliance, Disney and Sony Group Corp -- would be keen to get the steaming rights, given that it would give them a big boost in the online consumer market. Whoever bags the deal will also get a massive fillip in its aspirations to become a leading media player in India. Amazon was earlier reported to be very keen on the getting the IPL property in its portfolio, given that the retail giant had spent big on European football rights and wanted to expand into Indian sports market. BCCI's revenue from IPL media and streaming rights had multiplied manifold since the league came into existence. While it nearly doubled when Star India took over the media rights in 2018, the BCCI now expects the sum to triple in the 2023-27 cycle. Reports say it could be in the range of INR 40,000 to 45,000 crores, perhaps more. A top BCCI official was quoted as saying recently that \"Indian cricket is up for a bumper harvest from the sale of new cycle of IPL Rights. Don't be surprised if it touches (Rs) 40,000 to 45,000 crore. Let's wait for the magic to unfold.\" The offshoot of the potential windfall is that IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings (CSK) has become the country's first sports Unicorn with its market cap touching a high of Rs 7,600 crores and its share in the grey market trading in the Rs 210-225 price band. Two key reasons for the high share value of the India Cements-owned franchise recently were the addition of two new franchises to IPL at record prices, and the BCCI expecting a financial windfall from the media rights sales.","content":"IANS Mumbai, June 10 Amid fierce competition to wrest the media rights of the money-spinning Indian Premier League (IPL), there are reports that one of the big players, Amazon.com Inc., is planning to pull out, leaving the likes of giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd. to bid for the streaming rights of one of the most lucrative leagues in the world.
