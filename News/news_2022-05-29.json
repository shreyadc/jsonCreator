In the last outing for the reigning Test world champions against South Africa in February Henry was named player of the series, with 14 wickets and figures of seven for 23 at Hagley Oval that matched the New Zealand home record held by Richard Hadlee; during last year’s 1-0 win in England, he was the executioner at Edgbaston . England’s risk-taking future relies on McCullum handling unruly Test machine | Ali Martin Read more But though twice a 50-over World Cup finalist, this strong, versatile right-arm quick has found Test chances fleeting since his debut in 2015. Tim Southee and Trent Boult have dominated the new ball for a decade, Neil Wagner has been a unique left-arm battering ram at first change, while the hulking Kyle Jamieson has recently emerged. “Ha-ha, no,” says Henry, when asked if he is surely now an incumbent (and not least with Boult and Southee late arrivals from India). “It’s not something I worry about too much. The key for our group is worrying about what you can do to contribute. It’s great to have personal success but it’s how you get the win for New Zealand. “We’ve been lucky to have the competition for spots. Guys come in, understand their role and know what is required. Mine has changed over the years and it’s about how you fit in to try and take 20 wickets for the team. It’s knowing there is a bigger job and that’s something this group has prided itself on: coming in to do a job.” This team-first mentality chimes with the clarion call from Ben Stokes, Henry’s fellow son of Christchurch, on taking the England captaincy last month. The move to then rope in Brendon McCullum as the all-rounder’s head coach was a case of unashamedly pinching one of the leaders who set New Zealand on this path and hoping the same magic results. “I can only speak from my experience but I loved Brendon’s leadership,” says Henry, who won 21 caps across all formats under McCullum’s captaincy. “He’s great with people and building relationships. I’m sure he’ll do a really good job with England. “Something we’ve prided ourselves on is doing it our way, operating in a way that is authentic to us as a group, having that style of play. Brendon was instrumental in setting it up, then Kane Williamson took it on as captain and the group evolved further. “Brendon’s job now is what that change looks like with England. I don’t know what that environment is like but you have a very strong pool of players and when you come here – yes, there’s a new captain and coach – nothing changes: it’s England in their conditions.” English conditions and the Dukes ball are something Henry clearly relishes with spells at Worcestershire in 2016 and Kent two years later producing 102 Championship wickets at 18 runs apiece. He is signed to return to the latter after this tour, although he cracks a wry smile when noting how true the pitches have played this season. New Zealand made a similar move domestically over the past decade and, though challenging, Henry credits this for “adding tools to your belt” as a bowler. “I like to strike with the new ball but you might still have done a role at the other end, holding, creating pressure. It makes days like summer [against South Africa] sweeter,” he says. Matt Henry celebrates after dismissing South Africa’s Aiden Markram at Hagley Oval. Photograph: Andrew Cornaga/AP Such moments might not have been for Henry, who suffered a severe lower back stress fracture at the age of 21 after bowling with it for a year undiagnosed. Needless to say he has huge sympathy for the England seamers – Saqib Mahmood, Jofra Archer and Matthew Fisher – who are out for the season with the same problem. Henry’s was so bad he was forced to have the extreme surgery that involves fusing screws and a titanium cable into the lower spine. The procedure, which came with an endorsement from his Canterbury teammate Shane Bond had previously been viewed as the last roll of the dice and not performed on a seamer so young. “It was a daunting time as a fast bowler but I’m glad I have got through the other side,” he says. “Coming back was a mental battle. I was very lucky to have Bondy around for a coffee and chat about it. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. “You have doubts, twinges and fears that the problem is returning. The most important thing Bond said was: ‘Your back is now stronger than ever, you’ve done everything right, just let go and trust it’. I don’t think there’s one magical answer to solve the wider issue, though, every bowler is different and at their own stage of development.” Olly Stone underwent the same procedure last summer but it remains to be seen if others on the sidelines require such a dramatic intervention. Henry, now 30 and with the problem a distant memory, is proof there is a way back, with his sole focus these days being the best possible teammate and hopefully getting the nod at Lord’s.","pubDate":"2022-05-28 21:00:41","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0ea3b9fd252c44dfdd98a19c2473ba6a823607/0_229_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b1ff924abe5b58d716d7b8706e272d6a","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Titans' of Gujarat brace up for 'Royal' fight from Rajasthan's rockstars","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/titans-of-gujarat-brace-up-for-royal-fight-from-rajasthans-rockstars-745454","keywords":["Sports,Today NewsPaper,Cricket"],"creator":["The Hans India"],"video_url":null,"description":"IPL final between Gujarat Titans and Rajasthan Royals is about this and much more.","content":"Ahmedabad: Two leaders, who are minefields of talent in their own right, one team that has made a mockery of all betting odds and the other trying to complete a cycle that started 15 summers back, IPL final between Gujarat Titans and Rajasthan Royals is about this and much more.When IPL started over two months back, nobody would have believed that two captains walking out for toss in the title clash will be Hardik Pandya and Sanju Samson. 'Remember the Titans', a 2000 Hollywood film headlined by Denzel Washington is considered one of the best sports films on the proverbial underdog story, which always has a capital. It is not known if Titans skipper Hardik has watched it but for him and head coach Ashish Nehra, this journey of two months has been nothing short of spectacular. They have made a lot of people eat a humble pie because many, including experts, termed them a team of no-hopers post auction. A team that looked like a rag-tag outfit with only a few good players like David Miller, considered past their sell by date, or one-match wonders like Rahul Tewatia, it didn't really look good on paper. But then you wouldn't call cricket a \"game of glorious uncertainties\" if everything would be decided on paper. A fit-again Hardik took to leadership like fish takes to water and showed the way with his performances and the reason why he will always be an asset for Indian cricket. Miller, who played his best cricket at least five years back, showed his 2.0 version that stunned one and all. Tewatia showed that those five sixes in Sharjah wasn't a mere flash in the pan. Rashid Khan knew that he would be read well, so he became all the more parsimonious. Wriddhiman Saha after Rahul Dravid's hard-talk had reached a dead-end in his career but got a new lease of life and at least one more season to look forward to. Gujarat as a state has not been known for its sporting exploits. It produced players like Parthiv Patel or one of India's greatest ever pacers in Jasprit Bumrah but just like Tamil Nadu never had an emotional connect with a team before CSK appeared in the horizon, same is the case with Gujarat. Come Sunday, expect a partisan and vociferous crowd to chant \"Aava De\" and that's the impact that Titans have had on their fans. History will always throw examples that sporting teams bind a community and perhaps Titans can strike that chord with the Gujaratis. For Titans, if this is about carving a niche in-front of home crowd, Rajasthan would like to do it for someone, who would be watching up from the stars.Gujarat Titans: Hardik Pandya (captain), Rashid Khan, Shubman Gill, Mohammed Shami, David Miller, Wriddhiman Saha, Matthew Wade, Rahul Tewatia, R.

It took mere nine months to reconstruct the stadium with all the modern facilities, and a record seating capacity of over 1,12,000 people, thereby making it the world’s largest Cricket stadium, and the second-largest sports ground in the world after the Rungrado May Day Stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea. As per a report from the Press Information Bureau (PIB), the iconic stadium, is spread over 63 acres, with the total area equivalent to 32 Olympic size soccer fields put together. Overall, the entire developmental process of the stadium renovation, and to equip it with all the modern facilities, incurred a total approximate cost of INR 800 Crore. The other special feature of the Narendra Modi stadium is that with a total of six Red soil and five Black soil pitches on the ground, it is the only stadium in the country to possess two different kinds of soil surfaces for the matches to take place.

The plan was to start off small but “grow to the point of purchasing some of the southern hemisphere’s most sought-after colts and fillies to attack the world’s biggest races” and turn his business into “a sexy, recognisable, funky name in the equine game”. Anyone who liked the pitch could buy in, and plenty did. At one point, McCullum had 18 horses in the stable and the best part of 100 investors. Six years later McCullum is back in Test cricket, with another big idea. He wants to get England playing in such an entertaining way that everyone’s attention is drawn back towards the longest form at a time when interest in it is flagging. Brendon McCullum wants England to relax and shed their fear of failure Read more A lot of people say Test cricket is still “the pinnacle of the game”. McCullum, who gave up his job in the Indian Premier League to take this one on, is honest enough to admit that it won’t be for long unless it does a better job of selling itself to the public and the players. And just like with his syndicate, he’s hoping he will be able to persuade everyone else to buy in to his ideas about how to do it. That includes Jos Buttler, who is just about the biggest English star in cricket at the minute after his feats in the IPL. Which doesn’t mean Buttler is about to walk back into the Test team. McCullum was part of the selection panel that picked Ben Foakes and Jonny Bairstow in the squad for these first two Tests against New Zealand, opening at Lord’s on Thursday. But McCullum is eager to make Test cricket feel so exciting that Buttler wants to be back in the mix. And not just Buttler. McCullum also mentions Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone, “all guys have played international cricket before, who have been successful in the other forms of the game and who you’d think would be able to transition across”. Never mind that Moeen actually retired from Test cricket last autumn (“Has he?” says McCullum with a smile – “We’ll see.”), that Rashid hasn’t played a first-class match since his last Test, in January 2019, or that Livingstone hasn’t even made his Test debut. All four of them have, to varying extents, ended up prioritising their T20 careers over Test cricket and now McCullum wants to change their minds. “If we’re playing an attractive brand of cricket and we’re successful and people are getting right behind what we’re doing, then that might pique a bit of the interest of some of those guys. “I look at all of them and think there will be a time where they may get an opportunity if they’re invested enough. But we’ll see. The squad we’ve picked have got the opportunity first and foremost. But then if you’ve then got some of these other guys wanting to play, banging the door down with their own performances, then you’ve got a team who can dominate at the top.” McCullum wonders if there were times when these players felt pushed away from Test cricket by the way they were managed. “There’s probably been a bit of hurt at times for those guys too, because they’ve been in the team at times and then out of the team at others.” White-ball star Liam Livingstone has yet to make his Test debut. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images He puts a lot of store in loyalty. “That brings about a bit of confidence that you’re going to get an opportunity for a period of time. You need a bit of time to work out whether you’re any good at this level or not. Selection loyalty is very important to me. I’d rather give guys one more game than they probably feel they deserve themselves.” He admits this may be wishful thinking. Rashid is 34, so is Moeen, Buttler has already played 57 Tests. Besides which, the schedule is so congested that it’s getting harder for players to switch formats. “But my mentality is that if they’re the best cricketers, then why not have a conversation and see where you get to? It doesn’t mean they are going to make the side, they might not even be interested, but let’s at least have the conversation.” England’s risk-taking future relies on McCullum handling unruly Test machine | Ali Martin Read more McCullum comes from a team who succeeded by making the most of their small resources. He makes it sound as if he thinks England failed to get the best out of their much richer ones. Likewise with Livingstone, who is 28, and at a point in his career where he could reasonably choose to specialise in white-ball cricket. “We need to have a conversation about what his appetite for Test cricket is. And if he is keen on playing, then how does he see himself getting into the side? Just because you’re a good cricketer, it doesn’t mean you automatically get selected. “You’ve still got to earn the right to be able to do so. I don’t have any preconceived thoughts about whether he’s good enough or not, I just look at him and think he’s a very good cricketer, and think it’s worth having a conversation.” The point is that if your star players aren’t interested in playing Test cricket, how long can you keep claiming it’s the best cricket? So what happened to the horse racing syndicate? Well, McCullum is still in the business, but these days he just “buys them and races them with a few mates in New Zealand”. The syndicate didn’t work out quite like he hoped, and you wonder whether his time in English cricket is going to, either. But still, he and everyone else had a lot of fun along the way.","pubDate":"2022-05-28 17:00:36","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d66ea41c2f3a78de6052464dd9effb3d3fd2daf2/0_214_4983_2990/master/4983.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a9f9429979c789a2c039d66f2c149a24","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Struggling' Virat Kohli should take break cricket, says THIS former Australian pacer","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/struggling-virat-kohli-should-take-break-cricket-says-this-former-australian-pacer-2468275.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Kohli, who hasn't scored an international hundred for nearly three years, is battling his career's worst slump, having managed 341 runs in 16 IPL games at a below-par average of 22.73.","content":"Virat Kohli finished his dismal IPL 2022 campaign with a score off 7 balls and got out to a ball that has troubled him in the past.

During the grand finale of Women’s T20 Challenge at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) Stadium in Pune, the Velocity have won the Toss and elected to field first against the Supernovas. With one wins apiece before the ongoing finale tonight, the Supernovas, Velocity, and the Trailblazers had two points each under their belt. However, a poor Net Run Rate than the two other teams meant that the defending champions Trailblazers, led by Smriti Mandhana, had to bow out of the three-team tournament. For those unaware, the Women’s T20 challenge tournament was born as a result of India’s fantastic run during the 2017 ICC Women’s World Cup, when they finished as the runners-up after an agonizing loss against England in the grand finale. The inaugural edition in the year 2018 was a one-off match between the teams – IPL Supernovas and IPL Trailblazers. Post the season, a third team – IPL Velocity was added to the tournament, where the grand finale was preceded by a round-robin format. 4 matches have been played between them with both the teams winning 2 matches each. Who takes the lead tonight? #CricketTwitter #WomensT20Challenge 📸IPL/BCCI pic.twitter.com/RXDN81UBos — Female Cricket (@imfemalecricket) May 28, 2022 While it was the Harmanpreet Kaur-led Supernovas which had emerged as the winners of the first two seasons, Smriti Mandhana’s Trailblazers had lifted their maiden title during the tournament’s third edition in the year 2020. No thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the fourth edition had to be called-off in the year 2021, with the same being held in Pune in the year 2022. The good news for the women’s Cricket fans is that this might well be the last year of the tournament’s existence, as BCCI plans to announce a six-team franchise-based Women’s IPL next year onwards, after the world’s richest board had been subject to intense criticism for having not yet come up with a full-fledged global T20 women’s tournament, despite the Indian women’s team performing decently enough in the format at the international level off-late.","pubDate":"2022-05-28 15:02:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"You make cricket special, 12th Man Army: Virat Kohli pens heartfelt note for RCB fans after IPL 2022 exit","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/you-make-cricket-special-12th-man-army-virat-kohli-pens-heartfelt-note-for-rcb-fans-after-ipl-2022-exit-1955437-2022-05-28?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"You make cricket special: Kohli pens heartfelt note for RCB fans after IPL 2022 exit","content":"Royal Challengers Bangalore star Virat Kohli has penned a heartfelt note to fans and team management after RCB lost Qualifier 2 against Rajasthan Royals to get knocked out of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022.

He was beaten by the bounce of Prasidh Krishna and edged a simple catch after scoring just 7. Kohli scored just 341 runs at an average of 22.73 and a strike rate of 115.78. Bangalore's batters struggled to put up partnerships against Krishna, 3/22, and Obed McCoy, 3/23. They struck at regular intervals by bowling at impressive lengths. Captain Faf du Plessis labored for 27 deliveries to make 25 while Glenn Maxwell tried to break out but was brilliantly caught by a diving McCoy at fine leg in the 14th over in Trent Boult's return spell.

Buttler’s blistering unbeaten 106 off 60 balls romped Rajasthan to 161-3 with 11 balls to spare and set up the final against Gujarat Titans on Sunday. Bangalore, made to bat in the playoff, got only seven runs from star Virat Kohli and was restricted to 157-8.

Kohli's mediocre campaign in the IPL-15 ended after Royal Challengers Bangalore's seven-wicket defeat by Rajasthan Royals in the second qualifier in Ahmedabad on Friday. \"Do I say it is a concern, I do. I would like him (Kohli) to be scoring more runs of course,\" Lee told PTI on Saturday when asked about Kohli's prolonged lean patch. Kohli, who hasn't scored an international hundred for nearly three years, is battling his career's worst slump, having managed 341 runs in 16 IPL games at a below-par average of 22.73. In the ongoing IPL, he opened the RCB innings in most games. In the second qualifier , Kohli chased a fast, rising delivery from pacer Prasidh Krishna, which was wide outside the off-stump, to give a simple catch to Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson behind the stumps. \"The hardest thing is when Virat Kohli doesn't score runs, generally the team doesn't do well. When we see Kohli had that purple patch, when he got 800-900 runs in that season (IPL 2016) his team (Royal Challengers Bangalore) fared pretty well. We want more from Kohli. \"A strong Kohli is a strong team. Unfortunately he missed out in the semis; he could not get his team to cross the line of his own bat, getting less than 10 runs. \"Maybe (it is) a chance for Kohli to go back and try work on a few things and maybe just have a rest from cricket. Just get away and just freshen up the mind,\" added Lee, who is the brand ambassador of ' Sportsbet.io '. Around this time last year, Lee had picked Kohli and Australia seamer Pat Cummins as the best batsman and bowler of the world. \"When you look at the recent greats, it is hard to look past Virat Kohli,\" Lee had said when asked who his favourite Test batter is in an interview with ICC. This Indian Premier League has seen the emergence of young pacers like Avesh Khan, Mohsin Khan, Umran Malik, Mukesh Choudhary, Arshdeep Singh and the 45-year-old Lee, who has 310 Test wickets, believed this could come in handy when the country plays in the T20 World Cup in Australia. \"The two Khan boys (Mohsin and Avesh) have got real talent. The one thing that Indian cricket is producing is a nice catalogue of fast bowlers. I like that. \"They have got good spin options as well but certainly if you are looking forward to the T20 World Cup in Australia, you want guys that can bowl fast on the fast bouncy wickets,\" said Lee. One of the biggest finds of the IPL has been Malik, who consistently bowled over 150 kmph and ended with 22 wickets for the Sunrisers Hyderabad. \"Look he has been fantastic, what Umran Malik delivers is pure pace. I wish him well and I am hoping that he gets the opportunity to play the longer format of the game as well,\" Lee said.

As India have a packed schedule after IPL, the form of both the players has become a matter of concern for the team management as well as the fans.Speaking in an interview with Dainik Jagaran, Sri Lankan Legend Chaminda Vaas expressed his concern about the recent performance of Kohli and Sharma. With the T20 World Cup knocking at the door, Vaas said that match-winning players like Kohli and Sharma will have to come back stronger, but they need some rest to perform better.He said, \"Both Virat and Rohit are match-winning players. I think both of them needed a break from cricket before the World Cup. This will benefit them and they will not only come back fresh but also be more dangerous.\"However, Vaas has also stated that they have already made enough contribution to the Indian cricket and they can never be judged on the basis of their performance in a single tournament. \"It is not correct to talk about the possibility of performing in the T20 World Cup on the basis of IPL's form,\" Vaas added.Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have been rested in the upcoming five-match series against South Africa which will begin from 9 June in New Delhi. Vaas has supported the decision of the selectors as he hopes that after taking the much-needed break, they will start afresh and fans will be able to witness a better version of them. Vaas admitted, \"India becoming champion in the T20 World Cup will depend a lot on the performance of these two.\"In the latest season of IPL, Rohit Sharma suffered his worst-ever batting figures as his average was just 19.14. Not a single fifty-plus score came from the willow of the 'Hitman'. The Mumbai Indians skipper only managed to score 268 runs in his 14 appearances at a strike rate of 120.18.On the other side, former India captain Virat Kohli, this year, registered his most number of golden ducks in a single IPL season. However, the Royal Challengers Bangalore batter smashed two half-centuries this year. Kohli scored 341 runs in his 16 innings at an average of 22.73.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Supernovas will take on Velocity in the final of the Women’s T20 Challenge 2022. The match will be played at the MCA Stadium in Pune on 28 May 2022. Both teams have won one of their two games in the tournament so far. Harmanpreet Kaur has been the best batter of the Supernovas this season, where she has scored 104 runs in two games courtesy of one half-century. Apart from Kaur, Harleen Deol has also played an important part for the team with bat. In bowling, Pooja Vastrakar has been their best bowler with five wickets. For Velocity, the trio of Shafali Verma, Kiran Navgire and Laura Wolvaardt has played a crucial part with the bat. All three of them have been brilliant at the top for Velocity. Shafali Verma and Laura Wolvaardt have proved their class in the International cricket as well. Kate Cross has been their best bowler, whereas they also have the Indian trio of Sneh Rana, Deepti Sharma and Radha Verma. Indian Premier League is the wealthiest cricket tournament in the world and the calls for a Women’s IPL have been going on for quite a long time now. However, there is still no clue when will BCCI start the full-fledged Women’s IPL. The Women’s T20 challenge started in 2018 with just two teams, whereas the 2019 and 2020 seasons comprised three teams. The 2021 season was cancelled due to the Covid situation.

While Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai brigade has won the title a record five times, MS Dhoni-led yellow army has four trophy wins to their names.Chennai Super Kings have featured in nine finals till now and clinched the title four times. On 28 May 2011, they lifted the IPL trophy for a successive second time by relishing a huge victory against Royal Challengers Bangalore in the final at Chepauk’s MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai and became the first team to defend the title.As the track of Chepauk is known for carrying some memories of momentous scores, skipper MS Dhoni decided to bat first after winning the toss. The opening pair of Michael Hussey and Murali Vijay created a storm by stitching a 159-run partnership in front of the home crowd. While Hussey scored 63 off 45 balls including three fours and three sixes, Vijay was in the form of his life and smashed 95 runs facing just 52 deliveries. The devastating knock was laced with four boundaries and six maximums.Coming in at No 3, Dhoni added 22 runs playing 13 balls. After coming to face the final delivery when CSK was standing at 199, Dwayne Bravo whacked a maximum into the crowd to put up a mammoth 206-run target in front of the Kohli brigade. For RCB, Sreenath Arvind and Chris Gayle picked up two wickets each.In response, the Bangalore’s batting attack of Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle and AB De Villiers was neutralised by the Ravichandran Ashwin-led bowling unit. They lost both of their openers in the first three overs. After them, Kohli ignited the hope but only for some moments. Kohli had to go back to the pavilion after scoring 35 runs and RCB were six-man down in 11 overs.After Kohli’s dismissal, no batter except Saurabh Tiwary managed to stick to the crease for longer. Tiwary registered 42 runs in 34 balls but could not take his side home. Ashwin scalped three wickets and Shadab Jakati got two wickets for Chennai.🏆 #OnThisDay in 2011: Powered by Murali Vijay's 95, Hussey's 63 and Ashwin's 3-fer, Chennai defeated Bangalore by 58 runs to win their 2nd IPL title is as many years 👏🏻📸 IPL/Getty • #OTD #IPL #TATAIPL #CSK #CSKvRCB #RCBvCSK #BharatArmy pic.twitter.com/z6RySnNcjc— The Bharat Army (@thebharatarmy) May 28, 2022Bangalore fell 58 runs short of reaching the huge target in 20 overs and Chennai Super Kings brought their second consecutive IPL title home while displaying sheer dominance.
