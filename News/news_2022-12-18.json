The second tournament was locally organized by the Jinja Association of Cricket Clubs (JACC) and as has been the norm for each tournament to support a local social cause, the Nile edition has been about the ending of teenage pregnancies in the Nile region. The Nile edition had four teams featuring in it, Buutu, Amakubi, Amakokotazi, and Empungu battling for bragging rights over the two days of action. The games were played on a T10 format and were available to the World via a live stream on Batball.TV. Aggressiveness and passion were some of the key factors that headlined most of the games that were played with a number of good strikes from the players. Buutu was the better team of day one, as they went on to win all their three games of the day. Buutu currently tops the table of four and their phenomenal performance earned them an automatic qualification to the finals that will be played on Sunday 18th December 2022. Amakokotazi, Amakubi, and Empungu also have a chance to meet Buutu at the finals as there will be playoff games that shall determine who joins Buutu at the finals. Four games shall be played tomorrow to complete the tournament fixture with the best 16 players from the tournament earning a big chance to represent the region at Batball X next year. There will be more to play and fight for as Batball Open Nile Edition takes the final day tomorrow.","pubDate":"2022-12-17 18:36:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"kawowo","country":["uganda"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Travis Head puts Australia in charge against South Africa after WarnerтАЩs duck - The Guardian","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyL2RlYy8xNy9hdXN0cmFsaWEtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLWZpcnN0LXRlc3QtZGF5LW9uZS1yZXBvcnTSAV5odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc3BvcnQvMjAyMi9kZWMvMTcvYXVzdHJhbGlhLXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYS1maXJzdC10ZXN0LWRheS1vbmUtcmVwb3J0?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Travis Head puts Australia in charge against South Africa after WarnerтАЩs duck┬а┬аThe GuardianNew ball dominates before Head fights fire with fire | Australia v South Africa 2022-23┬а┬аcricket.com.auHeartbreak for Steve Smith in late twist┬а┬аnews.com.auA snapshot of day one of the first Test┬а┬аThe Canberra TimesFLEM'S VERDICT: Herculean Head worthy of Gilchrist comparisons... but don't count out South Africa just yet┬а┬аThe RoarView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-17 17:57:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"AUS vs SA 1st test: рдСрд╕реНрдЯреНрд░реЗрд▓рд┐рдпрд╛ рдХреЗ рдЦрд┐рд▓рд╛рдл рджрдХреНрд╖рд┐рдг рдЕрдлреНрд░реАрдХрд╛ рдХреЗ рдЗрд╕ рдЦрд┐рд▓рд╛рдбрд╝реА рдиреЗ рдкрдХрдбрд╝рд╛ рдЗрд╕ рд╕рд╛рд▓ рдХрд╛ рдмреЗрд╕реНрдЯ рдХреИрдЪ! рджреЗрдЦреЗрдВ VIDEO","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/aus-vs-sa-1st-test-south-african-player-khaya-zondo-probably-took-the-2022-s-best-catch-see-video-2284691","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"AUS vs SA 1st test: рдСрд╕реНрдЯреНрд░реЗрд▓рд┐рдпрд╛ рдФрд░ рджрдХреНрд╖рд┐рдг рдЕрдлреНрд░реАрдХрд╛ рдХреЗ рдмреАрдЪ рддреАрди рдЯреЗрд╕реНрдЯ рдореИрдЪреЛрдВ рдХреА рд╕реАрд░реАрдЬрд╝ рдХрд╛ рдкрд╣рд▓рд╛ рдореИрдЪ рдЦреЗрд▓рд╛ рдЬрд╛ рд░рд╣рд╛ рд╣реИ. рдпрд╣ рдореИрдЪ рдЧрд╛рдмрд╛, рдмреНрд░рд┐рд╕реНрдмреЗрди рдореЗрдВ рдЦреЗрд▓рд╛ рдЬрд╛ рд░рд╣рд╛ рд╣реИ. рдЗрд╕ рдореИрдЪ рдореЗрдВ рдкрд╣рд▓реЗ рд╣реА рджрд┐рди рдХрдИ рдХрд╛рд░рдирд╛рдореЗ рджреЗрдЦрдиреЗ рдХреЛ рдорд┐рд▓реЗ, рдЗрд╕рдореЗрдВ рд╕реЗ рдПрдХ рдбреЗрд╡рд┐рдб рд╡реЙрд░реНрдирд░ рдХрд╛ рдХреИрдЪ рднреА рд░рд╣рд╛. рдкрд╣рд▓реЗ рдмрд▓реНрд▓реЗрдмрд╛рдЬрд╝реА рдХрд░рдиреЗ рдЙрддрд░реА рджрдХреНрд╖рд┐рдг рдЕрдлреНрд░реАрдХрд╛ рдХреА рдЯреАрдо рдЯреА рдмреНрд░реЗрдХ рд╕реЗ рдкрд╣рд▓реЗ рд╣реА 152 рд░рдиреЛрдВ рдкрд░ рд╕рд┐рдордЯ рдЧрдИ. рдЗрд╕рдХреЗ рдмрд╛рдж рдЕрдкрдиреА рдкрд╣рд▓реА рдкрд╛рд░реА рдХреЗ рд▓рд┐рдП рдмрд▓реНрд▓реЗрдмрд╛рдЬрд╝реА рдХрд░рдиреЗ рдЖрдИ рдСрд╕реНрдЯреНрд░реЗрд▓рд┐рдпрд╛рдИ рдЯреАрдо рдиреЗ рдкрд╣рд▓реЗ рджрд┐рди рдХрд╛ рдЦреЗрд▓ рдЦрддреНрдо рд╣реЛрдиреЗ рддрдХ 145 рд░рдиреЛрдВ рдкрд░ 5 рд╡рд┐рдХреЗрдЯ рдЧрдВрд╡рд╛ рджрд┐рдП. рдЗрд╕рдореЗрдВ рдЕрдлреНрд░реАрдХрд╛ рдиреЗ рдкрд╣рд▓реА рдЧреЗрдВрдж рдкрд░ рд╢рд╛рдирджрд╛рд░ рдХреИрдЪ рдХреЗ рдЬрд╝рд░рд┐рдП рд╡рд┐рдХреЗрдЯ рдЭрдЯрдХ рд▓рд┐рдпрд╛. рдЗрд╕ рдХреИрдЪ рдХреЛ рд╕рд╛рд▓ рдХрд╛ рд╕рд░реНрд╡рд╢реНрд░реЗрд╖реНрда рдХреИрдЪ рднреА рдХрд╣рд╛ рдЬрд╛ рд╕рдХрддрд╛ рд╣реИ. рдЗрд╕ рдЦрд┐рд▓рд╛рдбрд╝реА рдиреЗ рдкрдХрдбрд╝рд╛ рд╣реИрд░рд╛рдиреА рднрд░рд╛ рдХреИрдЪ рдСрд╕реНрдЯреНрд░реЗрд▓рд┐рдпрд╛рдИ рдУрдкрдирд░ рдбреЗрд╡рд┐рдб рд╡реЙрд░реНрдирд░ рдкрд╛рд░реА рдХреА рдкрд╣рд▓реА рд╣реА рдЧреЗрдВрдж рдкрд░ рдЖрдЙрдЯ рд╣реЛрдХрд░ рдкрд╡реЗрд▓рд┐рдпрди рд▓реМрдЯреЗ. рдЕрдлреНрд░реАрдХрд╛ рдХреА рддрд░рдл рд╕реЗ рдкрд╛рд░реА рдХрд╛ рдкрд╣рд▓рд╛ рдУрд╡рд░ рдлреЗрдВрдХрдиреЗ рдЖрдП рдХрдЧреАрд╕реЛ рд░рдмрд╛рдбрд╛ рдиреЗ рд╡реЙрд░реНрдирд░ рдХреЛ рдПрдХ рдЦрд╛рд╕ рд░рдгрдиреАрддрд┐ рдХреЗ рддрд╣рдд рдЪрд▓рддрд╛ рдХрд┐рдпрд╛. рд░рдмрд╛рдбрд╛ рдиреЗ рд╡реЙрд░реНрдирд░ рдХреЗ рд▓рд┐рдП рд╢реЙрд░реНрдЯ рд▓реЗрдЧ рдкрд░ рдЦрд╛рдпрд╛ рдЬрд╝реЛрдВрдбреЛ рдХреЛ рд▓рдЧрд╛ рджрд┐рдпрд╛ рдерд╛. рдЙрдиреНрд╣реЛрдВрдиреЗ рдлреАрд▓реНрдбрд┐рдВрдЧ рдХреЗ рд╣рд┐рд╕рд╛рдм рд╕реЗ рдкрд╣рд▓реА рдЧреЗрдВрдж рд╣рд▓реНрдХреА рдХреА рд╢реЙрд░реНрдЯ рд╡реЙрд░реНрдирд░ рдХреА рдмреЙрдбреА рдкрд░ рдлреЗрдВрдХреА рдФрд░ рд╡реЙрд░реНрдирд░ рдЦреБрдж рдХреЛ рдмрдЪрд╛рдиреЗ рдХреЗ рд▓рд┐рдП рдмрд▓реНрд▓рд╛ рдЖрдЧреЗ рд▓реЗрдХрд░ рдЖрдП, рдЧреЗрдВрдж рдмрд▓реНрд▓реЗ рд╕реЗ рд▓рдЧрддреЗ рд╣реА рд╢реЙрд░реНрдЯ рд▓реЗрдЧ рдкрд░ рдЦрдбрд╝реЗ рдЦрд╛рдпрд╛ рдЬрд╝реЛрдВрдбреЛ рдХреА рддрд░рдл рдЧрдИ рдФрд░ рдЙрдиреНрд╣реЛрдВрдиреЗ рдЙрдЫрд▓рдХрд░ рдПрдХ рд╢рд╛рдирджрд╛рд░ рдХреИрдЪ рдкрдХрдбрд╝рд╛. рдЬрд╝реЛрдВрдбреЛ рдХрд╛ рдпрд╣ рдХреИрдЪ рд╡рд╛рдХрдИ рд╣реИрд░рд╛рди рдХрд░ рджреЗрдиреЗ рд╡рд╛рд▓рд╛ рдерд╛. рд╡рд╛рдпрд░рд▓ рд╣реЛ рд░рд╣реА рд╡реАрдбрд┐рдпреЛ рдореЗрдВ рдЖрдк рджреЗрдЦ рд╕рдХрддреЗ рд╣реИрдВ рдХрд┐ рдЙрдиреНрд╣реЛрдВрдиреЗ рдХрд┐рд╕ рд╢рд╛рдирджрд╛рд░ рддрд░реАрдХреЗ рд╕реЗ рдЗрд╕ рдХреИрдЪ рдХреЛ рд▓рдкрдХрд╛.

The legspinner was this week included in the Black Caps squad for their two-match series against Pakistan, having waited more than four years since the last of his 17 test appearances. After hearing the good news, Sodhi was quick to dig through the clutter that had accumulated during his long wait, keen to locate a prized possession. тАЬItтАЩs obviously a huge privilege being called back into the test side after four years,тАЭ Sodhi said. тАЬItтАЩs really exciting to be back and packing the baggy especially. тАЬSheтАЩs a little bit dusty. It was actually quite nice to go and find it and dust it off a little bit and chuck it in the bag. тАЬIтАЩve been on a lot of tours recently, and itтАЩs been awesome playing white-ball cricket, but itтАЩs really exciting and youтАЩre filled with honour and privilege to be able to pack it and take it away.тАЭ Sodhi is certainly no stranger to the international game. HeтАЩs played 71 matches for the Black Caps since last pulling on that treasured baggy hat, part of an innings defeat by Pakistan in Dubai in 2018. The 30-year-old has shone brightest in T20 cricket - in October becoming the fifth man to collect 100 international wickets - and believes his success with a white ball can translate now more than ever to the test arena. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. But Sodhi did concede he occasionally wondered whether he would get another opportunity to put that theory into practice. тАЬI would be lying if I said I didnтАЩt [have doubts],тАЭ he said. тАЬThere were times that a lot of white-ball cricket was being played and you start to focus a lot of your attention on that. тАЬBut the gapтАЩs gotten smaller in terms of what works in white-ball cricket will potentially work in red-ball cricket, as batters are becoming a lot more aggressive these days. тАЬItтАЩs pretty exciting and a bit of new territory - I havenтАЩt played test cricket in a long time. ThereтАЩs a little bit of learning as I go, which is funny to say at 30.тАЭ One recent lesson has particularly enhanced SodhiтАЩs threat at the bowling crease, lengthening his run up to generate more speed through the air, a factor he thinks will assist him on potentially docile Pakistani pitches. тАЬThe big thing that IтАЩve changed recently has been my run up, just to get a bit more energy to the crease,тАЭ he said. тАЬItтАЩs made my lines a little bit more consistent, and hopefully that helps me when I do get the chance to play some red-ball cricket again. тАЬAlthough itтАЩs in Asia, I donтАЩt think the wickets have been turning a hell of a lot, so youтАЩve got to work out ways to get dismissals. ItтАЩs about bringing both edges into play - thatтАЩs going to be really important - and bowling a slightly quicker pace.тАЭ Although honing his approach in T20 cricket had proven crucial to his chances of starting the first test in Karachi on Boxing Day, it wasnтАЩt just his cap that Sodhi was looking forward to leaving behind.

Uganda won the toss and elected to bowl 1st. Victoria Pearls have dominated the last three wins because of their opening bowling combination of Irene Alumo and Evelyn Anyipo. Once they were put off their lines today, Tanzania was able to grow into the game eventually finishing on 116. In ladiesтАЩ cricket especially against sides that are evenly matched anything over 100 is more or less the winning runs. In the chase, Uganda lost the steady Kevin Awino very early but Janet Mbabazi (33) got a promotion to number 3 and held the Uganda innings together for most of the innings. However, Uganda kept losing wickets and this led the asking rate to keep going up. Rita Musamali (24) provided some flashes with the blade down the order but in the end, Uganda was short by 12 runs. Uganda lost by 12 runs and will blame themselves for gifting Tanzania 16 extras which in the end made the difference. The Victoria Pearls will also have to rethink the idea of batting second, apart from Captain Consy Aweko batting at number 9 none of the other batters has a strike rate over 90, which means that any challenging total will be a big task for them to chase down. The Victoria Pearls will be in action tomorrow as they take old enemy Kenya. The winner of this clash will be sure to play in the final.","pubDate":"2022-12-17 16:37:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"kawowo","country":["uganda"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ramiz Raja likely to be removed as Pakistan Cricket Board chief, Here's why","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ramiz-raja-likely-to-be-removed-as-pakistan-cricket-board-chief-here-s-why-pakistan-vs-england-pak-vs-eng-2022-12-17-832026","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ramiz Raja is likely to be removed as chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board.

But the 28-year-old spinner said he did not experience any trouble in adjusting to Test cricket as he was not totally cut off from cricket, being involved in white-ball cricket for India. \"Kahne ke liye toh do saal hain par mujhe kabhi feel hi nahi huwa kyun ki main white-ball cricket khel raha tha (It might be nearly two years (22 months) but I never felt it that way because I was involved in white-ball cricket),\" Yadav told the media at the end of the third day's proceedings in Chattogram on Friday. Yadav said he did not feel any pressure playing his first Test in nearly two years as he was playing some form of cricket after gaining fitness following a knee surgery in 2021. The pace of the game and the formations may be a bit different but I did not face difficulty adapting to Test cricket, said Yadav. \"I was playing white-ball cricket since my comeback from injury -- playing T20 and One-day cricket. In between, I also played red-ball cricket for India A against New Zealand A and I bowled a long spell. Because of my bowling style, I did't find it much more difficult to switch from white-ball to red-ball cricket. \"Of course, I was a bit nervous as I was playing red-ball cricket after a long gap but I was not thinking about my performance. The formation is quite different and so are the field positions, you need to have more control in Test cricket -- so I was a bit nervous about these things but I felt quite good at the end of the first innings,\" said Kuldeep Yadav. Having scored a vital 40 off 114 balls batting down the order in India's first innings, Yadav said the pitch was perfect for batting. \"I believe it was a perfect wicket to bat on. I batted for 20 overs and it was really good to bat against spinners as well. Me and Ash bhai (R Ashwin) were initially looking at a first innings score of 360 but as time passed, batting became easier so we looked at a 400-run total. \"It's just keeping low sometimes and the odd ball is turning a bit. I think the wicket will remain the same. Probably on the fourth day, we will get more turn from spinners. So, we are hoping that in the second innings we will probably get more turn compared to the first innings,\" Yadav added. He did not agree to the suggestion that India delayed declaring their second innings as they were afraid (of Bangladesh chasing the target).

Now, on the road to recovery after undergoing a surgery to remove loose bone fragments and repair cartilage of his troublesome left ankle, Marsh believes he made the right call to go under the knife as the issue meant cricket had become a bit unenjoyable for him in those 12 months. \"Probably about 12 months I carried the injury for. It's obviously not ideal, but with the landscape of cricket these days being 12 months of the year, most guys carry things throughout the whole year,\" said Marsh on SEN WA Breakfast show. \"Mine sort of got to the point where (cricket) sort of got a bit unenjoyable to be honest and I want to enjoy playing my cricket and have a long time left in my career hopefully. This is all done on the basis that it's going to help me play as an all-rounder for the next five years at least and I'm really glad I got it done.\" It's probably not until you stop playing that you realise how sore you were at times. I want to be fully fit and play as an all rounder and play as much cricket for Australia as I possibly can,\" he added.

Under Williamson, New Zealand played in 40 Tests, winning 22, drawing eight and losing 10 matches (also two ending as no-result) and took the team to winning inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) in Southampton in June 2021. \"He took the Blackcaps to unprecedented success, he brought so much consistency of high performance (in) that side, right throughout all forms of the game he's achieved so much,\" said McCullum on SENZ Mornings radio show. \"He's done it in such an understated kind of a Kane Williamson, relaxed manner and I think he's been able to inspire fans not just from New Zealand to play cricket but also around the world there's lots of people who consider Kane Williamson's Blackcaps side as their second favourite team because of how they carry themselves and what they achieve.\" He's left the cap in a much better place, or the blazer as it is, when it comes to the New Zealand captaincy position. He's left the blazer in a better position than he found it, which was obviously off me. He's done a remarkable job and I look forward to sitting down with him at some stage and opening a nice bottle of wine and toasting to everything that he's achieved,\" he added. Though McCullum admitted to being surprised over Williamson leaving Test captaincy, he explained why the Tauranga-based batter stepped away from the role, with veteran pacer Tim Southee now appointed as the New Zealand skipper in Tests. \"I didn't think Kane was ready to step away just yet even though there'd been a couple of conversations recently. He sort of was trying to work out how to relax his workload a little bit. But I guess there's two parts to it: one is I think Tim Southee will do a fabulous job and he'll get all the support in the world from Kane as a foot soldier now, just as Tim gave everything that he could as a foot soldier to Kane in his captaincy. I think the second part is what an amazing job Kane did as captain of the Blackcaps for as long as he did,\" he said. The 34-year old Southee has led New Zealand in 22 T20Is and has served as Williamson's deputy alongside opener Tom Latham in the last few years. McCullum, currently England's Test coach, expects Southee, currently New Zealand's third-highest wicket-taker in history of the game, to lead the side through an aggressive and free-flowing brand of cricket. \"I think he'll do a fabulous job. I think it's a really good appointment, to be honest. I know obviously I'm on tour elsewhere and we're going to come up against New Zealand in six weeks' time or something but I think it's a really good appointment,\" said McCullum. \"(I'm excited to watch) how Tim goes about it because he's got a very aggressive cricketing mind as well and he'll want to play the game in a free-spirited way too so it'll be fascinating. It's exciting albeit there's a tinge of sadness for New Zealand as well,\" he added. Southee's first assignment as Test captain will be a two-match tour of Pakistan, starting from the first match in Karachi from December 26-30, followed by the second Test at Multan from January 3-7. Both matches are a part of the World Test Championship (WTC) cycle.

Credit: Getty Lyon claimed the players had no choice but to compose themselves and get on with the match after every Australian player went over and embraced the police to pay their respect. тАЬThatтАЩs our job,тАЭ Lyon said. тАЬIt was a pretty amazing moment, and maybe itтАЩs probably not the right word, but to go and say thank you to the cops or the police force after. I think that was a really nice moment. тАЬI know we all had a little moment there and we all said how tough that was. But come cricket time weтАЩve got to do our job.тАЭ Save Log in , register or subscribe to save articles for later.
