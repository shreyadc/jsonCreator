Before the start of the last five overs, India were in search of acceleration to get a mammoth total as Zimbabwe took three quick wickets in 11 balls. Suryakumar arrived and changed the tempo of the match yet again with the absolutely insane striking of the ball. He smacked six fours and four sixes in a death overs batting masterclass at a strike rate of 244 to end up with 61 not out off just 25 balls. His belligerent knock, laced with his trademark scoops and mesmerizing lofted shots, meant India got 79 runs in the last five overs. India skipper Rohit Sharma heaped praise on Yadav for producing astonishing knocks to propel the side toward a position of strength. \"What SKY (Surya Kumar Yadav) is doing for the team is remarkable, just coming out there, playing that way, taking the pressure off the others. We know his ability, and it allows the guy at the other end to take his time.\" \"The dugout can really be at ease when he bats, and he's shown a lot of composure when he's batted. We expected this from him, and he's gone from strength to strength,\" said Rohit in the post-match presentation ceremony. While being pleased with India topping Group 2 in a comprehensive performance, they will now be up against England in the second semifinal of the tournament at Adelaide Oval on Thursday. Rohit felt adjusting to conditions at the venue, where India won by five runs in a tense match against Bangladesh, will be the key. \"The key for us will be to adjust quickly to the conditions. We have played a game there, but we need to adjust quickly. England are a good team, and it will be a great contest. We should take pride in qualifying, firstly, and if we play that semifinal well, we have another big game as well.\" \"It's about understanding the lines and lengths -- the square boundaries are shorter -- and executing well. A very good all-round performance, something we were looking for. We had qualified, but we wanted to come out and play the way we wanted to play, which we achieved.\" Rohit signed off by expressing gratitude to the fans for coming out in support of the team in large numbers on match day. \"The fans have been brilliant all this while, almost everywhere we have gone we've got a full house, and we expect the same in the semifinals as well.

He is currently placed 3rd on the list of highest run-getters of the tournament with 225 runs against his name. But what has really stood out for him is his magnificent strike rate of 193. Now, Indian captain on Sunday said his \"dugout can really be at ease\" when Suryakumar Kumar is in the middle playing astonishing shots. Suryakumar reaffirmed his status as the world's number one T20 batter with another magnificent effort as India crushed Zimbabwe by 71 runs to set up a T20 World Cup semifinal date with England. \"The dugout can really be at ease when he bats, and he's shown a lot of composure when he's batted. We expected this from him, and he's gone from strength to strength,\" Rohit said at the post-match presentation ceremony. Suryakumar blasted an unbeaten 61 from 25 balls after set it up with a brisk fifty. In reply to India's 186 for five, Zimbabwe were bowled out for 115 in 17.2 overs. \"What SKY is doing for the team is remarkable, just coming out there, playing that way, taking the pressure off the others. We know his ability, and it allows the guy at the other end to take his time,\" Rohit added. Zimbabwe's batting depth was never enough to challenge the Indian bowlers with Ravichandran Ashwin (3/22) enjoying a good day at the office. In fact, all the other Indian bowlers were among the wickets in one of the most lopsided games of this global event. \"A very good all-round performance, something we were looking for. We had qualified, but we wanted to come out and play the way we wanted to play, which we achieved,\" said Rohit. Rohit said going into the semifinals at the Adelaide Oval, the key will be adjusting to the conditions quickly. \"The key for us will be to adjust quickly to the conditions.

On behalf of the team I'd really like to thank them,\" Rohit added. While the cricket world might be in awe of his game, Player of the Match Suryakumar said he is not trying anything different, and only looks to execute what he does at training in the match. \"I think the plan was very clear when me and Hardik were batting. He said let's take the positive route and see where we end up. We started hitting the ball well and never stopped till the 20th over. The atmosphere in the team is very nice, and the build-up to the knockouts has been very nice. My plan is always clear. I'm not trying anything different. I bat the same way in the nets as well,\" added Rohit. Asked about his performance this year, Suryakumar said, \"Feels really good, but coming out and starting from zero is what I always think when I come out to bat, and I'll keep doing that. It's good to see people come out and support us like this even after we've qualified.\" Suryakumar Yadav and Team India will next be in action against England at Adelaide Oval on November 10.","pubDate":"2022-11-06 18:13:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup: Optimistic India seeks to qualify for semifinals against a lively Zimbabwe","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup-optimistic-india-seeks-to-qualify-for-semifinals-against-a-lively-zimbabwe-621917","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Though India have a 5-2 edge over Zimbabwe in T20Is with their last face-off happening in 2016, it will be the first time that these two teams will be meeting in a T20 World Cup game.","content":"MELBOURNE: Exactly two weeks after India opened their Men's T20 World Cup campaign against Pakistan in a thrilling four-wicket victory at a sold-out Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Rohit Sharma-led side will be back at the iconic venue to seal their semifinal berth in the final Group 2 match of Super 12s against a lively Zimbabwe on Sunday. Though India have a 5-2 edge over Zimbabwe in T20Is with their last face-off happening in 2016, it will be the first time that these two teams will be meeting in a T20 World Cup game. While India have survived scares against Pakistan and Bangladesh, they will be fully aware that Zimbabwe can't be taken lightly. After all, the Chevrons, as Zimbabwe are called back home, did inflict an upset one-run win over Pakistan at Perth. Known for going hard at power-play due to embracing ultra-attacking batting approach, India haven't been able to get a solid opening partnership so far in the tournament. A look at their power-play scores suggests that the side have been suffering from opening blues: 31/3 against Pakistan (MCG), 32/1 against Netherlands (SCG), 33/2 against South Africa (Perth Stadium) and 37/1 against Bangladesh at Adelaide Oval. Their highest opening partnership is just 23, which doesn't do justice to the prowess of Rohit and Rahul. Though Rohit got a scratchy fifty against Netherlands and Rahul slammed a half-century against Bangladesh to end a string of low scores, India would like for the duo to have a good opening partnership before knockout arrive. Virat Kohli has been explosive with the bat while Suryakumar Yadav has chipped in whenever India needed a move on in their momentum. India would also want for Hardik Pandya and Dinesh Karthik to make a sizeable contribution with lower-order power-hitting. The bowling has been great for India barring when South Africa chased down 134 or Litton Das was putting up a show with the bat in power-play. Young left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh is admirably leading the charge with the new ball as well as in the death overs, with the other bowlers chipping in. After being sloppy in the field against the Proteas, India were excellent in this department in a rain-hit match against Bangladesh. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, will be aiming to finish the tournament on a high which has been a memorable one for them. In all-rounder Sikandar Raza, they have a shining sensation who has been a force behind them for sparking performances in the tournament.

Australia's semifinal qualification hopes hinge on the England vs Sri Lanka match currently underway at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Jos Buttler's team's loss can only bring joy to the Australians. But, given the way they have played in the tournament, losing the Super 12 opener to New Zealand by 89 runs, would have given the selectors food for thought. With the next T20 World Cup, to be hosted jointly in the Caribbean and the United States, the selectors have their task cut out and Taylor said one of the steps could be to bring in youngsters, as T20 cricket is not a game of 37 year olds. While skipper Aaron Finch and opening batter David Warner will both be 37 for the 2024 edition of the tournament, Glenn Maxwell and Steve Smith will be 35 and Marcus Stoinis 34. Wicketkeeper Matthew Wade has already said this is his last T20 World Cup. \"I don't see T20 cricket being a 37-year-old's game at the absolute elite level,\" Taylor was quoted as saying by Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday. \"It might be terrific from a spectacle point of view but at the top level you want young people playing this game,\" added the former skipper, who has played 104 Tests and 113 ODIs and been one of the most prolific run-getters for Australia. Taylor has doubts over Finch's future in the wake of his poor form continuing in the World Cup. \"When you're an opening batsman — I do know what it's like even though I didn't play T20 and facing guys bowling 140 km/h or quicker it's not always easy to stay in, but take them for eight or nine an over that's even harder. That often requires younger people with younger eyes and quicker feet. That's what Australia need to look at for our future,\" said Taylor, indicating the 35-year-old Finch was likely not suited for the job now. Mitchell Starc's omission for the game against Afghanistan surprised several present and former cricketers across the world including Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott, and Taylor felt Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins should have been left out instead. \"He's (Cummins) been struggling in this World T20,\" Taylor said. \"I was surprised with it (decision to drop Starc) because I thought if there's one guy who might be able to bundle out the tail or pick up some wickets with the new ball it might be Starcy.\" IANS","pubDate":"2022-11-06 18:03:39","image_url":"https://assets.sentinelassam.com/h-upload/2022/11/06/409813-2e2c3-16676303971960-1920.avif","source_id":"sentinel","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Want to take consistency from the tournament with us: Ervine","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/want-to-take-consistency-from-the-tournament-with-us-ervine-621914","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"With confidence brimming and the goal of making Super 12s achieved, Zimbabwe were now in the pursuit of making life tough for the big teams clubbed alongside them.","content":"MELBOURNE: Coming into the Men's T20 World Cup, not many had predicted that Zimbabwe would enter the Super 12 stage of the tournament, though they were riding on a new wave of results since July. After all, they were placed in a tough Group A of the first round which included two-time champions West Indies, Ireland and Scotland. But Zimbabwe scraped through to defeat Ireland and Scotland to top the table and enter the Group 2 of the Super 12s. With confidence brimming and the goal of making Super 12s achieved, Zimbabwe were now in the pursuit of making life tough for the big teams clubbed alongside them. Though their match against South Africa was washed out, Zimbabwe managed to stun Pakistan by successfully defending 130 and winning by one run. They had some disappointments too, losing by three runs to Bangladesh and comprehensively beaten by the Netherlands in a five-wicket defeat. Now, looking back at their campaign ahead of their final match against India at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, captain Craig Ervine wants to build upon the consistency shown by his team in the tournament for achieving bigger goals in the future. \"We knew that coming into this tournament, we had really good momentum. We got some great results leading into the tournament. The confidence and everything was up for us coming into the tournament and our main goal was to qualify for the Super 12s as well as still performing against some of the bigger teams. \"Going away from the World Cup, we want to take that sort of consistency with us. We know that the cricketing schedule is very busy going forward, so we want to keep this momentum that we have created. We have created a good support base now that many people are following Zimbabwe cricket. We want to try keep it that way and build on it going forward,\" said Ervine in the pre-match press conference. Against Bangladesh, Zimbabwe were close to making an upset victory and spice up the tournament. But their inability to score even a single run off the last two balls of the game, especially after no-ball was called when teams were already back in the dugout, was a pinching loss for Ervine and Zimbabwe. \"The loss to Bangladesh was very disappointing, especially to come so close. More so from the position that we were in, we were pretty much looked out of the game. But then Sean Williams and Ryan Burl together almost took us over the line. \"Then the last ball being a no-ball, and to come back on the field, you sort of sit back and think maybe we weren't destined for it. It's such a quick turnaround in this tournament. You can't really sit and think if we had done this or that as there's a next game which is few days away. So, we have to just kick on and look at the next game,\" expressed Ervine.

Kohli has scored most of his centuries and made his maximum contributions coming in at his favourite No.3 slot, though he scored his maiden T20I century — 122 not out vs Afghanistan in the 2022 Asia Cup in the UAE — opening the innings. Kohli's form slump had made the India team management experiment with his batting order but he returned to his usual No.3 slot in the ICC T20 World Cup and has been in supreme form with 220 runs in four matches and emerging as the leading run-scorer in the tournament with an average of 220. He played an astonishing knock of 82 not out against Pakistan in India's four-wicket win at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on October 23. \"In that number three slot, let him feel comfortable; let him work his way into the tournament,\" Ponting opined on ICC. \"I've also learned about the T20 game over the years that I've been involved, is it's more of an older man's game, or older person's game, than a young man's game. \"Just with the knowledge and the know-how and the expertise in situations like Virat has been confronted with a couple of times. They've (players like Kohli) done it before, and they tend to find a way to get it done more often than not. India now, I think, are reaping the rewards of keeping him there and if they go on to the next stage then I'm sure he'll produce something big in one of the finals as well,\" added Ponting. The Australia legend also gave an insight into how Kohli might make the most of his recent form struggles, based on Ponting's experiences across 17 years playing at the top level. While Kohli has said taking a break from the game recently helped him refresh, Ponting believes the support of family and teammates would also have been pivotal in his return to form. \"(It's) a great learning experience for Virat as a cricket person, to actually get to a point in his career when he had to change, had to do something different,\" Ponting said. \"We know he's always been a really hard worker, he's always been fit, always looked after his diet and been a great trainer. That worked for him up until a certain period of time where he had to look elsewhere and find other ways to get back to being a great player again. \"At the end of the day, we all play the game to try and do the right thing by our family, by our teammates and our fans. And that's probably the order that it goes in, to be honest. You want to make your family proud, you want to win games for your teammates and you want to have the people that turn up to watch, whether it's at the venue or through the TV screens, you want them to be proud of what you've done as well,\" added Ponting.

Reports indicate that the 31-year-old has been charged with four counts of sexual intercourse without consent. The batsman, who is one of his country’s biggest stars, was subsequently denied bail during a brief hearing at a court in Sydney. He is alleged to have assaulted a 29-year-old who he met online at a residence in the area earlier in the week. “ The woman met with the man after communicating with him for a number of days via an online dating application; it’s alleged he then sexually assaulted her on the evening of Wednesday, November 2, 2022 ,” a statement issued by New South Wales police said. “ As part of ongoing investigations, a crime scene examination was undertaken by specialist police at an address in Rose Bay yesterday. Following further inquiries, a 31-year-old man was arrested at a hotel on Sussex Street, Sydney, shortly before 1am today [Sunday morning] .” A post shared by DANNY (@danushkagunathilaka) New South Wales Police Commander Jayne Doherty said Gunathilaka had allegedly “ assaulted [the woman] a number of times while performing sex acts upon her .” Sri Lanka Cricket also confirmed that it was notified by the ICC that Gunathilaka had been arrested on allegations of the sexual assault of a woman in Sydney. It said the accused is due to appear in court on Monday. “ SLC will closely monitor the proceedings in court and, in consultation with the ICC, will expeditiously initiate a thorough inquiry into the matter and take stern action against the player if found guilty ,” it added. It was also confirmed that the Sri Lanka team have left Australia without Gunathilaka after their defeat by England earlier on Saturday. Gunathilaka had been ruled out of taking part in the tournament through injury and has represented Sri Lanka in various forms of cricket since 2015. He has drawn the ire of Sri Lankan cricket authorities on numerous occasions in the past. In 2017, he was suspended for repeatedly missing training sessions, while in 2018 he was cleared after a woman alleged he was present in a hotel room while she was raped by another man. Last year, he was handed an extended suspension after he was found to have breached Covid-19 lockdown rules in the UK during Sri Lanka’s tour of England.","pubDate":"2022-11-06 15:27:50","image_url":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.11/thumbnail/6367ca8485f5407b7929db7e.jpg","source_id":"rt","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Zimbabwe Highlights, T20 World Cup 2022: IND win by 71 runs, enter semis as table-toppers - CNBCTV18","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmN0djE4LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvaW5kaWEtdnMtemltYmFid2UtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS10MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjItaW5kLXZzLXppbS1tYXRjaC11cGRhdGVzLW1lbGJvdXJuZS0xNTEwMzU1MS5odG3SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Zimbabwe Highlights, T20 World Cup 2022: IND win by 71 runs, enter semis as table-toppers  CNBCTV18India vs Zimbabwe LIVE | India Thrashes Zimbabwe By 71 Runs | T20 World Cup  India TodayLive match blog - India vs Zimbabwe 42nd Match, Group 2 2022/23 - Cricket Insights  ESPNcricinfoIndia vs Zimbabwe Live Match Score | T20 World Cup 2022 LIVE | Ind vs Zim Live | Cricket News LIVE  CNN-News18Live Cricket Score - India vs Zimbabwe, Super 12, T20 WC 2022 | Cricbuzz.com  CricbuzzView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-06 14:58:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"\"England Will Be...\": Rohit Sharma Opens Up On Key Factors In India's T20 World Cup Semi-final - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS90MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjIvZW5nbGFuZC13aWxsLWJlLXJvaGl0LXNoYXJtYS1vcGVucy11cC1vbi1rZXktZmFjdG9ycy1pbi1pbmRpYXMtdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1zZW1pLWZpbmFsLTM0OTU2ODDSAZABaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cC0yMDIyL2VuZ2xhbmQtd2lsbC1iZS1yb2hpdC1zaGFybWEtb3BlbnMtdXAtb24ta2V5LWZhY3RvcnMtaW4taW5kaWFzLXQyMC13b3JsZC1jdXAtc2VtaS1maW5hbC0zNDk1NjgwL2FtcC8x?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"\"England Will Be...\": Rohit Sharma Opens Up On Key Factors In India's T20 World Cup Semi-final  NDTV SportsIndia vs Zimbabwe LIVE | India Thrashes Zimbabwe By 71 Runs | T20 World Cup  India TodayLive match blog - India vs Zimbabwe 42nd Match, Group 2 2022/23 - Cricket Insights  ESPNcricinfoLive Cricket Score - India vs Zimbabwe, Super 12, T20 WC 2022 | Cricbuzz.com  CricbuzzIndia vs Zimbabwe, T20 World Cup 2022, Highlights: India Thrash Zimbabwe To Top Group 2, Set To Face England In Semi-finals  NDTV SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-06 14:47:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Adelaide Oval Cricket Ground pitch report: Adelaide Oval pitch report batting or bowling for India vs England semi final","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-adelaide-oval-cricket-ground-pitch-report-adelaide-oval-pitch-report-batting-or-bowling-for-india-vs-england-semi-final/","keywords":["Cricket","Adelaide Oval","England","ICC T20 World Cup 2022","India"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"After quite a many close finishes and massive upsets till the last day of the ‘Super 12’ stage, the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 has got its four semi-finalists in India, Pakistan (from Group 2), England and New Zealand (from Group 1).

It was a Super Sunday at the Adelaide Oval in particular. Pakistan had the luck all smiling at them when, who crashed South Africa out with a 13-run victory, provided them with a massive lifeline which they humbly accepted with both hands and miraculously made it through to the semi-final after a 5-wicket victory against Bangladesh. The Netherlands victory benefitted India as well, as they automatically advanced through without needing the mandatory victory required against Zimbabwe later, at the . Despite the development, India did play true to their potential against the African nation with a massive 71-run victory, which made them the eventual table-toppers of ‘Super 12 Group 2’. They will now face the ever-challenging England side during the second semi-final of the tournament, scheduled to take place at the Adelaide Oval on November 10 (Thursday). For those unaware, England had made it through to the semi-final after defeating Sri Lanka during a close encounter on Saturday, at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). During the previous few T20 World Cup 2022 matches at this venue, the two-paced nature of the pitch has brought the spinners into play, who have not only managed to keep the run-flow in check but pick up crucial wickets as well during the middle Overs. Netherlands’ ‘Player of the Match’ against South Africa Colin Ackermann, and later Pakistan skipper Babar Azam as well post the next match at this very venue, mentioned about the slowness of the wicket which made it a tad difficult for the batters to get going with their innings. “The surface was slower and we knew 160 was competitive, yeah it was a great performance,” exclaimed Ackermann while mentioning that his team’s total of 168/4 was defendable enough on the Adelaide pitch. “Pitch wasn’t easy to bat on. Little bit two-paced. Me and Rizwan decided to go long, but unfortunately didn’t work out,” remarked Babar Azam who yet again struggled to get about with his innings. Having said that, batting will become easier after spending some time at the crease, with the shorter square boundaries coming to their advantage.","pubDate":"2022-11-06 14:47:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan is winning T20 World Cup 2022: Pakistan cricket team fan Momin Saqib draws STUNNING analogy with 1992 ODI World Cup","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/pakistan-is-winning-t20-world-cup-2022-pakistan-cricket-team-fan-momin-saqib-draws-stunning-analogy-with-1992-odi-world-cup-2531885.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan's win over Bangladesh ensured that they would be the fourth semi-finalists in the tournament with India joining England and New Zealand earlier in the day following South Africa's exit.","content":"Momin Saqib AKA Maro Mujhe Maro Guy is arguably one of the biggest fans of the Pakistan cricket team.

Smashing his third half-century in the tournament, Yadav smashed 61 unbeaten runs off mere 25 deliveries with the help of 6 Fours and 4 Sixes, to help India with a power finish to the total of 186/5 in their 20 Overs. Earlier, KL Rahul (51 off 35) too smashed his second-consecutive half-century of the ongoing World Cup, to get back to his much-needed form ahead of the semi-final. India had already made it after Netherlands, earlier in the day, humbled South Africa with a huge upset by defeating them with a 13-run margin at the Adelaide Oval. A win has ensured that India top the ‘Super 12 Group 2’ with 8 points under their belt. The spectators’ official attendance at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) today during the India versus Zimbabwe ‘Super 12’ contest was 82,507, as confirmed by the venue’s official Twitter handle. Tonight’s attendance is 82,507 🎉 — Melbourne Cricket Ground (@MCG) As per an earlier estimate on Saturday from one of the journalists at the venue, around 88,000 people were expected to arrive at the MCG even to witness India play against a low-ranked Zimbabwe. The expected massive turnout perhaps had to do with the fact that India were supposed to defeat Zimbabwe in order to make it through to the semi-final. However, the reason for a few thousand dip in attendance perhaps had to do with the fact that India had already booked their semi-final ticket before their match, after Netherlands earlier surprised the Cricketing fraternity with a huge upset, crashing the latter out of the tournament, while helping India go through.

Pakistan made an inauspicious start to their Super 12 campaign, losing their tournament opener to arch-rivals India followed by another last-ball loss to Zimbabwe. By the time Pakistan registered their second victory against South Africa in a rain-truncated match in Sydney, their fate had slipped out of their own hands. Their slim chances of making the last four depended on the Netherlands pulling off a giant-killing act against South Africa at the Adelaide Oval. Much to their relief, the Dutch team under Scott Edwards did just that, eking out a 13-run victory which was their first against South Africa in any format. After the Dutch side post a competitive 158-4, Brandon Glover (3-9) led a lion-hearted bowling effort to restrict South Africa to 145-8. The result provided a lifeline for Pakistan who then needed to beat Bangladesh in their final Super 2 game to move into the semi-finals. Babar's team did precisely that with a five-wicket victory to stay in contention for a second T20 World Cup title. \"We played pretty good cricket in the tournament,\" Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Afridi told a new conference. \"Even the two matches we lost, those were in the final delivery. We did not get the results we wanted but there is no doubt that we played good cricket.\" The Pakistan players watched on nervously as the Dutch side stunned South Africa, who again lived up to their \"chokers\" tag in global tournaments. \"We watched the game, it was a great result for us,\" said Afridi, whose 4-22 against Bangladesh earned him the player-of-the-match award. \"But we know the result was not in our hand, so we were preparing for our game (against Bangladesh).\" Pakistan bowler Shahnawaz Dahani posted on Twitter a couple of photos of Dutch cricketers with a caption saying \"Friends in need are friends indeed\".

Yadav, 32, continued to treat bowlers with utter disrespect scoring his 12th T20I half-century, 10th under Rohit Sharma, ninth this year, eighth at No. 4, fourth at a neutral venue, third in Australia and first against Zimbabwe in the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2022 Match 42 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Coming in to bat at No. 4 in the 12th over, Yadav scored an insane 61* (25) with the help of six fours and four sixes to play a titular role in powering India to 186/5 in 20 overs after Sharma won the toss and chose to bat. Had it not been for Yadav’s unbelievable knock, the Indian team would’ve never been able to score 107 runs in the second half of their innings (79 in the last quarter). Out of this world stuff from SKY🔥👏 Why don’t you share the cheat code for batting with us ?😉 — Lasith Malinga (@malinga_ninety9) Batting at a strike rate of 244 is one thing but batting in the manner in which Yadav is batting these days is completely other. The sheer effortlessness with which Yadav hit Zimbabwean fast bowlers behind the stumps spoke highly about him being in a class of his own. A street-smart batter who backs his instincts and skills to a tee, Yadav forced the opposition to be short of answers in a dead-rubber match. With all his last 10 T20 innings coming for India, Yadav has amassed 413 runs at an average of 59 and a strike rate of 192.99 with the help of as many as six half-centuries in this period.","pubDate":"2022-11-06 11:02:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"South Africa and World Cups: A love story carved by Eris","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/south-africa-lost-to-netherlands-by-13-runs-and-crashed-out-of-t20-world-cup-2022-2022-11-06-821748","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The world of cricket, over its glorious history, has witnessed great, rather legendary stories.

Stories about underdogs, of invincibles, of incomprehensible victories, indelible losses, and of gods walking. South Africa's story, on a cricket field, seems to be carved out by Eris, the god of chaos and hate. One such story was at play when South Africa took on the Netherlands in Adelaide on November 6, Sunday. The result was a given. But hey, where there's South Africa, nothing is really set in stone. There was always going to be a wee bit of possibility of what ultimately happened, but no one would have seriously thought about what transpired. It was, as I previously stated, all set in stone. Cricket is a funny game, sure it is, but South Africa wasn't supposed to lose. At least not this one. But as has been the case with this World Cup over and over, there was another upset in store. Another heist in store. This time, it would knock out one of the favourites to win the whole thing. Protea fire was alive and well. The last World Cup had everyone hoping so. If it wasn't for the run rate in 2021, South Africa lived up to the standards set by the legends of the game gone by. When I say, this wasn't supposed to happen, it is because South Africa had almost everything going for them. They had a world-class pace attack comprising of Anrich Nortje, Rabada, Parnell, and Ngidi. That was about bowling. Apart from their skipper Bavuma, they had two of the most destructive batters up their ranks in Rilee Rossouw and QDK. Add to that the killer aspect of Miller, and the class of Markram, there you have it, the recipe to win a global tournament. It was all going according to plan. They came in, beat Bangladesh by a huge margin, set the ball rolling, and then crushed India. They were looking like the only invincibles of the tournament. Come the last day of the Super 12 stage, all they had to do was restrict the minnows Netherlands to a gettable total, chase it, and walk into the semifinals.But hey, we are talking about South Africa, the ultimate chokers of international cricket. Something had to give in, right? Something had to happen for them to live up to their infamous tag. \"Hard one to swallow. We had the confidence and belief in ourselves as a unit to make the playoffs. Unfortunately for us, we couldn't do it. Winning the toss and bowling, what they got wasn't ideal. We lost wickets at crucial times. They used the dimensions of the field a lot better than we did,\" said Bavuma after losing to the Netherlands by 13 runs. After all these years of heartbreaks and emotional losses, Temba Bavuma's team had everything to carve out a legacy far beyond anyone could have ever imagined. But as has been the case with them over the years, the infamous tag had to persist. The heartbreak had to happen, for there are no greater chokers in World cricket than the South African cricket team. And for the record, I did not enjoy writing that.","pubDate":"2022-11-06 10:56:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs ZIM, T20 World Cup 2022, LIVE Updates: Mohammed Shami Strikes Again, Zimbabwe Five Down In 187-Run Chase vs India - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS90MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjIvaW5kLXZzLXppbS10MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjItc3VwZXItMTItZ3JvdXAtMi1pbmRpYS12cy16aW1iYWJ3ZS1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMzQ5NDQxNdIBjAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS90MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjIvaW5kLXZzLXppbS10MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjItc3VwZXItMTItZ3JvdXAtMi1pbmRpYS12cy16aW1iYWJ3ZS1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMzQ5NDQxNS9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs ZIM, T20 World Cup 2022, LIVE Updates: Mohammed Shami Strikes Again, Zimbabwe Five Down In 187-Run Chase vs India  NDTV SportsIndia vs Zimbabwe Live Match Score | T20 World Cup 2022 LIVE | Ind vs Zim Live | Cricket News LIVE  CNN-News18A Zimbabwean banana peel on India's route to the semis | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIndia Vs Zimbabwe: The Match To Lookout For | #MissionDownUnder Powered By Dafa News | NewsX  NewsXSurya blitzkrieg takes India to 186/6  Economic TimesView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-06 10:36:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket is a funny game: Babar Azam after SF qualification","link":"https://thenewsmill.com/2022/11/cricket-is-a-funny-game-babar-azam-after-sf-qualification/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","ANI"],"creator":["ANI"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-06 10:31:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsmill","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shoaib Akhtar Leads Celebrations As Memes Flood Social Media After Pakistan Reach T20 World Cup Semi.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS90MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjIvc2hvYWliLWFraHRhci1sZWFkcy1jZWxlYnJhdGlvbnMtYXMtbWVtZXMtZmxvb2Qtc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLWFmdGVyLXBha2lzdGFuLXJlYWNoLXQyMC13b3JsZC1jdXAtc2VtaXMtMzQ5NTIyOdIBngFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS90MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjIvc2hvYWliLWFraHRhci1sZWFkcy1jZWxlYnJhdGlvbnMtYXMtbWVtZXMtZmxvb2Qtc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLWFmdGVyLXBha2lzdGFuLXJlYWNoLXQyMC13b3JsZC1jdXAtc2VtaXMtMzQ5NTIyOS9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shoaib Akhtar Leads Celebrations As Memes Flood Social Media After Pakistan Reach T20 World Cup Semi..  NDTV SportsLive Cricket Score - Pakistan vs Bangladesh, Super 12, T20 WC 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzLive match blog - Bangladesh vs Pakistan 41st Match, Group 2 2022/23 - Cricket Insights  ESPNcricinfo\"Aap Bahut Bade Chokers Hai\": Shoaib Akhtar Brutally Trolls South Africa After Defeat vs Netherlands | Cricket News  NDTV SportsLive Cricket Score - Pakistan vs Bangladesh, Super 12, T20 WC 2022 | Cricbuzz.com  CricbuzzView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-06 10:28:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PAG vs SVD Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing XIs, Player Stats, Pitch Report the ICCA Arabian T20 League, Match 21","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/pag-vs-svd-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-xis-player-stats-pitch-report-icca-arabian-t20-league-match-21?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Adarsh Tabhane"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Pacific Group (PAG) will take on Seven Districts (SVD) in the 21st game of the ICCA Arabian T20 League at the ICC Academy, Dubai, UAE on Sunday (November 6).
