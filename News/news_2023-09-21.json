The game was abandoned just before 5pm without a ball being bowled even though rain had stopped in Leeds just after 2pm, 90 minutes after the scheduled start time. Boos greeted the decision by umpires Mike Burns and Adrian Holdstock from the smattering of spectators left on the ground who had waited patiently for a shortened game that should have been possible by 5pm at the latest. Instead a ‘saturated outfield’ was blamed for the abandonment, in particular a wet patch which had somehow got under the covers on the bowler’s run up at the Kirkstall Lane End the officials deemed would have been dangerous. Now the teams will move on to Trent Bridge for the second match on Saturday without Joe Root , who was thwarted in his attempt to gain 50-over rhythm ahead of the World Cup and will now rest before England leave for India on Wednesday. England’s first ODI against Ireland was called off amid farcical scenes at Headingley The game was abandoned just before 5pm without a ball being bowled on Wednesday Boos greeted the decision by umpires Mike Burns and Adrian Holdstock The frustration was made worse because of the number of inspections the umpires made seemingly only delaying the inevitable because they clearly did not feel the ground was fit. Attempts by ground-staff to dry the outfield were minimal and the 30-yard fielding restriction circle was never even put in place. Instead token inspections were made. ‘I was pretty hopeful we’d get a game to be honest,’ said Zak Crawley, who was due to make his first appearance as England captain. ‘But rain started later than forecast. I was very disappointed we didn’t play. ‘It was just the run up at this end, really. It wasn’t fit to play and that was probably the right call in the end. It was very wet and would have churned up if we’d played. ‘It wouldn’t have been fit for the bowlers. You have guys tearing in and you don’t want players not being able to perform at their best. ‘I’m not sure what happened because the bit of the ground that was wet was covered up. We were unlucky with the weather leading up to the game and this morning as well. But I’m not sure there was anything more the groundsman could have done.’ That may be so but yet again with cricket there was a complete lack of flexibility. If one end wasn’t fit then there should be nothing in the rules to stop the umpires deciding all the bowling should come from the same end. Former cricket umpire and Yorkshire icon Dickie Bird was among the fans who waited patiently No play was possible at Headingley despite attempts by ground-staff to dry the outfield It is the last thing troubled Yorkshire needed, coming so soon after the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal that engulfed the county and the financial crisis that resulted from it. At least insurance will cover refunds to spectators who had paid up to £110 for tickets to see what became a second-string England squad against low key opponents in Ireland. But it is not the first time there has been rain-related controversies at Headingley. In 2009 Yorkshire were forced to defend their new drainage system when a one-day international against West Indies was abandoned despite sun shining all day. Most famously, in 1991, blocked drains forced play in England’s Test against West Indies to be called off, with umpire Dickie Bird feeling the full force of the crowd’s anger.

However, he never got on the field at his home ground as heavy rain prevented even the possibility of a 20-over-a-side game at Headingley.

Asked to bowl first, the Rohit Sharma -led side bundled out Sri Lanka for just 50 runs, with pacer Mohammed Siraj stealing the show with his impressive six-wicket haul. Later, Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan chased down the target in just 6.1 overs and took Team India across the line with ten wickets in hand. After the final match, skipper Rohit attended a press conference, where his one comment left all the media persons in splits. During the interaction, Rohit was answering a question but he got interrupted by the sound of firecrackers, which were being burst by the fans to celebrate India's victory. The right-handed batter waited for a minute and said that the fans should wait for India to win the ODI World Cup 2023. \"It gives us a lot of confidence to come here and win a tournament like this. Through the tournament we saw a lot of..\" said Rohit when the noise of the bursting crackers interrupted him. Video pic.twitter.com/t7pcQGKEt8 \"Arey World Cup jeetne ke baad phodo ye sab..(burst crackers once we win the world cup)\", said Rohit with a smile as the media persons burst out in laughter. Talking about the match, Sri Lanka opted to bat first but Siraj soon made them regret this decision as they were reduced to 13/6 after he took four wickets in the 6th over. Kusal Mendis (17) and Dushan Hemantha (13*) swung their bats for a while, offering tiny moments of respite. Siraj ended with 6/21 in his seven overs while Pandya took 3/3 in 2.2 overs. Bumrah also got 1/23 in five overs as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 50 in 15.2 overs. Ishan Kishan (23*) and Shubman Gill (27*) chased down the target in 6.1 overs without any loss of wicket. India captured its eighth Asia Cup title and Siraj took home the 'Player of the Match' award. Kuldeep Yadav (nine wickets) was given the 'Player of the Series' award for his bamboozling spin bowling in the tournament. Shubman Gill with 302 runs in six games and one century and two fifties, scored the most runs in the tournament.

A re-run of that unforgettable 2019 final opens the tournament as defending champions England take on New Zealand, runners-up four years ago. Here’s a guide to all 10 venues you can expect to see throughout the tournament. MUST READ | When do the Proteas play at the 2023 Cricket World Cup Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad The largest sports stadium in the world will set the stage for the tournament opener, host an India vs Pakistan thriller and proudly present the World Cup’s climax final. The 132,000-capacity venue, renovated in 2021, is no stranger to history and a big occasion – in March 1987, Sunil Gavaskar became the first batter to breach the 10,000-Test run mark at the venue. Decades later, the stadium has hosted IPL finals and, in 2011, the last time that a World Cup was played in India, the hosts broke Australia’s streak of making the final of every ODI World Cup since 1996. M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru With boundary sizes of around 65 metres, M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is expected to offer some of the highest-scoring innings of the tournament. Records could be broken in a repeat of 2011, where Kevin O’Brien crashed the fastest hundred in an ODI World Cup in just 50 balls as Ireland chased down 328 to beat England. The stadium has been home to the National Cricket Academy since 2000, producing some of the finest international Indian talent seen this century. M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai Situated next the Indian Ocean, the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium will provide one of the most humid climates across all venues. In 1952, India registered their first-ever win in Test cricket when Vijay Hazare’s team defeated Donald Carr’s England. The first-ever tied Test match was played between India and Australia in 1986 at the 38,200 capacity stadium that sits just two kilometres from Marina Beach. Arun Jaitley Stadium, Delhi The Indian capital boasts one of the most historic venues in the country. Sachin Tendulkar broke Sunil Gavaskar’s record for most Test centuries when he brought up his 35th ton in a 2005 match against Sri Lanka. The stadium formerly had the reputation of producing slow pitches but, following a renovation of the square, the pace has picked up with totals to match. Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium, Dharamsala With its picturesque views, Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium is one of the newest stadiums in the country. The venue has been a regular feature in India’s home international calendar since 2013, when England visited for an ODI. With a 64-metre boundary, fans are at the heart of the action and high-scoring innings can be expected in the stadium’s opening game between Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Eden Gardens, Kolkata Before the Narendra Modi Stadium’s renovation, Eden Gardens held the title for the largest venue in India with a capacity of 68,000. It was the first stadium that hosted a World Cup final in 1987 after Lord’s hosted the first three. The lively pitch and breezy conditions next to the Hooghly River are sure to rustle up some stunning ODI clashes, as well as a World Cup semi-final meeting. Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow Lucknow’s cricket stadium, built in 2017, has not hosted a huge number of international matches before but the conditions are primed for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023. The square has had extensive renovation since the Lucknow Super Giants claimed the stadium as their home venue. The stage will be set for Australia vs South Africa on 12 October, where history will be made as the stadium hosts its first-ever World Cup fixture. Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai India’s ‘cricket capital’ boasts another colossal venue which will act as a host to the other semi-final. The distinct red-soil pitch has seen some monumental feats in the sport since it was built in 1974. From Sachin Tendulkar’s masterful innings in the 1996 Men’s Cricket World Cup to left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel’s 10/119 bowling figures for New Zealand against India, the venue is used to providing magical moments. MCA International Stadium, Pune Nestled in a secluded area on the outskirts of Pune, the stadium hosted its first international game when India took on England in 2012 — it was granted Test status in 2016. Players and fans alike flock to the 42,700-capacity stadium for its ability to conjure huge scores. The hosts will take on Bangladesh when it stages its first 2023 ICC Men’s World Cup clash on 19 October. Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad Before the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium was built in 2005, all international cricket in Hyderabad was played at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium. The 39,200-capacity venue’s popularity has sky-rocketed over 18 years and it lays claim to the rise of the Sunrisers Hyderabad who have established themselves as a strong IPL force for nearly a decade. A total of three matches will be played in October at the stadium including Pakistan vs Sri Lanka on 12 October. ALSO READ: Where is Klusener now?

Sketcher polled 30 votes from his 18 matches this season to finish four clear of East Ringwood’s James Belo on 26 votes and eight ahead of Brayden Kilpatrick of South Croydon on 22. He begun the year with an extraordinary 49-disposal performance in round one, where he won 16 clearances, 17 contested possessions and kicked four goals to reel-in a 29-point three-quarter-time deficit in a grand final rematch against Rowville. It was a game that Bulls’ coach Steve Hughes described as “one of the best performances he’s seen in local footy.” Shouldering extra responsibility in the Noble Park engine room in the absence of close mate Kyle Martin, the Bulls’ captain averaged 28 disposals in an extraordinary display of consistency that saw him go one-better than last year’s second-place finish in the medal count. Hughes said he was proud to see him recognised for the year he had, and wasn’t surprised with the final result. “A couple of people asked me post-season whether I thought he was a chance and I said that I thought he’d win it,” Hughes said. “You don’t see every other player, and there’s some high-quality players running around in our competition, but you can only judge it based on the way he plays each week. “Do the maths on it; he wears flashy boots, he takes a lot of grass when he gets the ball, he’s eye-catching, he doesn’t get into arguments with umpires and he wins high-possessions. “As most people know he’s been a bit of a bridesmaid to Kyle over the journey. “I think it’s testament to how much effort he put in this year to help carry the team in Kyle’s absence.” His remarkable consistency comes down to his diligence away from the field, with Hughes ranking him as one of the most professional at the club with a hunger to learn. Stepping into the role of captain for the first time in his senior football journey, his commitment to recovery and body maintenance set the standard for the rest of the Bulls’ locker room. “He’s incredibly professional, probably the most professional player in the club with managing his body,” Hughes said. “He’s in the ice bath before anyone else, he’s in the pool before anyone else, does additional recovery sessions during preseason. “He’s an animal, and he has to balance that as a high-quality local cricketer as well. “I’m over the moon for him and his family. “It’s really exciting, great recognition and over and above everything else, he had a fantastic season. “He’s a highly influential figure in most games.” Hughes also confirmed that Martin will make a welcome return to the Bulls’ midfield next year, re-joining his great mate in the middle of Pat Wright Senior Oval. “He’s been terrific standing beside me all year but I’d much prefer him out there on the ground,” Hughes explained.

Harbhajan, however, urged Sanju Samson to keep working hard and waiting for his chance. Despite having a sensational ODI average of 55.71, Samson's omission has sparked widespread outrage on social media. However, Harbhajan tried to explain why Samson is behind wicketkeepers like KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan in the pecking order. \"Sanju Samson's exclusion has raised a lot of debates. If you average 55 in ODIs and still don't be a part of the squad, then definitely that's strange. But I think Sanju wasn't selected because India already had two wicketkeepers, KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan. Both are also a part of the World Cup squad,\" Harbhajan Singh said in a video on his YouTube channel. Harbhajan also stated that he would prefer KL Rahul over Samson in ODIs, and with Ishan also impressing against Pakistan, he believes it will be difficult for the Kerala batter to remain in the picture at the moment. \"Sanju will need to wait for his chance. I know it is difficult to accept sometimes and one can get disheartened. But age is on his side and I urge him to continue putting in the hard yards and wait for his time. If I have to choose between KL Rahul and Sanju Samson, I would definitely select Rahul because of the stability he provides at No.4, and No.5. Samson is also a good player and can hit sixes at will, but the situation now is such that you can't have three wicketkeeper-batters in a team. It will be difficult to field all of them in the XI,\" Harbhajan added.","pubDate":"2023-09-20 17:49:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"f8a1e7e7a6b4978aff6a6f4e925b4092","title":"England's ODI vs Ireland abandoned due to rain without a ball being bowled","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/england-vs-ireland-odi-match-abandoned-due-to-inclement-weather-2438349-2023-09-20?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England's ODI vs Ireland abandoned due to rain without a ball being bowled","content":"Listen to Story The first match of the one-day international series between England and Ireland at Headingley was called off due to inclement weather on Wednesday.

The game was abandoned just before 5pm without a ball being bowled even though rain had stopped in Leeds just after 2pm, 90 minutes after the scheduled start time. Boos greeted the decision by umpires Mike Burns and Adrian Holdstock from the smattering of spectators left on the ground who had waited patiently for a shortened game that should have been possible by 5pm at the latest. Instead a ‘saturated outfield’ was blamed for the abandonment, in particular a wet patch which had somehow got under the covers on the bowler’s run up at the Kirkstall Lane End the officials deemed would have been dangerous. Now the teams will move on to Trent Bridge for the second match on Saturday without Joe Root , who was thwarted in his attempt to gain 50-over rhythm ahead of the World Cup and will now rest before England leave for India on Wednesday. England’s first ODI against Ireland was called off amid farcical scenes at Headingley The game was abandoned just before 5pm without a ball being bowled on Wednesday Boos greeted the decision by umpires Mike Burns and Adrian Holdstock The frustration was made worse because of the number of inspections the umpires made seemingly only delaying the inevitable because they clearly did not feel the ground was fit. Attempts by ground-staff to dry the outfield were minimal and the 30-yard fielding restriction circle was never even put in place. Instead token inspections were made. ‘I was pretty hopeful we’d get a game to be honest,’ said Zak Crawley, who was due to make his first appearance as England captain. ‘But rain started later than forecast. I was very disappointed we didn’t play. ‘It was just the run up at this end, really. It wasn’t fit to play and that was probably the right call in the end. It was very wet and would have churned up if we’d played. ‘It wouldn’t have been fit for the bowlers. You have guys tearing in and you don’t want players not being able to perform at their best. ‘I’m not sure what happened because the bit of the ground that was wet was covered up. We were unlucky with the weather leading up to the game and this morning as well. But I’m not sure there was anything more the groundsman could have done.’ That may be so but yet again with cricket there was a complete lack of flexibility. If one end wasn’t fit then there should be nothing in the rules to stop the umpires deciding all the bowling should come from the same end. Former cricket umpire and Yorkshire icon Dickie Bird was among the fans who waited patiently No play was possible at Headingley despite attempts by ground-staff to dry the outfield It is the last thing troubled Yorkshire needed, coming so soon after the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal that engulfed the county and the financial crisis that resulted from it. At least insurance will cover refunds to spectators who had paid up to £110 for tickets to see what became a second-string England squad against low key opponents in Ireland. But it is not the first time there has been rain-related controversies at Headingley. In 2009 Yorkshire were forced to defend their new drainage system when a one-day international against West Indies was abandoned despite sun shining all day. Most famously, in 1991, blocked drains forced play in England’s Test against West Indies to be called off, with umpire Dickie Bird feeling the full force of the crowd’s anger.

However, he never got on the field at his home ground as heavy rain prevented even the possibility of a 20-over-a-side game at Headingley.

Asked to bowl first, the Rohit Sharma -led side bundled out Sri Lanka for just 50 runs, with pacer Mohammed Siraj stealing the show with his impressive six-wicket haul. Later, Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan chased down the target in just 6.1 overs and took Team India across the line with ten wickets in hand. After the final match, skipper Rohit attended a press conference, where his one comment left all the media persons in splits. During the interaction, Rohit was answering a question but he got interrupted by the sound of firecrackers, which were being burst by the fans to celebrate India's victory. The right-handed batter waited for a minute and said that the fans should wait for India to win the ODI World Cup 2023. \"It gives us a lot of confidence to come here and win a tournament like this. Through the tournament we saw a lot of..\" said Rohit when the noise of the bursting crackers interrupted him. Video pic.twitter.com/t7pcQGKEt8 \"Arey World Cup jeetne ke baad phodo ye sab..(burst crackers once we win the world cup)\", said Rohit with a smile as the media persons burst out in laughter. Talking about the match, Sri Lanka opted to bat first but Siraj soon made them regret this decision as they were reduced to 13/6 after he took four wickets in the 6th over. Kusal Mendis (17) and Dushan Hemantha (13*) swung their bats for a while, offering tiny moments of respite. Siraj ended with 6/21 in his seven overs while Pandya took 3/3 in 2.2 overs. Bumrah also got 1/23 in five overs as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 50 in 15.2 overs. Ishan Kishan (23*) and Shubman Gill (27*) chased down the target in 6.1 overs without any loss of wicket. India captured its eighth Asia Cup title and Siraj took home the 'Player of the Match' award. Kuldeep Yadav (nine wickets) was given the 'Player of the Series' award for his bamboozling spin bowling in the tournament. Shubman Gill with 302 runs in six games and one century and two fifties, scored the most runs in the tournament.

A re-run of that unforgettable 2019 final opens the tournament as defending champions England take on New Zealand, runners-up four years ago. Here’s a guide to all 10 venues you can expect to see throughout the tournament. MUST READ | When do the Proteas play at the 2023 Cricket World Cup Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad The largest sports stadium in the world will set the stage for the tournament opener, host an India vs Pakistan thriller and proudly present the World Cup’s climax final. The 132,000-capacity venue, renovated in 2021, is no stranger to history and a big occasion – in March 1987, Sunil Gavaskar became the first batter to breach the 10,000-Test run mark at the venue. Decades later, the stadium has hosted IPL finals and, in 2011, the last time that a World Cup was played in India, the hosts broke Australia’s streak of making the final of every ODI World Cup since 1996. M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru With boundary sizes of around 65 metres, M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is expected to offer some of the highest-scoring innings of the tournament. Records could be broken in a repeat of 2011, where Kevin O’Brien crashed the fastest hundred in an ODI World Cup in just 50 balls as Ireland chased down 328 to beat England. The stadium has been home to the National Cricket Academy since 2000, producing some of the finest international Indian talent seen this century. M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai Situated next the Indian Ocean, the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium will provide one of the most humid climates across all venues. In 1952, India registered their first-ever win in Test cricket when Vijay Hazare’s team defeated Donald Carr’s England. The first-ever tied Test match was played between India and Australia in 1986 at the 38,200 capacity stadium that sits just two kilometres from Marina Beach. Arun Jaitley Stadium, Delhi The Indian capital boasts one of the most historic venues in the country. Sachin Tendulkar broke Sunil Gavaskar’s record for most Test centuries when he brought up his 35th ton in a 2005 match against Sri Lanka. The stadium formerly had the reputation of producing slow pitches but, following a renovation of the square, the pace has picked up with totals to match. Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium, Dharamsala With its picturesque views, Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium is one of the newest stadiums in the country. The venue has been a regular feature in India’s home international calendar since 2013, when England visited for an ODI. With a 64-metre boundary, fans are at the heart of the action and high-scoring innings can be expected in the stadium’s opening game between Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Eden Gardens, Kolkata Before the Narendra Modi Stadium’s renovation, Eden Gardens held the title for the largest venue in India with a capacity of 68,000. It was the first stadium that hosted a World Cup final in 1987 after Lord’s hosted the first three. The lively pitch and breezy conditions next to the Hooghly River are sure to rustle up some stunning ODI clashes, as well as a World Cup semi-final meeting. Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow Lucknow’s cricket stadium, built in 2017, has not hosted a huge number of international matches before but the conditions are primed for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023. The square has had extensive renovation since the Lucknow Super Giants claimed the stadium as their home venue. The stage will be set for Australia vs South Africa on 12 October, where history will be made as the stadium hosts its first-ever World Cup fixture. Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai India’s ‘cricket capital’ boasts another colossal venue which will act as a host to the other semi-final. The distinct red-soil pitch has seen some monumental feats in the sport since it was built in 1974. From Sachin Tendulkar’s masterful innings in the 1996 Men’s Cricket World Cup to left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel’s 10/119 bowling figures for New Zealand against India, the venue is used to providing magical moments. MCA International Stadium, Pune Nestled in a secluded area on the outskirts of Pune, the stadium hosted its first international game when India took on England in 2012 — it was granted Test status in 2016. Players and fans alike flock to the 42,700-capacity stadium for its ability to conjure huge scores. The hosts will take on Bangladesh when it stages its first 2023 ICC Men’s World Cup clash on 19 October. Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad Before the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium was built in 2005, all international cricket in Hyderabad was played at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium. The 39,200-capacity venue’s popularity has sky-rocketed over 18 years and it lays claim to the rise of the Sunrisers Hyderabad who have established themselves as a strong IPL force for nearly a decade. A total of three matches will be played in October at the stadium including Pakistan vs Sri Lanka on 12 October. ALSO READ: Where is Klusener now?

Sketcher polled 30 votes from his 18 matches this season to finish four clear of East Ringwood’s James Belo on 26 votes and eight ahead of Brayden Kilpatrick of South Croydon on 22. He begun the year with an extraordinary 49-disposal performance in round one, where he won 16 clearances, 17 contested possessions and kicked four goals to reel-in a 29-point three-quarter-time deficit in a grand final rematch against Rowville. It was a game that Bulls’ coach Steve Hughes described as “one of the best performances he’s seen in local footy.” Shouldering extra responsibility in the Noble Park engine room in the absence of close mate Kyle Martin, the Bulls’ captain averaged 28 disposals in an extraordinary display of consistency that saw him go one-better than last year’s second-place finish in the medal count. Hughes said he was proud to see him recognised for the year he had, and wasn’t surprised with the final result. “A couple of people asked me post-season whether I thought he was a chance and I said that I thought he’d win it,” Hughes said. “You don’t see every other player, and there’s some high-quality players running around in our competition, but you can only judge it based on the way he plays each week. “Do the maths on it; he wears flashy boots, he takes a lot of grass when he gets the ball, he’s eye-catching, he doesn’t get into arguments with umpires and he wins high-possessions. “As most people know he’s been a bit of a bridesmaid to Kyle over the journey. “I think it’s testament to how much effort he put in this year to help carry the team in Kyle’s absence.” His remarkable consistency comes down to his diligence away from the field, with Hughes ranking him as one of the most professional at the club with a hunger to learn. Stepping into the role of captain for the first time in his senior football journey, his commitment to recovery and body maintenance set the standard for the rest of the Bulls’ locker room. “He’s incredibly professional, probably the most professional player in the club with managing his body,” Hughes said. “He’s in the ice bath before anyone else, he’s in the pool before anyone else, does additional recovery sessions during preseason. “He’s an animal, and he has to balance that as a high-quality local cricketer as well. “I’m over the moon for him and his family. “It’s really exciting, great recognition and over and above everything else, he had a fantastic season. “He’s a highly influential figure in most games.” Hughes also confirmed that Martin will make a welcome return to the Bulls’ midfield next year, re-joining his great mate in the middle of Pat Wright Senior Oval. “He’s been terrific standing beside me all year but I’d much prefer him out there on the ground,” Hughes explained.

Harbhajan, however, urged Sanju Samson to keep working hard and waiting for his chance. Despite having a sensational ODI average of 55.71, Samson's omission has sparked widespread outrage on social media. However, Harbhajan tried to explain why Samson is behind wicketkeepers like KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan in the pecking order. \"Sanju Samson's exclusion has raised a lot of debates. If you average 55 in ODIs and still don't be a part of the squad, then definitely that's strange. But I think Sanju wasn't selected because India already had two wicketkeepers, KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan. Both are also a part of the World Cup squad,\" Harbhajan Singh said in a video on his YouTube channel. Harbhajan also stated that he would prefer KL Rahul over Samson in ODIs, and with Ishan also impressing against Pakistan, he believes it will be difficult for the Kerala batter to remain in the picture at the moment. \"Sanju will need to wait for his chance. I know it is difficult to accept sometimes and one can get disheartened. But age is on his side and I urge him to continue putting in the hard yards and wait for his time. If I have to choose between KL Rahul and Sanju Samson, I would definitely select Rahul because of the stability he provides at No.4, and No.5. Samson is also a good player and can hit sixes at will, but the situation now is such that you can't have three wicketkeeper-batters in a team. It will be difficult to field all of them in the XI,\" Harbhajan added.","pubDate":"2023-09-20 17:49:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"f8a1e7e7a6b4978aff6a6f4e925b4092","title":"England's ODI vs Ireland abandoned due to rain without a ball being bowled","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/england-vs-ireland-odi-match-abandoned-due-to-inclement-weather-2438349-2023-09-20?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England's ODI vs Ireland abandoned due to rain without a ball being bowled","content":"Listen to Story The first match of the one-day international series between England and Ireland at Headingley was called off due to inclement weather on Wednesday.

The game was abandoned just before 5pm without a ball being bowled even though rain had stopped in Leeds just after 2pm, 90 minutes after the scheduled start time. Boos greeted the decision by umpires Mike Burns and Adrian Holdstock from the smattering of spectators left on the ground who had waited patiently for a shortened game that should have been possible by 5pm at the latest. Instead a ‘saturated outfield’ was blamed for the abandonment, in particular a wet patch which had somehow got under the covers on the bowler’s run up at the Kirkstall Lane End the officials deemed would have been dangerous. Now the teams will move on to Trent Bridge for the second match on Saturday without Joe Root , who was thwarted in his attempt to gain 50-over rhythm ahead of the World Cup and will now rest before England leave for India on Wednesday. England’s first ODI against Ireland was called off amid farcical scenes at Headingley The game was abandoned just before 5pm without a ball being bowled on Wednesday Boos greeted the decision by umpires Mike Burns and Adrian Holdstock The frustration was made worse because of the number of inspections the umpires made seemingly only delaying the inevitable because they clearly did not feel the ground was fit. Attempts by ground-staff to dry the outfield were minimal and the 30-yard fielding restriction circle was never even put in place. Instead token inspections were made. ‘I was pretty hopeful we’d get a game to be honest,’ said Zak Crawley, who was due to make his first appearance as England captain. ‘But rain started later than forecast. I was very disappointed we didn’t play. ‘It was just the run up at this end, really. It wasn’t fit to play and that was probably the right call in the end. It was very wet and would have churned up if we’d played. ‘It wouldn’t have been fit for the bowlers. You have guys tearing in and you don’t want players not being able to perform at their best. ‘I’m not sure what happened because the bit of the ground that was wet was covered up. We were unlucky with the weather leading up to the game and this morning as well. But I’m not sure there was anything more the groundsman could have done.’ That may be so but yet again with cricket there was a complete lack of flexibility. If one end wasn’t fit then there should be nothing in the rules to stop the umpires deciding all the bowling should come from the same end. Former cricket umpire and Yorkshire icon Dickie Bird was among the fans who waited patiently No play was possible at Headingley despite attempts by ground-staff to dry the outfield It is the last thing troubled Yorkshire needed, coming so soon after the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal that engulfed the county and the financial crisis that resulted from it. At least insurance will cover refunds to spectators who had paid up to £110 for tickets to see what became a second-string England squad against low key opponents in Ireland. But it is not the first time there has been rain-related controversies at Headingley. In 2009 Yorkshire were forced to defend their new drainage system when a one-day international against West Indies was abandoned despite sun shining all day. Most famously, in 1991, blocked drains forced play in England’s Test against West Indies to be called off, with umpire Dickie Bird feeling the full force of the crowd’s anger.

However, he never got on the field at his home ground as heavy rain prevented even the possibility of a 20-over-a-side game at Headingley.

Asked to bowl first, the Rohit Sharma -led side bundled out Sri Lanka for just 50 runs, with pacer Mohammed Siraj stealing the show with his impressive six-wicket haul. Later, Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan chased down the target in just 6.1 overs and took Team India across the line with ten wickets in hand. After the final match, skipper Rohit attended a press conference, where his one comment left all the media persons in splits. During the interaction, Rohit was answering a question but he got interrupted by the sound of firecrackers, which were being burst by the fans to celebrate India's victory. The right-handed batter waited for a minute and said that the fans should wait for India to win the ODI World Cup 2023. \"It gives us a lot of confidence to come here and win a tournament like this. Through the tournament we saw a lot of..\" said Rohit when the noise of the bursting crackers interrupted him. Video pic.twitter.com/t7pcQGKEt8 \"Arey World Cup jeetne ke baad phodo ye sab..(burst crackers once we win the world cup)\", said Rohit with a smile as the media persons burst out in laughter. Talking about the match, Sri Lanka opted to bat first but Siraj soon made them regret this decision as they were reduced to 13/6 after he took four wickets in the 6th over. Kusal Mendis (17) and Dushan Hemantha (13*) swung their bats for a while, offering tiny moments of respite. Siraj ended with 6/21 in his seven overs while Pandya took 3/3 in 2.2 overs. Bumrah also got 1/23 in five overs as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 50 in 15.2 overs. Ishan Kishan (23*) and Shubman Gill (27*) chased down the target in 6.1 overs without any loss of wicket. India captured its eighth Asia Cup title and Siraj took home the 'Player of the Match' award. Kuldeep Yadav (nine wickets) was given the 'Player of the Series' award for his bamboozling spin bowling in the tournament. Shubman Gill with 302 runs in six games and one century and two fifties, scored the most runs in the tournament.

A re-run of that unforgettable 2019 final opens the tournament as defending champions England take on New Zealand, runners-up four years ago. Here’s a guide to all 10 venues you can expect to see throughout the tournament. MUST READ | When do the Proteas play at the 2023 Cricket World Cup Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad The largest sports stadium in the world will set the stage for the tournament opener, host an India vs Pakistan thriller and proudly present the World Cup’s climax final. The 132,000-capacity venue, renovated in 2021, is no stranger to history and a big occasion – in March 1987, Sunil Gavaskar became the first batter to breach the 10,000-Test run mark at the venue. Decades later, the stadium has hosted IPL finals and, in 2011, the last time that a World Cup was played in India, the hosts broke Australia’s streak of making the final of every ODI World Cup since 1996. M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru With boundary sizes of around 65 metres, M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is expected to offer some of the highest-scoring innings of the tournament. Records could be broken in a repeat of 2011, where Kevin O’Brien crashed the fastest hundred in an ODI World Cup in just 50 balls as Ireland chased down 328 to beat England. The stadium has been home to the National Cricket Academy since 2000, producing some of the finest international Indian talent seen this century. M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai Situated next the Indian Ocean, the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium will provide one of the most humid climates across all venues. In 1952, India registered their first-ever win in Test cricket when Vijay Hazare’s team defeated Donald Carr’s England. The first-ever tied Test match was played between India and Australia in 1986 at the 38,200 capacity stadium that sits just two kilometres from Marina Beach. Arun Jaitley Stadium, Delhi The Indian capital boasts one of the most historic venues in the country. Sachin Tendulkar broke Sunil Gavaskar’s record for most Test centuries when he brought up his 35th ton in a 2005 match against Sri Lanka. The stadium formerly had the reputation of producing slow pitches but, following a renovation of the square, the pace has picked up with totals to match. Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium, Dharamsala With its picturesque views, Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium is one of the newest stadiums in the country. The venue has been a regular feature in India’s home international calendar since 2013, when England visited for an ODI. With a 64-metre boundary, fans are at the heart of the action and high-scoring innings can be expected in the stadium’s opening game between Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Eden Gardens, Kolkata Before the Narendra Modi Stadium’s renovation, Eden Gardens held the title for the largest venue in India with a capacity of 68,000. It was the first stadium that hosted a World Cup final in 1987 after Lord’s hosted the first three. The lively pitch and breezy conditions next to the Hooghly River are sure to rustle up some stunning ODI clashes, as well as a World Cup semi-final meeting. Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow Lucknow’s cricket stadium, built in 2017, has not hosted a huge number of international matches before but the conditions are primed for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023. The square has had extensive renovation since the Lucknow Super Giants claimed the stadium as their home venue. The stage will be set for Australia vs South Africa on 12 October, where history will be made as the stadium hosts its first-ever World Cup fixture. Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai India’s ‘cricket capital’ boasts another colossal venue which will act as a host to the other semi-final. The distinct red-soil pitch has seen some monumental feats in the sport since it was built in 1974. From Sachin Tendulkar’s masterful innings in the 1996 Men’s Cricket World Cup to left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel’s 10/119 bowling figures for New Zealand against India, the venue is used to providing magical moments. MCA International Stadium, Pune Nestled in a secluded area on the outskirts of Pune, the stadium hosted its first international game when India took on England in 2012 — it was granted Test status in 2016. Players and fans alike flock to the 42,700-capacity stadium for its ability to conjure huge scores. The hosts will take on Bangladesh when it stages its first 2023 ICC Men’s World Cup clash on 19 October. Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad Before the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium was built in 2005, all international cricket in Hyderabad was played at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium. The 39,200-capacity venue’s popularity has sky-rocketed over 18 years and it lays claim to the rise of the Sunrisers Hyderabad who have established themselves as a strong IPL force for nearly a decade. A total of three matches will be played in October at the stadium including Pakistan vs Sri Lanka on 12 October. ALSO READ: Where is Klusener now?

Sketcher polled 30 votes from his 18 matches this season to finish four clear of East Ringwood’s James Belo on 26 votes and eight ahead of Brayden Kilpatrick of South Croydon on 22. He begun the year with an extraordinary 49-disposal performance in round one, where he won 16 clearances, 17 contested possessions and kicked four goals to reel-in a 29-point three-quarter-time deficit in a grand final rematch against Rowville. It was a game that Bulls’ coach Steve Hughes described as “one of the best performances he’s seen in local footy.” Shouldering extra responsibility in the Noble Park engine room in the absence of close mate Kyle Martin, the Bulls’ captain averaged 28 disposals in an extraordinary display of consistency that saw him go one-better than last year’s second-place finish in the medal count. Hughes said he was proud to see him recognised for the year he had, and wasn’t surprised with the final result. “A couple of people asked me post-season whether I thought he was a chance and I said that I thought he’d win it,” Hughes said. “You don’t see every other player, and there’s some high-quality players running around in our competition, but you can only judge it based on the way he plays each week. “Do the maths on it; he wears flashy boots, he takes a lot of grass when he gets the ball, he’s eye-catching, he doesn’t get into arguments with umpires and he wins high-possessions. “As most people know he’s been a bit of a bridesmaid to Kyle over the journey. “I think it’s testament to how much effort he put in this year to help carry the team in Kyle’s absence.” His remarkable consistency comes down to his diligence away from the field, with Hughes ranking him as one of the most professional at the club with a hunger to learn. Stepping into the role of captain for the first time in his senior football journey, his commitment to recovery and body maintenance set the standard for the rest of the Bulls’ locker room. “He’s incredibly professional, probably the most professional player in the club with managing his body,” Hughes said. “He’s in the ice bath before anyone else, he’s in the pool before anyone else, does additional recovery sessions during preseason. “He’s an animal, and he has to balance that as a high-quality local cricketer as well. “I’m over the moon for him and his family. “It’s really exciting, great recognition and over and above everything else, he had a fantastic season. “He’s a highly influential figure in most games.” Hughes also confirmed that Martin will make a welcome return to the Bulls’ midfield next year, re-joining his great mate in the middle of Pat Wright Senior Oval. “He’s been terrific standing beside me all year but I’d much prefer him out there on the ground,” Hughes explained.

Harbhajan, however, urged Sanju Samson to keep working hard and waiting for his chance. Despite having a sensational ODI average of 55.71, Samson's omission has sparked widespread outrage on social media. However, Harbhajan tried to explain why Samson is behind wicketkeepers like KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan in the pecking order. \"Sanju Samson's exclusion has raised a lot of debates. If you average 55 in ODIs and still don't be a part of the squad, then definitely that's strange. But I think Sanju wasn't selected because India already had two wicketkeepers, KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan. Both are also a part of the World Cup squad,\" Harbhajan Singh said in a video on his YouTube channel. Harbhajan also stated that he would prefer KL Rahul over Samson in ODIs, and with Ishan also impressing against Pakistan, he believes it will be difficult for the Kerala batter to remain in the picture at the moment. \"Sanju will need to wait for his chance. I know it is difficult to accept sometimes and one can get disheartened. But age is on his side and I urge him to continue putting in the hard yards and wait for his time. If I have to choose between KL Rahul and Sanju Samson, I would definitely select Rahul because of the stability he provides at No.4, and No.5. Samson is also a good player and can hit sixes at will, but the situation now is such that you can't have three wicketkeeper-batters in a team. It will be difficult to field all of them in the XI,\" Harbhajan added.","pubDate":"2023-09-20 17:49:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"f8a1e7e7a6b4978aff6a6f4e925b4092","title":"England's ODI vs Ireland abandoned due to rain without a ball being bowled","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/england-vs-ireland-odi-match-abandoned-due-to-inclement-weather-2438349-2023-09-20?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England's ODI vs Ireland abandoned due to rain without a ball being bowled","content":"Listen to Story The first match of the one-day international series between England and Ireland at Headingley was called off due to inclement weather on Wednesday.
