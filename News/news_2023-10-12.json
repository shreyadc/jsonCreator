Chathli, 58, was appointed chair after an extensive recruitment process, which was ratified by members’ vote at September’s extraordinary general meeting. He succeeds the interim chair Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, who remains on the board as a non-executive director, and Lord Kamlesh Patel, who stepped down in March.

My appointment has come on the back of some really good work by the board over the past 18 months – increased participation from all ethnicities, and in the pathway programme, and the culture of the club has changed dramatically over the last three years. “It is the most exciting job in English cricket to get into Yorkshire after it comes out of this dark period and tries to get back to the top.” Chathli was born in India and grew up in Mumbai (then Bombay), coming to the UK in 1980. He founded two successful communications agencies and is an experienced international capital markets expert – financial acumen that is much needed at Headingley. He is also a lifelong cricket fan, and a keen club player, describing himself to the Yorkshire Post as a “hit and hope” batter. His daughter Kira plays for Surrey, the South East Stars and the Oval Invincibles. He has a clear idea of where he wants the club to be in three years’ time. “If you want to create an elite pyramid then you need a broad pyramid to do that, and you have two hurdles to overcome: financial and inclusivity. The vision I want is for a club that is financially stable and socially and economically inclusive for everybody.” Yorkshire are in financial dire straits. The club owes the Graves Trust £14.9m – though the Trust has agreed to postpone a £500,000 payment due this month until next April. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In July, Yorkshire were handed a £400,000 fine – £300,000 of it suspended for two years – by the ECB’s Cricket Discipline Commission as a result of allegations of racism and discrimination at the club over a 17-year period. They were also deducted 48-points in the 2023 County Championship, finishing second from bottom. Chathli is unperturbed. “If you’re a lover of English cricket then you know everything there is to know about Yorkshire – some of the drama is second to none. Yorkshire have won the most number of championships and contributes a significant number of cricketers to England. A strong Yorkshire is a strong England.”","pubDate":"2023-10-11 18:48:41","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b44e06a24a3f5567d4ea9398a00ac0008e24b357/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ccab3d74048bdd1fcc238a8cbb954949","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["united kingdom","singapore","india","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d5cf872c612c9b657f92f28106e921f4","title":"Rohit urges India teammates to not worry about external factors ahead of Pakistan clash","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/rohit-urges-india-teammates-to-not-worry-about-external-factors-ahead-of-pakistan-clash-2447765-2023-10-11?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rohit urges India teammates to not worry about external factors ahead of Pakistan clash","content":"Listen to Story Following a commanding eight-wicket win over Afghanistan, India captain Rohit Sharma urged his team to focus on \"things we can control\" ahead of the mega World Cup clash against archrival Pakistan on Wednesday.

Rohit scored 131 off 84 balls, hitting five sixes and 16 fours, as India chased down a 273-run victory target with 15 overs to spare at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. \"(It) was a good win for us, very important to get that momentum at the start of the tournament,\" Rohit said during the post-match presentation. \"For us it is crucial that we don't worry about external factors and just look at things we can control. We just need to show up and do well,\" Rohit said while talking about India's clash against Pakistan on Saturday in Ahmedabad. \"Things like what the pitch is like, what combo we can play is what we can control. What happens outside we won't be worried about it. It is just about focusing on what we can do as players and how we can perform,\" the India captain added. Rohit said that absorbing pressure was crucial in India's first World Cup game. After being reduced to 5/3, India defeated Australia by six wickets in the first match to establish their dominance. \"We have got guys who can play fearless cricket with bat and guys who can absorb like the last game. It is about absorbing pressure and taking the right decision on the field,\" Rohit said. \"There will be a spell from the opposition where you will have to absorb pressure. Leading up to the tournament, we had played such games. \"We have got players with different skill sets in our team. They bring different attributes of the game to the team and it puts you in good positions as a team when you have that,\" he added.","pubDate":"2023-10-11 18:21:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"266acbba0a8c24915253d1bebe3acff2","title":"जीत के बाद भी इस घातक खिलाड़ी के नाम जुड़ा शर्मनाक रिकॉर्ड, करियर पर लग गया दाग!","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/mohammed-siraj-indian-bowler-conceded-4th-most-runs-in-odi-world-cup-match-india-vs-afghanistan-2023-10-11-993978","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"भारत ने अफगानिस्तान को धमाकेदार अंदाज में 8 विकेट से हरा दिया। इस मैच में भारत के लिए एक स्टार खिलाड़ी ने बहुत ही खराब प्रदर्शन किया। इस वजह से इस प्लेयर के नाम एक शर्मनाक रिकॉर्ड जुड़ गया।","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-10-11 18:14:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","source_priority":216441,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"article_id":"3a315738adf1bdc7d7a85d17c7f8df79","title":"'मैं रिकॉर्ड्स के बारे में ज्यादा नहीं सोचता', बड़ी जीत के बाद रोहित ने ये कहकर जीता दिल","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-gave-big-statement-after-match-win-against-afghanistan-in-odi-world-cup-2023-2023-10-11-993976","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"अफगानिस्तान के खिलाफ अपनी मैच जिताऊ पारी के बाद कप्तान रोहित शर्मा ने एक बड़ा बयान दिया। रोहित ने अपने रिकॉर्ड्स को लेकर भी एक दिल जीतने वाली बात कही।","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-10-11 18:04:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","source_priority":216441,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"article_id":"c933fe234132a483b93f6ca30197e34c","title":"Jasprit Bumrah plays down hype around Pakistan clash after India hammer Afghanistan","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/video/world-cup-2023-jasprit-bumrah-plays-down-hype-around-pakistan-clash-after-india-hammer-afghanistan-2447759-2023-10-11?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Jasprit Bumrah plays down hype around Pakistan clash after India hammer Afghanistan","content":"Following India's emphatic victory over Afghanistan in the 2023 World Cup, star pacer Jasprit Bumrah downplayed the hype surrounding the much-anticipated match against Pakistan. The Indian pace spearhead emphasized the importance of focusing on their own team's strengths and implementing their own game plan. In a post-match press conference, Bumrah remarked, \"See, every team will have batsmen, every team will have bowlers. We also have batsmen; we also have bowlers. We're not preparing any special for any special team. Yes, we're looking at ourselves more than the others because we've realised that if we focus on our team, we focus on our strengths, everything else takes care of itself.\" The seasoned campaigner highlighted how the team's focus remains on leveraging their own strengths rather than obsessing over the opposition's tactics. Being in control of their performance and strategy was underlined as the prime focus. Afghanistan may not have started the World Cup in India on the right note, losing two in two, but head coach Jonathan Trott says the boys are geared up to put in good performances and bring joy to the quake-hit country. Afghanistan were outclassed by 8 wickets by Rohit Sharma's India in Delhi on October 11. Mustafa Barghouti, Member, Palestinian National Council, slammed Americans for taking a stand to dehumanize Palestinians and said he is against terror anywhere, but Palestinians' struggle for freedom is not terror.

The former Indian captain, known for his aggressive style on the field, made a surprising appeal to the home crowd, asking them not to boo Afghan pacer . The incident was a stark contrast to an earlier altercation between Kohli and Naveen during the IPL 2023 match between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). The tension had escalated when the two players exchanged heated words while Naveen was at the crease. However, Kohli's recent gesture showed a different side of him, reflecting his maturity and respect for fellow players. Kohli, who has been nicknamed \"The King\" and \"Captain Fearless\" by his fans, is renowned for his dominant play and incredible captaincy. His appeal to the crowd showcased his leadership qualities, emphasizing the spirit of the game over personal grudges. Despite their past differences, Kohli stood up for Naveen, highlighting the importance of respect and sportsmanship in cricket. The World Cup match was a significant event, with India securing an eight-wicket victory over Afghanistan. Rohit Sharma, the current Indian captain, led the team to victory with an impressive century. However, it was Kohli's act of sportsmanship that stole the limelight, reminding everyone that cricket is as much about respect and fair play as it is about competition and victory. Born and raised in Delhi, Kohli has always been a crowd favourite at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. His appeal to the crowd not only diffused a potentially tense situation but also set an example for millions of his fans worldwide. This incident reaffirms why Kohli is not just considered a great player, but also a true ambassador of the sport.","pubDate":"2023-10-11 17:55:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"da524db966b69e53feea3c119e3bbd6b","title":"Ind vs Afg: रवि शास्त्री ने नवीन-उल-हक और विराट की \"दोस्ती\" को लेकर कह दिया यह कड़वा सच","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/hindi/cricket/ind-vs-afg-ravi-shastri-says-the-bitter-truth-about-naveen-ul-haq-virat-kohli-friendship-4472736#publisher=newsstand","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Afghanistan, 9th Match: अफगानिस्तान के मुकाबले में जितने चर्चे रोहित शर्मा की बल्लेबाजी के रहे, तो उतनी ही सुर्खियां नवीन-उल-हक और विराट कोहली के \"मिलन\" ने बटोरीं","content":"जारी World Cup 2023 में दिल्ली के अरुण जेटली स्टेडियम में बुधवार को भारत और अफगानिस्तान (India vs Afghanistan) के बीच खेले गए मुकाबले में भारत की जीत में रोहित शर्मा (Rohit Sharm) की बल्लेबाजी तो फैंस के बीच आकर्षण का विषय रही ही, तो वहीं पूर्व कप्तान विराट कोहली और अफगानी पेसर नवीन-उल-हक के आए विजुअल ने करोड़ों फैंस का ध्यान अपनी ओर खींचा. और तस्वीर सामने आई, तो यह पंडितों से लेकर आम फैंस के बीच चर्चा का विषय बन गई. अब यह तो आप जानते ही हैं कि इस साल हुए इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग में दोनों की कैसी तस्वीरें सामने आई थीं. कैसे दोनों की तस्वीरें करोड़ों फैंस के बीच चर्चा का विषय बन गई थीं, जिनके कारण इन दोनों सहित गौतम गंभीर को भी जुर्माना भरना पड़ा था.

Although it may come to use later in the tournament, Bumrah denied that Rohit's blazing hundred was a deliberate ploy to increase their net run-rate in the World Cup group stage. The hosts are only the third team to win their first two games and they are sandwiched between New Zealand and Pakistan at the top of the standings. \"Not at all. We are not looking at it from the beginning (of the tournament.

My appointment has come on the back of some really good work by the board over the past 18 months – increased participation from all ethnicities, and in the pathway programme, and the culture of the club has changed dramatically over the last three years. “It is the most exciting job in English cricket to get into Yorkshire after it comes out of this dark period and tries to get back to the top.” Chathli was born in India and grew up in Mumbai (then Bombay), coming to the UK in 1980. He founded two successful communications agencies and is an experienced international capital markets expert – financial acumen that is much needed at Headingley. He is also a lifelong cricket fan, and a keen club player, describing himself to the Yorkshire Post as a “hit and hope” batter. His daughter Kira plays for Surrey, the South East Stars and the Oval Invincibles. He has a clear idea of where he wants the club to be in three years’ time. “If you want to create an elite pyramid then you need a broad pyramid to do that, and you have two hurdles to overcome: financial and inclusivity. The vision I want is for a club that is financially stable and socially and economically inclusive for everybody.” Yorkshire are in financial dire straits. The club owes the Graves Trust £14.9m – though the Trust has agreed to postpone a £500,000 payment due this month until next April. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chathli is unperturbed. “If you’re a lover of English cricket then you know everything there is to know about Yorkshire – some of the drama is second to none.

Rohit scored 131 off 84 balls, hitting five sixes and 16 fours, as India chased down a 273-run victory target with 15 overs to spare at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. \"(It) was a good win for us, very important to get that momentum at the start of the tournament,\" Rohit said during the post-match presentation. \"For us it is crucial that we don't worry about external factors and just look at things we can control. We just need to show up and do well,\" Rohit said while talking about India's clash against Pakistan on Saturday in Ahmedabad. \"Things like what the pitch is like, what combo we can play is what we can control. What happens outside we won't be worried about it. It is just about focusing on what we can do as players and how we can perform,\" the India captain added.

After being reduced to 5/3, India defeated Australia by six wickets in the first match to establish their dominance. \"We have got guys who can play fearless cricket with bat and guys who can absorb like the last game. It is about absorbing pressure and taking the right decision on the field,\" Rohit said. \"There will be a spell from the opposition where you will have to absorb pressure. Leading up to the tournament, we had played such games. \"We have got players with different skill sets in our team. They bring different attributes of the game to the team and it puts you in good positions as a team when you have that,\" he added.","pubDate":"2023-10-11 18:21:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"266acbba0a8c24915253d1bebe3acff2","title":"जीत के बाद भी इस घातक खिलाड़ी के नाम जुड़ा शर्मनाक रिकॉर्ड, करियर पर लग गया दाग!","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/mohammed-siraj-indian-bowler-conceded-4th-most-runs-in-odi-world-cup-match-india-vs-afghanistan-2023-10-11-993978","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"भारत ने अफगानिस्तान को धमाकेदार अंदाज में 8 विकेट से हरा दिया। इस मैच में भारत के लिए एक स्टार खिलाड़ी ने बहुत ही खराब प्रदर्शन किया। इस वजह से इस प्लेयर के नाम एक शर्मनाक रिकॉर्ड जुड़ गया।","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-10-11 18:14:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","source_priority":216441,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"article_id":"3a315738adf1bdc7d7a85d17c7f8df79","title":"'मैं रिकॉर्ड्स के बारे में ज्यादा नहीं सोचता', बड़ी जीत के बाद रोहित ने ये कहकर जीता दिल","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-gave-big-statement-after-match-win-against-afghanistan-in-odi-world-cup-2023-2023-10-11-993976","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"अफगानिस्तान के खिलाफ अपनी मैच जिताऊ पारी के बाद कप्तान रोहित शर्मा ने एक बड़ा बयान दिया। रोहित ने अपने रिकॉर्ड्स को लेकर भी एक दिल जीतने वाली बात कही।","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-10-11 18:04:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","source_priority":216441,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"article_id":"c933fe234132a483b93f6ca30197e34c","title":"Jasprit Bumrah plays down hype around Pakistan clash after India hammer Afghanistan","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/video/world-cup-2023-jasprit-bumrah-plays-down-hype-around-pakistan-clash-after-india-hammer-afghanistan-2447759-2023-10-11?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Jasprit Bumrah plays down hype around Pakistan clash after India hammer Afghanistan","content":"Following India's emphatic victory over Afghanistan in the 2023 World Cup, star pacer Jasprit Bumrah downplayed the hype surrounding the much-anticipated match against Pakistan. The Indian pace spearhead emphasized the importance of focusing on their own team's strengths and implementing their own game plan. In a post-match press conference, Bumrah remarked, \"See, every team will have batsmen, every team will have bowlers. We also have batsmen; we also have bowlers. We're not preparing any special for any special team. Yes, we're looking at ourselves more than the others because we've realised that if we focus on our team, we focus on our strengths, everything else takes care of itself.\" The seasoned campaigner highlighted how the team's focus remains on leveraging their own strengths rather than obsessing over the opposition's tactics. Being in control of their performance and strategy was underlined as the prime focus. Afghanistan may not have started the World Cup in India on the right note, losing two in two, but head coach Jonathan Trott says the boys are geared up to put in good performances and bring joy to the quake-hit country. Afghanistan were outclassed by 8 wickets by Rohit Sharma's India in Delhi on October 11.

The former Indian captain, known for his aggressive style on the field, made a surprising appeal to the home crowd, asking them not to boo Afghan pacer . The incident was a stark contrast to an earlier altercation between Kohli and Naveen during the IPL 2023 match between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). The tension had escalated when the two players exchanged heated words while Naveen was at the crease. However, Kohli's recent gesture showed a different side of him, reflecting his maturity and respect for fellow players. Kohli, who has been nicknamed \"The King\" and \"Captain Fearless\" by his fans, is renowned for his dominant play and incredible captaincy. His appeal to the crowd showcased his leadership qualities, emphasizing the spirit of the game over personal grudges. Despite their past differences, Kohli stood up for Naveen, highlighting the importance of respect and sportsmanship in cricket. The World Cup match was a significant event, with India securing an eight-wicket victory over Afghanistan. Rohit Sharma, the current Indian captain, led the team to victory with an impressive century. However, it was Kohli's act of sportsmanship that stole the limelight, reminding everyone that cricket is as much about respect and fair play as it is about competition and victory. Born and raised in Delhi, Kohli has always been a crowd favourite at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. His appeal to the crowd not only diffused a potentially tense situation but also set an example for millions of his fans worldwide. This incident reaffirms why Kohli is not just considered a great player, but also a true ambassador of the sport.","pubDate":"2023-10-11 17:55:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"da524db966b69e53feea3c119e3bbd6b","title":"Ind vs Afg: रवि शास्त्री ने नवीन-उल-हक और विराट की \"दोस्ती\" को लेकर कह दिया यह कड़वा सच","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/hindi/cricket/ind-vs-afg-ravi-shastri-says-the-bitter-truth-about-naveen-ul-haq-virat-kohli-friendship-4472736#publisher=newsstand","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Afghanistan, 9th Match: अफगानिस्तान के मुकाबले में जितने चर्चे रोहित शर्मा की बल्लेबाजी के रहे, तो उतनी ही सुर्खियां नवीन-उल-हक और विराट कोहली के \"मिलन\" ने बटोरीं","content":"जारी World Cup 2023 में दिल्ली के अरुण जेटली स्टेडियम में बुधवार को भारत और अफगानिस्तान (India vs Afghanistan) के बीच खेले गए मुकाबले में भारत की जीत में रोहित शर्मा (Rohit Sharm) की बल्लेबाजी तो फैंस के बीच आकर्षण का विषय रही ही, तो वहीं पूर्व कप्तान विराट कोहली और अफगानी पेसर नवीन-उल-हक के आए विजुअल ने करोड़ों फैंस का ध्यान अपनी ओर खींचा. और तस्वीर सामने आई, तो यह पंडितों से लेकर आम फैंस के बीच चर्चा का विषय बन गई. अब यह तो आप जानते ही हैं कि इस साल हुए इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग में दोनों की कैसी तस्वीरें सामने आई थीं. कैसे दोनों की तस्वीरें करोड़ों फैंस के बीच चर्चा का विषय बन गई थीं, जिनके कारण इन दोनों सहित गौतम गंभीर को भी जुर्माना भरना पड़ा था.

Although it may come to use later in the tournament, Bumrah denied that Rohit's blazing hundred was a deliberate ploy to increase their net run-rate in the World Cup group stage. The hosts are only the third team to win their first two games and they are sandwiched between New Zealand and Pakistan at the top of the standings. \"Not at all.

My appointment has come on the back of some really good work by the board over the past 18 months – increased participation from all ethnicities, and in the pathway programme, and the culture of the club has changed dramatically over the last three years. “It is the most exciting job in English cricket to get into Yorkshire after it comes out of this dark period and tries to get back to the top.” Chathli was born in India and grew up in Mumbai (then Bombay), coming to the UK in 1980. He founded two successful communications agencies and is an experienced international capital markets expert – financial acumen that is much needed at Headingley. He is also a lifelong cricket fan, and a keen club player, describing himself to the Yorkshire Post as a “hit and hope” batter. His daughter Kira plays for Surrey, the South East Stars and the Oval Invincibles. He has a clear idea of where he wants the club to be in three years’ time. “If you want to create an elite pyramid then you need a broad pyramid to do that, and you have two hurdles to overcome: financial and inclusivity. The vision I want is for a club that is financially stable and socially and economically inclusive for everybody.” Yorkshire are in financial dire straits. The club owes the Graves Trust £14.9m – though the Trust has agreed to postpone a £500,000 payment due this month until next April. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chathli is unperturbed. “If you’re a lover of English cricket then you know everything there is to know about Yorkshire – some of the drama is second to none.

Rohit scored 131 off 84 balls, hitting five sixes and 16 fours, as India chased down a 273-run victory target with 15 overs to spare at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. \"(It) was a good win for us, very important to get that momentum at the start of the tournament,\" Rohit said during the post-match presentation. \"For us it is crucial that we don't worry about external factors and just look at things we can control. We just need to show up and do well,\" Rohit said while talking about India's clash against Pakistan on Saturday in Ahmedabad. \"Things like what the pitch is like, what combo we can play is what we can control. What happens outside we won't be worried about it. It is just about focusing on what we can do as players and how we can perform,\" the India captain added.

After being reduced to 5/3, India defeated Australia by six wickets in the first match to establish their dominance. \"We have got guys who can play fearless cricket with bat and guys who can absorb like the last game. It is about absorbing pressure and taking the right decision on the field,\" Rohit said. \"There will be a spell from the opposition where you will have to absorb pressure. Leading up to the tournament, we had played such games. \"We have got players with different skill sets in our team. They bring different attributes of the game to the team and it puts you in good positions as a team when you have that,\" he added.","pubDate":"2023-10-11 18:21:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"266acbba0a8c24915253d1bebe3acff2","title":"जीत के बाद भी इस घातक खिलाड़ी के नाम जुड़ा शर्मनाक रिकॉर्ड, करियर पर लग गया दाग!","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/mohammed-siraj-indian-bowler-conceded-4th-most-runs-in-odi-world-cup-match-india-vs-afghanistan-2023-10-11-993978","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"भारत ने अफगानिस्तान को धमाकेदार अंदाज में 8 विकेट से हरा दिया। इस मैच में भारत के लिए एक स्टार खिलाड़ी ने बहुत ही खराब प्रदर्शन किया। इस वजह से इस प्लेयर के नाम एक शर्मनाक रिकॉर्ड जुड़ गया।","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-10-11 18:14:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","source_priority":216441,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"article_id":"3a315738adf1bdc7d7a85d17c7f8df79","title":"'मैं रिकॉर्ड्स के बारे में ज्यादा नहीं सोचता', बड़ी जीत के बाद रोहित ने ये कहकर जीता दिल","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-gave-big-statement-after-match-win-against-afghanistan-in-odi-world-cup-2023-2023-10-11-993976","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"अफगानिस्तान के खिलाफ अपनी मैच जिताऊ पारी के बाद कप्तान रोहित शर्मा ने एक बड़ा बयान दिया। रोहित ने अपने रिकॉर्ड्स को लेकर भी एक दिल जीतने वाली बात कही।","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-10-11 18:04:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","source_priority":216441,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"article_id":"c933fe234132a483b93f6ca30197e34c","title":"Jasprit Bumrah plays down hype around Pakistan clash after India hammer Afghanistan","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/video/world-cup-2023-jasprit-bumrah-plays-down-hype-around-pakistan-clash-after-india-hammer-afghanistan-2447759-2023-10-11?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Jasprit Bumrah plays down hype around Pakistan clash after India hammer Afghanistan","content":"Following India's emphatic victory over Afghanistan in the 2023 World Cup, star pacer Jasprit Bumrah downplayed the hype surrounding the much-anticipated match against Pakistan. The Indian pace spearhead emphasized the importance of focusing on their own team's strengths and implementing their own game plan. In a post-match press conference, Bumrah remarked, \"See, every team will have batsmen, every team will have bowlers. We also have batsmen; we also have bowlers. We're not preparing any special for any special team. Yes, we're looking at ourselves more than the others because we've realised that if we focus on our team, we focus on our strengths, everything else takes care of itself.\" The seasoned campaigner highlighted how the team's focus remains on leveraging their own strengths rather than obsessing over the opposition's tactics. Being in control of their performance and strategy was underlined as the prime focus. Afghanistan may not have started the World Cup in India on the right note, losing two in two, but head coach Jonathan Trott says the boys are geared up to put in good performances and bring joy to the quake-hit country. Afghanistan were outclassed by 8 wickets by Rohit Sharma's India in Delhi on October 11.

The former Indian captain, known for his aggressive style on the field, made a surprising appeal to the home crowd, asking them not to boo Afghan pacer . The incident was a stark contrast to an earlier altercation between Kohli and Naveen during the IPL 2023 match between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). The tension had escalated when the two players exchanged heated words while Naveen was at the crease. However, Kohli's recent gesture showed a different side of him, reflecting his maturity and respect for fellow players. Kohli, who has been nicknamed \"The King\" and \"Captain Fearless\" by his fans, is renowned for his dominant play and incredible captaincy. His appeal to the crowd showcased his leadership qualities, emphasizing the spirit of the game over personal grudges. Despite their past differences, Kohli stood up for Naveen, highlighting the importance of respect and sportsmanship in cricket. The World Cup match was a significant event, with India securing an eight-wicket victory over Afghanistan. Rohit Sharma, the current Indian captain, led the team to victory with an impressive century. However, it was Kohli's act of sportsmanship that stole the limelight, reminding everyone that cricket is as much about respect and fair play as it is about competition and victory. Born and raised in Delhi, Kohli has always been a crowd favourite at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. His appeal to the crowd not only diffused a potentially tense situation but also set an example for millions of his fans worldwide. This incident reaffirms why Kohli is not just considered a great player, but also a true ambassador of the sport.","pubDate":"2023-10-11 17:55:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"da524db966b69e53feea3c119e3bbd6b","title":"Ind vs Afg: रवि शास्त्री ने नवीन-उल-हक और विराट की \"दोस्ती\" को लेकर कह दिया यह कड़वा सच","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/hindi/cricket/ind-vs-afg-ravi-shastri-says-the-bitter-truth-about-naveen-ul-haq-virat-kohli-friendship-4472736#publisher=newsstand","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Afghanistan, 9th Match: अफगानिस्तान के मुकाबले में जितने चर्चे रोहित शर्मा की बल्लेबाजी के रहे, तो उतनी ही सुर्खियां नवीन-उल-हक और विराट कोहली के \"मिलन\" ने बटोरीं","content":"जारी World Cup 2023 में दिल्ली के अरुण जेटली स्टेडियम में बुधवार को भारत और अफगानिस्तान (India vs Afghanistan) के बीच खेले गए मुकाबले में भारत की जीत में रोहित शर्मा (Rohit Sharm) की बल्लेबाजी तो फैंस के बीच आकर्षण का विषय रही ही, तो वहीं पूर्व कप्तान विराट कोहली और अफगानी पेसर नवीन-उल-हक के आए विजुअल ने करोड़ों फैंस का ध्यान अपनी ओर खींचा. और तस्वीर सामने आई, तो यह पंडितों से लेकर आम फैंस के बीच चर्चा का विषय बन गई. अब यह तो आप जानते ही हैं कि इस साल हुए इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग में दोनों की कैसी तस्वीरें सामने आई थीं. कैसे दोनों की तस्वीरें करोड़ों फैंस के बीच चर्चा का विषय बन गई थीं, जिनके कारण इन दोनों सहित गौतम गंभीर को भी जुर्माना भरना पड़ा था.
