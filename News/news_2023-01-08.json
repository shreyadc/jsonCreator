The New Zealand side has been hit by minor injury concerns on the eve of ODI and T20 series against Pakistan and India, ones that shouldn’t affect next month’s test picture. Test wicketkeeper Tom Blundell has an adductor strain but coach Gary Stead indicated he should be fit well before the much anticipated two-test home series against England begins. Pace bowler Matt Henry completed the final test against Pakistan with an abdominal strain but has been pulled out of the ODI squad and will miss this week’s series against Pakistan. No replacement has been announced by the side. The clashes against England will bring rare test glamour to New Zealand, with Brendon McCullum’s much-lauded influence in charge of the English adding a unique x-factor to the contest. It will be a massive test for New Zealand’s new captain Tim Southee, and it now seems certain he will be without his long-time new-ball partner. The 33-year-old Boult is playing in the UAE T20 league and will only return to New Zealand on the eve of the tests. After being released from his New Zealand Cricket central contract last year, Boult hoped his test career might continue and pointed out that the first test against England will be at Bay Oval, his home ground in Mt Maunganui. And he did line up in the first test in England last year just days after playing in the IPL final, proving his readiness in just one training session before going on to have an excellent series. Boult said at the time of his contract release he would respect New Zealand’s position on his test future. When asked after the drawn series against Pakistan if Boult might face England, Stead said: “No, I wouldn’t have thought so. “Trent and I have had discussions, his return from the UAE is only a day or so immediately prior to that. From a workload perspective that’s out of the picture.” That leaves Boult’s test future hanging by a thread, and gives another indication of how cricket’s new landscape, dominated by T20 leagues, is hurting the traditional form of the game. It will also be a massive disappointment for Kiwi and test cricket fans, with the Black Caps going into such a big series without one of their greatest spearheads. Meanwhile, rising star Kyle Jamieson is touch-and-go to be ready for England, although he is set to return from a long-term back injury with Auckland in the coming days. “Maybe England is a step too far, or maybe it is right for him,” Stead said. “He’s been out for a long time and it would be silly to push too quickly and set him back.” The side will almost certainly be without the services of Kyle Jamieson as well. Photo / Photosport Meanwhile, Stead said Southee’s captaincy was still in development, after Kane Williamson’s long tenure. While a drawn series is not something that will win much applause in the modern era, Stead sounded delighted with many aspects of the Pakistan games including the exciting finishes. He said Southee faced a tricky opening assignment though, in benign conditions and managing three spinners - a highly unusual business for a New Zealand test side. “There’s always a transition period, adjusting to how Tim captains,” he said. “Tim still does it his way - it’s hard to compare at the moment. He was thrown in at the deep end, and three spinners are not the norm in our conditions. “Let him develop in his own time, don’t put too many expectations and comparisons - everyone does it slightly differently. That’s the great thing about our game. “And he’s still got trusted people around him in Kane and Tom.” Stead said the McCullum factor had set up what should be a “blockbuster series” next month. “It’s great that England are coming over, they are playing very positive cricket at the moment,” he said. “They will want to test how their style goes in different conditions.”","content":"Kiwi bowling legend Trent Boult has been all-but ruled out of the Black Caps’ premier test showdown of the summer against England next month.

The match was on a knife-edge with three overs remaining as New Zealand needed the one wicket, while Pakistan needed 15 runs. Incredibly, the second last over had seen a six and a four and spinners were operating from either end. But the bad light call reignited the debate over the bad light rule as both sides wanted to continue, only to be overruled by the umpires. New Zealand were in sight of a series-clinching victory after dismissing Sarfaraz for a career-best 118 with 39 balls remaining in the match. But as dusk settled, Naseem scored 15 and Ahmed seven as Pakistan made it to 9/304 chasing 319. The result sees the two-match series ended 0-0 after the first Test – also in Karachi – ended in a draw, depriving New Zealand of their first series win in Pakistan for 53 years. Speaking on Fox Cricket about the baffling end to what had been a gripping Test match, Isa Guha, Mark Howard and Kerry O’Keefe slammed the umpires’ decision. Isha Guha said: “Wasn’t the last scoring shot a six as well?” “Correct,” Howard confirmed. “Both sides wanted to stay out there because they both thought they were a chance to win.” “So the umpires pulled them off?” Guha said. “I can’t believe it. The game doesn’t help itself. You’d be absolutely furious as a spectator.” Kerry O’Keeffe said it was: “another nail in the coffin of Test cricket. “We need results. The juggernaut of T20 and the IPL, it’s getting bigger, it’s not getting smaller. They played five days – it was theatre, it was drama going down. One team should have won and one team should have lost. And I think they were prepared for that.” “It could have been a tied Test,” Howard added. “And we’ll never know.” O’Keeffe continued: “And if you’re at the ground, if you’re watching that drama take place, you are totally engrossed it in. The umpires say ‘oh, that’s time, we’re off’.” The players were left to shake hands after bad light stopped play.

If the fielding team is told to bowl spin because of bad light and they take the option, they should be forced to finish the overs with spin until the Umps call it off, cause they can bring seam on at any time to finish the match,” de Villiers wrote on Twitter. “If the batting team manages to get it down to 5 or so runs required, the fielding team can just opt to bring on a seamer. Not fair imo.” Former New Zealand star Scott Styris wrote: “Both teams had a chance of winning and we come off the field with 3 overs to go. “Exhibit A of why test cricket is in trouble. “Well done both teams for battling all the way.” The Herald Sun’s weekend sports editor Jamie Tate posted: “Cricket shoots itself in the foot again. @TheRealPCB needs 15 runs to win. @BLACKCAPS need one wicket.

Agha Salman made a brisk 30 but was clean bowled by Matt Henry before New Zealand struck twice with the second new ball under fading light. Hasan Ali was trapped leg before wicket by Southee, and Sarfaraz was superbly snapped up by Kane Williamson low at leg slip off Bracewell.

Yadav, who has developed a proper knack of playing these blinder of an innings in the shortest format, not only tests the bowlers but also tests anyone who has to articulate his atypically freakish shots. Yadav, 32, appears to be in such a form where neither of conditions, oppositions or batting positions matter to him. Coming in to bat at No. 4 around the end of the powerplay, Yadav executed his sole intention of playing super-attacking eye-catching shots to a tee to power India to 228/5 in 20 overs after captain Hardik Pandya (4) won the toss and chose to bat in a series-decider. In the process, Yadav also powered himself to a third T20I century which was made possible after he hit a Kasun Rajitha full-toss to sweeper cover for a single in the penultimate over. Making batting look exceedingly easy, Yadav playing such impact-generating knocks time and again makes batting look incredibly difficult for his teammates for they are nowhere near him in terms of consistently playing game-changing knocks in this format. With Shubman Gill (46) hardly being able to generate any sort of momentum, Yadav was instrumental in playing boundary shots on a continuous basis. Yadav, who ended up scoring 112* (51) consisting of seven fours and nine sixes at a strike rate of 219.60, reached the three-figure mark on the 45th ball that he faced. The fact that this is Yadav’s third instance of scoring a T20I ton in just his 43rd innings speaks highly about his unrivaled conversation rate especially among batters belonging to Full Member Nations.

Coming in to bat at No. 3 in the first over of the ongoing third T20I against Sri Lanka in Rajkot, Tripathi made optimum use of the powerplay scoring 35 (16) with the help of five fours and two sixes at a strike rate of 218.75. The right-handed batter compensated for non-striker Shubman Gill not being able to score brisk runs in the first six overs. Having guided a Dilshan Madushanka leg-side delivery for his first boundary of the match on only the second ball that he faced, there was no stopping Tripathi since then. Tripathi, who hit another boundary in Tripathi’s second over, hit three more in spinner Maheesh Theekshana’s first over. The 31-year old player nailed a couple of sweeps to perfection before clearing the mid-off on the third occasion. It was in the following Chamika Karunaratne over that Tripathi hit consecutive sixes down the ground to put on display his calibre in the shortest format. Why is Sanju Samson not playing vs Sri Lanka today? It was in the second T20I in Pune on Thursday that Tripathi had made his T20I debut after replacing batter Sanju Samson in the Playing XI. Readers must note that Samson hasn’t been dropped but has been ruled out of the series due to a knee injury he sustained while fielding in the first match in Mumbai on Tuesday. Not part of a 17-member ODI squad for the subsequent three-match ODI series, Samson would be eyeing a three-match ODI series against New Zealand later this month with respect to making a return to the Indian team. India, meanwhile, refrained from making any change to their Playing XI for a series-decider at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium tonight. Sri Lanka, on the contrary, have included batter Avishka Fernando in place of batter Bhanuka Rajapaksa. Fernando, 24, is playing an international match after some 11 months on the back of being the highest run-scorer in Lanka Premier League 2022. Part of champions Jaffna Kings, the right-handed batter had scored 339 runs in 10 innings at an average and strike rate of 37.66 and 124.63 respectively.

Look at Ishan Kishan for example, how he hits the ball, he has even scored a double century recently. Just tell these players to go out there and play your game, don't restrict them. \"Just like Ishan Kishan, you need two or three more players who aren't afraid to express themselves, that's number one. All-rounders, batting all-rounders, bowling all-rounders are required in this line-up. There should be a combination of these players in the team. And what about ODI cricket, Just like Gautam Gambhir has played a major role of anchor in the past, the same way Virat Kohli will play that role this time around. He will help players like Ishan Kishan excel just as he got a century when Kishan got a double century.\" \"It's all about freedom, giving your players the freedom, do what you want, play your game even if you get out, that's the approach the team should have,\" said Srikkanth on 'Cricket Ka Mahakumbh' show on Star Sports. Srikkanth, a member of the 1983 ODI World Cup winning team in England, further backed Kohli to be on top of his batting in 2023 ODI World Cup. \"First of all, the knock played by Gautam Gambhir was phenomenal, that too in the World Cup, congratulations to him, I am proud of him. Superb batting throughout the series. I am making the prediction that Virat Kohli will show us the same heroics in the 2023 World Cup,\" he said. Former chief selector also feels that Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja and Jasprit Bumrah will be of critical importance to the Indian team during the 2023 ODI World Cup while adding Deepak Hooda will be in the reserves for him. \"My eyes will be on Hardik Pandya, I expect him to go out there and play his game. Bowl well as well as give his best at batting and fielding. Energy on the field, that's needed and that's what I see in Hardik Pandya. Just two important players we need, Ravindra Jadeja and Jasprit Bumrah. Ravindra Jadeja is very important and so is Deepak Hooda. Washington Sundar is definitely a certainty in my opinion, Axar Patel maybe a certainty,\" said Srikkanth. \"Need to work on developing Deepak Hooda, we do not need 10 overs from him, we just need three to four overs. He can be the batting all-rounder. The problem for team India now is that we lack batting all-rounders. At that time we had Yuvraj Singh who was a batting all-rounder, Sehwag another batting all-rounder. Sachin Tendulkar too used to bowl three to four overs. We just need them to bowl three to four overs and not 10 overs. So if we get such a bowler it would be good for team India.

Things improved on Day Two when almost a full 90 overs were possible before the rain returned to force a washout for Day Three on Friday. The weather forecast suggestions are far better for Saturday when much less rain is on the radar. Australia were batting at 475 for four when early stumps were called on Thursday. Usman Khawaja was unbeaten on 195 off 368 balls, including 19 fours and one six, while Matt Renshaw, who tested positive for Covid-19 before the start of the match, was alongside him with five not out. Cricket Australia also announced that patrons who purchased tickets for day three's play may be eligible for a refund under the terms of the 2022/23 Refund Policy. Given that less than 15 overs were bowled on Friday, ticket purchasers may be eligible for a full or partial refund. The rain in Sydney on Day 3 of the Test meant all elements of the pre-match ceremony of Jane McGrath Day - including the pre-show performance, and unfurling of the Jane McGrath Pink Silk and Pink Cap presentation - has been postponed for day four. Brief scores: Australia 475/4 in 131 overs (Usman Khawaja 195 not out, Steve Smith 104, Anrich Nortje 2/55) against South Africa.

One is so pleased to see the domestic championship tournament, the Ranji Trophy, played in every corner of the country. With 38 teams in the fray, cricket and cricketers are flourishing playing it, like never before. The days of the frugal number of first-class matches have given rise to a cricketers calendar now being full of matches the whole year round.The enormous number of runs scored and the competitive spirit that prevails at present from the junior to the international level is quite astonishing. There seems to be an air of seriousness amongst the young breed of cricketers that can be compared to one's educational qualifications. Cricket is now no more just a sport but a subject and a profession that can be pursued to make one's career and living. It has become a lucrative option for one to opt for as well. All this truly reflects how successfully India has taken to the sport of cricket. One can see cricket being played on open fields, narrow lanes and any surface where a ball and bat can mesh together. There is rarely a piece of land where one does not see young or old, boy or girl, in India, swinging a cricket bat or playing the game with such gusto and pride. The popularity of the game is not measured by the silverware won by a country but as to how the game has ingrained itself into the life and culture of their people. The British may have started cricket; however, India has taken it to a different level. Cricket is a religion for many in India. The huge following it attracts, with people playing it all around the country, is fabulous to see. Cricket is one sport that is competing well against the video games that the digital world is pushing every youngster into. India is one of the only countries that have serious competitive cricket tournaments from the school level itself. In India, cricket is gradually extending and flowing into the far corners of its landscape and in areas where cricket was never played. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have a challenging task, as they now require to create facilities and establish a system to capture the popularity and unearth the wealth of talent that exists. The greatest gain that cricket in India has achieved is in the emergence of teams such as Madhya Pradesh, Saurashtra, Vidarbha and Gujarat winning the Ranji Trophy in this decade. Earlier, Mumbai and all the major cricket-playing cities had dominated the Indian domestic scene. To break the camel's back, so one says, beating the giants of the game in India, has been the reason for the major upswing that exists in its popularity amongst the smaller towns. Cricket like other sports needs one to have good hand and eye coordination. This is a gift that comes naturally, whether, one is living in urban or rural India. The television and the advent of mobile phones in every home in India has further brought cricket into people's homes. Watching and learning is one of the important parts of skilling and developing one's game. This fortunately for thousands of aspiring cricketers is now available on hand even in the remotest corners of the country. This has popularized the game to a great extent and has brought in thousands of cricketers and millions of cricket followers. This also, unfortunately, has brought on an enormous amount of pressure on the Indian international cricketers to perform and be successful every time they play. The problem arises when the Indian side plays in an ICC tournament. The expectation of their fans and followers seem to affect them mentally when they are in a spot of trouble. India requires each one of their contracted players to interact with a mental and psychological coach before the ODI World Cup at the end of this year. The 2011 Indian World Cup-winning side withstood the pressure brilliantly and they could be another source of learning for the present side to explore. Cricket is not about winning and losing but about playing the game. Unfortunately, the present world only looks at winners and hence the vast spread of the game in India is not appreciated by most as the Indian cupboard has been bare of an ICC Trophy since 2012. One should rejoice at the fact that India has kept the game alive and cricket is attracting crowds like never before. The wonderful gain in Indian cricket has also been the gradual success of the Indian women cricketers. They have grown in stature to be one of the best sides in the world. The women's IPL and the cricket structure being put into place for domestic tournaments should be a further boost to them. The ICC Women's T20 World Cup is being played in South Africa from February 11, 2023. For the Indian women's team to win it would be just the ideal icing on the cake. This would catapult Indian cricket even further. Then one can say that cricket in India is truly and magnificently flourishing at its best. (Yajurvindra Singh is a former India cricketer.

Internationals.","content":"PUNE: Returning to the team after an injury lay-off, India's young pacer Arshdeep Singh made a horror comeback in the second T20I against Sri Lanka at Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune on Thursday. Arshdeep overstepped three times in a row in the second over of the Sri Lankan innings, becoming the first Indian to bowl a hat-trick of no-balls in T20 Internationals. The left-arm pacer sent down as many as five no-balls in the match to created another unwanted record for the most number of no-balls by an India in T20 Internationals. He has become the second bowler from a full ICC member nation after New Zealand's Hamish Rutherford to bowl five no-balls in a T20 International match. Arshdeep clearly has a problem with no-balls, overstepping 14 times in 22 T20 Internationals, which has left his captain Hardik Pandya worried. \"You can have a good day, you can have a bad day, but you shouldn't be moving away from the basics. For Arshdeep, in this situation, it is very difficult. In past as well he's bowled no-balls,\" Pandya said after the loss. \"It is not about blaming him or to be too hard on him, but we know no-balls in any format is a crime.\" India's pacers bowled a total of seven no-balls in the match, with Shivam Mavi and Umran Malik bowling one each. Arshdeep gave away 37 runs in two overs as Sri Lanka fought back in the middle overs to post a huge 206 after being put into bat. In reply, Suryakumar Yadav and Axar Patel gave home fans a glimmer of hope by putting together a blistering partnership of 91 runs, but ultimately it was too little too late for India, as they went down by 16 runs.

After eking out a narrow last-ball win in the opener, India fell short by 16-run defeat as Sri Lanka levelled the three-match series 1-1. The inconsistency of a young attack was one of the reasons for the defeat but going forward Umran Malik and Shivam Mavi will know that it was great learning experience for them. They erred in their lines and didn't always bowl the fuller length, making the Sri Lankan batters job easy to guide the pace of the short pitched stuff. The Indian bowling unit bled runs with left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, who returned to the playing XI after a spell of injuries, bowling as many as five no balls in his two overs. He stepped over the line three times on the trot in his first over, making him the first India bowler to bowl hat-trick of no-balls in T20I. Mavi, who made a sensational T20I debut in the opening game and Arshdeep Singh added to the no ball count as they too missed the trick with skipper Hardik Pandya, who had to rely on his spinners, lamenting that the team needs to get its basics right. But the youngsters in the team are expected more chances as they gather valuable experience. \"The young kids will have games like this at times, and I think we all need to be patient with them, (but) we need to be understanding that games like this can't happen,\" head coach Rahul Dravid said. \"I think as they're learning, it's tough. It's not easy learning in international cricket. You have to learn on the job. I think we're going to have to have a little bit of patience with these guys,\" he added. On the batting front, the top order, once again, failed to provide a solid start. Shubman Gill succumbed to his second successive failure in the series and would be eager to capitalise on the opportunities in hand like Rahul Tripathi, who too perished cheaply in his debut game. It was the second instance of the top-order collapse in the series. But despite half the team returning to the dugout under 60 runs, it was heartening to see India still go for chase as Axar Patel and Suryakumar Yadav almost pulled off the impossible. In Axar, India have found a reliable like for like replacement of Ravindra Jadeja. The team is expected to give its core more games to form lethal combinations as the team prepares for life beyond Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in the shortest format of the game. India is unlikely to make any changes for the series decider with head coach Dravid asserting \"we are not going to be chopping and changing people too much.\" As expected, Sri Lanka have given a solid fight to the hosts.

In ODIs, she picked 255 wickets, a record in women's international cricket. \"When I started playing cricket, if anyone hit a six or went for boundaries on my ball, then people used to tease me a lot. Because they were like, 'You bought these girls to play. It's not going to work. We'll win anyways'. I used to think that I wasn't lesser than them and I could go against them and win. My takeaway is if you believe in your inner instinct then definitely, with honesty and dedication, you can reach that place,\" said Jhulan in the latest episode of CRED's The Long Game series. It is well documented that Jhulan used to travel from her hometown Chakdha to Kolkata for cricketing practice. Now she has revealed about almost giving up the sport if not for her coach Sapan Sadhu. \"Mr. Sapan Sadhu sir is my coach till today and I remember telling him that it's difficult for me to continue. The first problem is coming from Chakdha to Kolkata and the second is that cricket is an expensive sport and I came from a middle class family. It was a burden to my family. He said, Give me two years. I will take care of everything she needs.' He had just one condition - that I shouldn't miss even one practice in those two years,\" she said. Jhulan and Mithali Raj, the batting legend of Indian women's cricket, have had great camaraderie. The duo were involved in a brilliant 157 runs stand in Taunton for the seventh wicket, with Mithali making 214 against England. \"In 2002, we were playing a test match at Taunton. Mithali was batting at 100 odd runs. I had just come down as the seventh batter and she was very tired. And those days, she used to use very heavy bats. I told her to stay there, that I am with her and I will give her full support. After a certain time, she scored 150 plus and again said that her arms were feeling numb. I told her Mithali look at that flag. We have to do it for our country'. She scored 200 plus runs and our partnership became a 7th wicket record partnership,\" recalled Jhulan. Jhulan played for India in five Women's ODI World Cups — 2005, 2009, 2013, 2017 and 2022. She remains the leading wicket-taker in the history of the Women's Cricket World Cups with 43 scalps. Asked about her style of leadership, she explained, \"You have to do a lot of communication as the leader. That is the most important thing. If you don't know your teammates, what emotional state they are in, what mental state they are in, technically whether they feel any different, whether they are feeling nervous.\" All these things you have to know as a leader. What you are doesn't matter, but how you give that comfort to your teammates, that is important.\" IANS Also Read: Life Insurance Corporation of India's (LIC) New Jeevan Shanti plan modifiedAlso Watch:","pubDate":"2023-01-07 13:03:36","image_url":"https://assets.sentinelassam.com/h-upload/2023/01/07/428428-jhulan-goswami.jpg","source_id":"sentinel","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Asian Cricket Council slams PCB chairman Sethi for his comments on cricket schedule","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/asian-cricket-council-slams-pcb-chairman-sethi-for-his-comments-on-cricket-schedule-631996","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Shah, who is also the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) released the cricketing calendar in Asia for 2023/24 as ACC President.","content":"NEW DELHI: The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) on Friday slammed the comments of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Najam Sethi who has publicly taunted ACC President Jay Shah over announcing the cricket schedule and pathways of the governing body for the 2023-24 calendar.

While you are at it, you might as well present the structure & calendar of our PSL 2023! A swift response will be appreciated.\" Now, on Friday, the ACC said in an official statement that the PCB had been informed about these details via email on December 22, 2022, but no response had come from them. Incidentally, on that day, Sethi had replaced Ramiz Raja as PCB Chairman. \"It has come to our knowledge that PCB Chairman Mr Najam Sethi has made a comment on the ACC President unilaterally taking the decision on finalising the calendar and announcing the same.\" The ACC wants to clarify that it has followed well established and due process. The calendar was approved by its Development Committee and Finance & Marketing Committee in a meeting held on December 13th, 2022,\" the statement read. \"The calendar was then communicated to all the participating members individually, including Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), via an email dated December 22nd, 2022. While responses were received from certain Member Boards, no comments or suggested modifications were received from PCB.

In response to Australia's 475/4, they were on the ropes at 149/6 at the end of the fourth day, needing a further 127 to make the hosts bat again at the Sydney Cricket Ground. South Africa has already lost the three-match Test series 2-0 as their batting struggles continue unabated on a sluggish, but negotiable SCG surface where Dean Elgar (15), Sarel Erwee (18) and Heinrich Klaasen (2) failed another batting Test.

The Proteas are scheduled to play only 28 Tests in the 2023-27 Future Tours Programme, fewer than New Zealand (32), Bangladesh (34), Australia (40) and England (43).

We've still got another day to bat and I'm sure we've done that before,\" Zondo said. \"I'm sure we'll be able to do it on day five.

Zondo, who played for the Durban-based Dolphins, said the nature of the SCG track reminded him of the Pietermaritzburg Oval because of the sluggishness.
