The 30-year-old has been included alongside one-time test player Glenn Phillips and uncapped Blair Tickner as part of a 15-man squad for the two test series, which starts in Karachi on December 26 and concludes in Multan from January 3. The tour will be Tim Southee’s first as test captain after Kane Williamson earlier announced he was stepping down as skipper in the longest format. Sodhi has played 125 white-ball games for the Black Caps and has been a mainstay in the T20 side — recently becoming just the fifth male player in the world to claim 100 T20I wickets. Despite not being able to play a lot of red-ball cricket of late, Sodhi has a strong first-class record featuring 279 wickets at an average of 33, with 16 five-wicket bags and two ten-wicket hauls. Phillips played his only test against Australia at the SCG in January 2020, scoring a half-century in the first innings. Like Sodhi, the 26-year-old Phillips has made his name in the T20I format, racking up 56 international caps and a current ICC T20I batting ranking of seven. Tickner featured in the Black Caps test squads for the series against South Africa and England in the winter, but is yet to debut, after playing 20 white-ball internationals.

Photo / Photosport Coach Gary Stead congratulated the trio on their inclusion in the squad. “It’s always an exciting time for a player to be selected in a test squad and even more so when you’ve been away for an extended period of time,” Stead said. “I know all three of the guys have a real passion for the longest form of the game and are looking forward to getting into their red-ball work at the pre-tour camp in Lincoln this week.” Stead acknowledged that Sodhi had not been able to play a lot of red-ball cricket recently due to the demands of the international white-ball schedule, but said he had the faith of the selectors. “Ish has been playing international cricket for almost a decade now and we’re backing his skills and experience. “Looking at the current conditions and style of play in the Pakistan and England test series, we feel having a wrist-spinner in the team will be important.” Stead was full of praise for Phillips who he said had taken his white-ball game to new heights in the past two seasons. “Glenn is clearly a very talented batsman and we’re excited to introduce him back into the test squad for this tour. “His ability to bowl off-spin is also a plus point with the prospect of turning pitches.” Glenn Phillips presented with his test cap on debut. Photo / Photosport Stead said Tickner’s inclusion reflected his place amongst the test bowling stocks in the country. “Blair’s been with the group for our past two test series and we believe he’s very much ready for test cricket. “He has genuine pace and gets good bounce which is a real asset to have in sub-continental conditions.” Trent Boult made himself unavailable for the tour, while Kyle Jamieson remains unavailable for selection as he continues his recovery from a back injury. Stead said the squad was looking forward to the prospect of playing test cricket in Pakistan for the first time since 2003. “It’s going to be a new experience and the kind of challenge that excites this group. “We’ve naturally been keeping an eye on the current test series against England, particularly the last two tests of the series held in Multan and Karachi, where we will play. “This series will be the first for Tim Southee as test captain and together we’re both looking forward to getting into our work for the tour.” The Black Caps one-day squads for Pakistan and India will be named on Monday December 19.

Can you imagine the Queensland Rugby League FOGs sending that through – can you imagine the uproar?“I’m just glad they have given us plenty of notice for this wonderful get-together because it would enable me to hire my electric bike and ride to Sydney so I’m carbon-neutral in line with the Australian captain’s theme.”The ACA email - sent out on December 13 titled Member Update – stated: “All members attending will receive a $30 food and drink voucher upon arrival that can be used at all SCG food and drink outlets located in the Victor Trumper Stand.”ACA officials were criticised for the same penny-pinching offer to former Western Australia and South Australia players late last month.Ritchie – who played 30 Tests - received the email, despite being a Queenslander, because he previously lived in NSW.Tongue-firmly-in-cheek, Ritchie added: “This is a magnificent Christmas present. To know that such a generous offer has been made – to know I can go there and be fed and watered the entire day – is so comforting.“Actually, that should be ‘fed and watered’ for the first ten minutes before the voucher amount runs out. I’ve looked up the SCG food menu and what a day out I’m going to have!“I might have to cut back on what I normally have on a day out and maybe pack some sandwiches. But, in all seriousness, what does this show in terms of what the ACA thinks of their past members?”Another former Test cricketer said: “They can’t be serious?”Ritchie’s concerns over how quickly his voucher will evaporate were confirmed when The Daily Telegraph checked the SCG food and beverage prices.The $30 voucher won’t stretch too far with large chips costing $8, a braised beef pie ($8), stadium burger ($13.50), Singapore/Hokkien noodles ($19) while raw fish (200g) would cost $35, crunching the amount in one hit.Beer prices inside the SCG range from $9.30 to $13.40.The ACA countered by claiming the cost to hold private events for former players is significant and that player numbers attending such functions have been decreasing. It is also anticipated the ACA will invite players to a hospitality function at a Sheffield Shield game this season.The ACA email to former players reads: “Good morning, the Australian Cricketers’ Association is delighted to invite you to attend the inaugural NSW ‘Day at the Cricket’ event taking place on day two of the third Test between Australia vs South Africa.“This season the ACA has revamped our annual state reunions, allowing members to enjoy more of the action from the stands, while still having the same opportunity to catch up with fellow members.“Please note that there will be no hospitality at this event.“We hope you can join us for what promises to be an entertaining day’s play and a great opportunity to connect with fellow ACA members.”","pubDate":"2022-12-14 21:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: Kane Williamson to stand down as Black Caps test captain","link":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/cricket-kane-williamson-to-stand-down-as-black-caps-test-captain/WHCO5NORANEE3GJLFHX5NFJ4SM/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"An end to the country’s most successful test cricket captaincy era appears nigh.","content":"An end to the country’s most successful test cricket captaincy era appears nigh.

The feat came exactly 34 years after Sachin, then 15, began his journey to greatness with an unbeaten 100 against Gujarat at the Wankhede Stadium. Late Lala Amarnath and one of his three sons Surinder had made hundreds on their Test debuts, making them the only father-son duo to achieve the feat in the 145-year history of traditional international format. Batting at No. 7, Tendulkar junior, who had moved to Goa from Mumbai earlier this season in search of more playing opportunities, hit two sixes and 16 fours in his knock of 120 from 207 deliveries. Along with No. 3 Suyash Prabhudessai (212; 416 balls, 29×4), Tendulkar junior put together 221 runs for the sixth wicket to take Goa to a mammoth 493/8 at close on day two. Primarily, a left-arm fast medium, Arjun had come out to bat at the fag end of the opening day n Tuesday after the departure of wicketkeeper-batter Eknath Kerkar with Goa precariously placed at 201 for 5. He started cautiously, seeing off 12 deliveries to be on four overnight in the company of RCB player Prabhudessai (81). The 23-year-old started his innings afresh and saw off the Rajasthan attack boasting of seasoned duo of Aniket Choudhary and Kamlesh Nagarkoti to complete his maiden half-century off 86 balls. He got to his maiden century off 177 deliveries to emulate his father, who holds the record of all-time highest run-scorer in international cricket. The medium-pacer took eight wickets in eight List A games. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he took four wickets in three T20 matches for Goa. Arjun had made the cut for the India Under-19 team and was bought by Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Mumbai Indians. But he has never played an IPL match for the most successful IPL side.

Speaking on Wednesday - the day originally set down for the hearing before Warner withdrew his application to have the ban overturned - Sullivan also said any attempt by Cricket Australia to interfere with the independent review would do serious harm to the governing body’s integrity. David Warner signs autographs for fans in Adelaide. Credit: AP “We are an independent panel,” Sullivan told the Herald and The Age. Sullivan - who served on the NRL judiciary between 1993 and 1997, has been a member of the Court of Arbitration for Sport since 2000, was a former deputy chairman of the FIFA ethics committee, was an FFA appeals committee member for 10 years and is an International Cricket Council code-of-conduct commissioner - said public hearings avoided “ill-informed or uninformed conjecture”, adding that AFL and NRL tribunals were open to the media. “They’re heard in public because if they’re heard in private there’d be a whole lot of speculation about what happened behind the closed doors and people will make guesstimate,” Sullivan said. “Or one party will leak selected versions of things. So we just wanted it all to be open, to the extent possible with David’s well-being in mind. “We would undoubtedly have probably been very sympathetic to requests that certain things be heard in private if he wanted it to be heard. But generally speaking, we didn’t want any room for ill-informed or uninformed conjecture.” Warner was furious that questions might have been asked about the 2018 Cape Town ball-tampering scandal and that the media might have been allowed to cover all or part of the hearing when his application was only about the length of the ban. He has always maintained his guilt for his part in the incident. He withdrew the application on the eve of the Adelaide Test, accusing the three-man code-of-conduct commission panel of attempting to hold a “public lynching” and said he did not want to put his family or his teammates through any more “trauma”.","pubDate":"2022-12-14 18:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"France vs Morocco LIVE SCORE: Spirited Atlas Lions stand tall in Kylian Mbappe &amp; Co. way to FIFA World Cup final","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/france-vs-morocco-live-score-fifa-world-cup-2022-semi-finals-al-bayt-stadium-qatar-football-latest-updates-11810081.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"France vs Morocco LIVE SCORE: Spirited Atlas Lions stand tall in Kylian Mbappe &amp; Co. way to FIFA World Cup final","content":"France vs Morocco LIVE SCORE: Line-ups are out!

France vs Morocco preview : Morocco’s history-making run at the World Cup is about to get its ultimate test. Africa’s first World Cup semifinalist will play defending champion France and striker Kylian Mbappé, the leader of a new wave of football superstars coming out of an era dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. The match has cultural and political connotations because Morocco was under French rule from 1912-56 and the outcome is far from a foregone conclusion. Morocco have exceeded all expectations in Qatar by beating second-ranked Belgium in the group stage and then eliminating European powerhouses Spain and Portugal in the knockout phase to reach the semifinals. No African or Arab nation has ever gotten this far before. Read all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.

Suryakumar Yadav, or SKY as he is affectionately called, has scored 1424 runs from 43 innings across the three formats this year for India. FirstCricket Staff December 14th, 2022 23:04:21 IST Shreyas Iyer achieved a notanle milestone during the first Test against Bangladesh. AP India batter Shreyas Iyer on Wednesday became the country’s top run-getter across formats in 2022, surpassing Suryakumar Yadav to achieve the feat. Shreyas Iyer reached the milestone during the first Test between Bangladesh and Indi a in Chattogram, that started on Wednesday. With 1489 runs from 38 innings, Iyer is now India’s leading run-scorer across formats this year. Suryakumar Yadav, or SKY as he is affectionately called, has scored 1424 runs from 43 innings across the three formats this year for India. Virat Kohli features third in the list with 1304 runs from 39 innings, while Rishabh Pant is fourth with 1278 runs from 41 innings. Rohit Sharma, who is currently not playing the first Test due to an injury, is in fifth spot, with 995 runs from 40 innings. Shreyas Iyer played a pivotal role after India opted to bat on Wednesday. Coming into bat with India’s score reading 112/4, Iyer forged a 149-run stand with Cheteshwar Pujara (90), who fell in the nervous nineties. At stumps, India were 278/6, having just lost Axar Patel, but Iyer remains not out on 82 heading to Day 2 on Thursday. The 28-year-old Iyer, in fact, received a lifeline when, in the 84 th over, he was seemingly bowled by Ebadot Hossain , but the bails failed to fall off, eventually giving Shreyas Iyer yet another chance with him being not out. India will look to cross the 300-run mark on Thursday. Read all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.

The Ugandans had comprehensively dealt with Rwanda in the morning encounter defeating the hosts by 85 runs but a persistent drizzle in the afternoon washed out the clash with Tanzania with the coastal boys on the ropes at 41/9. In the clash against Rwanda, Coach Laurence Mahatlane handed T20I debuts to Ronald Lutaaya and Cyrus Kakuru with the former grabbing his opportunity with both hands scoring a half-century on debut with some counter-attacking shot play. Lutaaya another of the U-19 graduates from the 2022 U-19 World Cup to make the step up to the senior team walked in after just two balls but he was relentless in his approach scoring all over the ground for a well-played 64 off 36 balls. The numbers might not tell the whole story of the match because besides Simon Ssesazi (34) the rest of the top order didn’t have any other double digits. A late flourish from Frank Nsubuga (31 not out) and Captain Brian Masaba (29) helped Uganda to 185/9. However, the approach from the Cricket Cranes wasn’t their usual consolidation early on and then go big later, this time the intention was very positive from each batter and while they lost wickets none of the new batters looked at putting the foot off the gas. Uganda reached the 100 mark inside 9 overs and Rwanda did so well to restrict them to 185 in the end. In response, local hero Orichide Tuyisenge (66) took the game to Uganda with some counter-attacking strokes and he was the only shining star in the Rwandan batting. He was the only one to get into double digits as Joseph Baguma exploited the turning Gahanga wicket to claim his best T20I bowling figures of 4/14 which also earned him the player of the match award. Uganda gave away 100 runs but collected the win by 85 runs. In the afternoon familiar enemy Tanzania won the toss and decided to bat 1st, a decision that would regret as Uganda went on the hunt immediately with some lively pace from Cosmas Kyewuta (1/13) and Juma Miyagi (3/12) ripping through the top. The spin duo of Frank Nsubuga (2/4) and Henry Ssenyondo (3/12) ensured the chock hold remained tight as Tanzania was railing at 48/9 when the heavens opened. A no result gets Tanzania out of jail and will be content with a point from the game. The sides will be back in action tomorrow for Match Day 3 at the Gahanga. Uganda will take on Rwanda in the morning and then Tanzania in the afternoon.","pubDate":"2022-12-14 17:04:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"kawowo","country":["Uganda"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"INDW vs AUSW, 3rd T20I Highlights: Australia Beat India by 21 Runs to go up 2-1 in 5-match Series - News18","link":"https://news.google.com/__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?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"INDW vs AUSW, 3rd T20I Highlights: Australia Beat India by 21 Runs to go up 2-1 in 5-match Series  News18India Women vs Australia Women Highlights 3rd T20I: AUS W win to go 2-1 up  Hindustan TimesRecent Match Report - Australia vs India 3rd T20I 2022/23  ESPNcricinfoIN-W vs AU-W Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Australia Women Tour of India, 3rd T20I  Cricket AddictorPerry, Harris and bowlers help Australia go 2-1 up | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-14 16:48:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Bangladesh: Shreyas Iyer luckily escapes dismissal off Ebadot Hossain's ball after bails refuse to fall","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/india-vs-bangladesh-shreyas-iyer-luckily-escapes-dismissal-off-ebadot-hossains-ball-after-bails-refuse-to-fall-11809841.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Bangladesh: Shreyas Iyer luckily escapes dismissal off Ebadot Hossain's ball after bails refuse to fall","content":"The opening day of the first Test between Bangladesh and India in Chattogram on Wednesday saw a bizarre incident, with Shreyas Iyer having survived a clean bowled dismissal by a close margin.Pacer Ebadot Hossain was bowling the 84th over of the Indian innings, and the incident happened in the fifth ball of that over.An incredible sequence of play in the #BANvIND Test match as @ShreyasIyer15 is bowled by Ebadot Hossain but theYour reaction on this close 'escape' ❓#SonySportsNetwork #ShreyasIyer pic.twitter.com/q6BXBScVUz— Sony Sports Network (@SonySportsNetwk) December 14, 2022Shreyas Iyer misread the line completely, and Ebadot unleashed a peach of a delivery that clipped the stumps, and stump lights flashed, but to everyone’s surprise, the bails remained intact, and did not come off. This was to the relief of the Indian duo of Shreyas and Pujara, who were batting at that time, but Bangladesh players on the other hand were left stunned.In fact, Law 29.1 of the MCC Laws of cricket state that: “The wicket is broken when at least one bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or one or more stumps is removed from the ground.”In this case, no bail had fallen off and that meant Shreyas Iyer received a lifeline.In fact, the bail was replaced just three balls before the delivery of the “wicket”, after the earlier one had failed to light up.And to Iyer’s surprise, it was precisely the bail that failed to fall down when Ebadot had rattled the stumps.India had got off to a shaky start, with stand-in skipper KL Rahul (22), Shubman Gill (20) and Virat Kohli (1) failing to convert into big knocks, but Cheteshwar Pujara (90) then came to the rescue, forging a 64-run stand with Rishabh Pant.That was followed by another productive stand for Pujara, a 149-run partnership with the still unbeaten Shreyas Iyer (82 not out), before the former was dismissed by Taijul Islam in the 85th over.From 48/3 at one stage, India went onto post 278/6 at stumps on the opening day. Mehidy Hasan Miraz struck in the very last ball before stumps, removing Axar Patel for 14.India will look to get past the 300-run mark in the first session on Thursday.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Sahil Malhotra December 14th, 2022 20:22:44 IST Arjun Tendulkar is playing in the Ranji Trophy from the Goa Cricket Association side. AFP Arjun Tendulkar got his First Class career off to a dream start as the left-hander hit a hundred on his debut against Rajasthan in the ongoing Ranji Trophy fixture. Coming into bat at No.7 in the 82nd over of the innings, Arjun put on a solid 221-run partnership with Suyash Prabhudesai, who hit a brilliant 212, and gave Goa the upper hand against a formidable Rajasthan unit. Thirty-four years ago, Arjun’s father Sachin, then 15, had hit a hundred on his Ranji Trophy debut against Gujarat and now the son, more known for his bowling, has emulated the feat with a 207-ball 120 at the Goa Cricket Association Academy Ground in Porvorim. Also Read: Arjun Tendulkar scores century on Ranji Trophy debut, replicates father Sachin’s feat People who have watched Arjun’s journey unfold from close quarters had no doubts about his batting abilities but it was always the bowling that took most of the limelight. Former India cricketer Subroto Banerjee, who has been mentoring Arjun since he was just 13, knew the youngster has the skills with the bat but wasn’t expecting a hundred on debut. “I always knew he had the skills with the bat and has the ability to hit the big shots consistently. After his performances in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, I expected him to score the runs in Ranji Trophy but wasn’t expecting a hundred on debut,” says Banerjee in an exclusive conversation with News18 Cricketnext. Arjun’s hundred came against a good Rajasthan bowling line-up featuring the likes of Aniket Choudhary, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, and Mahipal Lomror. Banerjee was pleased that the runs came against a side that has bowlers who have played India A and IPL, and have won the Ranji Trophy in the past. “What is pleasing to me is that the knock has come against a good team, with bowlers who have played for India A, play in the IPL and the team has also won Ranji Trophy. It hasn’t come against a Mizoram or a Meghalaya side. He has scored the runs against a good team with a good line-up,” says Banerjee. The move to Goa After not getting a consistent run with Mumbai’s senior team, Arjun decided to move base to Goa this year in search of more game time. It’s been so far so good for the 23-year-old who impressed in the white-ball competitions earlier this year. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Arjun took 8 wickets in 7 games and returned with 10 scalps in the seven SMAT fixtures he played this year. “It was simple, he wasn’t getting game time in Mumbai and there was no point warming the bench. The idea was that he gets more game time. Only then he could improve or showcase his skills. There was no surety of him getting a consistent run or game time with Mumbai this year so Goa move was ideal for him to showcase his skills and improve as a cricketer,” reveals Banerjee. The former India cricketer further added that there were no reservations from Sachin on the move and he too wanted Arjun to get game time. “There were no reservations as such from Sachin. He wanted Arjun to go and play and learn. You can only learn/improve if you play. That’s what he wanted for Arjun. Very little improvement or growth as a cricketer happens when you continue to warm the bench. And had he stayed in Mumbai, who knows whether or not he would have played these many games or played at all. There was no surety,” says Banerjee. Battle ready Being Sachin Tendulkar’s son, that too when you are a cricketer, ensures there is no dearth of attention, and scrutiny. Right from his younger age-group playing days, Arjun has had the focus on him but Banerjee assures the all-rounder has made peace with the attention and is mentally battle-ready. “The boy has cricket in him. And he will shut everyone up with his performances with both bat and ball. In the past, he couldn’t get game time higher up the order so the big runs weren’t there but I knew and was very confident in his batting skills. I have seen the boy hit hundreds, hit big runs during age-group days and local Mumbai circuit. He has the skills and is mentally very tough to take on challenges. “A cricketer will be tested on how he/she performs when put in the deep end. Same was with Arjun. He knows the attention/pressure will always be there but he’s mentally very strong and is very hardworking, and will continue to deliver the goods,” Banerjee concludes.

Hosts lost two more wickets in quick succession with Prateek Reddy and Anikethreddy back in the pavilion without opening their accounts.

Mickilhit Vignesh hit for a six over his head and then took two off Warrier to reach his three-figure mark in 130 balls. He added 61 runs for the ninth wicket with Kak before the latter was dismissed after his 61-ball vigil. Mickil then went all out with B Punnaiah, the last man at the crease. But Punnaiah edged Vignesh to wicketkeeper (0) as Mickil remained unbeaten. With a mountain to climb, both Jagadeesan and Sudarshan showed intent from the first over. in Tamil Nadu ‘s reply. They milked runs at will, scoring almost six an over. Jagadeesan, who was the aggressor in the partnership, hit Anikethreddy and Tanay Thyagarajan for sixes. He smacked T Ravi Teja through covers to reach his century in just 77 deliveries.

He has scored 14 fifties in his last 51 Test innings. However, his quest for a century continues. Pujara is one of the senior players in the Indian team. He is playing as a regular batsman in the Test team. He played 97 Test matches and scored 6882 runs in 165 innings. This includes 18 centuries and 35 fifties. In the ongoing Test match against Bangladesh, Pujara along with youngsters Pant and Shreyas Iyer has rescued the struggling team. He was amazing by forming a partnership of 64 runs with Pant and 149 runs with Shreyas. However, he could not register a century. At the end of the first day’s play, the Indian team has scored 278 runs after losing 6 wickets in 90 overs. Shreyas Iyer will continue tomorrow’s match with 82 runs. He had last scored 193 runs against Australia in Sydney in 2019. Since then he has not registered a century in the 51 innings he has played so far. However, he has recorded 14 half-centuries in this intervening period. He has been dismissed twice in these last 51 innings of over 90+ runs. He has lost his wicket once in 80+ runs and twice in 70+ runs. Pujara is the 8th highest run-scorer in Test cricket for the Indian team. Kohli is at the 6th position with 8075 runs. Sachin (15,921 runs) is on the first position, Dravid (13,265 runs) is on the second position and Gavaskar (10,122 runs) is on the third position.","pubDate":"2022-12-14 13:35:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Messi'ah of Millions: Indian fans wait for Messi's '2011 Tendulkar moment'","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/messiah-of-millions-indian-fans-wait-for-messis-2011-tendulkar-moment/articleshow/96229534.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"When you see Messi running circles around the best in the world and then make them chase shadows -- like he did with defender Josko Gvardiol on Tuesday night in Doha -- the world appears to be magical.

Rahul, against Bangladesh in the Test series opener at Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium, the race to make it to the WTC final for them also returns in a phase where Test cricket is happening from the sub-continent to the southern hemisphere. The away series defeat to South Africa and losing the Edgbaston Test in England has meant India are in fourth place on the WTC points table. If they are to make it to a second successive WTC final, to be held at The Oval in June 2023, they need to win at least five, if not all six of their remaining Tests, including four against Australia at home in February-March. This is where the challenge for the Indian team is — wins and draws will work, but not a loss. 2022 has been a year in which India have won only two out of five Tests played this year — both those wins came against Sri Lanka at home in March. Moreover, with no Rohit, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja, the task to get wins over slow turning pitches of Bangladesh and make up for the 2-1 ODI series loss becomes much more difficult. With the Indian batters not being great players of spin as compared to the previous generation of Test batters, the task is cut out for the current batting line-up to succeed in the challenge coming from Bangladesh captain and left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan, off-spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz and left-arm spinner Taijul Islam. \"There is a World Test championship (final) qualification so we will also have to be aggressive as well. We know where we stand and what we need to do to qualify for the final. Each day, each session we will have to assess what is required for the team in that particular moment and try to give our best and enjoy each day of Test cricket.\" \"We won't go in with any set mindset. There is a history of a certain venue. You look at the numbers and you take certain pointers from that. At least for us we will go there and try to be aggressive and brave, try and get a result,\" said Rahul to reporters in a pre-series conference. In Rohit's absence, Rahul will likely open with Shubman Gill, with Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and Rishabh Pant occupying numbers three to six. Axar Patel could be picked to fill the void in Jadeja's absence and pair up with Ravichandran Ashwin for spin-bowling duties. In case India need three spinners, Kuldeep Yadav can add that variety. As far as the fast-bowling department is concerned, Umesh Yadav and Mohammed Siraj will be the first-choice picks, with Shardul Thakur as a possible third choice, though Jaydev Unadkat's left-arm angle could make team management think about taking him. While India are playing Tests after five months, Bangladesh are also returning to the fold after six months. Shakib, their talismanic captain, is having an injury concern after being hit on the ribs in the second ODI against Umran Malik, while Taskin Ahmed is ruled out due to recovery from a back injury. The big challenge will be for their Test specialists Mahmadul Hasan Joy, Mominul Haque and Taijul Islam to find their groove immediately in red-ball cricket. With Tamim Iqbal also out due to injury, Bangladesh could give a debut to top-order batter Zakir Hasan, who got a call-up to the squad after his 173 saved Bangladesh A in a four-day match against India A last month. India have never lost to Bangladesh in a Test match and the visitors would want to keep it intact at Chattogram and later in Dhaka to inch closer to sealing a WTC final spot.

The absence of Bumrah and Shami gives Umesh a chance to have an uninterrupted run in a Test series, which has been a little difficult for him ever since Mohammed Siraj emerged as a strong third pacer. Umesh has had few chances in Test cricket over the last few years, having played three Tests each in 2020 and 2021, and played just one match in 2022, which came in January against South Africa at Cape Town. But with his encouraging four wickets in the second four-day match for India A against Bangladesh A last week, it will give him the billing to lead India's bowling attack where making the cut for World Test Championship (WTC) final is at stake. \"Umesh is a very experienced bowler and what he brings to the table. Unfortunately, the way things have been, he hasn't got enough opportunities. Looking at the team balance, someone like Bumrah, Shami, Siraj came in and team management has spoken to him on why certain decisions were taken. In that sense, we are very clear with Umesh as far as clarity is concerned.\" \"If I look it from other way, Umesh becomes a spearhead for us right now. He has a lot of experience with him going into the Test match and series. Also happy with the way Siraj has progressed and delivered in Test cricket. He has won Test matches for us and in other venues as well.\" \"A lot is expected from Umesh, but it is also a great opportunity for someone like Siraj to fill in. Every Test match from here on is extremely important for us (keeping WTC final in mind) and from our perspective, we are looking at winning every Test match,\" said Mhambrey in the pre-match press conference.

In every session, the demands would be different but one thing is sure that you are going to see a lot of aggressive cricket from our side,” India stand-in skipper KL Rahul had said recently, ahead of the match.However, there was no aggressive approach seen among the visiting openers on Wednesday.While the opening duo of Rahul and Shubman Gill did manage to hit boundaries at regular intervals during the first seven overs, with Rahul even cutting through point against Shakib Al Hasan at one stage, the boundaries were hard to come by for India following that phase.Shubman Gill too scored three fours including a pull shot off Ebadot Hossain, but fell for the paddle sweep off Taijul Islam, as Gill was caught by Yasir Ali at slip after getting a top edge off his bat.KL Rahul and Virat Kohli soon followed after, with the duo being dismissed within an over’s gap between the 19th and 20th to leave India at 48-3 at one stage.Virat Kohli’s cheap dismissalVirat Kohli, whose last Test hundred had come against Bangladesh in November 2019, was dismissed cheaply this time, falling for just one run.Facing Taijul Islam in the 20th over, Kohli was trapped LBW plumb in front of middle stump. Kohli had a chat with Pujara at the other end and went for the review with three seconds remaining, but UltraEdge confirmed there was no bat involved and ball-tracking showed it was clearly hitting the stumps.Kohli was stuck on the back foot while trying to playing it to leg side, but the ball ended up spinning sharply and eventually struck Kohli on the backpad.Cheteshwar Pujara misses tonCheteshwar Pujara has been in the nervous nineties phase before, and on Wednesday, he was victim of yet another dismissal in the 90s.Pujara had got to his half-century in 125 deliveries, but failed to convert it into a century, being dismissed for 90 by Taijul Islam.Taijul came up with a flatter ball pitching on middle, and turned enough to beat the outside edge, eventually hitting the off-stump and knocking the bails off.Notably, Pujara last scored a Test century for India in January 2019, when he amassed 193 against Australia in Sydney. The wait for another Test century goes on for Pujara.Pujara-Iyer standCheteshwar Pujara and Shreyas Iyer played pivotal roles in India’s recovering on Day one of the first Test against Bangladesh. While Pujara was involved in a 64-run stand with Rishabh Pant (46), Pujara went onto forge 149-run stand with Shreyas Iyer for the fifth wicket.That partnership stabilised India’s innings, and that helped India win some momentum going into day two, and while India have lost Pujara, Shreyas Iyer remains unbeaten on 82.They may have just four wickets in hand, but India will look to get past the 300-run mark in the first session on Day 2 to make it tough for Bangladesh in their first-innings reply, while Shreyas Iyer searches for what will be just his second Test century.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The action shifts to Brabourne Stadium in the southern end of Mumbai, just a few kilometres away from the Wankhede Stadium where the BCCI is headquartered. The Women in Blue made a fine comeback in the second T20I in front of a sold-out DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai after suffering a nine-wicket thrashing in the opening game. While the Indians could collect just one wicket in the second game as well, it was their batting department that primarily helped stage the turnaround, with Smriti Mandhana (79) and Richa Ghosh (26 not out) helping the side finish level on scores after being set 188 to win. India would then score 20 runs in the Super Over, 13 of which came of Mandhana’s bat. Seamer Renuka Singh would then bowl out a tidy over to ensure the hosts were abreast with the world champions heading into the third game. Squads : India : Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Harmanpreet Kaur(c), Richa Ghosh(w), Deepti Sharma, Devika Vaidya, Radha Yadav, Anjali Sarvani, Meghna Singh, Renuka Thakur Singh, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Sabbhineni Meghana, Harleen Deol, Yastika Bhatia.
