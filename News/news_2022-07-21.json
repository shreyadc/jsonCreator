The game’s heavy hitters were involved in frank discussions of climate change as an issue for cricket, in particular the concern that without decisive action, Australian summer temperatures could reach 50C within the next 20 years, making outdoor sport impossible. Europe’s recent heatwave, including temperatures exceeding 40C in London , only added to the topicality of the matter. Australian men’s cricket captain Pat Cummins at the launch of Cricket for Climate in February. Credit: Getty Images A gathering of about 80 people included the Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley, his Australian Cricketers’ Association counterpart Todd Greenberg, CA and state association board directors, club cricket representatives and the head of Fox Sports, Steve Crawley. Among the keynote speakers at the summit was the noted documentary filmmaker and climate change activist Damon Gameau , whose work has included the film 2040 , that explicitly sets out the need for major corrective action and how to do it. Gameau’s acting credits included learning to bat like Greg Chappell for the 2012 miniseries Howzat: Kerry Packer’s War , but on this occasion he was one of numerous voices helping to generate conversations among cricket’s great and good about what may be done to keep temperatures down. Cummins, who in 2021 joined the now Federal senator David Pocock in a climate regeneration campaign called The Cool Down, has thought deeply about the problems that high temperatures and natural disasters could pose for cricket. In February he launched Cricket For Climate , a group focused initially on equipping grassroots clubs with solar panels and inverters to reduce their carbon output to net zero. The initial launch was overshadowed by the fact it took place around the same time Australia’s former coach Justin Langer was on the cusp of resigning. Cummins was joined back then by current and former Australian players Rachael Haynes, Steve Smith, Moises Henriques, David Warner, Shane Watson, Alyssa Healy, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitch Marsh, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa. This time around, Cummins and others involved in Cricket for Climate have made it clear that they won’t be speaking about the summit until there are concrete proposals to take forward. On the group’s website, Cummins set out the challenge of climate change and how it related to cricket in Australia. “Australia loves its summer of cricket, from the beach to the Boxing Day Test. But in 2020, we saw drought, bushfires, smoke and floods wreak havoc on the grassroots and elite season,” Cummins wrote. “By 2040, the Australian Climate Council says heatwaves in Sydney and Melbourne could reach 50C. That’s game over for the sport we love. “Like the scoreboard, the climate data doesn’t lie. The future of our beautiful country – the future that my partner Becky and I hope to one day share with our kids and grandkids – is under threat. The data says we’re not doing enough to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the worst aspects of climate change, including extreme heat and natural disasters. “Australia’s environment gives us the opportunity to lead the way on renewable energy, but it takes a whole team effort. That’s why I’m inviting my fellow cricket players, administrators, clubs, supporters and sponsors to join Cricket for Climate. Our country, our sport, and the communities we live and play in, are counting on us to act fast, and act together.” Cummins, fiancée Becky Boston and Norman the dog at the couple’s NSW Southern Highlands farm. Credit: Getty Images Cricket for Climate is not the only way in which Cummins has tried to look at improving the game and the world - he is an avowed supporter of ethical corporate and governance practices. “It’s been a real inflection point in the past couple of years, where if you try to do the right thing, it’s been great to see companies that are rewarded,” he told The Good Weekend last year. “I love seeing the socially conscious companies win. It all comes from consumers and new generations demanding that things are done right.” An ambassador for UNICEF, Cummins took time out on the recent tour of Sri Lanka to seek to understand the privations faced by many in the country during its current economic crisis.

Akram, who picked 502 wickets in 356 ODIs and bowled Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup final against England, also backed all-rounder Ben Stokes' decision to retire from 50-over matches citing an \"unsustainable\" workload. \"I think so (on ODI cricket being scrapped). In England, you have full houses. In India, Pakistan especially, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, one-day cricket you are not going to fill the stadiums.\" \"They are doing it just for the sake of doing it. After the first 10 overs, it's just 'OK, just go a run a ball, get a boundary, four fielders in and you get to 200, 220 in 40 overs' and then have a go in the last 10 overs. Another 100. It's kind of run-of-the-mill,\" said Akram on Vaughany and Tuffers Cricket Club Podcast. Further talking about Stokes and his decision to retire from ODIs to focus on Tests and T20Is, Akram remarked, \"Him deciding that he is retiring from one-day cricket is quite sad but I agree with him. Even as a commentator one-day cricket is just a drag now, especially after T20. I can imagine as a player. 50 overs, 50 overs, then you have to pre-game, post-game, the lunch game.\" \"T20 is kind of easier, four hours the game is over. In the leagues all around the world, there is a lot more money -- I suppose this is part and parcel of modern cricket. T20 or Test cricket. One-day cricket is kind of dying.\" \"It is quite tiring for a player to play one-day cricket. After T20, one-day cricket seems it is going on for days. So players are focusing on the shorter format. And longer format obviously (with) Test cricket.\" Despite T20 cricket having tons of fan-following and pushing ODI cricket out of the limelight, Akram, who picked 414 wickets in 104 Tests, still believes that Test cricket is the most prominent format of the game as this is where legends of the game are made. \"There's a battle within the battle in Test cricket. I always preferred Test matches. One-day used to be fun but Test matches were where you were recognised as a player where people still pick you for the world XIs.\" \"OK money matters -- I understand where they are coming from -- but they should also remember (Test cricket) if they want to be recognised as one of the greats of the game,\" he said.","pubDate":"2022-07-21 07:54:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"NZ's Bracewell continues dream run","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/nzs-bracewell-continues-dream-run-c-7599529","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Writers"],"video_url":null,"description":"Michael Bracewell has snared a hat-trick in his maiden over in T20 cricket to continue his rise in the international game.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-21 07:25:18","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-7599529/63b15c23c0d363ee62cd5bbc8b3e7f266ea1a6e4-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Ben Stokes deciding to retire from ODIs is quite..': Wasim Akram has his SAY on future of one-day cricket","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ben-stokes-deciding-to-retire-from-odis-is-quite-wasim-akram-has-his-say-on-future-of-one-day-cricket-2487949.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England all-rounder Ben Stokes sent shockwaves in the cricketing world with the news of him retiring from the ODIs.

It was a special win as it came after 28 years at the Mecca of Cricket, the Lord’s in London.On a pitch that had a considerable grass covering, England captain Alastair Cook won the toss and elected to bowl first. The Indian batters found it tough on the surface that had excessive assistance to the bowlers. However, Ajinkya Rahane stood tall and slammed a sensational 103 runs off 154 deliveries to help India post a competitive 295 runs.England responded with 319 runs and they were propelled by a ton by Gary Balance. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the bowlers for India as he took a six-wicket haul. The pitch had dried out over the three days and in the second innings, India were far better as they scored 342 runs.

Perth Scorchers won the title last year by defeating Sydney Sixers in the final. The BBL has always been criticized for the lack of international stars. It has been seen that the big names have not been a part of the BBL in the past, and some of them have been available for just a couple of games. The main Australian players also stay busy during the course of the BBL. To overcome the issue, the BBL will have its first-ever international draft for the upcoming season. Players like Faf du Plessis, Rashid Khan, DJ Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Colin Munro, etc have already registered for the international draft. On 21 July, the weighed lottery of the BBL international draft took place.

The right-hander shared a 219-run third-wicket partnership with Tom Alsop (135; 277 balls; 15×4) and battled through the scorching heat that swept the entire country.

There have been calls to drop him from the national team but Ponting, who captained Australia to two World Cup triumphs in 2003 and 2007, says that if he was India, he would keep pushing Kohli to get his confidence back. \"If you leave Virat out of the eve of the World Cup, and someone comes in and has a reasonable tournament, it will be hard for Virat to get back in it,\" Ponting said in the latest episode of The ICC Review. \"If I was India, I would keep pushing with him, because I know the upside. If they actually get him back confident and playing as well as he can, that upside is better than most. So I think if I was a captain or a coach around the Indian set up, I would be making life as easy as possible for him to feel as comfortable as possible, and just wait for him to flick the switch and start scoring runs again,\" he added. The Australian great also suggested selectors must find a spot for Kohli in India's top-order and commit to leaving the champion batter there for the entirety of the T20 World Cup, with the hope he finds his best form during the knockout stages of the tournament. \"Early in the tournament, for a first-round game, (it's important to) get him in nice and early, among the runs, and then hopefully by the end of the tournament you'll have Virat Kohli back at his best,\" he said. \"That's the way I would look at it. I wouldn't think about holding him back at the start of the tournament, with the thought that you might be able to bring him back towards the back end and have him peak. Tournament play isn't like that. \"You need to work your way into the tournament, get some runs under your belt, and get some confidence and then be playing your best cricket at the back end,\" he added.

After getting injured on the tour of West Indies , the 32-year-old pacer missed the IPL 2022, where he was due to represent Lucknow Super Giants and has been out of action until recently. \"I'm struggling to be honest. I need another operation unfortunately. I played that club cricket game for Ashington, which was basically a test.

England start their three-match T20 programme with South Africa in Chelmsford on Thursday holding an unassailable 8-2 lead in the multi-format series, but the skipper is already thinking about the impact playing at the Commonwealth Games could have for the sport as a whole. Knight's side swept the ODI matches 3-0 and South Africa can only level the series by producing their own T20 whitewash, with the action beginning live on Sky Sports Cricket & Main Event on Thursday from 6.30pm. But women's cricket will be involved at the Commonwealth Games for the first time at Birmingham, with the tournament due to get under way on July 29, and Knight believes it is a \"game-changer\". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Knight said: \"It is a chance for us as a sport to reach some people we haven't reached before. A huge stage to show what we can do. \"The platform to reach so many people is there, so our job is to be successful and show the skills that we have. \"It's massive how much women's cricket has changed and this could be another game-changer in terms of reaching new people and a different level.\" A men's cricket competition was held at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, with South Africa taking gold by beating Australia in the final. The only Olympic cricket competition was at Paris 1900 when only two countries took part and Great Britain overcame hosts France to win gold. July 21, 2022, 6:30pm Live on Asked if cricket could become part of the Olympics, Knight said: \"Potentially. Long after I've retired it might well happen. \"I think T20 would be the format, like it is in the Commonwealths, and the conversation would have to be had about schedules. \"There's a lot in the schedule and something would have to give to get it in there with other events going on. \"The balance needs to be found and (the women's game) does allow for that. \"The men are slightly different. I look at the schedules they have and wonder, 'How do they be a human being as well as a cricketer?'. \"But I see no reason why it can't happen, especially for it to open up a different audience for cricket around the world.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player England have named the same 15-player squad for the South Africa series and the Commonwealth Games, with Knight saying the thought of playing at a multi-games event has given her \"goosebumps\". \"It is something completely different,\" said Knight, who wants to attend athletics' 100m finals or cycling's road races in Birmingham if her schedule allows. \"We went to kitting out the other day and it was a brand new experience. \"To see pictures of outstanding athletes on the wall who have competed for Team England got the goosebumps going. \"It made the girls realise how different it was going to be and excited for what's to come.\" Teenagers Alice Capsey and Freya Kemp are among those in a youthful-looking T20 squad, with experienced opener Tammy Beaumont the notable omission. Beaumont, a veteran of 99 T20 internationals, responded to her omission by hammering 119 from 107 balls in England's third ODI victory against South Africa on Monday. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Knight said: \"I knew she would get a hundred, knowing Tammy's character she would have wanted to prove a point. \"Tammy's ODI form is undisputable.

Continuing in his position, weightlifting national coach Vijay Sharma is feeling bullish about his two teams' chances of creating history again. View this post on InstagramA post shared by Saikhom Mirabai Chanu (@mirabai_chanu)The team is without three gold medallists from Gold Coast but it has little bearing on the unit which boasts of several star performers at the Commonwealth level.With a major rule change of allowing just one weightlifter per nation for each weight category from this Games, India look well set to script history as the 15-member squad also includes most of the faces from last year's Commonwealth Weightlifting Championships. The event held in Tashkent last December saw lifters claim 16 medals (including four gold) to finish second behind Canada in the medals tally.\"We have a very strong squad for the Commonwealth Games,\" coach Vijay Sharma told Firstpost from Birmingham. \"We will be fighting for 11 to 12 medals. The men’s team is, in fact, in better shape than the woman’s team this year. The men’s team has the stronger chances of winning a medal but preparation-wise, both the teams are ready, rest will see on the day.\"Mirabai Chanu massive gold medal favouriteOlympic star Mirabai Chanu, who won silver and gold in 2014 and 2018 respectively, is a massive favourite to claim gold in 49kg category as her Tokyo results of lifting 202 kgs (87kgs in snatch and 115 in clean and jerk) puts her head and shoulders above of the rest of her rivals.Coach Sharma said for Mirabai, who didn't compete in Tashkent last December, CWG is merely a preparatory event as they work on her weaknesses in the snatch category.\"There’s not much pressure on Mirabai for this competition. She is capable of defeating them all in Birmingham if you compare the performances. We are here to improve on our weaknesses and that has been the snatch segment. If we improve on that here we will be in a better position to compete at World Championship event later in Colombia (November-December),\" Sharma said.\"Now we are not really thinking about peaking because it’s a long period for Olympic qualifiers. Last time at Olympics, it was the snatch that kept us away from gold and we want to strengthen that and want to be in the gold medal fight.\"Mirabai was on par with China's Olympic champion Hou Zhihui in the clean and jerk segment in Tokyo. The Indian lifted just a kg less than the Chinese (116kgs), who also set the Olympic record in the segment. However, in snatch, Mirabai fell short by 7kgs to the 25-year-old Chinese, who lifted 94kgs for another Games record. The Chinese also holds the world record of 96kgs.This will be Mirabai's first major event since the Olympics and the second overall as the 27-year-old lifter competed in Khelo India senior national ranking women’s weightlifting tournament in Himachal in June, where she lifted 191kg (86 + 105 kgs) for the gold.Coach admitted that they tried to improve Mirabai's national record of 88kg in snatch at the event but couldn't succeed and will aim to achieve that next week in Birmingham.\"Earlier we didn’t have time to work on her technique but now we were able to work on our weaknesses. We played a tournament in Kangra and we were trying to break the national record there but we didn’t succeed (88kgs her personal best in the snatch). Post that, we worked more on the snatch and now we will be aiming to improve the national record in Birmingham,\" he said.Youth Olympic star Jeremy Lalrinnunga and others in focusAmong other big names, 2018 Youth Olympic gold medallist Jeremy Lalrinnunga will be aiming for his second major senior medal in the 67 kg category. Lalrinnunga is the favourite for the gold as the 19-year-old boy from Mizoram leads the Commonwealth rankings with his gold-winning effort of 305kg (141 + 164 kgs) in Tashkent and it gives him at least a 10kg edge over the No. 2.Jeremy's road to the gold medal was made easier by the doping suspension of six Pakistani lifters in April, which included his category rival and earlier gold favourite Talha Talib, who finished a creditable fifth at the Olympics.Jeremy recovered from his prolonged knee injury from last year and his gold medal at the Commonwealth Championships brought the much-needed confidence back.\"Jeremy is surely a gold medal contender, we are feeling strongly about his chances. CWG will be important for him to get himself back in the game as he had a long battle with his knee and other injuries. But he has recovered well now and his performance has improved as well,\" coach Vijay said.Achinta Seuli (73kg), Ajay Singh (81kg) and Lovpreet Singh (109kg) and Gurdeep Singh (109kg-plus) are among the other men's gold medal contenders.20-year-old Achinta's 316kg (143 + 173 kgs) lift in Tashkent gives him a strong edge over his Malaysian No. 2 rival Muhammad Erry Hidayat in the 73kg category while Ajay Singh's 322 kg (147 + 175 kg) effort puts him in a neck-to-neck battle with Canada's Nicolas Vachon for the top honour. Lovpreet and Gurdeep, on the other hand, will have to massively improve their clean and jerk in the heavyweight category for the gold. Gurdeep may also script history by becoming the first plus category lifter to win medal at CWG.Gururaja Poojary {265kg (117 + 148)} will also be in an even battle for a silver medal with Papua New Guinea's veteran weightlifter Morea Baru in the 61kg category. However, beating Malaysia's Muhamad Aznil Bidin to the gold will require special effort.\"Apart from Jeremy, Achinta Seuli, Ajay Singh will fight for gold among men. We are hopeful of a medal in the plus category as well and that’s big because we never won a medal in that category as well but Gurdeep Singh in capable of fighting for gold and silver medal this time,\" said the coach.As far as the rest of the women's team is concerned, coach Sharma made an attempt to maximise the medal chances for India by adding Jhilli Dalabehara to the 49kg category and moving Mirabai to 55kg for the CWG. However, International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) rules of allowing an athlete to compete in his/her best category, coupled with the one athlete per nation rule, meant Jhilli had to sit out of the squad.The women's squad still has the likes of Sorokhaibam Bindyarani Devi (55kg), Punam Yadav (76kg), Purnima Pandey (87-plus kg) among major medal prospects.Bindyarani, who grabbed silver in Tashkent, has a similar weakness as Mirabai in snatch and that could prove pivotal in her gold conquest against Nigeria's Adijat Adenike Olarinoye. She lifted 198kg (84 +114) last December and will have to gain a whopping six kgs in snatch to match her Nigerian rival.\"Bindya is weak in her snatch as well but she still is a strong medal contender. Our main contender in the category is the Nigerian girl, who has lifted six kgs more than Bindya (90kgs), which is a huge gap. So we are trying to reduce that as much as possible,\" said Sharma.India's chances in the 59 and 71 kg category are slim and 64kg is the only category that will have no representation from the country. For Punam {220kg (98 + 122)}, it will be a straight fight against England's Emily Muskett for the silver medal as her rival has lifted just two kgs more than her in the clean and jerk category.Similar to Gurdeep, Purnima {229kg (102 +127)} will have a shot at winning India's first medal in the women's plus category but must see off stiff competition from England's Olympic silver medallist Emily Campbell and Australia's 2018 CWG runner-up Charisma Amoe-Tarrant.\"Purnima Pandey will have to create history because India have never won a medal in the category. She also will face a tough fight from her English rival, who also won a medal at the Olympics but I am hopeful of at least a bronze in the category,\" Sharma concluded.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Many former cricketers and administrators have commented on the future of the format and how it is finding difficult to stay relevant. Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram too has voiced his concerns and backed Stokes' decision to retire from ODIs.“Him deciding that he is retiring from one-day cricket is quite sad but I agree with him. Even as a commentator one-day cricket is just a drag now, especially after T20. I can imagine as a player. 50 overs, 50 overs, then you have to pre-game, post-game, the lunch game.\"T20 is kind of easier, four hours the game is over. The leagues all around the world, there is a lot more money - I suppose this is part and parcel of the modern cricket. T20 or Test cricket. One-day cricket is kind of dying.“It is quite tiring for a player to play one-day cricket. After T20, one-day cricket seems it is going for days. So players are focussing on more shorter format. And longer format obviously [with] Test cricket,” Wasim Akram said while speaking on The Telegraph's Vaughany and Tuffers Cricket Club podcast.Akram feels there is an immediate need to look into the format as filling the stadiums during a one-day game is going to be a challenge.“I think so. In England you have full houses. In India, Pakistan especially, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, one-day cricket you are not going to fill the stadiums.\"“They are doing it just for the sake of doing it. After the first 10 overs, it’s just ‘OK, just go a run a ball, get a boundary, four fielders in and you get to 200, 220 in 40 overs’ and then have a go last 10 overs. Another 100. It’s kind of run-of-the-mill,” said Akram.The legendary cricketer picked Tests as his favourite format.“There’s a battle within the battle in Test cricket,” he said. “I always preferred Test matches. One-day used to be fun but Test matches were where you were recognised as a player where people still pick you for the world XIs. OK money matters - I understand where they are coming from - but they should also remember if they want to be recognised as one of the greats of the game,” said Akram.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Her best throw of 59.60 metres carried her into the medal match.Rani, who had finished eighth at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, was placed in Group B and started with a foul throw. She then registered a throw of 55.35 metres which wouldn't have been enough to move into the final. But she went better in the third and final attempt to book her spot in the 12-women final.The 59.60m throw wasn't enough to get an automatic qualification spot. The benchmark was set at 62.50m with three athletes breaching that mark. Rest of the nine athletes qualified by way of being the best performers.Haruka Kitaguchi of Japan qualified top with a throw of 64.32m followed by China's Shiying Liu (63.86m) and Lithuania's Liveta Jasiunaite (63.80m). All three set their season best marks in the process.With her 59.60m effort and a place in the World Championships final, Annu Rani has seemingly put her disappointment at Tokyo Olympics behind her. Last year at the Summer Games, the national record holder had finished 14th from 15 athletes to not make the cut from qualifying. Then her best throw was a mere 54.40 metres.Leading up to the World Athletics Championships, she was in good form.

The month of July 2022 has seen the issue of hectic scheduling in cricket and prioritisation of franchise T20 leagues being reignited. South Africa chose to pull out of a three-match ODI series against Australia in January 2023 to ensure their players would be available for the upcoming new domestic T20 competition in the country. Earlier this week, England's Test skipper and all-rounder Ben Stokes announced his retirement from ODI cricket after the first match against South Africa at the age of 31, citing the \"unsustainable\" workload by playing in all three formats. With speculations coming that the upcoming Future Tours Programme (FTP) for the 2023-27 cycle will have more of T20I action, Shastri, currently in United Kingdom as a member of the Sky Sports commentary team, feels that bilateral T20Is should be reduced by a huge amount to free up the hectic international calendar. \"I would be a little careful of the number of bilateral splits, especially in T20 cricket. There's a lot of franchise cricket which can be encouraged, whichever country it's in - India, West Indies, or Pakistan. You play less bilaterals and then you get together for the World Cups. So, the emphasis on ICC World Cup events becomes paramount. Then people look forward to them,\" said Shastri in an episode of the Vaughany and Tuffers podcast. Shastri, a former India all-rounder and member of the 1983 Cricket World Cup winning team, further asked for creation of two divisions in Test cricket in a bid to safeguard the future of the longest format of the game. \"I think two tiers are needed, otherwise Test cricket will die in 10 years time. You need six teams at the top, and then six teams in the second and then you qualify. And those top six play against each other more often because of the corridor you open up by having less bilateral T20 cricket and just franchise cricket.

India and the struggle against left-arm seamers continues. The Men in Blue have found going tough against left-arm quicks and the top-order comprising of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli struggled in the recently concluded ODI series vs England. Former India opener Wasim Jaffer feels \"this is one area I feel Indian batters need to improve\".“Talking from India’s batting perspective, they need to improve how they play left-arm seamers. That has been a concern, including Trent Boult, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Reece Topley probably in the series. That is one box they need to tick, where they are getting some Indian bowlers to bowl them in the nets. That has been a concern, when the ball gets old it’s fine but those bowlers have troubled the Indian batters. This is one area I feel Indian batters need to improve going forward,\" Jaffer told News18.Jaffer's views were echoed by former England captain Nasser Hussain who, in a chat with Sony Sports Network, highlighted the moments India batters struggled against left-arm seamers.“They need to play to left arm [pace bowling] a little bit better. History tells you that Shaheen Shah Afridi blew them away one evening in Dubai, Mohammad Amir blew them away one afternoon at the Oval in a final, and Reece Topley has blown them away here [at Old Trafford].“They need to be a bit more tensed to their batting so some of their seamers will come down in a T20, in the last two overs with 20 to win. One of those seamers will need them to get across the line,” Hussain added.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

(Owen Humphreys/PA via AP) England opener Jason Roy turns a year older today. The right-handed batter has proved indispensable to his side in the limited-overs format and played an important part in securing their maiden World Cup win in 2019. Roy was born on 21 July 1990 in South Africa’s Durban. His family shifted to England when he was 10. He soon made his mark for Surrey and was noticed by the selectors. His aggressive strokeplay led him to make his way into the T20I team against India in 2014. The next year, the swashbuckling opener made his ODI debut. He was one of the stars of England’s 2019 World Cup campaign, where he stunned onlookers with his fiery performances. As Jason Roy turns 32, here is a look at some of his best performances: 180 vs Australia (2018): The England opener put up a double-century stand with Joe Root in the first Australia-England ODI at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. After the hosts put up a target of 304 courtesy Aaron Finch’s ton, it was Jason Roy’s sublime knock that guided England to a 5-wicket win. The right-handed batter also slammed the highest individual score at the MCG, as well as the highest score by an England batter, and was awarded the player of the match for his innings. 162 vs Sri Lanka (2016): Roy once again won the player of the match for his match winning knock of 162 runs. The opener slammed bowlers all over the park for 3 sixes and 13 fours before he was dismissed by Nuwan Pradeep. His blistering innings is the joint-fourth highest score by an English batter in ODIs. 153 vs Bangladesh (2019): In the 2019 World Cup campaign, Jason Roy steered his side to victory against Bangladesh. The opener’s 153-run knock helped England reach a mammoth total of 386 against the Mushfiqur Rahim-led side. Roy’s blistering knock was studded with boundaries - 14 fours and 5 sixes. England then romped to a 106-run victory due to Jofra Archer and Ben Stokes picking up 3 wickets each. 114 vs Pakistan (2019): In the Trent Bridge ODI, the right-handed opener led his side to a thrilling victory. After Babar Azam helped the visitors put up 340 on the scoreboard, Roy and Ben Stokes took up the mantle of steering their side to a win. For his 114 off 123 deliveries, the opener was once again awarded the player of the match. 101* vs Netherlands (2022): Jason Roy slammed his first ODI century since the 2019 World Cup in 86 deliveries. He put up an unbroken 163-run stand with Jos Buttler to clinch victory in just 30.1 overs. The blazing partnership between the two batters led England to a 3-0 clean sweep in the series.
