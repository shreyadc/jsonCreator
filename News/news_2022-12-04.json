It has been learnt that Shami had suffered the injury during a training session after he returned from Australia, where the Indian team made a semifinal exit from the T20 World Cup. Shami could also miss the upcoming two-Test series, beginning in Chittagong from December 14. “Fast bowler Mohd. Shami sustained a shoulder injury during a training session in the lead up to the ODI series against Bangladesh. He is currently under the supervision of the BCCI Medical Team at the NCA, Bengaluru and will not be able to take part in the three-match series. The All-India Senior Selection Committee has named Umran Malik as Shami’s replacement,” BCCI Secretary Jay Shah said in a press release. The extent of Shami’s injury is not known yet. Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur, Deepak Chahar, Umran Malik and Kuldeep Sen will form the pace attack for the three-match ODI series against Bangladesh. The 33-year-old Shami is an integral part of India’s ODI scheme of things, going into the World Cup next year. Skipper Rohit Sharma and head coach Rahul Dravid would be worried if the Bengal speedster misses the Test series because India need to win every game to stay in contention for the upcoming World Test Championship final at the Oval in June. “Shami’s absence from three ODI games is definitely a factor but bigger worry is his likely absence from Tests where he is supposed to spearhead the attack in Jasprit Bumrah’s absence,” said a BCCI source. Shami has taken 216 wickets in Test cricket from 60 matches. Umran Malik is one of the fastest bowlers in world cricket. He made his ODI debut recently in New Zealand where he played two games and claimed two wickets. —PTI Umran Malik replaces injured Shami in ODI series against Bangladesh added by Press Trust of India on 1:13 am December 4, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-03 19:43:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SRM Welkin School beat Burn Hall School in summit clash","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/12/04/srm-welkin-school-beat-burn-hall-school-in-summit-clash/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["KR Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"SRINAGAR: SRM Welkin School, Sopore beat Burn Hall School in the finals of “Khadijah memorial champions trophy” played here on Saturday.

Pakistan reached 499-7 in its first innings on the lifeless wicket and still trailed by 158 runs at stumps on the third day with play again ending early because of fading light. Captain Babar Azam (136), Imam-ul-Haq (121) and Abdullah Shafique (114) all hit tons on a run-friendly wicket which even Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ramiz Raja feels is not a great advert for Test cricket. But England hit back after tea when Ollie Robinson broke the 123-run stand between Babar and debutant Saud Shakeel (37). Robinson found the outside edge of Shakeel’s bat and Babar, who hit 19 fours and a six in his eighth hundred, played a cut against offspinner Will Jacks (3-132). Veteran James Anderson (1-47) used all his 175-test experience on an unresponsive wicket for the bowlers, before finally he got his first wicket in his 19th over when Mohammad Rizwan (29) was caught at short mid-wicket. Babar and Shakeel denied England success in the middle session and guided Pakistan to 411-3 by tea with the Pakistan skipper dominating both spin and pace. Babar was the seventh batter in three days to notch a hundred in England’s first test in Pakistan in 17 years after the visitors had posted 657 all out on the back of hundreds from England openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett, Harry Brook and Ollie Pope. Babar used his feet well against the spinners and raised his half century off 68 balls when he lifted Jack Leach (2-160) over wide mid-on for a six after lunch. He reached his hundred off 126 balls when he thumped a backfoot cover-driven boundary. Earlier, Imam and Shafique struck centuries after Pakistan resumed on 181-0 before throwing away their wickets. Azhar Ali (27) got a life when Crawley couldn’t grasp a difficult chance at leg slip against Anderson before he was trapped leg before wicket by Leach after England took the second new ball im mediately after 80 overs. Left-handed Imam, who made centuries in each innings during the drawn test against Australia in March at the same venue, scored 121 off 207 balls. Shafique, a centurion in the same test against Australia, hit a more conventional 114 off 203 balls. It was the first time in test history that openers from both teams had scored centuries in the first innings. Only 14 wickets fell over five days on a similar type of pitch when Australia last played at the Pindi Cricket Stadium and the wicket was rated as “below average” by ICC match referee Ranjan Madugalle. The pitch received one demerit point as a result. Shafique completed his 100 off 177 balls with a single after lofting Joe Root for a six on the legside before Imam also reached the milestone with a flicked boundary off Root. With the wicket doing little for the England spinners, Imam threw away his wicket by unnecessarily going for a big shot against Leach and holed out at long on. Leach then trapped Azhar lbw on the back foot at the stroke of lunch. —PTI 1st Test,Day-3: Pakistan reaches 499-7, still trails England by 158 runs added by Press Trust of India on 1:12 am December 4, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-03 19:42:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Argentina vs Australia LIVE SCORE: Lionel Messi and Co aim to seal FIFA World Cup quarter-final berth","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/fifa-world-cup-2022-live-score-argentina-vs-australia-football-match-latest-updates-11746761.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"Argentina vs Australia LIVE SCORE: Lionel Messi and Co aim to seal FIFA World Cup quarter-final berth","content":"Argentina vs Australia LIVE SCORE: Lionel Messi and Co aim to seal FIFA World Cup quarter-final berth Argentina vs Australia, FIFA World Cup LIVE SCORE: Hello and welcome to our LIVE coverage of the FIFA World Cup 2022 round of 16 match between Argentina and Australia that will happen in Al Rayyan.

FIFA World Cup: Fixtures | Results | Points Table | Squads | Records The two sides have faced each other a grand total of five times, though none of those matches have occurred in a World Cup; all of them being international friendlies. The Netherlands have won four of those five games, the first of which took place in 1998, while the United States won the most recent meeting between the two in 2015. Both teams went through the group stages unbeaten; three-time World Cup runners-up Netherlands defeated Senegal and hosts Qatar, both 2-0 wins, and played out a 1-1 draw against Ecuador. The United States, who reached the semi-finals in the inaugural edition in 1930 and have progressed beyond the Round of 16 just once (2002) since then, started off with back-to-back draws against Wales (1-1) and England (0-0) before a 38th-minute goal by Christian Pulisic helped them beat Iran 1-0 and secure their place in the last 16. Group C toppers Argentina will go up against Group D runners-up Australia in the second Round of 16 fixture scheduled on Saturday, the match kicking off at 10 pm local time (12.30 am IST).

So, bowlers and fielders are searching for replacements to shine the ball with some of them coming up with innovative and bizarre ideas to achieve it. However, the most hilarious method was opted for by England’s Joe Root during the first Test against Pakistan at the Pindi Cricket Stadium. While Pakistan was batting in the second innings, Root was spotted rubbing the ball on the head of his teammate Jack Leach who is partially bald. “Absolutely ingenious!” Root finds a unique way of shining the ball with the help of Leach 🤝😅 #PAKvENG | #UKSePK pic.twitter.com/mYkmfI0lhK — Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) December 3, 2022 A clip of the funny sight was shared by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on their official Twitter handle. The video shows Root walking to the crease during a break between two overs. Much to the amusement of the cricketing fraternity, the English batting great approached Leach and went on to remove the cap from the spinner’s head. Then he polished the ball on his scalp for some time before putting the cap on Leach’s head again. The moment caught the attention of commentator Nasser Hussain and he was left in splits. David Gower, who was also in the box accompanying Hussain, termed Root’s surprising move “classic and ingenious.” After providing his support to the team, Leach was seen heading back to the pavilion. Then, Root handed the ball to medium pacer Ollie Robson for the next over. Since being posted on the internet, the footage has received more than 1.5 lakh views on Twitter. So far, as many as 4,800 users have liked the England side’s “unique way of shining the ball.” A user named the incident “bald tempering.” Bald tempering 👩🏼‍🦲🏏 — Ali Kiyani (@azkiyani) December 3, 2022 A person noted, “Nothing is useless in this world, not even baldness.” Nothin is useless in this world not even baldness.. 😉 — Nomadic soul 💙 (@LostSoul190179) December 3, 2022 An individual said, “When cricket experience meets life experience.” When cricket experience meets life experience 😂 — Ehtisham (@Ehtisham4226995) December 3, 2022 Here are some other reactions: Necessary is the mother of invention 😜 — Musafir (@Baiguuu) December 3, 2022 This is mocking on this terrible historical pitch — playa (@umerufsid) December 3, 2022 Nasser; Don’t look at my direction 😂😭 — 07🇵🇰 (@zainabjavedm20) December 3, 2022 In the first innings, England put on a brilliant batting effort, scoring 657 runs with four batters hammering commendable centuries. With Pakistan’s openers Abdullah Shafique (114) and Imam-ul-Haq (121) putting up a 225-run stand for the first wicket, the hosts are also building up a strong counter attack. Pakistan’s excellent batting display continued on Day 3 of the Test in Rawalpindi, while England are still trying to find more effective ways to pick up wickets on the batting-friendly surface.

This was his second brilliant season on the trot as he had scored 603 runs, again with four hundreds, in five matches of the 2021/22 edition of India’s premier List A tournament.Gaikwad’s stature in List A is growing with every innings and after an ordinary run in the editions preceding 2021, he has never looked back. Averaging over 60 in the format, the best in the business, the right-hander continues to score truckloads of runs. He had a brilliant run with Chennai Super Kings in the 2020 and 2021 editions where he accumulated 204 runs (six innings) and 635 runs (16 innings) respectively. His consistency in the IPL and domestic circuit earned him the India T20I cap in the away series against Sri Lanka in 2021 and the ODI cap came his way in the 2022 home series against South Africa.Ten games (nine T20Is and one ODI) for India weren’t ideal and an ill-timed injury forced him out of the reckoning. Now, the 25-year-old finds himself on the road to come back into the senior team. He has responded in fine fashion with a daddy Vijay Hazare Trophy season but the India call could take longer than expected. There’s a traffic jam of sorts in the Indian cricket team as far as the openers are concerned and it’s going to be a very happy headache for the incoming set of selectors.Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, and KL Rahul are already there and you have someone like Shubman Gill, who has been mighty impressive in the limited opportunities he has got. Already waiting in the wings are Prithvi Shaw and Yashasvi Jaiswal. Both Mumbai openers have not put a foot wrong in the domestic circuit and continue to score runs across formats. In such a scenario, Gaikwad’s wait could get long but he has definitely taken giant strides forward with a brilliant show in the knockouts. Ask any former cricketer/coach/selector and they would put a hundred in the knockouts right up there, and Gaikwad has three, on the trot!The right-hander’s temperament in big games has been second to none and his ability to switch gears has been effortless. All his hundreds could be broken into two contrasting knocks. Watchful vs pace, explosive vs spin and all-out once the eye are in. He was made to work hard by a very disciplined Saurashtra attack which also induced plenty of false strokes from the right-hander in the final. But Gaikwad was ready for the battle and wanted to bat right till the end. Just when the fireworks were expected, a miscommunication with the partner ended Gaikwad’s stay in the middle. Had he stayed longer, it could have been a different story for Maharashtra who ended as runners-up this year.Intense competitionSample this. Yashasvi Jaiswal has hit two hundreds and two fifties in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, averages nearly 54 in the format, scored a big FC hundred (145) for India A vs Bangladesh A, and also had 266 runs from nine innings in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. It was a frustrating List A season as far as Shaw is concerned as the explosive right-hander failed to convert the starts he got. He, however, was in the zone in the SMAT and scored 322 runs in ten games at a strike-rate of 180+.The 2020/21 Vijay Hazare Trophy was a big one for Shaw as he scored 827 runs in 8 innings, and also hit four hundreds. Next on the list, that year was the very talented southpaw from Bengaluru Devdutt Padikkal who scored 737 runs from 7 innings. He also hit four hundreds that year. Gentle reminder: He too is an opener.And, then you have someone like Shubman Gill. In the 15 ODIs he has played for the country, the classy right-hander has scored 687 runs at an average of 57.25 and hit a hundred and four fifties. Surprisingly, his name didn’t feature in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh series as selectors made way for returning senior pros Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul.Next few months are very crucial for the Indian cricket team, especially in the white ball set-up, as the team would look to put the blueprint in place for next year’s 50-over World Cup and the T20 World Cup in 2024. With how the players are performing in their opportunities with the Indian team and in the domestic circuit, the selectors and management are in for a hard time, and Ruturaj Gaikwad has only made it harder for them. ","pubDate":"2022-12-03 13:14:37","image_url":"https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/380x285/fixed/jpg/2022/11/Ruturaj-Gaikwad-Vijay-Hazare-Trophy-double-ton-Twitter-1.jpg","source_id":"firstpost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Bangladesh: Injured Mohammed Shami shares emotional post after getting ruled out of ODIs","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/india-vs-bangladesh-injured-mohammed-shami-shares-emotional-post-after-getting-ruled-out-of-odis-11745571.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Bangladesh: Injured Mohammed Shami shares emotional post after getting ruled out of ODIs","content":"Cricket India vs Bangladesh: Injured Mohammed Shami shares emotional post after getting ruled out of ODIs Mohammed Shami has been ruled out of the ODI series against Bangladesh with a shoulder injury, which has also made his participation in the two-match Test series doubtful. FirstCricket Staff December 3rd, 2022 17:45:11 IST Injured India pacer Mohammed Shami receives treatment on his right shoulder. Image credit: Instagram/mdshami.11 Mohammed Shami vowed to “come back stronger” after getting ruled out of India’s upcoming three-match ODI series in Bangladesh due to a shoulder injury. The senior India pacer, who had replaced Jasprit Bumrah in the T20 World Cup squad, is also doubtful for the two-match Test series that takes place right after the ODIs. A statement from the BCCI confirmed that Shami had picked up the injury during a training session and is currently under supervision of the BCCI medical team at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru. “Injury, in general, teaches you to appreciate every moment. I’ve had my share of injuries throughout my career. It’s humbling. It gives you perspective. “No matter how many times I’ve been hurt, I’ve learned from that injury and come back even more stronger,” Shami wrote in a post on Instagram in which he also thanked his fans for their love and support. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mohammad Shami , محمد الشامي (@mdshami.11) Shami has been replaced in the Indian ODI squad by Jammu and Kashmir quick Umran Malik, who made his ODI debut in the tour of New Zealand. Malik, who plies his trade for the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League, was engaged in a memorable pace battle with New Zealand speedster Lockie Ferguson and hit express speeds of up to 153kmph during the series, which India lost 1-0. Several seniors were rested for the tour of New Zealand that took place right after the T20 World Cup with Hardik Pandya and Shikhar Dhawan leading the Men in Blue in the T20Is and ODIs respectively. The Bangladesh tour however, witnesses regular skipper Rohit Sharma return to action along with vice-captain KL Rahul and batting superstar Virat Kohli.

Somya Kapoor December 3rd, 2022 14:26:13 IST India will be taking on Bangladesh in first ODI in Dhaka. (Photo Source: BCB) The auditions for the next year’s ODI World Cup have started with the team management roping in some new faces alongside the experienced campaigners. India haven’t been able to win an ICC Trophy since 2013 (barring the Asia Cup) and the wait extended after they bowed out of the T20 World Cup following a thumping defeat to England. The team did face a lot of heat on social media and from the fans. But let bygones be bygones. It’s time for the unit to move on and focus on the big tournament scheduled to take place in India next year. After the T20 World Cup was over, the Men in Blue travelled to New Zealand for a three-match T20I series and as many ODIs. The senior players like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli were rested from both the series while Hardik Pandya led the side in T20Is and Shikhar Dhawan donned the captain’s hat in ODIs. Snapshots from #TeamIndia ‘s first training session in Bangladesh ahead of the three-match ODI series. #BANvIND 📸 – BCB pic.twitter.com/AXncaYWeup — BCCI (@BCCI) December 2, 2022 The visitors clinched the T20I series while suffering a defeat in the ODI assignment. But not much could be made out of them as we could have had results only in one T20I and one ODI after the tour was marred with rain. Moving forward, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul are back for the ODIs against Bangladesh. On the other side, some new faces like Rajat Patidar and Kuldeep Sen have also travelled with the side to the neighbouring nation. What’s in the kitty? Well, the first answer to this is — a happy headache, especially in the batting department. The team management has three experienced batters in Rohit, Dhawan and KL to take the openers’ spot while Shreyas Iyer who has been in sublime form in ODIs is likely to take the number four position. Now, if the team management wants to accommodate Rahul then Dhawan will have to sit out as the visitors are most likely to go in with six bowlers. Dhawan went in with five bowlers against New Zealand in the first ODI and it backfired, eventually resulting in India’s series loss. Keeping KL in the XI might not really go well with the fans as the right-handed batter hasn’t really been in the greatest of forms in the recent past. It would be interesting to see whether the management sticks to Rohit and KL or go back in time and hand the responsibility to one of the most successful duos of Sharma and Dhawan. Variety in bowling unit At present, the Indian bowling unit looks pretty stable despite Jasprit Bumrah and now Mohammed Shami missing out . Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur, Mohammed Siraj, Umran Malik (who has replaced Shami) and Kuldeep Sen make the pace bowling department while Washington Sundar, Axar Patel and Shahbaz Ahmed are the three spinners. While Chahar is a natural when it comes to swinging the ball, Siraj and Umran can rattle any opposition with their pace on a given day. Thakur has had a couple of disappointing outings recently but his knack for picking wickets at crucial stages is something that any team would vouch for. The three spinners that have travelled with the side also bring a lot to the table. While they would be handy with the ball, all the three are good batters too. It would again be interesting to see whether the young lad Shahbaz gets a go or the coach and the captain give Axar another chance. Patel didn’t really have a good time at the World Cup though. Sundar is in brilliant touch. He has the ability to bowl economical spells, pick crucial wickets and can chip in with runs at a brisk pace. At present, the six bowlers that might make it to the XI would be Chahar, Siraj, Shardul, Umran, Sundar and Axar.
