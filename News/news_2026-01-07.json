Ahead of the upcoming India vs New Zealand ODI series, the former India captain was seen politely declining an offer of Mumbai’s iconic street food, vada pav, from a fan during a training session in Mumbai.Viral Moment from Training SessionIn a video that has gone viral on social media, Rohit can be seen preparing for a training session when fans gathered nearby called out to him. One fan, speaking in Marathi, offered him a vada pav, long known as Rohit’s favourite snack.“Rohit bhaiya, vadapav pahije ka?” the fan asked.Rohit responded with a smile, waved his hand and clearly signalled a no, choosing discipline over indulgence. The moment quickly caught attention online, with fans praising his commitment to fitness.After the practice session ended, when Rohit Sharma came out, the fans jokingly said, \"Rohit bhaiya, vadapav pahije ka\" and Rohit just waved his hand and replied, \"No\" 😂❤️bRO always enjoy with his fans❤️ pic.twitter.com/euco1nvMqs— Rushiii45 (@rushiii_12) January 6, 2026Fitness First Ahead of International ReturnEver since retiring from Test cricket last year and shifting his full focus to ODIs, Rohit has been particularly careful about his diet and physical conditioning. After an impressive outing for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he is set to rejoin the Indian squad for the three-match ODI series against New Zealand.This is not the first time Rohit has turned down vada pav. A similar moment had occurred earlier during the Vijay Hazare Trophy, underlining a consistent approach to his fitness goals.A Revamped Rohit SharmaFormer India cricketer Abhishek Nayar had earlier revealed that Rohit significantly changed his eating habits and trained intensely ahead of the Australia tour last year. The results showed on the field, as Rohit finished 2025 as India’s second-highest run-getter after Virat Kohli, scoring 650 runs with two centuries and four fifties.With the first ODI against New Zealand scheduled for January 11, Rohit’s viral moment reflects a clear message: focus, fitness and form remain his top priorities.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["sports","news"],"creator":["bibhu prasad ray"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2026-01-06 15:48:00","pubDateTZ":"UTC","fetched_at":"2026-01-06 16:15:16","image_url":"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1280x960/odishatv/media/media_files/2026/01/06/rohit-sharma-2026-01-06-21-17-39.jpeg","video_url":null,"source_id":"odishatv","source_name":"Odisha Tv","source_priority":62016,"source_url":"https://odishatv.in","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/odishatv.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"008a2cc69b0f86f43afa1e4f3c88ce89","link":"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cql4dv4yxg9o","title":"When is the next Ashes series?","description":"Our Ask Me Anything team explore when the next Ashes series will be and what venues have been selected.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":null,"creator":["tasnim chowdhury"],"language":"english","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2026-01-06 15:44:21","pubDateTZ":"UTC","fetched_at":"2026-01-06 16:06:10","image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/3893/live/344a1930-eb14-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"bbc","source_name":"The Bbc","source_priority":1781,"source_url":"http://www.bbc.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/bbc.jpg","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"759efe1022bc304046806e40d5475f6f","link":"https://www.thedailyjagran.com/sports/indian-super-league-to-begin-february-14-all-clubs-to-take-part-sports-minister-mansukh-mandaviya-10290934","title":"Indian Super League To Begin February 14, All Clubs To Take Part: Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya","description":"Indian Super League,ISL 2025-26,Mansukh Mandaviya,AIFF,Kalyan Chaubey,I-League,Indian football,Football clubs India,Sports Minister India,Football tournament","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["football tournament","indian football","indian super league","i-league","sports minister india","kalyan chaubey","mansukh mandaviya","football clubs india","isl 2025-26","aiff"],"creator":["the daily jagran"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports","top"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2026-01-06 15:41:40","pubDateTZ":"UTC","fetched_at":"2026-01-06 16:08:24","image_url":"https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2026/01/06/article/image/ISL-1767714076685_v.webp","video_url":null,"source_id":"english_jagran","source_name":"Jagran English","source_priority":10561,"source_url":"https://english.jagran.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/english_jagran.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"8ca407be95d9c9e0219605505739eebf","link":"https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/stuart-broad-claims-yuvraj-singhs-six-sixes-saved-five-years-of-his-career-a-slap-on-the-face-article-153406501","title":"Stuart Broad Claims Yuvraj Singh's Six Sixes Saved Five Years Of His Career - 'A Slap On The Face'","description":"Stuart Broad reflected on Yuvraj Singh's six sixes in the 2007 T20 World Cup and claimed that it saved five years of his career.
