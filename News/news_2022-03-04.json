But with now 50% crowd being allowed into the stadium, the sounds of cheers and claps from the fans will be heard when Virat Kohli takes the field for his 100th Test, becoming the 12th Indian and 71st cricketer to achieve the landmark. Friday’s Test against Sri Lanka also marks Virat Kohli’s first appearance in Tests since leaving the captaincy after India lost 2-1 to South Africa in January. Though his returns with the bat (no century since November 2019) have invited concern and criticism in equal measure, there is no questioning that Kohli has been the backbone for India`s batting for a very long time. Though Kohli had a low-key Test debut in June 2011 against the West Indies in the backdrop of his stunning white-ball game, his desire to succeed and strive hard for excellence in the longest format of the game has resulted in him amassing 7962 runs in 99 matches at an average of 50.39, including seven double centuries. In his landmark Test, Kohli will be entering a new phase of his career: as the senior-most batter in the side with no demands of captaincy and chance to scale much greater peaks with a renewed mindset. Kohli’s landmark 100th Test also marks the start of Rohit Sharma’s stint as the Test captain of India. The hosts haven`t been on the losing side in home Tests since the 2-1 defeat to England in 2012 and will be hoping to extend their streak against a visiting Sri Lanka side. Apart from keeping the winning juggernaut rolling against Sri Lanka, India will have one eye on gaining some crucial World Test Championship (WTC) points, In the race to the final. India are in fifth place while Sri Lanka are the early topper of the table.

Marsh passed away surrounded by family in an Adelaide hospital at 6am on Friday morning, after suffering a heart attack in Bundaberg last Thursday. Tributes flowed in from around the world as the sporting community extended their condolences for the passing of a man seen as an “icon” of the sport. The current Test team awoke this morning in Rawalpindi to the news of Marsh’s passing as they prepared for day one of the historic first Test against Pakistan. “Rod was a colossal figure in Australian cricket who gave close to 50 years of incredible service to Australian cricket, from his debut in the Ashes series of 1970/71, through to his time as National Selector, when many of the current group of Australian men’s players came into close contact with him,” Cummins said. “He was brilliant to deal with because he knew the game inside-out, but also had a way of dealing with you to put you at your ease. Vale Rodney Marshâ¦love to Ros and the boysâ¦saddest of daysâ¦outstanding service to Australian cricketâ¦great team mateâ¦mention of his name makes me smileâ¦brilliant dig ðððððð “I, along with countless other people in Australia, grew up hearing the stories of him as a fearless and tough cricketer, but his swashbuckling batting and his brilliance behind the stumps over more than a decade made him one of the all-time greats of our sport, not just in Australia, but globally. “When I think of Rod I think of a generous and larger-than-life character who always had a life-loving, positive and relaxed outlook, and his passing leaves a massive void in the Australian cricket community. “My thoughts, and the thoughts of the entire tour party here in Pakistan, are with Rod’s wife Ros and their family at this terrible time.” Cricket Australia chairman Dr Lachlan Henderson said Marsh had made an enormous impact on the game. “This is a tremendously sad day for Australian cricket and for all those who loved and admired Rod Marsh,” Henderson said. “Rod will be forever remembered for the way he played the game and the pleasure he brought crowds as a member of some great Australian teams. ‘Caught Marsh, bowled Lillee’ has iconic status in our game. “Rod also made an enormous contribution to the game by identifying, coaching and mentoring many future stars in his various roles as coach and director at cricket academies in Australia and other cricket playing nations. “Our thoughts are with Rod’s wife Ros, his sons Paul, Dan and Jamie and the extended Marsh family, his many friends and teammates with whom he created so many special memories.” Marsh was 74 and will be remembered as an icon of the game, having played 96 Tests for Australia between 1970 and 1984 as one of the greatest wicket-keepers of all time. The caught Marsh bowled Lillee combination was the most famous double-act in cricket. Marsh had been in an induced coma after a couple of Queensland cricket locals revived him last week several minutes after he’d suffered a heart attack. After his playing career, Marsh continued to serve the game in many capacities, most recently as a national selector, and his cricket academy helped nurture dozens of Test players including Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer. Mark Waugh, who served as a selector alongside Marsh, was among the first to express his sincere condolences for the “icon”. “So incredibly sad to hear of the passing of Rod (Bacchus) Marsh an absolute icon of Aust cricket,” Waugh wrote on Twitter. “Had the pleasure of working with Rod for a number of years as a selector and you wouldn’t meet a more honest, down to earth, kind hearted person. RIP.” Australia’s women’s wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy received the news in New Zealand, where she is preparing for Saturday’s opening match of the ODI World Cup against England. “Oh man. Sad day. Sending all my love to the whole Marsh family xx,” Healy wrote on social media. The Marsh family released a statement on Friday morning, paying tribute to an “incredible husband, father and grandfather.” “On behalf of my mother Ros and brothers Dan and Jamie, it is with immense sadness that I advise that my father Rod passed away peacefully early this morning,” Paul Marsh said in a statement on behalf of the family. “He has been an incredible husband, father and grandfather and we have been so fortunate to have had him in all of our lives. “We are so grateful for all of the love and support our family has received from so many people over the last week. It has given us strength in the most difficult week of our lives. “Details for the funeral will be advised in due course.” Originally published as Australian cricket legend Rod Marsh passes away following heart attack To join the conversation, please log in.

I used to enjoy batting for long periods of time, try to win games for my team, or try to get a first-innings lead, which is the format we used to follow,” he said. “These are the things which reveal your true character. I just felt that Test cricket needed to stay alive, because this for me is real cricket,” Kohli said in the interview with the Indian cricket board. Kohli, 33, threw in the towel as India’s most successful Test leader with 40 wins and 17 losses in 68 Tests as captain. Under his leadership, India rose to top the Test rankings and stayed there for over three years, beating all comers at home and away including winning a series in Australia for the first time. But India failed to win any international tournaments, including last year’s inaugural World Test Championship, when they lost to New Zealand in the final. A few months later, Kohli quit as T20 captain after a disastrous World Cup that included a heavy defeat to arch-rivals Pakistan and failing to make it to the knock-out stage. He was then sacked as one-day captain and after publicly falling out with the head of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Saurav Ganguly resigned the Test captaincy in January following a series loss in South Africa. Rohit Sharma, who last month replaced Kohli as captain across all formats, was one of a string of players past and present to pay tribute to his predecessor on Thursday ahead of the landmark match. “As a Test team, we stand in very good position. If you look at the last five years of our Test cricket... the whole credit goes to Virat for getting us going in this particular format,” Rohit told reporters. “What he has done with the Test team was brilliant to see,” Rohit told reporters, saying he wanted to give Kohli a “special” victory over the visitors —- who have never won a Test in India. Sachin Tendulkar, who played 200 Tests for India, said in a video message to Kohli that it had been “fantastic” to watch him over the years. “Numbers will have their roles, but your real strength is being able to motivate the whole generation,” he said. “That’s been your real strength and your immense contribution to Indian cricket. That is something which I would say is your real success.” India’s coach Rahul Dravid said: “To be able to play one (Test) is great. To play 100 is a fantastic achievement. “It’s an achievement Virat Kohli can be very proud of. It’s a great achievement for one of India’s greatest players. Just looking at his fitness and looking at where he is, I think he has a lot more to go.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan blind clean sweep South Africa","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/938443-pakistan-blind-clean-sweep-south-africa","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KARACHI: Pakistan blind cricket team defeated South Africa by six wickets to seal the three-match ODI series 3-0 here at the Southend Club Stadium on Thursday.Pakistan chased the 253-run target in 29 overs after losing four wickets in the process.

The second rule of Australia's Women's Cricket World Cup campaign is not to talk about the last one. Meg Lanning's side have endured a five-year wait to avenge the biggest disappointment of their careers, and get the chance to do it this month in New Zealand. It is clear the last World Cup - won by hosts England in an upset triumph - has left scars. \"To be honest, we don't really talk about 2017 anymore,\" Lanning said this week in Christchurch. \"It obviously had a big impact on us but now it's a completely different group and we're on a new journey together.\" Alyssa Healy, who, like Lanning felt the pain of 2017's semi-final exit, is also not one for reminiscing. \"You can ask me about 2017 all you want. But I've wiped it from my brain,\" she tells AAP, only half-joking. Australia headed to England in 2017 as world No.1s and hot favourites, as they do this year. Alarm bells rang after Australia fell three runs short to the hosts in a group stage chase, giving England their first World Cup win over their arch-rivals in 24 years. Finishing second after the round-robin, Australia was then dumped out of the tournament by India in the semi-finals, when Harmanpreet Kaur's unbeaten 171 left the Aussie attack floundering. Lanning was bowled for a duck and Healy made five as Australia fell 36 runs shy. \"It was a disappointing time for us. There's no shying away from that,\" Healy said. \"That England game summed up where our group was at at the time and I don't think I'm speaking out of school to say that. \"It was a comfortable run chase we made hard for ourselves. We played comfortable cricket. We didn't push the letter. We were sort of in this comfortable mindset.\" The tournament failure brought serious introspection. \"We sat down and we watched that semi-final ... a brutal old-school team bonding session,\" Healy said. \"It was uncomfortable and uncomfortable for the bowlers in particular. It was painful.\" Asked about that review, Lanning said only that it \"had a really big impact on how we have played since and how we have operated off the field as well\". It's hard to argue with that. In the five years since, Australia have won 29 of their last 30 ODIs - including a world record 26-match unbeaten streak - while keeping a tight grip on the Ashes, including a flawless home series last month. \"We've had unbelievable success since that moment and probably it was the turning point for us and maybe the lesson that we needed,\" Healy said. In New Zealand, Australia can call on a strong core of experience to mount their World Cup campaign. Ellyse Perry will play at her fourth World Cup, while Lanning, opener Rachel Haynes and pace bowler Megan Schutt play at their third. Healy travelled to the 2013 tournament but didn't play, making the 2022 tournament her second, along with Ashleigh Gardner, Jess Jonassen, Beth Mooney and Amanda-Jade Wellington. Gardner, Australia's reigning player of the year, faces a delayed start after catching COVID-19 and will meet up with her teammates after the first two matches.

The second rule of Australia's Women's Cricket World Cup campaign is not to talk about the last one. Meg Lanning's side have endured a five-year wait to avenge the biggest disappointment of their careers, and get the chance to do it this month in New Zealand. It is clear the last World Cup - won by hosts England in an upset triumph - has left scars. \"To be honest, we don't really talk about 2017 anymore,\" Lanning said this week in Christchurch. \"It obviously had a big impact on us but now it's a completely different group and we're on a new journey together.\" Alyssa Healy, who, like Lanning felt the pain of 2017's semi-final exit, is also not one for reminiscing. \"You can ask me about 2017 all you want. But I've wiped it from my brain,\" she tells AAP, only half-joking. Australia headed to England in 2017 as world No.1s and hot favourites, as they do this year. Alarm bells rang after Australia fell three runs short to the hosts in a group stage chase, giving England their first World Cup win over their arch-rivals in 24 years. Finishing second after the round-robin, Australia was then dumped out of the tournament by India in the semi-finals, when Harmanpreet Kaur's unbeaten 171 left the Aussie attack floundering. Lanning was bowled for a duck and Healy made five as Australia fell 36 runs shy. \"It was a disappointing time for us. There's no shying away from that,\" Healy said. \"That England game summed up where our group was at at the time and I don't think I'm speaking out of school to say that. \"It was a comfortable run chase we made hard for ourselves. We played comfortable cricket. We didn't push the letter. We were sort of in this comfortable mindset.\" The tournament failure brought serious introspection. \"We sat down and we watched that semi-final ... a brutal old-school team bonding session,\" Healy said. \"It was uncomfortable and uncomfortable for the bowlers in particular. It was painful.\" Asked about that review, Lanning said only that it \"had a really big impact on how we have played since and how we have operated off the field as well\". It's hard to argue with that. In the five years since, Australia have won 29 of their last 30 ODIs - including a world record 26-match unbeaten streak - while keeping a tight grip on the Ashes, including a flawless home series last month. \"We've had unbelievable success since that moment and probably it was the turning point for us and maybe the lesson that we needed,\" Healy said. In New Zealand, Australia can call on a strong core of experience to mount their World Cup campaign. Ellyse Perry will play at her fourth World Cup, while Lanning, opener Rachel Haynes and pace bowler Megan Schutt play at their third. Healy travelled to the 2013 tournament but didn't play, making the 2022 tournament her second, along with Ashleigh Gardner, Jess Jonassen, Beth Mooney and Amanda-Jade Wellington. Gardner, Australia's reigning player of the year, faces a delayed start after catching COVID-19 and will meet up with her teammates after the first two matches.

Marsh leaves an indelible impact on the sport of cricket, both on and off the field. On it, Marsh was a genuine gamechanger, becoming the first Australian keeper to hit a century when he put up 118 in the first Test against Pakistan in Adelaide in December 1972. The legendary wicketkeeper also formed a lethal partnership with Dennis Lillee, with 95 of his Test wickets caught by Marsh. Watch Australia’s Tour of Pakistan on Kayo.

Marsh made his impact felt on the younger generations too, becoming head coach of the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide in the 1990s and early 2000s. He also later served as a national selector until 2016. Speaking on SEN Radio on Friday morning, Australian cricket great Brett Lee said the news of Marsh’s death “rocked everyone”.

The guy that played 96 Test matches, nearly 4000 runs... an absolute legend of the game, a legend of a bloke. A typical Aussie bloke who played his cricket hard, enjoyed a beer.” Speaking of Marsh’s role at the Australian Cricket Academy, Lee paid tribute to his ability to get the best out of the country’s emerging talent. “I got to know Rod very well down at the Cricket Academy back in ‘94 and ‘95. Just a terrific guy,” he said. “Obviously a big fan growing up, you think about Lillee and Thommo [Jeff Thomson] steaming in and the great Rod Marsh behind the stumps taking speccys left and right. A wonderful keeper behind the stumps to spinners.

I just thought this guy is so normal, he’s such a great fella. Harsh but fair. “He wanted the best out of the players which was why he was so respected as a player, person and coach. Everyone is rocked and so saddened.” Then-Australia selector Rod Marsh laughing with former player Shane Warne. (Photo by Paul ELLIS / AFP) Source: AFP Mark Waugh echoed similar sentiments, describing Marsh as a “straight-shooter” with “such a great heart”. “You know where you stand with Rod,” he told foxsports.com.au . “He was such a straight-shooter and I think that’s the trademark, he doesn’t beat around the bush but he’s got such a great heart. He was such a great judge of a cricketer too. Obviously a tremendous player. “He was good fun. We had a good time together as selectors, we’d have a glass of red and all those sorts of things. He was a bubbly sort of person.” The Australian public looks back fondly on the Marsh-Lillee days and it is no different for Waugh, who called his time watching the partnership as “iconic”. Khawaja: 'I grew up down the road' | 02:33 “The big moustache and just the way he played the game,” Waugh added. “He was aggressive with the bat, he was a tough cricketer but a very fair cricketer. I remember the underarm, he was totally against that. He was just such a tough and fair cricketer.” Waugh also took to social media, tweeting his sadness on hearing of Marsh’s death. “So incredibly sad to hear of the passing of Rod (Bacchus) Marsh an absolute icon of Aust cricket. Had the pleasure of working with Rod for a number of years as a selector and you wouldn’t meet a more honest, down to earth, kind hearted person,” he tweeted. Former teammate Kerry O’Keeffe described Marsh as a “fantastic lieutenant” on the field while reflecting on their time playing together. “Just so sad. I knew it was imminent,” he told foxsports.com.au . “He was my wicket-keeper in all of my 24 Tests. We had some rollicking times together. A life well lived, that’s the key to Rodney. “He was a realist [on the field]. He was a great lieutenant, he was a fantastic lieutenant to whoever who served under. He wouldn’t deliver anything above his station. “He rang me last year, we had a long chat. I liked him. We got along well. It’s so sad how he went. He was as strong as an ox. He was so tough. He got that century in the centenary Test and jeez, it was such a gritty knock.” Rod Marsh was a true leader on the field.

Source: News Corp Australia The pair shared “a lot of partnerships” together, with O’Keeffe describing it as the “best batting time I’ve ever had”. “I enjoyed that immensely,” he said. “We put on about 180 against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval and just the batting time I’ve ever had; he got 130-odd and I got 80-odd. He was a fantastic slog-sweeper, before the slog-sweeper became everyone’s shot. He could deposit them 20 rows back. “We held that seven-wicket record for a long time. That’s my only record, but I held it with Rod.” As for Marsh’s work with the gloves, O’Keeffe called him a “fantastic wicket-keeper to fast bowlers”. “Went horizontal through the air so well. Any nicks from Lillee and Thompson were snaffled,” he added. Ash Gardner tests positive to COVID | 00:43 In a combined biography of both Marsh and Lillee, Ian Chappell described the legendary keeper as “a man whose skill with the globes could life a team with a brilliant catch or who could offer some tactical advice that might turn a game in the team’s favour”. The rest of the cricket world has taken to social media to pay their respects, with David Hussey, Lisa Sthalekar and Alyssa Healy among those to reflect on Marsh’s achievements. “Sad day with the passing of the great Rod Marsh. His saying, “cricket is a simple game made complicated” still resonates with me. Rod will be missed, thoughts are with his family,” Hussey wrote. Lisa Sthalekar wrote on Twitter: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of Rod Marsh. What a legend of a cricketer, a great bloke who made everyone feel welcome in this great game”. “Oh man. Sad day. Sending all my love to the whole Marsh family xx,” wrote Healy.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rod Marsh: Australian cricket great dies aged 74 - The Guardian","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyL21hci8wNC9yb2RuZXktbWFyc2gtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1jcmlja2V0LWdyZWF0LWRpZXMtYWdlZC03NNIBYGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyL21hci8wNC9yb2RuZXktbWFyc2gtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1jcmlja2V0LWdyZWF0LWRpZXMtYWdlZC03NA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rod Marsh: Australian cricket great dies aged 74  The Guardian‘Deep sadness’: Cricket legend dead at 74  news.com.auAustralian cricket legend Rod Marsh has died aged 74  ABC NewsRodney Marsh: A great gloveman who became part of nation’s folklore  Sydney Morning HeraldCricket legend Rod Marsh dies aged 74  PerthNowView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-04 00:06:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Deep sadness’: Cricket legend dead at 74","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-legend-rod-marsh-dead-at-74/news-story/feedb4d68d3614964643ab32e1887392","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Aussie cricket legend Rod Marsh has died at the age of 74 after suffering a major heart attack last week.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-03 23:52:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Absolute icon’: Cricket world mourns legend","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/really-tough-aussie-test-team-rallying-around-cricket-legend-rod-marsh/news-story/c98d2d5e77ab1315f04e2a67cd41787c","keywords":["Breaking News","Cricket news and galleries","National","Network News","NewsWire","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Tributes have begun to flow for Australian cricket legend Rod Marsh after his tragic passing on Friday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-03 23:51:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Re-opening to stop AFL's multi-million-dollar bleed","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/afl/western-australia-border-open-matthew-pavlich-column/b1d130bd-1f99-4ad9-8051-ebe4b9a2ef39","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"Now that the Western Australia border has opened the AFL can breathe a sigh of relief, but a lesson needs to be learned.","content":"* Matthew Pavlich is a Nine Sports presenter and co-founder of Pickstar\"I'll be back.\" It's one of the most famous lines in cinematic history.Acting as a cyborg assassin, the Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is refused entry to a police station, only to return shortly thereafter and destroy the counter and those inside.While West Australians aren't planning on destroying the rest of Australia (trust me we're not!), as the Western Australia border wall falls, there is certainly an overwhelming feeling by many of us - including me - of being 'back'.READ MORE: Cricket legend Rod Marsh dead at age 74READ MORE: Vaccine backflip gives Djokovic Roland-Garros boostREAD MORE: Fresh doubts over Federer's comeback attemptThe Western Australia border was closed to the entire country almost two years ago (696 days) due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions.Western Australians, the most isolated citizens in the world, became even more segregated. And while we didn't know how long that would be, finally and pleasingly, Western Australia rejoins Australia and the world, enabling us to enjoy quarantine-free travel as and when we please.Embrace loved ones, do business face to face, reunite with friends.From a sports perspective, for teams involved in national and international elite sport, there will be no more hubs, no more delays and a likely return to the usual cadence of a normal season. And boy, don't we all need some live sport to help us move forward.But as much as things are 'back' to normal, they stay the same and there will be fresh challenges for sporting bodies, and us all, as we navigate the next twelve months and beyond - both socially and financially.As an operations manager of an AFL team recently told me, 'Footy ops, never stops'. What he meant by this, is that while open borders will signal a collective sigh of relief from players and administrators around the country, there will be new hurdles to jump in 2022. I suspect this will be a similar scenario across many industries.In order to keep the game going, the AFL recently revealed it spent an eye watering $76 million on COVID-19-related expenses over the past two seasons. It's expensive to keep your players and staff safe and healthy.Despite recording a cash surplus in 2021, the AFL had an underlying operating loss of $43 million in 2021, after a loss of $22.7 million in 2020. And that is after recording revenue of $738.m last year and $674.8m in 2020.It just goes to show the true cost of the pandemic with the establishment of a debt facility totalling a reported $600m and the cost of multiple hubs and additional travel and accommodation requirements.We were all craving some reassurance that 2022 wouldn't have the same cost hit on the game. But the decision to indefinitely delay the Western Australia border reopening in a dramatic late-night press conference on January 20, 2022, left many people in sport and across Australian reeling.As a result of the dramatic U-turn, we were as uncertain as at any other time during the past two years. With our confidence broken, we became hesitant.Uncertainty and hesitation on the sporting field can leave an athlete to appear old or inexperienced, slow and unprepared. The same can be said in the boardroom or in politics when a lack of assertiveness and conviction is displayed.People crave certainty and a path forward. By making a deal with the public – get vaccinated and the border will open - and then backflipping, the Western Australia Government failed to provide that certainty and confidence.At the time, there may have been justifiable good reasons to remain closed, but the failure to outline any sort of plan left everyone in limbo. Everyone, uncertain.Many teams in the AFL and corporate Australia, have worked alongside team culture guru Ray McLean from Leading Teams, who often refers to the \"commit, do, review\" process; whereby a group of people commit to a plan, go and do it, and then review the results thoroughly.From my perspective, being on the other side of high-performance sport now - in the media and in business - it seems that we are very good at committing to a plan, implementing and executing it, but the review aspect is desperately lacking.Admittedly those in charge over the last two years haven't had the time to review many of the decisions. Government, the police, industry leaders and health authorities have all been going non-stop, seemingly having to make it up as they go.But now with some sort of normality returning, we may finally have the chance to step back and review the decisions made. A chance to find the time and space and perhaps take a longer view.I really hope we do, because there is so much to learn and reflect upon. And as we do reflect, it will be nice to do so back in person, with our friends from the east.For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here!","pubDate":"2022-03-03 23:46:19","full_description":"* Matthew Pavlich is a Nine Sports presenter and co-founder of Pickstar \"I'll be back.\" It's one of the most famous lines in cinematic history.

READ MORE: Cricket legend Rod Marsh dead at age 74 READ MORE: Vaccine backflip gives Djokovic Roland-Garros boost READ MORE: Fresh doubts over Federer's comeback attempt The Western Australia border was closed to the entire country almost two years ago (696 days) due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions. Western Australians, the most isolated citizens in the world, became even more segregated. And while we didn't know how long that would be, finally and pleasingly, Western Australia rejoins Australia and the world, enabling us to enjoy quarantine-free travel as and when we please. Embrace loved ones, do business face to face, reunite with friends. From a sports perspective, for teams involved in national and international elite sport, there will be no more hubs, no more delays and a likely return to the usual cadence of a normal season. And boy, don't we all need some live sport to help us move forward. But as much as things are 'back' to normal, they stay the same and there will be fresh challenges for sporting bodies, and us all, as we navigate the next twelve months and beyond - both socially and financially. As an operations manager of an AFL team recently told me, 'Footy ops, never stops'. What he meant by this, is that while open borders will signal a collective sigh of relief from players and administrators around the country, there will be new hurdles to jump in 2022. I suspect this will be a similar scenario across many industries. In order to keep the game going, the AFL recently revealed it spent an eye watering $76 million on COVID-19-related expenses over the past two seasons. It's expensive to keep your players and staff safe and healthy. Despite recording a cash surplus in 2021, the AFL had an underlying operating loss of $43 million in 2021, after a loss of $22.7 million in 2020. And that is after recording revenue of $738.m last year and $674.8m in 2020. It just goes to show the true cost of the pandemic with the establishment of a debt facility totalling a reported $600m and the cost of multiple hubs and additional travel and accommodation requirements. We were all craving some reassurance that 2022 wouldn't have the same cost hit on the game. But the decision to indefinitely delay the Western Australia border reopening in a dramatic late-night press conference on January 20, 2022, left many people in sport and across Australian reeling. As a result of the dramatic U-turn, we were as uncertain as at any other time during the past two years. With our confidence broken, we became hesitant. Uncertainty and hesitation on the sporting field can leave an athlete to appear old or inexperienced, slow and unprepared. The same can be said in the boardroom or in politics when a lack of assertiveness and conviction is displayed. People crave certainty and a path forward. By making a deal with the public – get vaccinated and the border will open - and then backflipping, the Western Australia Government failed to provide that certainty and confidence. At the time, there may have been justifiable good reasons to remain closed, but the failure to outline any sort of plan left everyone in limbo. Everyone, uncertain. Many teams in the AFL and corporate Australia, have worked alongside team culture guru Ray McLean from Leading Teams, who often refers to the \"commit, do, review\" process; whereby a group of people commit to a plan, go and do it, and then review the results thoroughly. From my perspective, being on the other side of high-performance sport now - in the media and in business - it seems that we are very good at committing to a plan, implementing and executing it, but the review aspect is desperately lacking. Admittedly those in charge over the last two years haven't had the time to review many of the decisions. Government, the police, industry leaders and health authorities have all been going non-stop, seemingly having to make it up as they go. But now with some sort of normality returning, we may finally have the chance to step back and review the decisions made. A chance to find the time and space and perhaps take a longer view. I really hope we do, because there is so much to learn and reflect upon. And as we do reflect, it will be nice to do so back in person, with our friends from the east.

He was also a more-than-handy batter, a villain, a rebel, irreverent, insubordinate - and loved and admired as one half of an Australian cricket partnership of uncanny proportions. Marsh, who died Friday aged 74, was also a coach, mentor and administrator who guided the game's youth through national and international cricket academies. Born in Armadale, Western Australia, on November 4, 1947, Rodney William Marsh had his introduction to cricket in the backyard of his family home, along with his elder brother, Graham, who went on to become a successful professional golfer. The Marsh brothers represented their state in cricket at schoolboy level before pursuing their chosen sports. By the age of eight he was playing competitively with the Armadale under-16 side. \"I kept wicket right from the start, but batting was my main strength,\" he recalled. The balance between batting and keeping wicket eventually tipped in favour of the latter, although it was probably the former that ensured his selection in the Australian team for the first Test of the 1970-71 series against England at the Gabba. His Sheffield Shield form for WA had put Marsh in contention for the wicketkeeper's job after the retirement of Brian Taber, although Queensland's John McLean also had selection claims. Marsh got the job because he was considered the better batsman and quickly rewarded the selectors' faith with an innings of 44 in the drawn second Test and an unbeaten 92 in the fifth. Australia's new keeper also justified his place behind the stumps holding 10 catches and making three stumpings for the series. But it was a routine entry in the scorebook of the seventh, and final, Test of that series in Sydney that was to prove portentous. On the first morning, Dennis Lillee, who had made his debut for Australia in the previous Test in Adelaide, had English batsman John Hampshire caught behind the wicket. As a result, a simple notation entered the scorebook and the Test cricket lexicon for the first time: c Marsh b Lillee. The same detail was to appear on Test match scorecards a further 94 times, its regularity prompting Marsh to explain an almost psychic relationship with Lillee. \"I've played with him so much now that most of the time I know what he is going to do before he has bowled. I know from the way he runs up; the angle, the speed, where he hits the crease, where the ball is going to be,\" Marsh said. The spiritual connection continued to the end with the pair who began their Test careers in the same 1970-'71 series announcing their retirement during the same match against Pakistan in Sydney in 1984, Marsh finishing his career with a then world record 355 dismissals and Lillee with the same number of wickets, also then a world record. Marsh began his Test career immediately following Australia's 4-0 drubbing by South Africa in 1969-70 and was joined in the subsequent home series against England by fellow debutants Lillee and Greg Chappell, a triumvirate that was instrumental in Australia's resurgence. Little more than a year later, Australia drew the 1972 series in England 2-2 and then won all three Test matches against Pakistan in '72-'73 before a 2-0 away defeat of the West Indies and successive Ashes series wins over England. Australia's run ended in England in 1977, in a series played against a backdrop of rumblings about World Series Cricket. The home team's 2-0 success heralded a tumultuous period in which Marsh, Lillee and Chappell, who been the cornerstone of success, were now leaders of the WSC defection. With the disbanding of World Series Cricket the three returned in 1979-80 for home series against the West Indies and England, but hostility accompanied them. An on-again-off-again captaincy imbroglio involving Kim Hughes and Chappell was fuelled by Lillee's view that Marsh should have been made captain, a belief with which the latter concurred. Marsh never backed away from accusations he and Lillee disapproved of Hughes, insisting later it was a matter of his fellow West Australian not being ready for the job. In a further, notorious incident, the names Marsh and Lillee were again mentioned on the same line when the pair bet, at 500-1, that England would come from a seemingly impossible position to win the third Test at Headingly in 1981. Marsh had PS5 and Lillee PS10 on their rivals who duly blasted their way to victory on the back of Ian Botham's second innings of 149 not out. On his retirement in 1984, Marsh had played in 96 Tests, taken a record 355 dismissals and scored 3633 runs with a top score of 132 at an average of 26.5. He was also the first Australian wicketkeeper to make a Test century, and played in the first one-day international, against England in Melbourne in 1971. Marsh later headed the cricket academies of Australia and England, and was inaugural head of an ICC world coaching academy in Dubai. He also became Australian chairman of selectors. Although a tough competitor and mentor, he was respected worldwide for his fairness and knowledge of the game. His sportsmanship was exemplified when Greg Chappell directed his brother Trevor to bowl an underarm delivery against New Zealand in a one-day international in 1981 - Marsh shook his head in disapproval, trying to dissuade his captain. \"Respect,\" said Marsh \"is part of my non-negotiables.\" Marsh became a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1982 and was elected to the Sport Australia Hall Of Fame in 1985 and the Cricket Hall Of Fame in 2005. Marsh leaves his wife Ros and sons Dan, who captained Tasmania to their first Sheffield Shield win, Paul, a former CEO of the Australian Cricketers' Association, and Jamie.","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5925696/11c96c0f48a2a535f4c3305fa319b507eac8039d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australian cricket legend Rod Marsh passes away following heart attack","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/australian-cricket-legend-rod-marsh-passes-away-following-heart-attack-c-5925668","keywords":null,"creator":["Ben Horne"],"video_url":null,"description":"The cricket world is mourning the death of Australian legend Rod Marsh, who has passed away after suffering a heart attack last week.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-03 23:24:05","full_description":"Cricket great Rod Marsh has died in Adelaide after suffering a heart attack in Bundaberg last week. Marsh was 74 and will be remembered as an icon of the game, having played 96 Tests for Australia between 1970 and 1984 as one of the greatest wicket-keepers of all time. The caught Marsh bowled Lillee combination was the most famous double-act in cricket. Marsh had been in an induced coma after a couple of Queensland cricket locals revived him last week several minutes after he’d suffered a heart attack. After his playing career, Marsh continued to serve the game in many capacities, most recently as a national selector, and his cricket academy helped nurture dozens of Test players including Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer. Mark Waugh, who served as a selector alongside Marsh, was among the first to express his sincere condolences for the “icon”. “So incredibly sad to hear of the passing of Rod (Bacchus) Marsh an absolute icon of Aust cricket,” Waugh wrote on Twitter. “Had the pleasure of working with Rod for a number of years as a selector and you wouldn’t meet a more honest, down to earth, kind hearted person.

No duo in the history of the game has combined for more dismissals than Dennis Lillee and Marsh. After retiring, Marsh held a variety of coaching, high performance and administration roles across Australia and England. In 2005 he was inducted into Cricket Australia’s Hall of Fame. As a cricketer, Marsh was a central figure in an era when played transitioned from amateurs to professionals. He didn’t hesitate joining World Series Cricket and while he never captained the Test team, he led Western Australia to the Sheffield Shield/Gillette Cup double in 1976/77. While Adam Gilchrist is often credited with changing the way wicket-keepers were perceived, Marsh was a pioneer in his own right.

At the time of Marsh’s retirement in 1984, he had collected a then world record 355 Test dismissals. The last of his Test tons came against England in the 1977 centenary Test. He was the head of the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide where he fostered the progress of talents such as Ricky Ponting, Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee. Marsh was later poached by England, where he became the director of its own national academy before being made a selector. He left in September 2005 having played a key role in England reclaiming the Ashes urn. Marsh is survived by his wife Ros, plus children Paul, Dan and Jamie. More to come.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket legend Rod Marsh dies aged 74","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-legend-rod-marsh-dies-aged-74-c-5925493","keywords":null,"creator":["Steve Larkin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australian cricket great Rod Marsh has died, aged 74, after suffering a heart attack a week ago.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-03 23:04:21","full_description":"Australian cricket great Rod Marsh has died, aged 74.

Marsh suffered a heart attack in Queensland last Thursday and has passed away in an Adelaide hospital. Marsh played 96 Test matches for Australia before overseeing the nation’s cricket academy and later becoming a selector. The West Australian’s imprint also spread throughout the cricket world. After retiring, Marsh headed the cricket academies of both Australia and arch foe England, and was inaugural head of an International Cricket Council world coaching academy in Dubai. After those stints, Marsh returned to Australia and became the nation’s chairman of selectors in 2014, a role he held for two years. Marsh became a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1982 and was elected to the Sport Australia Hall Of Fame in 1985 and the Cricket Hall Of Fame in 2005. Australia’s Test players are expected to wear black arm-bands when the first Test against Pakistan starts later Friday in Rawalpindi, as a mark of respect for the champion wicketkeeper. “Quite a few players and staff members have had really good relationships with Rod in the past,” Test captain Pat Cummins told reporters on Thursday. “It’s really tough. It has certainly been a conversation point over here.” Marsh leaves his wife Ros and sons Dan, who captained Tasmania to their first Sheffield Shield win, Paul, a former CEO of the Australian Cricketers’ Association, and Jamie.","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5925490/b500ae64d77cf6c398de1c077b0989881e6182d6-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
