After fans signed up to the initiative 24 hours earlier, many were shocked when they were informed Joe Root was back as captain. Ben Stokes, who was announced as Root’s successor last month after the prolific run-scorer stepped down following the humiliation in the Caribbean, was included at the bottom of the team listed in alphabetical order to face New Zealand on June 2.

The embarrassing gaffe was corrected quickly, but not quick enough for a number of people who took to Twitter to point out the blunder. The Telegraph questioned the motivations of the “early access” scheme, saying it went against the notion of the team representing the “whole nation”. The scheme, which was a marketing idea, came on the same day Tom Harrison confirmed he was stepping down as the governing body’s chief executive. Meanwhile, England, who last week appointed Brendon McCullum as their new Test coach, are set to back Ollie Pope in the No.3 role. Mott being eyed to become England coach | 00:43 The 24-year-old has been prolific in County Cricket but yet to carry his promise into the Test arena. After 23 Tests, Pope averages 28.66 and was dropped during the recent Ashes embarrassment. Brook, who has started the season by amassing 758 runs at 151.6, justifies his call-up, while fellow rookie Potts has been included after taking 35 wickets for Durham this season. England's batsman Ollie Pope is being backed as their long-term solution at first-drop.

Jack Leach is a great character who gives everything with bat and ball but we know his ceiling is only so high.” England squad: B Stokes (Durham, capt), J Anderson (Lancashire), J Bairstow (Yorkshire), S Broad (Nottinghamshire), H Brook (Yorkshire), Z Crawley (Kent), B Foakes (Surrey), J Leach (Somerset), A Lees (Durham), C Overton (Somerset), M Potts (Durham), O Pope (Surrey), J Root (Yorkshire).","pubDate":"2022-05-18 22:12:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Umran will be a great bowler for India: Vaas","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/05/19/umran-will-be-a-great-bowler-for-india-vaas/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai: Former Sri Lankan pacer Chaminda Vaas reckons rookie speedster Umran Malik, who has thrilled everyone with his pace in the IPL, will become a “great bowler” for India.

Playing for the Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL-15, the fast bowler from Jammu has been impressive with his pace and consistently clocked above 150 kmph in the speed gun. He has so far taken 21 wickets, with best figures of 5/25 and is the fourth highest wicket-taker in the tournament. “I think he (Umran) is getting better day by day and I saw him playing in the last IPL as well. He is bowling consistently and accuracy is important when it comes to T20. And he will be a great bowler for India. He will be there with (Jasprit) Bumrah, I guess if India gives him a chance. He will go a long way,” Vaas told reporters here. The ex-left-arm seamer, who has 355 wickets in 111 Tests, is in the city to coach children of the ‘Mumbai Cricket Club’ led by coach Jwala Singh. This IPL has also seen the emergence of young pacers like Mukesh Choudhary, Arshdeep Singh, Umran, Avesh Khan, Mohsin Khan and the 48-year-old attributed it to good first-class structure in India. “India has a good first-class structure and most of the first-class clubs are producing a lot of (good) cricketers and India cricket has a plan going forward. So that is why they are able to produce so many fast bowlers, cricketers,” he said. Vaas elated with performance of Sri Lankans The IPL has seen Sri Lankan players like Wanindu Hasaranga, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dushmantha Chameera among others perform well and Vaas feels it will pave the way for the younger cricketers in the island nation. “Well, I am so glad that in this IPL, most of the Sri Lankan got opportunities and they believe in themselves that they can (play) a bigger role in the IPL. And the best example is Wanindu (Hasaranga). “Wanindu is a star and he has always performed well in the Sri Lanka team but here (in the IPL) he is doing amazing. Not only him but others are doing (playing) their part (well) and it is good for the future players of Sri Lanka to come and play in the IPL. It is a morale-booster for the youngsters,” said Vaas. “Dushmantha has come a long way. I was working with the national set-up for eight months and he has improved a lot. I am already pleased with his performance and he will be a future star,” he added. Vaas predicts bright future for Matheesha Pathirana Matheesha Pathirana made an impressive debut for Chennai Super Kings and Vaas feels the rookie pacer has a brilliant future. “Yes, when I was the U19 coach, he (Matheesha) came from that group and I have seen his potential. He is bowling like Lasith Malinga and he has a brilliant future. “With his action, he might get injuries but he has to look after himself and Sri Lanka cricket (also needs to) take care of him,” he added. Vaas also thanked India for helping Sri Lanka, which is facing an economic crisis. “Actually I am not in politics, but this (current) issue is a bigger mess in Sri Lanka. I was glad that the Indian government has helped us to come (out) this situation in a better way,” he signed off. —PTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-05-18 20:12:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-De Kock, Rahul smash record opening IPL partnership","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/05/19/cricket-de-kock-rahul-smash-record-opening-ipl-partnership","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - South African Quinton de Kock and India's KL Rahul recorded the highest opening partnership in Indian Premier League history on Wednesday as their stand of 210 fired the Lucknow Super Giants to the playoffs with a two-run win over the Kolkata Knight Riders.

De Kock scored an unbeaten 140 off 70 balls and captain Rahul scored 68 not out from 51 balls as they became the first pair to bat 20 overs in an IPL innings. Their opening stand surpassed the previous best of 185 by Jonny Bairstow and David Warner for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2019, while De Kock also set the highest individual score this season. \"I was a little bit cooked. But I had to get out there and get on with the job. It was just a bit of frustration that came out,\" said De Kock. \"The last couple of games just the way I was getting out. It was just a bit of release. I didn't know what I was thinking, I was just keeping it in.\" Chasing a target of 211, Kolkata got off to a poor start with both openers out for single-digit scores. Nitish Rana (42) and captain Shreyas Iyer (50) helped them bounce back before Rinku Singh (40 from 15 balls) lit up their run chase. Rinku and Sunil Narine (21 not out) hit 17 runs in the 19th over, leaving Kolkata to chase 21 runs in the final over. Rinku piled pressure on Lucknow as he hit Marcus Stoinis for a four and two sixes in the first three balls of the final over, with Kolkata needing only three runs off the final two balls to win. But Stoinis held his nerve as he dismissed Rinku on the fifth ball, with Evin Lewis taking a stunning one-handed catch. The Australian all-rounder completed the job by taking out Umesh Yadav with a yorker on the final delivery as Lucknow joined fellow new franchise Gujarat Titans in the playoffs. \"There haven't been so many games that have gone to the last ball,\" said Rahul. \"Yes, they have gone to the last over but not so close. Happy to be on the other side, good way to finish the last game of the league stage.\" (Reporting by Manasi Pathak in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis)","pubDate":"2022-05-18 19:37:00","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/05/19/1589854.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my","country":["malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Why England’s new limited-overs coach is on a mission in Cairns","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/local-cricket/england-limitedovers-coach-mott-in-cairns-with-bulls-masters-to-announce-cup-moves/news-story/2d060f5881a9673f6fe8a024e4639de9","keywords":["Cairns Post","Junior Sport","Local Cricket","Local sport","Sport","Top News"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Queensland cricket royalty – including England’s new limited-overs coach – will hope a trip to the Far North will serve as a chance to come together to remember the great Andrew ‘Roy’ Symonds.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-18 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 Points Table Update, Latest Orange Cap, Purple Cap Lists After Lucknow Super Giants Defeat .. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9pcGwtMjAyMi1wb2ludHMtdGFibGUtdXBkYXRlLWxhdGVzdC1vcmFuZ2UtY2FwLXB1cnBsZS1jYXAtbGlzdHMtYWZ0ZXIta2tyLXZzLWxzZy1tYXRjaC02Ni0yOTg4NzYx0gGIAWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2lwbC0yMDIyL2lwbC0yMDIyLXBvaW50cy10YWJsZS11cGRhdGUtbGF0ZXN0LW9yYW5nZS1jYXAtcHVycGxlLWNhcC1saXN0cy1hZnRlci1ra3ItdnMtbHNnLW1hdGNoLTY2LTI5ODg3NjEvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022 Points Table Update, Latest Orange Cap, Purple Cap Lists After Lucknow Super Giants Defeat ..  NDTV SportsLive Cricket Score - KKR vs LSG, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIPL 2022 Highlights KKR vs LSG: Lucknow beat Kolkata in final over thriller  Hindustan TimesIPL 2022: Who needs to beat who to qualify - All playoffs possibilities in 8 points  Times of IndiaKKR vs LSG, IPL 2022 Highlights: Lucknow Super Giants Make it to the Playoffs, Beat Kolkata By 2 Runs  News18View Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-18 18:35:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lord's cricket ground to turn red, white and blue on Queen's Platinum Jubilee","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/lord-s-cricket-ground-to-turn-red-white-and-blue-on-queen-s-platinum-jubilee-1951194-2022-05-18?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Lord's cricket ground to turn reLord's to turn red, white and blue on Queen's Platnimum Jubileed, white and blue on Queen's Platinum Jubilee","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-18 18:12:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"E Lewis cricketer catch video: Evin Lewis grabs sensational catch to dismiss Rinku Singh in KKR vs LSG IPL 2022 match","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-e-lewis-cricketer-catch-video-evin-lewis-grabs-sensational-catch-to-dismiss-rinku-singh-in-kkr-vs-lsg-ipl-2022-match/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","KKR","Lucknow Super Giants","Videos","Evin Lewis","Indian Premier League","Kolkata Knight riders","LSG","Marcus Stoinis","Rinku Singh"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Evin Lewis cricketer catch: The West Indian batter grabbed a sensational match-winning catch at the Dr DY Patil Sports Academy tonight.

During the 66th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Kolkata Knight Riders and Lucknow Super Gaints in Navi Mumbai, Lucknow Super Giants beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 2 runs in a cliffhanger of a finish. Chasing a 211-run target, Knight Riders were supposed to have lacked behind drastically after all-rounder Andre Russell (5) was dismissed by Mohsin Khan in the 17th over. Needing 61 runs off 20 balls with Rinku Singh (40) and Sunil Narine (21*) in the middle, the left-handed pair put together a 21-ball 58-run partnership for the seventh wicket. Rinku and Narine hitting two fours and seven sixes between them turned the tables to a large extent until the penultimate ball of the match. Kolkata, who needed 21 runs in the last over, brought down the equation to needing three runs off two balls. Playing his fifth match of the season, Super Giants batter Evin Lewis contributed significantly on the field in a match where he didn’t get to bat. Fielding at sweeper cover, Lewis ran towards his left before putting on display a dive to grab a sensational one-handed catch when Rinku hit Marcus Stoinis on the off-side. With the batter looking unstoppable in the last over, putting curbs in front of him required such a magnificent effort from a fielder.

Nasser Hussain has led the chorus of approval in England over the appointment of a 46-year-old coach who he believes moulded one of the greatest teams in sport in his seven years at the helm of the all-conquering Australian women's side. Mott was officially unveiled as England men's white-ball coach on Wednesday, hailed as \"the outstanding candidate\" by England's director of men's cricket Rob Key, as he was selected ahead of home candidates led by the initial favourite, Paul Collingwood. But it was quickly made clear that a lot is going to be expected of the \"exceptional\" Queenslander. \"What he has done with the Australian women's team is what will be asked of him to achieve for our men's white-ball sides,\" said Key. That is a big ask, as Mott led an era of unprecedented dominance for Australia in the women's game over seven years, having held the Ashes throughout that period, winning back-to-back T20 World Cups in 2018 and 2020 and lifting the 50-over trophy last month. But former England captain Hussain is confident Mott can deliver. \"He's a really good choice, an exceptional coach, who's had a lot of success at New South Wales and knows English and Welsh cricket inside out, having played here,\" Hussain said on Sky Sports. \"He took a good Australian women's side and made them into a great side, arguably the greatest women's cricket team there's ever been - and there are encouraging signs there with the England (men's) side. \"Rob Key wanted someone to come in and not just put the cones down for Eoin Morgan. He wanted someone who was going to push England's white-ball team even further - and I think that's exactly what Matthew Mott will do. A really good appointment.\" Collingwood had led Test and limited-overs series in the West Indies this winter and was tipped to land the job full-time. Yet, as with the Test team which will now be overseen by ex-New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, England have plumped for Antipodean adventure. But Key still wants to keep Collingwood involved. \"He was fine, Colly. He's always been a massive supporter of England and he's desperate to help out Matthew Mott and Brendon McCullum,\" he said. \"The players are sometimes the most brutal judges and all of them speak very highly of Paul Collingwood. \"He is in the system. He is an asset in our environment, but where he's going to be for the whole summer, I don't think we know until the coaches come in.\" Mott admitted it had taken \"something special\" to prise him away from the Australian women's team job, which he had loved. \"However, I genuinely believe that the time is right to play a role in helping the England men's ODI and T20 group continue to evolve as one of the best teams in the world,\" he said. Key was adamant that Mott's excellence in the women's game should not be underestimated. \"He has made the gap greater between Australia and the rest of the pack in the women's game,\" said Key.","pubDate":"2022-05-18 17:37:17","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-6852772/a58d1539714ada7039adaa3483fa1d1ef8294711-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England Cricket: Ben Stokes' first Test squad announcement goes wrong as Joe Root is named captain","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-10830205/England-Cricket-Ben-Stokes-Test-squad-announcement-goes-wrong-Joe-Root-named-captain.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Stokes is gearing up for his first challenge since replacing Joe Root as England captain last month, with New Zealand to come in a three-match Test series throughout June.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-18 17:06:16","image_url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/18/18/57982145-0-image-a-31_1652893263739.jpg","source_id":"dailymailuk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"KKR vs LSG, IPL 2022 stat attack: Quinton de Kock posts highest score of season, stitches record stand with KL Rahul","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/kkr-vs-lsg-ipl-2022-stat-attack-quinton-de-kock-posts-highest-score-of-season-stitches-record-stand-with-kl-rahul-10691231.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"KKR vs LSG, IPL 2022 stat attack: Quinton de Kock posts highest score of season, stitches record stand with KL Rahul","content":"Quinton de Kock provided a batting masterclass enroute to a sensational hundred and alongside skipper KL Rahul, fired Lucknow Super Giants to 210 for no loss against Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League in Navi Mumbai on Wednesday.More than 60 games into the IPL, the surfaces are getting tougher for strokeplay and Rahul thought it was better to put runs on the board.Both Rahul and de Kock got the measure of the wicket in the powerplay, reaching 44 for no loss, before flaunting their wide range of strokes on way to their unbeaten 210-run stand, the highest ever opening partnership in the history of the tournament.The South African hammered 10 sixes and as many fours in his 70-ball unbeaten 140, while Rahul collected four sixes and three fours in his 51-ball 68 not out.De Kock, who was dropped by Abhijeet Tomar off Umesh Yadav in the third over, made KKR pay heavily for the lapse. The South African was in his elements smashing the spinners and pacers with equal disdain.He used the pull shot against the faster bowlers and was at his innovative best against the seasoned spin duo of Sunil Narine and off coloured Varun Chakaravarthy.Out of the sixes he hit, de Kock's reverse sweep off Narine stood out. Anything short from the pacers, de Kock was happy to put it away over deep square leg region.The southpaw was in no mood to stop even after reaching three figures. Tim Southee was poor in the death overs as he fed balls after balls in the slot for de Kock to deposit it into the stands.His 19th over yielded as many as 27 runs with de Kock finding the boundary at will.Rahul watched de Kock's breathtaking knock from the best seat in the house. The skipper did not have much to do in the slog overs but he too played some sublime strokes on way to his third half century of the season.In our coverage of the 66th match of IPL 2022, we take a look at some of the key statistics from the game so far:— Quinton de Kock's unbeaten 140, only his second ton in the IPL, is the highest score in the 15th edition of the season, going past Rajasthan Royals opener Jos Buttler's 116 against Delhi Capitals.— De Kock also became the third player after Buttler (627) and Rahul (537) to cross 500 runs this season, jumping to the third spot in the Orange Cap list. The South African has collected three half-centuries so far this season in addition to the century.— The unbroken 210-run stand between de Kock and Rahul is now the highest-ever opening stand in the history of the league. The record had previously belong to Jonny Bairstow and David Warner, who stitched a 185-run stand for the Sunrisers Hyderabad against Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2019.— This is first time in the history of the IPL that not a single wicket fell in the first innings of a match.— Rahul, who remained unbeaten on 68 off 51 balls, became the first Indian to cross the 500-run mark for five consecutive seasons. Only Warner, who achieved the feat in six consecutive appearances, is ahead of him in this list.With inputs from PTIClick here to follow live updates on the KKR vs LSG IPL 2022 matchRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPL Live Score, IPL 2022 schedule, IPL 2022 Points table and Entertainment News.

During the 66th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League at the DY Patil Sports Academy Stadium in Mumbai, the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) wicket-keeper batter Quinton de Kock registered his second century in the marquee league’s history, against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), with the latter’s bowlers literally gasping for their breaths post the end of the innings. Tonking the spinners and pacers alike at a mind-boggling strike rate of 200, de Kock amassed a total of 140 unbeaten runs off mere 70 deliveries, with the assistance of 10 towering Sixes and as many Fours. He stitched together a 210-run partnership- the highest ever in IPL for the 1st wicket , alongside his skipper KL Rahul (68* off 51), as the LSG openers carried their bats playing out all the 20 Overs themselves. While the unbeaten 210-run stand was the highest ever against KKR for any wicket, it was also the third-highest in the history of the tournament for any team. Missing: one white cricket ball, last seen leaving the face of Quinton de Kock’s bat at the speed of light 🥴 #LSGvKKR #epic #TATAIPL — Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) May 18, 2022 The South African batter has been playing the IPL since the 2013 edition, with the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) as his debut team. He played for the Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals), for the next three seasons in 2014, 2015, and 2016, and then for the RCB during the 2018 edition. The 29-year-old became a crucial part of the Mumbai Indians (MI) camp having played for them for the next three seasons – 2019-2021. Ahead of IPL 2022, the Lucknow Super Giants roped him into their side at bidding amount of INR 6.75 Crore. Overall, in his illustrious IPL career, Quinton de Kock has amassed a total of 2,758 runs across 91 matches, at an average and strike rate of 32.44 and 133.94 respectively. He has smashed 19 half-centuries and 2 centuries in the process, with the help of 277 Fours and 105 Sixes.","pubDate":"2022-05-18 16:54:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England cricket chief Key backs captain Stokes and coach McCullum to unlock the talent of Pope","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-10830093/England-cricket-chief-Key-backs-captain-Stokes-coach-McCullum-unlock-talent-Pope.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England are backing the new Test partnership of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum to bring the best out of Ollie Pope in a position he has yet to fill.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-18 16:41:33","image_url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/18/17/57981413-0-image-a-15_1652892087461.jpg","source_id":"dailymailuk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: KKR vs LSG - Quinton de Kock scores his second IPL century; Twitter fails to keep calm","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ipl-2022-kkr-vs-lsg-quinton-de-kock-scores-his-second-ipl-century-twitter-fails-to-keep-calm-kolkata-knight-riders-vs-lucknow-super-giants-2022-05-18-777593","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Quinton de Kock played a monstrous inning for Lucknow Super Giants in the match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Wednesday.

The South African, though, would make the Knight Riders pay dearly for that mistake as he would go on to add another 128 runs to finish unbeaten 140 off just 70 balls — which surely will go down as one of the best in the history of the league.De Kock was ably supported by skipper KL Rahul, who earlier became the first Indian to score 500-plus runs for five consecutive seasons and finished unbeaten on 68 off 51 deliveries. The two were going toe-to-toe in the first half of the innings before de Kock teed off and completely bossed the second half.LSG, as a result, posted a commanding 210/0 after opting to bat — producing the highest-ever opening partnership in the process.Here we take a look at some of the top reactions to De Kock's masterclass on Twitter: What a classic, in Brendon McCullum's last game as KKR coach, a keeper in Quinton de Kock hits an unbeaten 140*#RandomConnections #IPL2022— Nikhil 🏏 (@CricCrazyNIKS) May 18, 2022 I think this is what being \"in the zone\" is. #QuintondeKock. — Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) May 18, 2022  As much as I'm mesmerized by this QdK whirlwind knock, the inner MI fan hurts a bit more. #IPL2022 pic.twitter.com/PY2tFah4XP— Sameer Allana (@HitmanCricket) May 18, 2022 Quinton de Kock❤️ After the 12 months he's had I'm glad he's finding some form and showing some real joy and emotion in his batting again. — Shaun (@Shaun_Analytics) May 18, 2022  This is breathtaking hitting from Quinton de Kock.

The veteran batter shared an unbroken partnership of 165 runs with Litton Das 88*, to guide Bangladesh to 385/3 after Sri Lanka's 397.

KL Rahul and Quinton de Kock would have planned to start steadily and then we can expect either one of them to press on the accelerator and the other one to anchor till the end.

Umesh Yadav has the new ball in hand and is raring to go. Let's play... Andre Russell is down for a quick chat. Russell says that it's been going good so far and the stats are in their place but feels he could have done a bit better in the batting department. Mentions that he doesn't want to think too far ahead but personally would have liked to score a few more runs and will look to do so in this game. Adds that he tries to get a good base to hit boundaries and even if he faces a few dot balls, he doesn't get fazed by it because he has a clear mindset and it's all about being positive. Mentions that in order to become a consistent power-hitter, one needs to have a solid core. Kolkata skipper, Shreyas Iyer says they would have batted first as well. Adds that going by Lucknow's history they aren't the best chasers so wanted to bat first. Mentions that he had a word with the guys and told them that it is the last chance for them to put on a show for all the fans and for the coaching staff as well. Informs that they have just one change which is a forced one - Ajinkya Rahane has been ruled out and Abhijeet Tomar comes in to replace him. KL Rahul, the captain of Lucknow, says that they want to bat as the surface looks dry and in the last few games here, it has been tough to chase. Adds that they want to stay positive and they have done well in the tournament, and a couple of bad games won't change anything. He wants to start fresh and focus on this game. Admits that the middle order has been a concern but at the same time, he adds that they have quality there and he trusts his batters to figure it out. Feels that the pitches have been tricky and starting your inning in the middle order is never easy. Informs that they have three changes - Krunal Pandya (niggle), Dushmantha Chameera and Ayush Badoni make way for Manan Vohra, Evin Lewis and Krishnappa Gowtham. Kolkata (Playing XI) - Venkatesh Iyer, Abhijeet Tomar (In for Ajinkya Rahane), Nitish Rana, Shreyas Iyer (C), Sam Billings (WK), Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Umesh Yadav, Tim Southee and Varun Chakaravarthy. Lucknow (Playing XI) - Quinton de Kock (WK), KL Rahul (C), Deepak Hooda, Manan Vohra (In for Ayush Badoni), Marcus Stoinis, Evin Lewis (In for Dushmantha Chameera), Jason Holder, Krishnappa Gowtham (In for Krishnappa Gowtham), Mohsin Khan, Avesh Khan and Ravi Bishnoi. TOSS - Lucknow have won the toss and they will have a BAT first. We have some team news. As you're already aware that Ajinkya Rahane has been ruled out for the rest of the season and we are seeing Abhijeet Tomar getting his Kolkata cap. He might replace him at the top, or maybe Sam Billings will go back to opening and Tomar will be in the middle order. We can also see Manan Vohra getting his Lucknow cap, so, he will be making his debut for the franchise. PITCH REPORT - Graeme Swann is pitchside. He says it's the last game at this ground. Mentions that the pitch for tonight's game is bang in the middle of the ground with the square boundaries being around 70 meters. Adds that it is the 20th game on this ground so it has gotten a bit tired but because of the red soil, it is still hard. The former English spinner opines that the ball will grip and there will be a good amount of turn. Reckons the team winning the toss will look to bat first. Lucknow seemed to be cruising towards a place in the playoffs at one stage but inconsistent performances against good sides have seen them lose a bit of momentum. They are still sitting in the top four but a loss here can hurt their aspirations of finishing in the top two. Skipper KL Rahul will be looking to regain a bit of lost form himself and end the league stage on a high. Which side will come out on top? We shall find out soon. Stay tuned for toss and team news. Kolkata have found a sort of a second wind in the last few matches and even without the services of their talisman Umesh Yadav, the rest of the players, especially Nitish Rana and Andre Russell have pulled up their socks. Yadav's return in the last game though has only strengthened the side. They are still in the playoffs race but need to win this game to bolster their chances. Kolkata did have a very poor run in the middle phase of the competition and they will hope it doesn't cost them dearly. It's matchday here in the Indian T20 League and in match number 66, two sides gunning for a playoffs spot go head-to-head as Lucknow take on Kolkata at the DY Patil Sports Academy in Navi Mumbai. This is a must-win for Kolkata to stay alive in the competition whereas Lucknow will officially qualify for the playoffs if they win. An exhilarating encounter awaits. On that note, welcome to the coverage. ...

I think it’s absolutely the right thing to do,” Nasser Hussain said on SkySports. “I’d there were other bowlers available, you could have rotated them a fraction. I think it’s absolutely the right thing to do to have Anderson and Broad with that Duke’s ball ready to go.” The post “They were bowling pretty well when they were left out”: Nasser Hussain backs the selection of James Anderson and Stuart Broad in England test team appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-05-18 13:07:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lord's to turn red, white and blue for Queen's Platinum Jubilee","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/lords-to-turn-red-white-and-blue-for-queens-platinum-jubilee/articleshow/91644102.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Lord's will be a sea of red, white and blue during England's first Test against New Zealand next month as the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) joins Britain's celebrations to mark Queen Elizabeth's seven decades on the throne.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-18 12:49:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mushfiqur Rahim becomes first Bangladesh batter to complete 5,000 runs in Test cricket","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/mushfiqur-rahim-becomes-first-bangladesh-batter-to-complete-5-000-runs-in-test-cricket-1951066-2022-05-18?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mushfiqur Rahim 1st Bangladesh batter to complete 5,000 runs in Tests","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-18 12:44:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Lord&#039;s to turn red, white and blue for Queen&#039;s Platinum Jubilee","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/05/18/cricket-lord039s-to-turn-red-white-and-blue-for-queen039s-platinum-jubilee","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LONDON (Reuters) - Lord's will be a sea of red, white and blue during England's first test against New Zealand next month as the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) joins Britain's celebrations to mark Queen Elizabeth's seven decades on the throne.

The 96-year-old, Britain's longest-reigning monarch, marked seven decades as queen in February, and four days of \"Platinum Jubilee\" events to recognise that landmark are being held at the start of June. The MCC announced on Wednesday that floral decorations and bunting around Lord's, known as the Home of Cricket, will be swathed in the colours of the flag during the June 2-6 test. \"As soon as the match dates were announced, we were excited at being given this unique opportunity to join the celebrations,\" said Guy Lavender, MCC Chief Executive & Secretary. \"We are really looking forward to seeing Lord's, and everyone in the ground, decked out in red, white and blue.\" A tree will be planted in the Coronation Garden on the opening day of the match and a \"Platinum Jubilee pudding\" will be available in all premium seating. \"All spectators will be encouraged to join in the celebration by wearing red, white and blue and they will be able to get their hands on their own Lord's Jubilee souvenir...,\" a statement said.

On Sunday, however, they conceded the No 2 spot to the Rajasthan Royals following a 24-run loss at the Brabourne Stadium. They can go back to their old position, and also confirm their qualification for the playoffs should they emerge winners on Wednesday.They will, however, have to sort out the issues in their batting order that was the main cause behind their defeats in their last two outings, which caused them to drop a place in the rankings. LSG were bundled out for a lowly 82 while chasing 145 against GT, and were restricted to 154 after being set 179 to win by RR.Kolkata's hopes of finishing in the top four are very slim given they currently sit at the sixth position with 12 points in hand and their outing against Lucknow is their final league game of the season.A win on Wednesday will bring them level on points with Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore and while they're expected to finish ahead of RCB given the latter's abysmal Net Run Rate, they'll have to hope DC end up losing to Mumbai Indians, or win, but by not too big a margin.Lucknow had outplayed Kolkata the last time these two sides met, on 7 May in Pune, with Shreyas Iyer's men getting bundled out for 101 after being set 177 to win. Lucknow will seek inspiration from this performance when they take to the field on Wednesday, hoping to complete a season double against the two-time champions.Star WatchAndre Russell: The big-hitting Jamaican has been among the biggest entertainers this season, scoring 330 runs at an average of 41.25 with a blistering strike rate of 182.32, making him a prized scalp in the eyes of the LSG attack. What’s more, he has been just as effective with the ball this year, collecting 17 wickets at an average of 13.71, finding himself in the Top 10 in the bowling charts. Russell played a central role in the team’s dominant victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad on Saturday with an unbeaten 49 as well as a haul of 3/22.KL Rahul: The Lucknow skipper has done a fine job as a captain in his franchise' debut season, but his form with the bat in their recent outings will be a cause for worry. Rahul was at one point competing with RR's Jos Buttler for the Orange Cap, scoring two unbeaten 103s along with a couple of half-centuries; his scores in Lucknow's last three outings though have read 0, 8 and 10, which no doubt puts pressure on the rest of the batting lineup. Rahul is due a big score, and he will hope to regain his form in the business end of the tournament and hopefully produce a knock that clinches a playoff spot for his side.Uncapped WatchRinku Singh: Aligarh’s Rinku has definitely made an impact for the Knight Riders as a middle-order batter this season, with his unbeaten 42 in a successful chase against RR being his standout performance. He has scored 134 runs so far this season at an average of 33.5 and a strike rate of 131.37 and can play both the second fiddle when the likes of Russell tee off, or take charge himself. And the team will surely look towards him should the top-order fail to fire on Wednesday.Mohsin Khan: Khan has been having quite the debut season so far, and is among the most impressive youngsters to have emerged in the 15th edition of the league, with 10 wickets to his name from seven outings at an average of 15.20 and an economy just a shade above the six-an-over mark. Khan was having a good run with the ball stretching five games until going wicketless for 43 runs against Rajasthan, a performance from which he’ll hope to bounce back on Wednesday.Quotes\"If you look at our team we have a lot of match-winners, match-winners in the sense that they go and play their role in that particular moment. Be it only three-four overs remaining or in the PowerPlay, it's only about doing your role and sticking to it\"— KL Rahul on the team's batting order after the defeat to RR“Each and every player takes it well, and they have put in their best efforts.
