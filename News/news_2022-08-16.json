Swing-king Anderson fears the lure of easy money in Twenty20 events could shorten the careers of players in the five-day format. PAJames Anderson is not just the oldest swinger in town but also around the globe as he targets Test wickets for England aged 40[/caption] James Anderson fears Test cricket will never see the likes of him and fellow England quickie Stuart Broad againGetty Anderson is poised to become the first specialist quick bowler in 61 years to take an England Test wicket over the age of 40. He has no plans to hang up his bowling boots but believes others are likely to follow the lead of Kiwi star Trent Boult, who last week announced at 33 he plans to play fewer internationals and focus on lucrative franchise events. Asked if there will be another 40-year-old playing for England, Anderson said: “Maybe Broady but definitely not after that because no one will be stupid enough. “With franchise cricket, The Hundred, short forms, I can’t see anyone wanting to play Test cricket this long. I see more and more doing what Trent Boult has done.

The easiest thing for bowlers is to bowl four overs or 20 balls. That takes nothing out of you. “And if you’re getting paid just as well as you would in Test cricket, it probably makes sense. It will tempt more people.” Back in 1961, Derbyshire bowler Les Jackson played the second of his two Tests (the first was in 1949) and his four wickets were the last by a specialist England seamer aged 40. In 1994, Graham Gooch was the most recent 40-plus (he was actually 41) to take a wicket for England but he was mainly a batsman, of course.

He did some TV punditry on England’s white-ball matches in July and during The Hundred. But Anderson could not wait to get back to bowling. He said: “Everyone gets better with experience in whatever walk of life. “I keep working on stuff, playing around with seam positions and different balls, trying to disguise things more so people can’t see the swing. “Forty is just a number. It’s not how I feel — I don’t feel like I’m slowing down. “The last few weeks, I’ve been training hard. In the last  couple of days’ practice here at Lord’s, I feel in great rhythm so hopefully I can show that on the field. “I definitely feel proud of where I’ve got to.  And very fortunate I still have the love for the game and the desire to get better. My passion is still there. My body is functioning properly, allowing me to do the job I love. James Anderson “With a lot of people, that’s the first thing that goes and that’s when you start winding down. “But my passion is still there. My body is functioning properly, allowing me to do the job I love.” England have so far won all four Test matches under captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon “Baz” McCullum with four epic run chases. The Proteas reckon “Bazball” is a myth that will come unstuck. But Anderson added: “I’ve been itching to get back. Those four Tests were incredible. “What we did on the field was great but the energy in the dressing room was brilliant. I felt as happy as I have in an England dressing room for  years. “Everyone feels the same — really excited to get going. “Ben and Brendon know how they want us to play. We’re buying into that and absolutely loving it.” Lord’s will again turn “Red for Ruth” in honour of ex-England captain Andrew Strauss’ late wife and the foundation he set up in her name to help families facing the death of a parent.","pubDate":"2022-08-15 21:56:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Recent Match Report - Rockets vs Phoenix 15th Match 2022 - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuY3JpY2luZm8uY29tL3Nlcmllcy90aGUtaHVuZHJlZC1tZW4tcy1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi0yMDIyLTEyOTkxNDEvYmlybWluZ2hhbS1waG9lbml4LW1lbi12cy10cmVudC1yb2NrZXRzLW1lbi0xNXRoLW1hdGNoLTEyOTkxODUvbWF0Y2gtcmVwb3J00gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Recent Match Report - Rockets vs Phoenix 15th Match 2022  ESPNcricinfoThe Mens and Womens Hundred 2022: Birmingham Phoenix v Trent Rockets - Results, Match Reports and Reactions Monday August 15th  Cricket WorldBirmingham Phoenix vs Trent Rockets, The Hundred Men's Competition 2022: When And Where To Watch Liv..  NDTV SportsRecent Match Report - Rockets vs Phoenix 7th Match 2022  ESPNcricinfoCricket Betting Tips and Fantasy Cricket Match Predictions: Womens Hundred 2022 - Birmingham Phoenix vs Trent Rockets, Match 7: 15th August  Cricket WorldView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-15 20:42:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Game changer: New No.1 sport predicted for summer","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/basketball/basketball-news-2022-all-the-latest-happenings-around-the-nbl/news-story/eb8200e10810ec9d4e504a08f82a97b6","keywords":["Basketball","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"NBL boss Larry Kestelman has thrown down the gauntlet to cricket and the A-League, declaring basketball can become Australia’s No. 1 summer sport.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-15 20:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"No, the Proteas have not come up with a name for how they play Test cricket","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/proteas/no-the-proteas-have-not-come-up-with-a-name-for-how-they-play-test-cricket-4b799490-fd05-4c1a-b649-4cf50a7f582a","keywords":null,"creator":["Stuart Hess"],"video_url":null,"description":"None of the attending media nor Proteas head coach Mark Boucher wanted to say the term ‘Bazball,’ at his press conference on Monday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-15 19:34:53","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/1c1f8362-e842-520d-bcf8-06aff6a288cd&operation=CROP&offset=0x145&resize=2763x1552","source_id":"iol","country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“A bit like an AB de Villiers”: Ricky Ponting rates Suryakumar Yadav at par with de Villiers; considers him a must in India’s T20 World Cup squad","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-a-bit-like-an-ab-de-villiers-ricky-ponting-rates-suryakumar-yadav-at-par-with-de-villiers-considers-him-a-must-in-indias-t20-world-cup-squad/","keywords":["Cricket","AB de Villiers","ICC T20 World Cup 2022","Ricky Ponting","Suryakumar Yadav"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ricky Ponting rates Suryakumar Yadav alongside the legendary AB de Villiers considering his wide range of shots all across the the ground.

Ever since making his T20I debut for India during the home series against England last year in Ahmedabad, where he ramped the English pacer Jofra Archer for a Six on the very first ball of his innings, there has been no looking back for the right-hander. Post the recently concluded tour of England, where he scored his maiden T20I ton at Nottingham, which was also arguably one of the finest T20 knock by an Indian off-late, Yadav again found his mention in the words of praises of fans and experts of the game. Post the limited Overs series against West Indies, the 31-year-old even went on to reach the second spot in the ICC Men’s T20I rankings for batters, just behind the Pakistan skipper Babar Azam. Ricky Ponting rates Suryakumar Yadav at par with de Villiers With the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia just a couple of months away from its commencement, legendary Australian skipper, during an interaction with the ICC, compared Suryakumar Yadav with the legendary Proteas batter AB de Villiers, considering his wide range of shots in all parts of the cricket field. “Surya (Yadav) scores 360 degrees around the ground, a bit like an AB de Villiers did when he was in his actual prime. The lap shots, the late cuts, you know, the ramps over the keeper’s head. He can hit down the ground,” Ponting said. “He hits really well over the leg side, flicks to deep backward square particularly well, and he’s a good player of fast bowling and is a good player of spin bowling,” he further added.

Ponting, as MI coach has seen Yadav enough during his initial years with the franchise. The former Aussie skipper, while stating Yadav as an automatic pick in the Indian squad for the imminent T20 World Cup, also picked batting positions 1,2 or 4 as ideal for him in the team, with Virat Kohli at his traditional no.3 spot. “It’s got to be in the top four, I think. I said stick with him (Virat) in his traditional spot, which has been number three. For Surya, it’s one, two or four. I think he can open, but I think he’s probably, you know, if you could probably just keep him away from the new ball, let him control the middle part of the game outside the Powerplay, through in the middle, and if he’s in at the end, you know what can happens,” remarked Ponting.

Musa Ehizoje, the NCF’s public relations officer, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Monday,l that preparations are in place to host the eight-nation tournament in Abuja. “Nigeria is very ready to host the tournament. The most important aspect of hosting a tournament is already in place, which is the grounds. “We have twin pitches at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja and they are ready,” Mr Ehizoje said. Considering the prevalent security challenges in the country, the NCF official said the ICC was satisfied with the country’s security details. “There are no challenges with regards to security. “Before any country will be given the right to host any tournament, ICC must be comfortable with your security plan and they are comfortable with our security details. “Nigeria can boast of the best security architecture in hosting tournaments as there has never been a case where there are security threats in our competitions both local and international,” he said. Mr Ehizoje said the decision to grant Nigeria the hosting rights was due to her grassroots development efforts in promoting the game. “This is not the first time Nigeria is hosting an ICC qualifier. We hosted the T20 Qualifier A in 2018 in Lagos. “This will be the second time and it is because the world cricket governing body has seen what Nigeria is doing with regards to grassroots cricket development. “Abuja also provides a natural solution to host the competition because of the twin pitches at the stadium and both are turf wickets. “This is a 50 overs competition and you will require a minimum of two pitches at close proximity and that’s why Abuja has been chosen,” Mr Ehizoje added. The tournament is scheduled for 28 September to 9 October.

With the involvement of the Indian owners, fans have been eager to know whether or not the BCCI would tweak their rules to allow Indian players to participate in the South African league. Will MS Dhoni play in CSA T20 league During an interaction with the Indian Express, one of the BCCI officials reiterated the board’s previous stand of not allowing the Indian players – active or retired, to partake in any of the overseas T20 leagues in any capacity, unless they have cut their ties with the BCCI. “It’s clear, no Indian player including domestic players can take part in any other league until he is retired from all forms of the game. If any player wants to take part in these upcoming leagues he can only do so when he cuts off all ties with the BCCI,” a BCCI official told The Indian Express. Discussions were rife on whether the current Chennai Super Kings skipper MS Dhoni can join the Johannesburg Super Kings (owned by the Chennai Super Kings Sports Limited) at least in the capacity of a mentor, if not a player. Responding to the same, the BCCI official remarked, “Then he can’t play IPL for CSK. He has to retire here first.” Thus, for Dhoni, or any other retired Indian player to participate in the CSA T20 league, or any other overseas league, he would have to retire from the IPL first.

During the 14th match of the ongoing The Hundred Men’s competition between the Oval Invincibles and Southern Brave, at the Kennington Oval in London, Brave’s all-rounder Marcus Stoinis seemed to be questioning the legality of Pakistan and Invincibles’ pacer Mohammad Hasnain’s delivery after getting dismissed. During the 61st delivery of the innings, Stoinis (37 off 27) got dismissed off a short delivery bowled by Hasnain, which perhaps got big on him, to ultimately flat-bat it high in the air and caught by the fielder at mid-off. Post the dismissal, Stoinis explicitly seemed to suggest that the Pakistani pacer’s action during his dismissal delivery was a chucking one, for which the latter has been accused of earlier as well and was resultantly also suspended from bowling for a brief period earlier this year. ‘Chucking’ refers to an illegal bowling action which occurs when a bowler throws the ball instead of bowling. As per the ICC rules and regulations regarding illegal bowling actions, a bowler’s action is illegal if his/her elbow extends by an amount of more than 15 degrees between their arm reaching the horizontal and the ball being released. ICC tests the players’ action using high-tech biomechanics and experts to determine the legality. If a bowler is found to be chucking, he/she needs to get their action rectified before they are allowed to take the field once again in international cricket. Chucking in cricket is illegal as it gives an added advantage to the bowlers in the game. If a bowler flexes his/her arm over 15 degrees, he/she gets to generate more pace and thus make it unfairly difficult for the batters to play. Hasnain’s bowling action was reported by umpire Gerard Abood during the Big Bash League (BBL) match between Sydney Thunder and Adelaide Strikers in January this year. After undergoing the Biomechanics tests, it was confirmed by the findings of the Lahore University of Management Sciences, that the pacer was indeed bending his elbow more than the permissible 15 degrees limit by the ICC. After facing suspension from bowling for a brief period, the 22-year-old was declared fit to bowl again following a tweak in his action which met the ICC’s set limit. This is the video of Mohammmad Husnain bowling to Marcus Stoinis and Stoinis signalling that Husnain is chucking.

Strauss, who is currently the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board’s (ECB)cricket committee, took into consideration the expanded two and half months window for the IPL while making the assessment.”One thing we know in other countries, Test cricket doesn’t pay the bills, like it does here,” Strauss told the Daily Telegraph. “The T20 format is the way that a lot of people get introduced to the game in the first place. I still maintain that they can sit together comfortably, Test and T20 cricket. “But the challenge we have is (to provide a) manageable schedule that allows players to do both. That is really complicated. It’s multi-dimensional,” Strauss added. Recently star New Zealand left-arm pacer Trent Boult pulled out of the central contract so that he has more time to play franchise cricket.”It definitely feels like right at the moment, the rate of change is increasing.”And the truth is, none of us know what’s around the corner so you can all look into the future and go, ‘Yeah, we’re going to have this situation where players are signed up to franchises for 12 months of the year and there’s less international cricket.

The first ODI of Pakistan’s tour of Netherlands 2022 will be played in Rotterdam tomorrow. A three-match ODI series will be part of the ongoing ICC Men’s World Cup Super League. Readers must note that both the teams’ last ODI assignments were also a three-match series. While Netherlands had last hosted England in June, Pakistan’s last ODI series was against West Indies at home in the same month. Currently at the fifth position on the points table of the Super League, Pakistan have won nine and lost six out of their 15 ODIs in this period. Netherlands, on the other hand, are reeling at the bottom of the points table due to just two wins and as many as 13 losses out of their 16 matches. Set to resume their ODI rivalry after a mammoth 19 years, the last Netherlands vs Pakistan ODI was played during the ICC Cricket World Cup 2003. Individual three-wicket hauls by the then Pakistan new-ball bowlers Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhtar had played titular roles in bundling out Netherlands for 156 in a 254-run chase. Considering the number of ODIs played between these two teams, there’s not much to be mentioned in the head-to-head segment for this match. A vast gap since their last match also makes mentioning numbers (both for teams and individual players) slightly irrelevant. That being said, it is noteworthy that Netherlands and Pakistan had played an ODI each during the ICC Cricket World Cup 1996 (Lahore), ICC Champions Trophy 2002 (Colombo) and 2003 World Cup (Paarl). 💯% effort in the field to stay on 🔝 #NEDvPAK | #BackTheBoysInGreen pic.twitter.com/mYFNhwJvEz — Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) August 15, 2022 Barring their first-ever ODI, the remaining two matches were played at neutral venues.

It was the Men in Blue’s second ODI World Cup win after 28 years and it came under the captaincy of MS Dhoni. India defeated Sri Lanka by six wickets in the summit clash, which was played at the iconic Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.Notably, to make it to the final, India had got the better of arch-rivals Pakistan in the semi-final match in Mohali. Talking about the high-octane clash, former India spinner Harbhajan Singh revealed how Dhoni’s advice helped him get a crucial breakthrough, which was also his first wicket of the match.After opting to bat first against Pakistan in the semis, India rode on Sachin Tendulkar’s 115-ball 85 to set a challenging 261-run target for the arch-nemesis.During the run-chase, Pakistan lost the plot after a brisk start and were reeling at 106/4. However, their then skipper Misbah-ul-Haq helped the Men in Green to bounce back in the match as he started to build a dangerous-looking partnership with Umar Akmal, who was quick in scoring runs and even smashed a four and two sixes during his stay at the crease.However, Dhoni came up with a master plan that helped Harbhajan to break the partnership between Misbah and Akmal.Some #GreatestRivalry stories are best narrated \"dil se\" by our legends themselves!Relive the banter with @harbhajan_singh, @ImZaheer & @jatinsapru & gear up to #BelieveInBlue for #INDvPAK! #AsiaCup2022 | Aug 28, 6 PM | Star Sports & Disney+Hotstar pic.twitter.com/KPGsicJDoW— Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) August 14, 2022\"It was one of those games where I felt I was getting a bit numb. I had bowled five overs and conceded around 26-27 runs. It was a water break, and Dhoni told me, 'Bhajju pa, aap vahan se daaloge' (around the wicket). Kamran (Umar) was playing good, so was Misbah. And they were scoring runs and the partnership was getting dangerous,\" Harbhajan said as he recalled the moment on Star Sports' Dil Se India.\"So I came to bowl. I remembered God. I just prayed for a win. And God did listen to me. On the very first ball, I got the wicket of Kamran (Umar) Akmal as I bowled around the wicket. He completely missed the ball.\"Interestingly, Akmal’s wicket proved to be the turning point of the match as, after his dismissal, Pakistan’s batting order collapsed as they lost their star all-rounder duo of Abdul Razzaq (3) and Shahid Afridi (19) cheaply, while Misbah (56) tried to hold the fort from the other end. But, it was not enough for the Men in Green as they were bowled out for 231, thus losing the match by 29 runs.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Every day, every week, every month, we’re seeing a new example of how that world is changing,” Strauss said, as the high-performance review he is leading for the ECB prepares to report on the future of the game at elite level. “We’re having to ask ourselves in this country, where does our game fit into that? We [need to] make sure that we have incentives there for our players to play both red- and white-ball cricket. Of course, the ECB have put a lot of time and attention and effort into [giving] the Hundred the potential to be a global short-form event that matches any of these other leagues. “One of the things that we need to be conscious of in the game in this country is we have to be nimble and adaptable. And we can’t afford to be slow moving and have our heads in the sand. That’s really important – that we set the game up in a way that allows us to be flexible because ultimately players, if they’ve got many opportunities, will always look at those opportunities side by side and decide what’s best for them. “We need to continue promoting all the brilliant things cricket in this country offers players – we want to have a strong domestic game and we want to make sure the players are playing the right balance of formats so that it’s not all drifting down that white-ball, short-form route.” Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though some think it will prove impossible for Test and ODI cricket to continue in their current forms given the amount of T20 matches being scheduled – the former India coach Ravi Shastri, for example, suggested last month that the number of Test-playing nations should be halved from its current 12 – Strauss said he feels more optimistic. “I still maintain they can sit together comfortably, Test cricket and T20 cricket. But the challenge we have is, can we produce a manageable schedule that allows players to do both? That is really complicated. It’s multi-dimensional. It’s like a big Rubik’s Cube.” Richard Thompson’s in-tray: key tasks for ECB chair with cricket in turmoil Read more After winning their first four Tests of the summer against New Zealand and India, England’s Test side will get another opportunity to demonstrate their recent improvement when the three-Test series against South Africa starts at Lord’s on Wednesday. Spectators at the second day will be invited to wear red in support of the Ruth Strauss Foundation , set up by the former England captain after the death of his wife, Ruth. The foundation aims to assist families facing the death of a parent and to encourage research into non-smoking lung cancers. “It’s early days and there are still a lot of areas of improvement,” Strauss, who was England’s director of cricket for three years, said of the Test team’s upturned fortunes under the captaincy of Ben Stokes and with Brendon McCullum as coach. “It’s just brilliant to see players playing with a smile on their face, enjoying the challenge, not worried so much about what might go wrong. “They’re more excited about doing things that haven’t been done before – pioneering, changing the face of the game or however you want to describe it. The more you have that mindset in the dressing room the more confidence builds, the more you are able to do extraordinary things.
