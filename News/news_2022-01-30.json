Peshawar Zalmi will lock horns against Islamabad United in the league game of the PSL 2022. The match will be played at the National Cricket Stadium in Karachi. Peshawar Zalmi won their first game, whereas Islamabad United will start their campaign from this game. The game will be live on Sony Six from 2.30 PM IST. Who will win today PSL 2022 match: Peshawar Zalmi vs Islamabad United Pitch Report The average 1st innings T20 score at this ground is 167 runs. There’s a lot of dew factor thing in this time of the season, and batting will be easier in 2nd innings. Out of 35 T20 games played here, 26 games are won by the chasing teams. Peshawar Zalmi preview Peshawar Zalmi lost in the final last year, and they won their first game of this season. This batting of this side is excellent for the T20 format. Tom Kohler-Cadmore has been a constant T20 performer, but the way Yasir Khan batted was terrific. Haider Ali and Shoaib Malik will handle the middle-order, whereas Hussain Talat and Sherfane Rutherford will play the role of finishers. Usman Qadir is the leading spinner, but the pace department looks quite weak in this game. Probable XI: Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Yasir Khan, Haider Ali, Shoaib Malik, Hussain Talat, Sherfane Rutherford, Ben Cutting, Sameen Gul, Pat Brown, Sohail Khan, Usman Qadir. The winning moment #PSL7 | #YellowStorm | #PZvsQG pic.twitter.com/g7gDt0ldRr — PeshawarZalmi (@PeshawarZalmi) January 28, 2022 Islamabad United preview Islamabad United will start their PSL 2022 campaign from this game. This team looks well balanced on the paper. Alex Hales is coming on the back of a brilliant BBL 11, whereas Raheem Stirling and Rahmanullah Gurbaz are also terrific T20 players. Asif Ali proved his class in the T20 World Cup, whereas the addition of Azam Khan is a bonus. Shadab Khan will take care of spin duties, whereas there are pacers like Hasan Ali, Merchant de Lange, Faheem Ashraf, and Mohammad Wasim Jr in the team. Probable XI: Alex Hales, Raheem Stirling, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Asif Ali, Mubasir Khan, Azam Khan, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Ali, Merchant de Lange.

One run from Dean’s over as the lead climbs towards one fifty. 36th over: Australia 106-3 (Mooney 56, Lanning 2) Ecclestone continues, Lanning off the mark by flicking square. Then gets strike back and produces a nice square drive to the deep sweeper. 35th over: Australia 103-3 (Mooney 55, Lanning 0) Charlie Dean bowls a maiden over to Mooney, who is blocking everything. 34th over: Australia 103-3 (Mooney 55, Lanning 0) Ecclestone finishes her over with a couple of hand grenades to Meg Lanning, or so it seems. Very watchful. Australia lead by 143. You’d think England have left their run too late. Finally they get one. Hits Perry low as she stretches forward, and in front. She talks to Mooney and then walks off. But she was a long way forward! And they have three reviews in hand. Why wouldn’t you check that one? Anyway, she’s given herself out. 33rd over: Australia 103-2 (Perry 41, Mooney 55) Charlie Dean on for a bowl, tossing it up and drawing Mooney into a drive to deep cover for two. 32nd over: Australia 101-2 (Perry 41, Mooney 53) Down on one knee goes Mooney, miscuing a sweep from Ecclestone for a single. Perry defends the rest. England appeal for a couple of pad strikes, no love. 31st over: Australia 100-2 (Perry 41, Mooney 52) Kate is certainly cross right now. Chances spurned. She bowls a floaty full one that Perry dismisses through cover. Australia’s three figures come up. 30th over: Australia 95-2 (Perry 37, Mooney 51) England lose another review after Perry stretches forward in defence and comes close to edging a ball behind. But doesn’t. We had a check for a stumping as well. Perry survives. More runs come. Mooney edges a couple away to raise her 50. The lead is 132. Mooney pulls away another run. 29th over: Australia 91-2 (Perry 36, Mooney 48) Still three slips and a point for Perry, the gully has been taken out. Bowls outside off and now Perry is dropped! Ohhhhh my. Amy Jones again. Perry goes hard at it, thick edge going towards first slip. Jones the keeper has every right to go for the catch but her footwork looks slow, she has to dive, and she gets one glove to it without taking it in. All the drops in the first innings, now these ones: in short, England have not been good enough to win. 28th over: Australia 86-2 (Perry 31, Mooney 48) Ecclestone gets an appeal sent upstairs as Mooney comes forward with bat and pad together and is hit in line. Umpire Graham-Smith says not out and the soundwave tech suggests there might have been a tiny inside edge. Could also have been the bat hitting ground or boot or something. I don’t know whether it would have hit the stumps because we didn’t see the ball-tracking afterwards. 27th over: Australia 86-2 (Perry 31, Mooney 48) Cross has to find the calm to continue. Hit Mooney on the pad but there’s some edge involved. Finding a better length to Perry as well. 26th over: Australia 83-2 (Perry 31, Mooney 45) Ecclestone continuing, and they collect a couple of singles. 25th over: Australia 81-2 (Perry 30, Mooney 44) Cross in to Mooney after drinks, and she’s dropped by Jones! Straightforward chance for the keeper, one sidestep, normal height, and it hits her wrist and flies away for four runs. That is an awful miss. Mooney was on 40. 24th over: Australia 76-2 (Perry 29, Mooney 40) A couple of false shots against Ecclestone, Mooney top-edging the cut and then top-edging the pull, but lots of gaps and it all ends well for the batter. Drinks. 23rd over: Australia 70-2 (Perry 28, Mooney 35) Perry has been quiet for a while, but comes back to life with a perfect straight drive for four. Just past the non-striker’s stumps and down the ground from Cross. The partnership goes up to 58 with a couple of singles thrown in as well. 22nd over: Australia 64-2 (Perry 23, Mooney 34) The left-hander is happier to play shots against the spinner, tugging into the leg side for two on a couple of occasions. 21st over: Australia 60-2 (Perry 23, Mooney 30) Kate Cross on to replace Sciver. Mooney isn’t shy about playing shots to Cross, but keeps finding the field until a single off the last ball. 20th over: Australia 59-2 (Perry 23, Mooney 29) No run from Ecclestone’s over, as Perry is happy to wait it out. They’re being very cautious against England’s premier spinner. 19th over: Australia 59-2 (Perry 23, Mooney 29) A few really nice shots from Mooney today, and that’s the best of them as she steps into a cover drive for four. Add that to a brace through square leg. Sciver can’t put the brakes on. 18th over: Australia 53-2 (Perry 23, Mooney 23) Ecclestone to Mooney, another over with only a single as Mooney is largely happy to defend. Brunt has been off the field for a few overs but comes back on now. Danni Wyatt was the sub. 17th over: Australia 52-2 (Perry 23, Mooney 22) Sciver to Perry, who clips two more runs off her legs to deep square in an otherwise tidy over. 16th over: Australia 50-2 (Perry 21, Mooney 22) Ecclestone around the wicket to the left-hander,t rying to turn in to Mooney with a short leg in place Leg slip and a regulation slip as well. England need this wicket. The day is getting warmer too, still sticky and humid. No run from the over. 15th over: Australia 50-2 (Perry 21, Mooney 22) Sciver tries to bang in a few balls, make something happen by hitting the pitch. Finds swing when she pitches up as well. Three singles regardless. 14th over: Australia 47-2 (Perry 20, Mooney 21) Ecclestone comes on and slows the scoring immediately, Perry fishing without much contact at a few balls after a Mooney single. Chris Mackenzie-Davey takes passionately to his keyboard. “In response to Tim’s comments on Canberra yesterday: been living here for 20 years and take from a local, it’s fantastic. World class galleries and museums, vibrant arts scene, fantastic restaurants and fresh food markets, superb wine district, wonderful parks and gardens, national parks and bush reserves everywhere, five universities with campuses, incredible local region to explore including NSW south coast, Snowy Mountains and a myriad of other things to do and see. What’s not to love! Only things lacking are first-class cricket and an A-League football team. Oh, and we have Australia’s best beer!” Pretty sure the smaller breweries in most Australian cities would all have a decent claim to that last part, but the rest is true enough. Also when Canberrans complain about “peak hour” traffic for a five-minute delay it’s quite funny. Bloody cold in winter though, and can be bloody hot in summer. No escape on the great inland plains. 13th over: Australia 46-2 (Perry 20, Mooney 20) Sciver to replace Brunt, but it doesn’t start well as she overpitches and gets smoked through cover for four. Perry’s most convincing shot of the morning. Finds some outswing but Perry reaches for it and guides four through the gap at gully. Catches up to Mooney’s score. 12th over: Australia 38-2 (Perry 12, Mooney 20) Short ball from Shrubsole down the leg side, money for jam, but Mooney can’t catch up with it. Mooney is happy to leave most everything else. 11th over: Australia 38-2 (Perry 12, Mooney 20) A clever shot from Mooney, opening the face of her bat and diverting crisply behind point for four, and that was a decent enough ball from Brunt. A few singles as well, Mooney is keeping things moving. 10th over: Australia 31-2 (Perry 11, Mooney 14) Again Perry flings a drive at Shrubsole and very nearly edges behind again. The batting machine is not purring. Gets another thick outside edge past gully for a couple of runs. 9th over: Australia 29-2 (Perry 9, Mooney 14) A bit streaky and a bit controlled from Perry, driving with the outswing of Brunt to divert the ball along the ground past gully for four runs. Then it should be a dot ball as Perry clips to midwicket but Kate Cross lets it through her hands for three. We noticed she left a half-eaten banana on the boundary at fine leg, so perhaps there was some fruit-related slipperiness involved. 8th over: Australia 21-2 (Perry 2, Mooney 14) Nearly out, Mooney, with a big bottom-handed drive aimed at mid-on. Misses it and it nearly takes the inside edge to the keeper. Shrubsole follows up with a peach to Perry that nearly takes the outside edge. Survival time. 7th over: Australia 20-2 (Perry 2, Mooney 13) A solid thunk from Mooney’s bat as she strides forward and cover-drives Brunt, but straight at the fielder. Can’t get a run until a flick to leg from the sixth ball. 6th over: Australia 19-2 (Perry 2, Mooney 12) Shrubsole to partner Brunt, swinging one in that almost gets Perry in trouble lbw as well. Just gets some bat onto it for a single. Shrubsole bowls a right-hander’s line to the left-handed Mooney, who glances off her leg stump for four. 5th over: Australia 13-2 (Perry 0, Mooney 7) Just a couple of Brunt deliveries to finish the over that was interrupted yesterday, as the bowler appeals for one that hits the middle of Perry’s bat. It will be Perry and Mooney to resume, with Brunt bowling. Three slips, gully, point, cover, mid-off, mid-on, long leg. Running my eye over Manuka Oval, all looks good here. Plenty of green still on the surface, and some ragged patches at both ends of the strip. Is there enough there for the bowlers to force enough mistakes? That is the question. But at least, unlike most pitches we’ve seen in this format, there is a fair chance. Here’s my match report from yesterday’s play, which was great while it lasted. Good Canberra morning, nuffies. Here we are from the Australian capital once again, and the first thing I need to report to you is that it isn’t raining. Not now, at least. The forecast suggests showers could happen at any point during the day, though the radar isn’t showing much at present. So who knows. We lost two full sessions yesterday to rain, right at a very exciting part of the day, which has taken the air out of the game. The paths to a win for either team from here are: one, an 18-wicket day in which England fall short. Two, eight Australian wickets by perhaps an hour after lunch, and England have time to chase. Right now the Aussies are 52 runs ahead and two wickets down, and England will resume with rested bowlers and an almost new ball. So who knows.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec436b5cfb86f6b9096b5123a3fcaf855e516ce/0_83_4115_2471/master/4115.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=155a63dee2637d12fdb798007a01ebba","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Australia fight off COVID U-19 for WC semi","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-fight-off-covid-u-19-for-wc-semi-c-5496412","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia are hopeful all players will be available for their Under-19 Cricket World Cup semi-final against India, after COVID-19 infections among the group.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-29 22:26:11","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5496412/e8a5343b307d449239e85892c2d989db46f93767-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow"},{"title":"Australia fight off COVID U-19 for WC semi","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-fight-off-covid-u-19-for-wc-semi-c-5496408","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia are hopeful all players will be available for their Under-19 Cricket World Cup semi-final against India, after COVID-19 infections among the group.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-29 22:26:10","full_description":"Australian officials are hopeful ambidextrous spinner Nivethan Radhakrishnan will be among the players available again for selection for their Under-19 Cricket World Cup semi-final, after the squad was infiltrated by COVID-19. It's understood the virus has infected at least four Australia players during the tournament in the Caribbean, causing selection headaches in the past fortnight. Australia will play India in Wednesday's semi-final, after the sub-continent powerhouse sealed their spot in the last four with a five-wicket win over Bangladesh. But Australian officials will hope the outbreak in their group has been brought under control and will have limited impact on the grand-final qualifier. Fast bowler Tom Whitney missed Australia's must-win group match with Scotland after contracting the virus, but was able to return for the quarter-final win over Pakistan on Friday. Radhakrishnan has missed both the Scotland and Pakistan games, with Australian staff hopeful he will be out of isolation and recovered to face India. The Tasmania spinner is one of Australia's best players, also batting in the top and middle order. Middle-order batter Isaac Higgins also missed the Pakistan clash after contracting the virus, while a fourth unnamed player has been isolated. Australia are not alone in being impacted by COVID-19 during the tournament. India were without 12 players for their clash with Uganda and had to call in six reserves to play with the non-infected members of their squad. Other countries have also had positive tests, while Canada have been forced to pull out of the playoffs for lower spots due to a lack of available players. Australia's preparations for the tournament had already been heavily impacted by the virus, with no full-squad camps or national tournaments in the past two years. The team went into the tournament with just one warm-up match against India after not playing together in the months prior, while other sides played in lead-in tournaments. \"We haven't been as as lucky as a lot of the other countries,\" in-form opener Teague Wyllie told AAP. \"Those guys have already played 20 or 25 games together. We played three or four. \"So we basically just have to go out there and string performances together a lot earlier than a lot of other nations have had to. \"We've just got to make the most of it with the time we've got over here, and I think a lot of the boys are cherishing the time we get together.\"","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5496408/e8a5343b307d449239e85892c2d989db46f93767-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest"},{"title":"Mitchell Starc, Ashleigh Gardner win top Cricket Australia awards","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mitchell-starc-ashleigh-gardner-win-top-cricket-australia-awards/article38347216.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["PTI"],"video_url":null,"description":"Gardner first indigenous person to get Clark award","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-29 21:38:12","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu"},{"title":"India book semi-final spot v Australia","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/india-book-semifinal-spot-v-australia/video/7848d4239b4f9b57b731fb1419ace96c","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Australia will play India in the semi-finals of the Men's U19 World Cup after India eliminated Bangladesh by 5 wickets at Coolidge Cricket Ground in Antigua.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-29 21:04:08","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost"},{"title":"India book semi-final spot v Australia","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/india-book-semifinal-spot-v-australia/video/7848d4239b4f9b57b731fb1419ace96c","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Australia will play India in the semi-finals of the Men's U19 World Cup after India eliminated Bangladesh by 5 wickets at Coolidge Cricket Ground in Antigua.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-29 21:04:08","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Under-19 World Cup 2022: India beat Bangladesh by 5 wickets, to meet Australia in semifinal","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/under-19-world-cup-india-beat-bangladesh-by-5-wickets-to-meet-australia-in-semifinal-2022-01-30-757011","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India's Kaushal Tambe (11*) finished off in style with a six to get the 'Boys in Blue' a convincing five-wicket win against Bangladesh in the second quarter-final of the ongoing Under-19 World Cup 2022 here at Coolidge Cricket Ground, Antigua.

As India emerged victorious against the Tigers on Sunday, Yash Dhull and Co. will now meet Australia in the second semifinal of the high-octane tournament on February 2, Wednesday. Much to the expectations, IND U19 vs BAN U19 game turned out to be a low scoring match on a turf that had a plenty to offer for the bowlers. India righteously encashed on their decision to bowl after winning the toss as they staggered Bangladesh for just 111 runs. The bowling friendly-deck laden with the green cover and moisture absorbed in it was exploited well by the Indian bowlers. Right from the start, India's pace duo comprising Rajvardhan Hangargekar and Ravi Kumar kept Bangladesh under the pump who were reeling at 20 runs with the loss of three wickets in the powerplay. While the left arm quick- Ravi Kumar alone jolted Bangladesh's top three batsmen for a few runs, Vicky Ostwal's two wickets combined with overall economic bowling enabled India bundle Bangladesh for 111 runs. Not much can be talked about Bangladesh's performance with the willow who were badly struggling until SM Meherob (30) and Ashiqur Zaman (16) jammed a 50-run partnership to bring the Tigers out of the choppy waters. Barring Aich Mollah (17), SM Meherob and Ashiqur Zaman the rest of Bangladesh's batters departed in single digit scores. Chasing 112 runs, India weren't even off the mark and lost their opener Harnoor Singh (0) for a duck. Angkrish Raghuvanshi (44) and the vice-captain Shaik Rasheed (26) then steadied India's ship with a 70-run partnership between them before Bangladesh pacer Ripon Mondol came firing on all cylinders to jolt the Indian side. Besides getting the breakthrough, Mondol claimed four wickets and removed Angkrish, Rasheed, Siddarth Yadav (6) & Raj Bawa (0). Just when India suffered some turbulence in the middle overs, skipper Yash Dhull (20*) stood tall. With thin support from the other end, Dhull along with Kaushal Tambe managed to get India across the finising line with a victory.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"ICC U19 World Cup: Young pacer Ravi wreaks havoc as India oust defending champions Bangladesh to enter se - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9uZXdzL2ljYy11MTktd29ybGQtY3VwLXJhdmkta3VtYXItYW5na3Jpc2gtcmFnaHV2YW5zaGktc2hpbmUtYXMtaW5kaWEtYmVhdC1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLXRvLWZhY2UtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWluLXNlbWlzL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg5MjExMDg2LmNtc9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"ICC U19 World Cup: Young pacer Ravi wreaks havoc as India oust defending champions Bangladesh to enter se  Times of IndiaU-19 World Cup: India vs Bangladesh Preview  NEWS9 liveIndia U19 vs Bangladesh U19 Live Streaming Details- ICC U19 World Cup 2022  Cricket AddictorHighlights, India vs Bangladesh, ICC U19 Cricket Wor..

During the grand final of the Legends Cricket League 2022 between Asia Lions and the World Giants at the Al Amerat Cricket Ground, it is the World Giants, who comfortably prevailed by 26 runs to lift the silverware. The only aspect of the game which went the Lions’ way was the Toss before the start of play, as Misbah-ul-Haq invited the Giants to bat first only to witness absolute carnage from Darren Sammy’s men from the field of action. It all began with a Kevin Pietersen (48 off 22) onslaught as he propelled the Giant’ total to 64/2 after the end of the Powerplay. But, with the fall of Pietersen’s wicket, and the scorecard reading 65/3, the match seemed to be tilting towards the Lions’ way, given the way scores even in excess of 200 have been chased down in the previous matches. But, things went on a continuous downward spiral for Misbah, ever since the threatening dark cloud in the form of a certain Corey Anderson decided not only to descend at the Al Amerat Ground, but also accompany with quite a few lightning strikes. He came down heavily on the Lions’ bowling attack with an absolute belter of an innings of 94* off 43 deliveries, laden with 7 Fours and 8 sixes. His aggressive partnerships alongside Brad Haddin (37 off 16), skipper Darren Sammy (38 off 17) and Albie Morkel (17* off 8) meant that the World Giants went on to post a massive 256/5 off their 50 Overs. In reply, the Asia Lions, knowing fully well how they had to approach the chase, did start well with Sanath Jayasuriya (38 off 23) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (25 off 16) posting 59/1 in the Powerplay. But, with the required run-rate skyrocketing with every passing Over, someone had to play an Anderson-like innings to get anywhere close to target, which unfortunately for them, was not to come by in the night of the final, as the Asia Lions finished their innings at 231/8. Pakistan’s Mohammad Yousuf (39* off 21) was the highest scorer for the Lions, while for the Giants, Albie Morkel (4-0-35-3) was the pick of the bowlers. WG vs AL | Match Result The World Giants have claimed their victory in the ultimate battle of the legends. The war is over and the giants stand tall with their victory flag proudly hoisted. WG won by 25 runs #GameOfGOATs #Howzat #LegendsLeagueCricket #LLCT20 #T20Cricket — Legends League Cricket (@llct20) January 29, 2022 Man of the series Legends Cricket League 2021 For his 8 wickets across 5 innings, at an average of 17.75 and economy rate of 7.88, the former South African and World Giants pacer Morne Morkel was awarded the ‘Legend of the tournament’. He was the joint highest wicket-taker alongside Asia Lions’ Nuwan Kulasekara, who also picked up an equal number of wickets, at a comparatively better average than Morkel’s at 16.62. But, perhaps being part of the winning side, it was Morkel who got the edge over the Sri Lankan to bag the ‘Man of the series’ award.

Ash Barty has become the first Australian to win a singles title Down Under in over 40 years. And the last time anybody else even really threatened was 2005 and the moment was a bit too big for Lleyton Hewitt. That feels like a lifetime ago.Jon Wertheim: The big threat after Lleyton Hewitt and before today was, well, Ash Barty, who has been the No. 1 seed before and had entered the Australian Open as a major champion before, and she got to the latter rounds and just the moment seemed to get to her. This tournament? It didn't. For seven matches, she dropped zero sets. Her serve was broken only three times all tournament. She's the No. 1 and she played like it. And she didn't really have a tough set the entire tournament until the 14th out of 14, and she ended up coming through in a tiebreaker. So she is really unequivocally the world number one and now is one major away from a career Grand Slam.CA: So Barty’s story is well-trodden—she took a break in her teens to play cricket after it seemed like her career wasn't really coming along the way she wanted it to, and then came back and burst onto the scene at a bit of a later age. Now I think Ash Barty is clearly the top player in the world and the force that needs to be reckoned with going into the two non-hard court majors—both of which she’s won already.JW: She's not wired like other players. She's very difficult not to like. There's literally nothing not to like about her…There was chatter over the last few days that maybe she might retire. Maybe she says, I can't think of a better way to go…I’m newly married, and it's been fun. I know that she really has struggled with life during COVID and living away from home, she's kind of like, by her own admission, she's a homebody. And she's playing on a different timetable. And part of that means, Yeah, I'm taking a year off in the middle of my career to see how badly I really want it. Part of that timetable means going months and months and months without going back to Australia, because of COVID and some of that timetable is who knows, I mean, she could play 15 more years if she wanted to, and it also wouldn't surprise a lot of people if we were closer to the end than the beginning.CA: I mean, in a way that's kind of refreshing, right? We're seeing athletes who are threatening to play professional sports into their 50s…Seems like it's been a while since we've seen someone in tennis hang it up before they've had to. To see somebody say: You know what, I think this was great, but there are other things I can do with myself, that's kind of cool in its own way.JW: I think: What's your motivation now? It might be to win a career slam, but if she retired today she would be in the Hall of Fame. I don’t know, maybe the competition and the desire for self improvement is enough. Maybe she becomes one of those players that chases history. But yeah, you're right. I mean, very few champions retire early anymore. Pete Sampras sort of did his mic drop retirement, but he was in his 30s.CA: Right, and clearly regressing in a lot of ways.JW: Barty doesn't turn 26 until April. But I think the other question is just: I don't know how people beat her. I mean, she has so many dimensions to her game. That slice she hits is absolutely nasty. She has the best serve in women's tennis right now. And given the way she competed and dealt with pressure and expectation, the mind really reels thinking of how many more of these she could win.CA: Another factor I feel like here is the machine, and how much it will wince at the idea of letting her go. And maybe she's an independently willed person, or has a group of people around her who don't care about squeezing every last dollar out of her career enough to make it an issue. But like, when you're this good and you're in an era of women's tennis that's been looking for the successor to Serena for a few years now, when the machine finds someone, it's going to be hesitant to say: all the marketing doesn't matter, all the opportunities to sell this, it doesn't matter. Just go ahead and have fun. I mean that's just really impressive if she really doesn't care that much… if she's willing to give up a lot of the fame, a lot of the money, a lot of the legacy-making projects that prominent athletes are investing in a lot now.JW: I think one of the other factors that we don't often consider is: this one month notwithstanding, it's a long way from home for most of the year. I mean, even for the American players to pop over to Europe is nothing compared to traveling to Australia. And I think that's part of it, too: You can't get knocked out of the French Open, go back to Florida for two weeks, and then go back to Wimbledon. That's not really an option when your home base is in Australia.CA: I don't think it's a coincidence that another player who has talked about hating the grind of the tour for years, saying: Yeah, I don't know if I like this so much, maybe I'll retire, is Nick Kyrgios, who, we should mention, also just won a title, in men’s doubles, at the Open. Big year for the Australians in Australia. But he's also someone who is a homebody, who likes being around his his mom, who likes goofing off, likes having more of a normal life…I hadn't really considered this being a factor in all of that before but I'm sure, the travel takes a toll even more for the Australians.JW: Yeah, I mean, this is the drawback of being a global sport. If you’re playing a team sport, maybe you'll drive home from the Staples Center and stay in your home. And I think sometimes tennis can seem glamorous and the players are posting from Rome one week and Dubai the next, but living out of a bag sacks and I think especially after last year with all the COVID protocols I think that really took a toll.We should also give a tip of the hat to Danielle Collins. Now she’s in the top 10, she’s the top-ranked American. She's really intense. She really likes to compete. She's kind of a jock that is wired to compete and that serves her very well.CA: She made a run at this tournament a few years ago, and now she’s taken the next step.

That is the reason why he has thrown himself in the mega auction to try his luck. Dorji started receiving calls as soon as his friends came to know his name is in the auction and then he had to tell tham that is just the initial round and the final list will be out after some days. Two days earlier, Dorji posted a photo with CSK captain MS Dhoni and shared an anecdote from the time he met the former Indian captain. In that photo, Dorji is seen posing with MS Dhoni and both are holding a signed Bhutan team jersey. \"Keep it simple. Focus more on the process and less on the results. If you get the process right you will get the result. And enjoy, don’t take too much pressure. Ever since the great MS Dhoni gave me this piece of advice, it has always stuck with me,\" Dorji captioned the post. A post shared by Ranjung mikyo dorji (@mikyo_dorji) The Bhutanese cricketer says that he has submitted his name to be taken in auction but he does not feel he will make the cut into the final list. \"Playing in the IPL is an ultimate dream for me. People saw that there was one player in the auction list from Bhutan and my friends started calling me. But they don’t know (laughs) that this is just the initial round, and the names are going to be shortlisted further. If I am honest to myself, my name will not be there in the main list after it is trimmed.

During the fortnight that ended a 44-year wait, Barty had her full repertoire on display. The kick serve aka “the hopper”. The one-handed slice, two-handed drive backhands. The forehand dripping with heavy topspin. Risky drop shots, opportune volleys, and the all elite overhead. The shot that generated the most buzz, however, was played during practice: Barty casually tucked the tennis ball off her hip, a textbook leg glance, pointed elbow and all. 🎾 x 🏏 @ashbarty • #AusOpen • #AO2022 pic.twitter.com/bUb1gqwxjH — #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 22, 2022 “It was a sweet little glance, wasn’t it?” laughs Andy Richards, cricket coach, proud Queenslander and a “fairweather tennis fan”. Richards, who trained Barty during her brief switch to cricket, gushes over his ward’s exploits at the Melbourne Park. “She’s looked awesome. I think just in the last couple of years, she’s got so much more mature,” Richards says on the phone, minutes before the start of the final, from his Brisbane home where he’s putting out “beverages” for friends who’d come over to watch history being made. “Whatever happens, Australia is excited for her. We tend to put a fair bit of pressure on our people… I just think people will be happy for her because she’s just a genuine, really good human being. We have people all across the world that get a bit taken aback as to how she presents herself. And I can tell you from experience that how she presents is exactly how she is.” https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png “An 18-year-old with the maturity of a 30-year-old” was Richards’ first impression of Barty. It was 2015, and Barty was a doubles contender (she reached three Grand Slam finals) and a singles’ prospect, when she walked away from a sport she had been playing since she was 4. Exhausted with the rigours of the Tour, she did not seek a protected ranking, but didn’t throw away her racquets either. Barty was coaching kids when she was invited to speak at the national women’s cricket team dinner. Check Out Express Premium Weekly Sports Newsletter: Why Mohammad Asif, Why? Govind Ballabh Pant, freedom fighter and first UP CM Sundance 2022: Only Indian film to compete is a kite’s-eye view of Delhi pollution Click here for more There, she told Queensland cricketers Jess Jonassen, Delissa Kimmince and Beth Mooney: “I really wouldn’t mind giving cricket a go.” “It was half a throwaway line, half-serious chat. The girls came back and told me,” says Richards, who was the coach of Queensland Fire and was putting together the team for Brisbane Heat for the inaugural Women’s Big Bash that year. “I’d tried it with a few different sportspeople before so I thought we would give it a go. She came in and we just had a coffee and then I said okay, we’ll organise to have a hit and see what she looked like.” At the hit, Barty, kitted up in borrowed gear, faced 150 deliveries. Richards reckons she missed three. 🎾 x 🏏 @ashbarty • #AusOpen • #AO2022 pic.twitter.com/bUb1gqwxjH — #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 22, 2022 “She’d never played the game, except for some backyard cricket. And during that first hit, she was probably already better than the bottom third of my squad. I asked her if she would like to come and train and she said no, not until she’d had another four or five hits,” says Richards. “She didn’t want to embarrass herself. She also didn’t want to put anybody out.” Barty soon earned the spot. The next challenge was to earn camaraderie. “Fitting into such a competitive environment is not always easy. The girls are not always necessarily accepting of people coming in from outside. A couple of our girls had a fair bit of friendly banter with Ash, and she gave back as much as she got. It seemed like she had been with the team for years. That’s not an easy thing to do in a group of competitive sporting women. But she did it seamlessly.” Barty, expectedly, was “a coach’s dream”. “An extraordinarily talented woman, her hand-eye coordination is as good as I’ve seen from a crossover sport point of view. Elite athletes like her have awareness about where their body needs to be, to execute their skill,” says Richards, who has also worked with Pakistan women’s team as an assistant coach and batting consultant. A cursory glance at Barty’s game is enough to reveal why she was able to transfer her skills from the court to the pitch. How the 5’5 all-courter goes toe-to-toe with stronger specimens, getting on top of the bounce to ‘flat bat’ the forehand. How she bends and picks the ball with a double backhand, sometimes on the half-volley, and powers it deep cross-court. “Obviously, the cow corner, sort of wide mid-on was a strength. But for me, it was her ability to play straight. At the back end of that first session, I said ‘I just want you to hit them as hard as you can as straight as you can’. Immediately, she got her body in position. Clearing the front leg and hitting it straight.” On her debut for the Heat, Barty scored a 27-ball 39 — “There was a six that she hit straight out of the Junction Oval,” Richards recalls, “men are happy to hit the ball as far as she did that day ” — but had a largely indifferent season. The media attention around her, however, helped jumpstart the tournament. “She added so much more to our sport from a professional point of view. We were at that crossroads, sort of moving into full professionalism in women’s cricket, and she was able to add a whole different perspective for the girls and us as well.” But what did Barty get out of her cricketing sojourn? She has previously said that the 18 months away from tennis made her “a better person, on and off the court. A better tennis player.” Richards believes cricket gave Barty a sense of belonging, and teammates for life. “We’ve had a couple of chats about it. She’s very much a team-oriented person. If we look at her love for her family, her indigenous cultural background, there’s a strong feeling of belonging in all of that. In tennis, she didn’t have that as a young girl growing up, spending a lot of time away, overseas without a really strong network,” Richards says. Tennis is considered an individual sport. But you’ll notice that when she talks, she always says ‘we’. She talks about her team. I think she had a lot of fun with us, she had a lot of freedom. And she’s carried that forward.” In an interview with the New York Times, given during her Big Bash days, Barty said: “Everyone is part of the squad, and when you’ve got 15, 16 girls around each other, everyone pushes each other on. It was a very good dynamic from the get-go, and I was just very lucky that they welcomed me in so easily… We played a game at the Gabba, and we won, and went down the shed to have a beer. I’d never had a beer after a win before.” In the same piece, Rennae Stubbs, an Australian six-time Major champion, had opined: “Selfishly, would I love to see her come back and play tennis? Absolutely, because I still think that her best tennis is ahead of her.” She returned in 2016, and has since achieved the world No. 1 ranking and three Grand Slam titles. Cricket, though, has never strayed far from her mind. Ongoing women’s Ashes was her distraction before Saturday’s final. She played cricket with her entourage, kit bag doubling as stumps. When not on the court, she pulls a Donald, volleying a golf ball against a wall with a bat. Richards shares that Barty keeps in touch with her former teammates. And when in town, Barty and her fiance go to a game of cricket with Richards and family. “I was devastated when she came up to me one day, and sheepishly said, ‘look, I think I want to go back to tennis'”, Richards says. “But deep down inside, I knew, that’s where she belonged.” Richards knew that cricket’s loss was Australia’s gain. The sentiment was perhaps best summed up at an awards show by comedian Rove McManus, who broke down the Ash Barty-tennis-cricket love triangle. “…If you love something, set it free – it may go have a crack at cricket and come back to you!”","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress"},{"title":"U19 World Cup 2022, India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Ravi Kumar Deals Bangladesh Triple Blow In Early Burst - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pY2MtdW5kZXItMTktd29ybGQtY3VwLTIwMjIvdTE5LXdvcmxkLWN1cC0yMDIyLWluZGlhLXUxOS12cy1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLXUxOS1zdXBlci1sZWFndWUtcXVhcnRlci1maW5hbC1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMjczNjk0MtIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"U19 World Cup 2022, India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Ravi Kumar Deals Bangladesh Triple Blow In Early Burst  NDTV SportsU-19 World Cup: India vs Bangladesh Preview  NEWS9 liveIndia U19 vs Bangladesh U19 Live Streaming Details- ICC U19 World Cup 2022  Cricket AddictorWatch: Rajvardhan Hangargekar's Stunning Delivery In Training Ahead Of India's U-19 World Cup Super ..  NDTVSports.comUnder-19 WC | India’s virus-hit warriors return for quarterfinal  The HinduView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-29 13:53:40","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"World Giants vs Asia Lions LIVE Score, Legends League FINAL: Toss, Playing XI, Dream11 Fantasy Prediction, Streaming info","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/legends-league-2022-final-world-giants-vs-asia-lions-live-score-updates/article38345163.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Team Sportstar"],"video_url":null,"description":"Legends League Cricket 2022, WGS vs ALN: Get the live cricket score, highlights, commentary, updates and more from the final between World Giants and Asia Lions in Oman.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-29 13:29:48","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar"},{"title":"U-19 World Cup 2022: Ireland vs Zimbabwe Live Cricket Score And Updates","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/u-19-world-cup-2022-ireland-vs-zimbabwe-live-cricket-score-and-updates-2737071","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"U-19 World Cup 2022: Ireland vs Zimbabwe Live Cricket Score And Updates: Ireland and Zimbabwe face off in a Plate semi-final match at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad and Tobago on Saturday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-29 13:24:28","full_description":"U-19 World Cup 2022: Ireland vs Zimbabwe Live Cricket Score And Updates: Ireland and Zimbabwe face off in a Plate semi-final match at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad and Tobago on Saturday.

Australia A Women lived up to their expectations and started the series on Friday with a 42-run victory. Molly Strano put up a match-winning all-round display to help her side take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Meanwhile, England A Women wouldn’t be happy with their performance in the first match. They managed only 219 runs on the board after being set a target of 261 runs. The visitors will now look to bounce back and level the series 1-1.

The pitch at Phillip Oval is a good one for batting. The batters find it easy to score runs as there is minimal movement on offer for the pacers. However, we can expect spinners to get some turn in the latter stages of the game. Wicketkeeper Georgia Redmayne: Australian A Women skipper Georgia didn’t have a great outing in the previous game. However, she is a fine batter and is expected to deliver in today’s match. Batters Phoebe Litchfield: Phoebe is one of the most consistent batters in Australia’s lineup. She smashed a great half-century in the previous game. Emma Lamb: Emma showed her brilliance with the bat in the recently-concluded T20 series. She has scored two half-centuries in three games and is expected to carry on her form. All-rounders Heather Graham: Heather put in a decent all-round performance in the last outing. She scored valuable 38 runs as well as picked up a wicket at an economy of just 3.25. Alice Richards: Alice was one of the few positives for England in the previous game. She managed to score 72 runs as well as grabbed two wickets at an economy of 3.83. Bowlers Molly Strano: Molly was adjudged the Player of the Match for her all-round display in her team's previous outing. She scored 39 runs down the order and also grabbed two vital wickets at an economy of 3.38. Tash Farrant: Tash also made handy all-round contributions in the previous game. She scored 21 runs at a quick pace while also taking one wicket and two catches.

Batters Upul Tharanga is currently the second-highest run-scorer in the competition. He has scored 223 runs in four games at an average of 55.75.

The post Gotta See It: Ennis scores spectacular spin-o-rama goal top-shelf appeared first on Sportsnet.ca.","content":"MELBOURNE, Australia — Ash Barty really didn’t know how to react to this drought-breaking triumph. The usually so reserved and understated champion just let it all out, yelling “yes … yes.” A quick walk to the net to congratulate the Australian Open runner-up, 28-year-old American Danielle Collins. Yes, that restored some sense of order. Acknowledge the umpire with a handshake. Yes, that’s another important task for the women’s top-ranked tennis player. Then back onto Rod Laver Arena to scream out again: “yes … yes.” Yes, it had been 44 years since an Australian won a singles title at the Australian Open. So no need to keep a lid on the celebrations. An almost full house at Rod Laver Arena, despite ticket restrictions imposed for the COVID-19 pandemic, was rocking. Barty knew what to do when she saw who was presenting the trophy. Her mentor, the Indigenous and Australian tennis icon Evonne Goolagong Cawley, had flown in secretly from Queensland state to hand it over to the next generation star with Indigenous heritage. Instinct kicked in for Barty. It was a big, loving hug. Barty will no longer be weighed down by the 1970s. She recovered from 5-1 down in the second set to beat Collins 6-3, 7-6 (2) in the final on Saturday night, becoming the first Australian to win the Australian Open women’s singles champion since Chris O’Neil in 1978. The pressure is off the 25-year-old Aussie, who has made a remarkable career comeback after taking time off — missing every Grand Slam tournament in 2015 and ’16 — and briefly flirting with a professional cricket career. “It was a little bit surreal,” Barty said. “I didn’t quite know what to do or what to feel — just being able to let out a little bit of emotion, which is a little bit unusual for me, and being able to celebrate with everyone who was there in the crowd, the energy was incredible.” Barty now has Grand Slam singles titles on three surfaces, adding the hard courts of Melbourne Park to her titles on grass at Wimbledon last year and on clay at the 2019 French Open. Serena Williams is the only active player on the women’s tour with majors on all three surfaces. “This is just a dream come true for me,” Barty said. “I’m just so proud to be an Aussie.” Goolagong Cawley was a trailblazer. She won four of her seven Grand Slam singles titles at the Australian Open from 1974-77, after winning the French Open at the age of 19. She won Wimbledon in 1971 and, after having a baby, in 1980. She reached 11 other major finals, including four in a row at the U.S. Open. And she spotted Barty’s talent at a young age. “Very lucky to be able to give her a hug in some of the biggest moments in my life,” Barty said. “To be able to experience that together on such a big occasion, on such a beautiful court, and in a tournament that means so much to both of us — it was really nice to have her there just as someone to lean on when I wasn’t really sure what to do.” O’Neil was involved in the night, too, bringing the trophy into the stadium. Barty had only conceded one service game through six matches leading into the final. And Collins was the fourth American in as many rounds to take her on, with Barty beating Amanda Anisimova, Jessica Pegula and 2017 U.S. Open runner-up Madison Keys in straight sets. Collins, meanwhile, had to rally from a set and break down to beat Danish teenager Clara Tauson in the third round. She was hampered by a sore back, which prevented her from sitting down in changeovers. Barty took the first set after saving a break point in the fifth game and then breaking in the next. Collins hit back, unloading with her powerful ground strokes and relying on her high-intensity game to break Barty’s serve in the second and sixth games. She twice served for the second set, and twice was within two points of taking her first Grand Slam final to a third. But she lost momentum when Barty jumped into a second serve and sent a return winner down the line in the seventh game. Collins went to talk to the chair umpire when she faced a break point, and got booed by the crowd. When she lost the game, Collins got another chorus of boos. Revived by that energy, Barty won five of the next six games and then dominated the tiebreaker. “This crowd is one of the most fun I’ve ever played in front of,” Barty said. “You relaxed me, forced me to play my best tennis.” Until Saturday, Barty’s best run in Australia had ended in a semifinal loss to eventual champion Sofia Kenin in 2020. Australian flags and the red, black and yellow Aboriginal flag were waved around in the crowd. Cathy Freeman, who carried both flags to celebrate her gold medal in the 400 meters at the Sydney 2000 Olympics — one of the defining images of those Games — was in the house, too. Collins, whose previous best run at a major was a semifinal loss here in 2019, paid tribute to her longtime mentor Marty Schneider and her boyfriend Joe Vollen. “Thank you for believing in me,” she said, crying. “I haven’t had a ton of people believing me in my career.” Collins, who doesn’t have a permanent coach, said she came up just short. “I was pushed to the max, and I gave myself a chance there,” she said. “So it was a great event for me. Accomplished some new things. Learned a lot of new things.” Australia’s drought in the men’s singles dates back to Mark Edmondson’s victory in 1976, but the men’s doubles title is back with a homegrown team for the first time since 1997. Wild-card entrants Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis — the so-called Special Ks — finished off a fairly wild men’s doubles campaign by beating Matt Ebden and Max Purcell 7-5, 6-4.","pubDate":"2022-01-29 12:58:19","full_description":"MELBOURNE, Australia — Ash Barty really didn't know how to react to this drought-breaking triumph.

Starc managed to keep his cricket going despite a below-par outing against India in the 2020-21 Test series at home while also losing his father to the dreaded disease soon after. \"Obviously last year was particularly tough on and off the field,\" Starc was quoted as saying by foxsports.com.au. \"I probably didn't play the cricket I wanted to and, at certain stages, I probably didn't want to play cricket at all.\" Starc was heavily criticised after he took just 11 wickets at 40.72 in the series against India. His performance in the ICC T20 World Cup in the UAE too left a lot to be desired, with the pacer conceding 60 runs without taking a wicket in his four overs in the final. Criticism by spin legend Shane Warne ahead of the Ashes didn't help either and Starc made it clear that it did not go down well with him. He ended the Ashes as one of the team's key performers in its 4-0 drubbing of England. Starc played in all the five Ashes Tests and finished with 19 wickets at an average of 25.37. \"I think, what was it? It was a straight half-volley on leg stump I think someone (Warne) said,\" Starc said on the criticism from the legendary Australian spinner. \"What would you like me to speak to him (Warne) about? It doesn't interest me at all. He's (Warne) entitled to his opinion. I'm just going to go about my cricket the way I'd like to, and I've got my family support networks and I get to play cricket with some of my best mates, so I'm pretty comfortable with where I'm at,\" Starc added. Starc, who took 43 wickets across all formats in the 12-month period, edged out all-rounder Mitchell Marsh by one vote. He is only the fifth fast bowler since its inception to win the award, joining Pat Cummins, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath. It was a double delight for Starc as he also won the men's ODI Player of the Year. Starc said what matters to him is the opinion of his friends and family, including his cricketer wife Alyssa Healy, who keeps wickets for the Australian women's team and bats explosively at the top of the order.
