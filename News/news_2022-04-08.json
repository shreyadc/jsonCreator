Essex openers Sir Alastair Cook and Nick Browne battled through fierce winds to record a 220-run stand that threatened to demoralise Kent in Division 1 of the LV= Insurance County Championship. But Essex slipped to 272-4 at the close after stand-in Kent captain Ollie Robinson opted to field first after winning the toss. Robinson took over captain duties from Jack Leaning, who missed out through a hamstring injury. It took Kent five and a half hours before making the breakthrough when Australian debutant Jackson Bird forced Browne into his only mistake in an innings that spanned 253 balls, contained 13 fours and brought him 107 runs. Browne‚Äôs dismissal did not upset Cook‚Äôs concentration as the former England captain duly clocked up the 70th century of his distinguished career before driving loosely at Bird four balls later and edging behind for 100. The platform built by Cook and Browne threatened to be wasted as England batsman Dan Lawrence departed lbw for seven, played no shot to former Essex bowler Matt Quinn. Then Nathan Gilchrist trapped nightwatchman Jamie Porter plum in front second ball without score. It was an overcoat and bobble hat sort of day for spectators and equally uncomfortable out in the middle where blustery conditions had bowlers aborting run-ups, chasing to retrieve caps blown off. Cook seemed the more unsettled by the wind early on if not by the benign wicket. He was outscored by the traditionally less adventurous Browne to the extent that when Browne reached his fifty from 109 balls shortly after lunch, Cook had only just accelerated to 34 from a similar number of deliveries. Indeed, Cook‚Äôs contribution had been just seven runs in the first hour. Browne was consistently strong when straight-driving and reached his half-century with a sweet shot through mid-off that slowed up just short of the boundary to yield two. The 200-run stand was reached when Browne abandoned normal restraint and bounced down the wicket and lofted a full-toss from rookie off-spinner Tawanda Muyeye over the mid-wicket boundary. He followed that by whipping Bird‚Äôs first delivery with the new-ball through the on-side to record the 13th boundary of his innings and the 17th first-class century of his career.","image_url":"https://www.kentonline.co.uk/_media/img/330x0/3G23QPXJFLOGB43PXKJI.jpg","source_id":"kentonline","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Tata IPL 2022 LSG vs DC Live score and Update: Kuldeep removes De Kock but LSG on course - Firstpost","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMi2QFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maXJzdHBvc3QuY29tL2ZpcnN0Y3JpY2tldC9zcG9ydHMtbmV3cy9sc2ctdnMtZGMtbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3JlLXRhdGEtaXBsLTIwMjItbWF0Y2gtc2NvcmVjYXJkLWxpdmUtdXBkYXRlLWx1Y2tub3ctc3VwZXItZ2lhbnRzLXZzLWRlbGhpLWNhcGl0YWxzLWluZGlhbi1wcmVtaWVyLWxlYWd1ZS1saXZlLXN0cmVhbWluZy10b2RheS0xMDUyMzk0MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Tata IPL 2022 LSG vs DC Live score and Update: Kuldeep removes De Kock but LSG on course¬†¬†FirstpostDavid Warner | Interview | IPL 2022¬†¬†Delhi CapitalsLive Cricket Score - LSG vs DC, Match 15, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzMatch Preview - Capitals vs Super Giants, Indian Premier League 2022, 15th Match¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoAhead of LSG vs DC, David Warner copies Salman Khan's moves in viral video¬†¬†DNA IndiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-07 17:40:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lucknow Super Giants vs Delhi Capitals Live Score Ball by Ball, IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/lucknow-super-giants-vs-delhi-capitals-live-score-over-match-15-t20-16-20-updates-2869573","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Lucknow Super Giants vs Delhi Capitals from Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy, Navi Mumbai.

A full toss, above the batter's waist. Deepak Hooda cuts it to cover where Sarfaraz Khan takes a good catch. Although, the umpire does not look satisfied. Both the umpires converge and take it upstairs. The third umpire deems it as a no ball. The next ball is a free hit but it won't be bowled by Anrich Nortje, as he gets ruled out of the attack for bowling two no balls (height). Is that a fair ball? Deepak Hooda has been caught at cover but the umpires are checking whether that was above the waist of the batter. Yes, the replays clearly suggest that it is above the waist and it is a no ball. Also, Anrich Nortje is taken off as this is the second ball delivered by him in this game that is above the waist of the batter. 15.2 overs (0 Run) Back of a length, outside off. Deepak Hooda stays back, tries to cut it away but gets beaten on the outside edge. 15.1 overs (1 Run) Full length, wide outside off.

Aktenfoto von UEFA-Pr√§sident Aleksander Ceferin. AP Neon-Und das Schweiz: Die UEFA hat am Donnerstag neue Lizenzbestimmungen genehmigt, um die bestehenden Regeln zum finanziellen Fairplay zu ersetzen, die es den europ√§ischen Klubs erm√∂glichen, gr√∂√üere Verluste als zuvor zu erleiden, w√§hrend die Ausgaben f√ºr Geh√§lter und Transfers begrenzt werden. Wie erwartet hat der europ√§ische Fu√üballverband beschlossen, die 2010 eingef√ºhrten Freispielregeln zu √ºberarbeiten, um die Schuldenspirale zwischen den Klubs auf dem ganzen Kontinent zu reduzieren. Die Grenzen der FFP wurden durch das Aufkommen staatlich kontrollierter Superm√§chte wie Manchester City und Paris Saint-Germain deutlich. ‚ÄûDie gr√∂√üte Neuerung wird die Einf√ºhrung einer Teamkostenbasis sein, um eine bessere Kostenkontrolle in Bezug auf Spielergeh√§lter und Transferkosten zu erreichen‚Äú, erkl√§rte UEFA-Pr√§sident Aleksander Ceferin auf einer Pressekonferenz in Nyon, Schweiz, nach einer Sitzung des Exekutivkomitees der Organisation . Die UEFA gestattet den Klubs nun, √ºber drei Jahre Verluste in H√∂he von 60 Millionen Euro (65,5 Millionen US-Dollar) zu melden, statt zuvor 30 Millionen Euro, und die erlaubte Zahl wird sogar auf 90 Millionen Euro f√ºr einen ‚Äûfinanziell gesunden‚Äú Klub steigen. Diese Lockerung der Regeln ist jedoch mit neuen Obergrenzen f√ºr die Lohnausgaben verbunden. Es bestand absolut keine Aussicht auf eine spezifische Gehaltsobergrenze, wie sie im nordamerikanischen Sport √ºblich ist, da die UEFA 55 Mitgliedsstaaten mit mehr als 1.000 Klubs hat und sich mit der UEFA, dem Arbeitsrecht und dem nationalen Wettbewerb auseinandersetzen muss. Nach den neuen UEFA-Vorschriften m√ºssen die Vereine jedoch die Ausgaben f√ºr Spielergeh√§lter, Personal, Transfergeb√ºhren und Agenten bis zur Saison 2025/26 auf 70 % der Gesamteinnahmen begrenzen. Die Obergrenze sinkt, wenn die laufenden Vertr√§ge auslaufen: 90 % der Einnahmen des Vereins in 2023/24, gefolgt von 80 % in der folgenden Saison und dann auf 70 %. ‚ÄûVerst√∂√üe werden zu vorab festgelegten Geldstrafen und sportlichen Ma√ünahmen f√ºhren‚Äú, sagte Ceferin. Klubs, die gegen die Regeln versto√üen, k√∂nnten Transferverboten, Leihbeschr√§nkungen, einer Herabstufung von einem europ√§ischen Wettbewerb zu einem anderen und einem Abzug von Champions-League-Punkten unterliegen.

The Run Chase ... Right then. 150 is what Lucknow need to extend their winning run in this campaign. It gets more interesting as KL Rahul was seen busy with the towel at the fag end of the innings. So the dew is in play, can Lucknow make the most of it? Delhi will give it their all, but they will surely have a hard time in the field. An enticing chase coming up shortly. Do not go anywhere. Krishnappa Gowtham is in for a chat. He says he feels good to be back in the Indian T20 League. Adds that it is all about mixing your pace on a pitch like this. Tells that there were a bit of jitters at the start for him as he was playing after a very long time. Mentions that bowling tight and straight lines is very important on this track. The Lucknow bowlers were blown off by the sheer attacking play of Prithvi Shaw, as Delhi had racked up 67 runs in 7.2 overs. But the spinners rose to the challenge and got their side back in the contest. Gowtham got ride of Shaw, while Bishnoi struck twice to put Delhi in a precarious position. Later, the spin twins managed to put a lid over the run rate by not letting Pant free his arms. Lucknow's bowler were excellent in the death overs. Delhi could not counterpunch in the middle overs. Prithvi Shaw was on the attack from the word go. His valiant knock also gave not much but enough time for Warner to get familiar with the conditions from the other end. David Warner though could not make the most of it, as his arch-nemesis Ravi Bishnoi got the better of him for the third time in the Indian T20 League. Rovman Powell followed suit. Rishabh Pant and Sarfaraz Khan kept the runs ticking by picking up singles, but in the final 5 over, Pant picked up the pace of his innings and smacked 18 runs in the 16th over. The pair though could not go all-out in the final two overs and hence were left with a below par first innings score on this wicket. Lucknow gave away only 13 runs in the final two overs. They have restricted Delhi to 149 and will be very satisfied as they head towards the pavilion. Delhi would be really gutted with their approach after a solid start. 19.6 overs (1 Run) A full ball, on middle. Rishabh Pant drags it towards long on and settles for only a single. Delhi end with 149/3. 19.5 overs (1 Run) A slower ball, on a length, around off. Sarfaraz Khan looks to play it across the line. It takes the top edge and hits his helmet. The ball rolls to the off side and the batters cross ends. 19.5 overs (1 Run) Wide! A slower bumper, angling in from off. Sarfaraz Khan looks to pull but he misses. The umpire calls it wide for height. 19.4 overs (1 Run) A yorker, wide outside off. Pant digs it out towards short third man and manages only a run yet again. This is brilliant bowling from Holder. 19.3 overs (1 Run) A yorker-length ball, on middle. Sarfaraz Khan squeezes it out towards deep mid-wicket and gives the strike back to Rishabh Pant. 19.2 overs (1 Run) A loopy full toss, on off.

Sarfaraz Khan looks to play the reverse-sweep but he misses and gets hit on his pad. The ball rolls to the off side for a leg bye. A stifled appeal for LBW from Holder but the impact was surely outside off. 16.6 overs (1 Run) A slower ball, full and outside off. Sarfaraz Khan looks to heave it across the line. It takes the toe end of the bat and goes just over the bowler for a single. 13 runs off the over! 16.5 overs (2 Runs) A slower ball, into the surface, outside off.

TOSS - Lucknow has won the toss and they have elected to BOWL first. PITCH REPORT - Graeme Swann is near the pitch. He says that the wicket looks pretty good with some grass present evenly. The spinners will look to bowl very straight lines around off and outside off. The first innings average score should be somewhere around 180. Both batters and bowlers will have a good outing. Lucknow seems to have some great batting depth, with the top-order and middle-order able to be more expansive in their batting. Their batting depth is just incredible. While Delhi have a great mix of bowlers at their disposal, and would really need their middle-order to hit the ground running. We are heard that Marcus Stoinis could be back in contention to start for Lucknow. Nonetheless, Delhi have Warner and Nortje available for selection as well. Who will gain the bragging rights? We shall find out soon. Stay tuned for toss and team updates. Hello and a warm welcome to game number 15 of the Indian T20 League. In this match, Lucknow will clash against Delhi.

However, In January 2022, PCB chairman Ramiz Raja shared a proposal of a four-nation super series featuring India, Pakistan, Australia and England, via his official Twitter handle. Following that proposal, Ramiz has spoken again on possibility of holding the four-Nation Super Series. Raja expressed that he is hopeful and positive for his plan when he attends the ICC meeting in Dubai from April 7 to 10. He also said he will be speaking with the BCCI on the sidelines regarding the proposed series. The PCB chief left for Dubai on Wednesday (April 6) along with Faisal Hasnain (PCB Chief Executive) aiming to push the decision on his proposal. With Australia already having accepted the proposal, the PCB chairman still awaits an answer from England and India. \"India-Pakistan (2022 T20 World Cup) tickets were sold in one day, we don't have a political perspective on things and if a fellow cricketer is leading the BCCI, we should be approachable to each other since we don't know politics,\" Raja said in a recent interview. \"I'll talk to Ganguly regarding a four-nation tournament. The future of cricket is in triangular and four-nation competitions. Twenty20 leagues are taking away eyeballs from bilateral cricket, of which the novelty factor is decreasing,\" said Raja. A PCB source said that Ramiz will share a special report with the ICC executive board on hosting the Pakistan-Australia series which concluded on Tuesday in Lahore. \"Ramiz is confident that after the successful hosting of the Pakistan Super League and the series against Australia he will face no problems convincing the other member boards to schedule bilateral series against Pakistan with emphasis on three-test series in the 2024-25 calendar,\" the source said. He said Pakistan had kept a window open in their FTP for a bilateral series against India in 2024-25. \"The PCB chairman will also hold meetings with various heads of the respective boards to improve relations and create future opportunities for Pakistan cricket,\" the source added.

In his recently published book ‚ÄòNot Just A Nightwatchman: My Innings with BCCI‚Äô, published by ‚ÄòRupa‚Äô, Rai touched upon various issues that he dealt with during his 33-month tenure. One of the issues and perhaps the most controversial, was when Kohli complained about his breakdown of relationship with Kumble, who announced his resignation publicly just after Champions Trophy in 2017. Kumble was handed a one-year contract in 2016. \"In my conversations with the captain and team management, it was conveyed that Kumble was too much of a disciplinarian and hence the team members were not too happy with him,\" Rai has written in his book. \"I had spoken to Virat Kohli on the issue and he did mention that the younger members of the team felt intimidated by the way he worked with them.\" Rai reveals that the then Cricket Advisory Committee comprising Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman had recommended Kumble's re-appointment. \"Soon, the CAC met in London and interacted with the two separately in a bid to resolve the issue. After deliberations over three days, they decided to recommend Kumble's reappointment as the head coach.\" However it was evident from what followed was that Kohli's point of view was given more respect and hence Kumble's position became untenable. \"We had long conversations with Kumble after he had returned from the UK. He was obviously upset about the manner in which the entire episode had panned out. He felt he had been unfairly treated and a captain or team should not be given so much importance. \"It was the duty of the coach to bring discipline and professionalism into the team and as a senior, his views should have been respected by the players.\" Rai also wrote that Kumble felt that more credence was given to following protocols and process and less emphasis was laid on how the team performed under his guidance. \"He was disappointed that we had given such importance to following process, and that, in view of the team's performance over the previous year, he deserved an extension.\" Rai had further written that he had explained to Kumble as to why he didn't get an extension. \"I explained to him that considering the fact that even his earlier selection in 2016 had followed a process, and that his one-year contract had no extension clause, we were bound to follow process, even for his reappointment. And that is exactly what was done.\" Rai however found it mature and prudent on both Kohli and Kumble's part to maintain a dignified silence on the issue or else the controversy would have continued. \"It is indeed very prudent of captain Kohli to have maintained a dignified silence. Any utterance from him would have set off a fusillade of opinions. \"Kumble, on his part, too, kept to himself and did not go public on any issue that had transpired. That was the most mature and dignified manner of dealing with a situation which could have become unpleasant for all parties involved.\" In 2017, when Ravi Shastri was reappointed as head coach (earlier he was Cricket Director), the BCCI had in its initial mail stated that Rahul Dravid and Zaheer Khan were appointed batting and bowling consultants respectively. However the decision had to be overturned and later Shastri's right-hand man and confidante Bharat Arun was also reinstated as bowling coach. Rai, in his book, mentioned that there were practical difficulties which led to Dravid and Zaheer not being able to take up the role. \"Laxman called to say that news reports were emerging that the CoA had reportedly given the impression that the CAC had exceeded its remit in recommending Dravid and Zaheer as consultant/coach. \"He called to convey the 'pain of the CAC'. I assured him that these were media speculations and somebody was quite unnecessarily adding his unsolicited two bits to the process.\" \"The fact remained that Dravid was far too occupied with the U-19 team to spare time for the senior team. Zaheer was contracted with another team and could not have been engaged. And hence that recommendation could not be acted upon. That put the lid on the process,\" he wrote. However Rai's recollection for all those who had covered the issue back then, seems a bit inaccurate. \"Had they known that Dravid and Zaheer would be unable to take up, why would have Rai sanctioned their appointments,\" a senior official, who was active back then told PTI . \"The truth is that Shastri, after his appointment had made it clear that he would only work when his choice of support staff is given and that roster needs to have Bharat Arun,\" the official added. While Rai is absolutely spot on in mentioning that it was Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who recommended an A+ category in the central contracts, the figures mentioned on page 36 of the book do not match with reality. \"As per the suggestion of team management, we devised four categories, A+, A, B and C, and the remuneration contemplated was '8 crore, 7 crore, 5 crore and 3 crore, respectively.\" However, the BCCI's Centrally contracted cricketers get Rs 7 crore (A+), Rs 5 crore (A), Rs 3 crore (B group) and Rs 1 crore (group C). A factual error noted in the book is England all-rounder Ben Stokes' salary which Rai has quoted as $4 million (Page 71) for eight weeks. \"Another remarkable example has been that of Ben Stokes. He was barred from playing due to some infractions not related to cricket. That seemed not to have caused him too much of consternation as he earned $4 million in the IPL, and that too for a mere eight-week engagement,\" he wrote. However it must be mentioned that Stokes was bought by Rajasthan Royals for $2.16 million (¬£1.63 million) and not for the amount mentioned in the book.

Paceman James Pattinson, who is now retired, and former Test captain Tim Paine were also absent. Paine remains on an indefinite break from the game after a sexting scandal. The number of players in the group, which forms the core of Australia's international squads, was the maximum 20 allowed. Those who missed out can still though represent Australia. Dynamic wicketkeeper-batsman Inglis was a key addition for 2022-23 while Mitch Marsh, Scott Boland, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marcus Stoinis and Mitchell Swepson all retained their places having earned contract upgrades last season. \"We believe this group provide us great coverage and versatility across all formats while others, as we saw in the past year, will continue to get opportunities to play a big part,\" said chief selector George Bailey. \"To contract just 20 players was challenging given the number of key series and the cycle of upcoming T20 and one-day World Cups, all of which will require varying skill sets and combinations.\" Promoted Players not picked Thursday can still win a full contract by earning 12 'upgrade points' during the year, with a Test match worth five points, an ODI two points and a T20 one point.
