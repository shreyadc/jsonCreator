He beliefs match practice is the best way for a cricketer to prepare himself for a new season. Addressing a media gathering in the city Sunil Gavaskar said,\"Domestic cricket season in the country starts around November. So it is better to start the local season within September. It will help the cricketers to get more and more match practice.\"Gavaskar is in the city to participate in a function which was organized by TOPCEM (Meghalaya Cement). The legendary cricketer is the Brand Ambassador of the company. It is a very common fact that each and every time Assam participate in the national level competition, the batting becomes the main area of concern. It's not like there is a lack of talent in the State. The problem occurs due to lack of consistency in the performance. When a reporter placed this point to Gavaskar, he replied, \"Earlier, I mentioned that match practice is very essential for the preparation. So it should get priority. At the same time if possible you should invite reputed coaches here to train your batsmen to overcome the problem.\" Meanwhile, the former Indian captain said that Rajasthan Royals' Riyan Parag has potential and he should grab the opportunity. He also acknowledged his fielding skill. \"Riyan didn't get many opportunities to play but his fielding was very impressive and it can be handy in selection. If it is found that the batting skills of two batsmen are almost equal level, good fielding skill can bring advantage for selection. Riyan should grab an opportunity whenever he gets a chance to play,\" said Gavaskar. The legendary cricketer also feels that Guwahati is capable of hosting Test cricket in the coming days. Wishing that he wants to spend more time in this city, he said, \"I have visited Guwahati on several occasions but wasn't able to stay for a long period. I feel it would be possible only if the city gets the opportunity to host Test matches. Hotels in this city are good and equipped with all necessary facilities, including gym, which are required for the teams. Air connectivity is also good here\" The function was attended by Director and President - Sales & Marketing of Meghalaya Cement Bajrang Lohia and Dr. Anil Kapur respectively where a special scheme for the masons was launched. Assam Sports Journalists' Association also feliciated Gavaskar in the function.

This will mark the beginning of the ICC Women's Championship 2022-2025 cycle which is also a pathway for qualifying the 2025 World Cup. The addition of Ireland and Bangladesh have raised the number of teams in the race to ten now. This is also the first time that Pakistan will be playing the ICC Championship matches on their home soil. The ten teams will play eight three-match series each during the 2022-25 cycle comprising four home series and four away series. The hosts plus the five top-placed teams will get direct entry to the World Cup. The remaining two teams will be identified through a global qualifier comprising six teams, the remaining four teams from the ICC Women Championship plus two others who will be selected according to the ICC Women’s ODI team rankings. Both nations have faced 30 times in ODIs with Sri Lanka having won 21 while Pakistan have sealed victories in only 9 matches. The last time both teams came face-to-face in ODIs was back in 2018 when Pakistan had toured Sri Lanka for a three-match ICC Women Championship series. Bismah Maroof's side swept that series 3-0 in Dambulla. Pakistan's skipper Bismah Maroof is confident to carry the same momentum which her brigade had got in the T20 series. \"The way we finished the T20 series, we will definitely try to carry the same momentum,\" Bismah told a news conference here on Tuesday. \"These matches are very important keeping in view the ICC Championship points. We will try our level best to win the series and get vital points,\" she said. \"Past is not in our mind and we will take the T20I series confidence into the ODI series and win the series at home conditions,\" she said while responding to a question that Sri Lanka have a great record against Pakistan in ODI cricket. Bismah said the introduction of the ICC Championship has benefited them more. \"The ICC Championship has benefited us as we now compete with the top teams. Before this we had to play directly against them in the World Cup and that made a huge difference. But now with more matches against the top sides our confidence is being boosted and now we can compete against big teams,\" she said. Sri Lankan captain Chamari Athapaththu said that they would have to raise their game.\"Definitely the last T20I series was not good for us as we lost three games. Now the ODI series is a fresh start and it's very important for us as we need points. It's a very good opportunity for us and we have to play positive cricket,\" Chamari told a news conference. \"Last year we did not get more ODIs and we missed the World Cup as well. We have more youngsters and a few seniors in the team so these are tough days but we hope we will do well in the ODI series,\" Chamari said. Earlier in the day the ODI series trophy was unveiled by both the skippers. Pakistan squad: Bismah Maroof (captain), Aiman Anwar, Aliya Riaz, Anam Amin, Diana Baig, Fatima Sana, Ghulam Fatima, Gull Feroza, Muneeba Ali Siddiqui (wicketkeeper), Nida Dar, Omaima Sohail, Sadaf Shamas, Sadia Iqbal, Sidra Amin and Sidra Nawaz (wicket-keeper).

Sreeja, the reigning India No.1, won the senior national title in Shillong at the 83rd Senior National Table Tennis Championship. The selectors of the Indian table tennis team announced the squad which is subject to clearance from the Sports Authority of India, after Archana Kamath was included in the side despite not meeting the existing criteria. Kamath is the second highest-ranked Indian player at 66 after Manika Batra (39) but she was not among the top four players going by the existing selection criteria which also factors in domestic performance. The Committee of Administrators (CoA) plans to tweak the selection guidelines in the future. The chosen players are Manika, Archana, Sreeja Akula (rank 66), Reeth Rishya (100), with Diya Chitale (129) as the standby. Experienced players like Ayhika Mukherjee and Sutirtha Mukherjee were ignored. Explaining the reasons behind awaiting concurrence from SAI, S D Mudgil, CoA representative and chairperson of the selection committee said, “Under the existing selection criteria, one of the members (Archana) falls outside the top four. “The selection committee is convinced that the existing guidelines are “flawed” and has moved to make necessary course-correction, with new guidelines effective from October 1. “However, in this transitionary phase, with an eye on a rich medal haul in Birmingham, we have included the said player in the team. She (Archana Kamath) is one half of the doubles pair (Manika the other) that is ranked No. 4 in the world and which will be the top seeds at the Commonwealth Games. “Therefore, the selection committee feels that this is a case worthy of consideration by SAI.” The men’s team which has been picked is a more straightforward one, consisting of the great Sharath Kamal, G Sathiyan and Harmeet Desai. Manush Shah will be the standby. Mudgil also made it clear that all the 15 players (eight men and seven women) at the camp will be fielded at the ensuing World Table Tennis Tour events in Zagreb (Croatia), Ototec (Slovakia) and Budapest (Hungary) in June-July as part of an ongoing process to bolster the strength of Indian table tennis. The CWG-bound paddlers will also be provided with an acclimatisation camp in partnership with a leading European team. ‘Aim is to have 10 Indians in world’s top-100’. The CoA led by Justice (retd) Gita Mittal was appointed by the Delhi High Court in February this year to “clean up the TTFI”. Unveiling an ambitious five-year plan that envisages setting up a national academy along the lines of the National Cricket Academy, with regional academies in four other cities, she said, “The aim is to have at least 10 Indians in the top-100 in the world in both the senior and the junior categories among men and women. “For that, we need cooperation from all quarters, not criticism just for the sake of it.” The squads were picked after a week-long national camp at the Padukone-Dravid Centre for Sports Excellence in Bangalore. Men: Sharath Kamal, G Sathiyan, Harmeet Desai, Manush Shah (Standby) Women: Manika, Archana, Sreeja Akula, Reeth Rishya, Diya Chitale (Standby).

In this case, some fans have raised the allegation of match-fixing (Match Fixing) through the Twitter site. The Gujarat Titans, led by Hardik Pandya, have clinched the title in the current IPL season. This is the inaugural season for that team. The first step taken by Gujarat on the IPL field is a victory track. The first team to reach the play-off round, amassing a number of wins in the league round. Followed by the first team to enter the final. Now the trophy has been won as well. This is because each of the players on the team shone as match winners. In this case, some fans have accused the team of match-fixing. Some people say that cricket matches are gambling. It has been echoed in international cricket in the past. Players and executives of some teams have been accused of gambling in the IPL last season 2013. Since then it has been customary for these match-fixing allegations to be placed here and there. Gujarat wins: Gujarat captain Hardik Pandya led the team to victory in the final. He took 3 wickets and 34 runs in the final. He won the Man of the Match award. Gill scored 45 and Miller 32. Butler, on the other hand, scored 39 and Yashaswi Jaiswal 22 for Rajasthan. No batsman other than them has scored more than 15 runs. The team also missed two catches while fielding. In the end, Gujarat won the match and the trophy by 7 wickets. Fan Match Fixing Accusation: Fans have leveled match-fixing allegations from various angles regarding the match. It is also worth noting that often these are all tweet posts. “Home Minister Amit Shah. His son Jaisha, BCCI secretary. Gujarat team playing at Ahmedabad ground. What else can be expected? Can we expect to win the RCB trophy?” Said a blogger. “Hardik Pandya did not show much emotion after winning the trophy. As if he knew the outcome in advance,” one said. “People who like IPL matches would still think it’s not match-fixing,” said one. Social networking users trended this with the hashtag #fixing. Some have also questioned the manner in which Jaisha celebrated the Gujarat team after its victory. Thus stretches many questions. However, the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Board of Control for Cricket in India is monitoring gambling and match-fixing. \r Home minister is Amit Shah.Secretary of BCCI is Jay Shah.Gujrat playing at Ahmedabad. What do you expect? RCB to win cup? #fixing#hotstar – tomy (tomy_craig) May 29, 2022 \r Is this the way a BCCI official should celebrate on an individual team’s victory, where is professionalism and neutrality.

Miller has failed to impress for South Africa in white ball cricket in the last few years, but had an outstanding Indian Premier League season with champions Gujarat Titans in a stunning reversal of form. He batted mostly at number five, as opposed to his usual six with South Africa, where he scored 481 with the best average in the competition of 68.71 at a strike rate of 143. \"He has performed exceedingly well in IPL. Whatever feelings of insecurity he had are gone now,\" Bavuma told reporters on Tuesday. \"We will have a conversation. He is an important member of the team. If he feels he can add more value higher up the order, it is a conversation to have.\" South Africa will want to settle their batting order in this series with the T20 World Cup in Australia to follow in October. \"The important thing is to prepare for the World Cup,\" Bavuma says. \"The guys need to be in a competitive space. And the India series will be an important part of the competitive process, even if the conditions will be different in Australia.\" Bavuma added that as much they want to win the series, there will be an element of rotation to manage the burden. \"We haven’t got together as a team but the rest of the (non-IPL players) have had good sessions. We will arrive a bit early to get familiarised. \"With multiple formats (this season), it will be important to manage the workload, especially the bowlers.\" The series gets under way in Delhi on June 9 and finishes in Bangaluru 10 days later.

The chances of rain increase from 47% to 51% in the upcoming hours of the match and the humidity is set to be around 61%.
