Pakistan had no answers to India’s collective all-round display as they succumbed to a below-par total of 191. After the game, Arthur heaped praise on the Indian team and expressed the intention of both teams meeting again in the final. “Yeah, I do. This Indian team is a very, very good cricket team. I think they’re very well led by Rahul and Rohit. I think they look good. I think they’ve got all bases covered and I’m looking forward to meeting them in the final again,” Arthur said in the post-match conference. Coming to the match, India won the toss and put Pakistan to bat. The ‘Men in Green’ were cruising in the first innings with skipper Babar Azam and Imam-ul-Haq settled on the pitch. However, Pakistan fell apart as Indian bowlers started to showcase their prowess as they forced Pakistan’s downfall from 155/2 to 191 all out as as Babbar Azam-led men suffered a collapse, losing the last eight wickets for 36 runs. The Indian batters were well poised from the beginning to chase the Pakistan total of 191. Shubman Gill, who made his first appearance in the ODI World Cup, scored some scintillating hits before losing his wicket. He struck three consecutive fours off Hasan Ali in the second over of the Indian innings. Shubhman was out on Shaheen Shah Afridi’s bowling and the hope his wicket may have generated among Pakistan fans was short-lived. Virat Kohli joined Rohit, who was smooth in his power hitting. Kohli also came up with some strong blows before he was caught off the bowling of Hasan Ali during the powerplay. Rohit and Shreyas took charge and strode along even as Pakistan bowlers tried hard to get a breakthrough. The sea of Indian fans, many of them dressed in blue, cheered and waved as Indian batsmen struck. Rohit fell short of his well-deserved century by 14 runs. Shaheen claimed his second wicket of the night with Rohit walking back to the pavilion with a score of 86. In his well-paced innings, Rohit crossed the milestone of 300 ODI sixes which have come in 254 matches. With 351 sixes in 308 games, former Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi leads the tally, while West Indies legend Chris Gayle hammered 331 maximums in 301 encounters. After Rohit’s departure, Shreyas 53* and KL 19* guided India to a comprehensive 7-wicket victory to make it 8-0 in the World Cup between the two arch-rivals.

The influencer finalises by calling out Ryan Garcia and Gervonta Davis. 20:32 To the judges... That was fight of the night. Walid showed his heart and came out fighting in the last round but Deen The Great should be winning this. He could've knocked out Deen The Great, who threw himself out of the ring to waste some time. These are two of the very best in this scene. 20:27 Walid Sharks vs Deen The Great: Into the final round Somehow Walid Sharks is still standing. It's been all Deen The Great. I'm surprised Walid Sharks' team haven't thrown in the towel yet. He has to get a knock-out to win. 20:24 Tommy Fury arrives Tommy Fury is here and ready in his hometown. He takes on KSI in the main event later tonight., 20:23 Can KSI do it? KSI would shock the world if he beats Tommy Fury. He seems to think that he can do it.

Mail Sport's Charlotte Daly has spotted the UFC star on Facetime to Danis ahead of his bout. 20:06 NEXT UP: Walid Sharks vs Deen The Great This could be fight of the night. It's the rematch everyone wanted. Last time they faced each other, Walid Sharks was winning every round... then Deen the Great knocked him out. It only takes one punch, people. 20:05 Even more celebrities As we close in on the main events, the celebrities are arriving. Sir Mo Farah joins Eddie Hearn, while Jill Scott is here along with Louis Theroux. Theroux shares a strong relationship with KSI, having worked on a fight documentary together in the past. 20:03 KSI on how he BEATS Tommy Fury KSI has just spoken to DAZN. He's given away his game plan. 'It's going to be a long day for Tommy,' he said. 'Tommy, you're going to hate today bro. 'It's easy to get under people's skin. I'm calm, relaxed, I know what I need to do. 'He can't deal with it. I'm letting the pressure build then eventually lights out. I have to hit him and he'll understand he can't rush me, simple. I won't need luck bro.' 19:55 ANTHONY TAYLOR WINS BY UNANIMOUS DECISION All three judges score the bout 49-45 in favour of Anthony Taylor. He's the new Misfits light heavyweight champion and falls on his back in celebration . 19:52 End of the fight Anthony Taylor did what he needed to do. I'll be shocked if this isn't a win for the American. Disappointing from King Kenny. 19:49 Into the final round 'Why are you backing up and trying to box when you're losing a fight?' asks Daley Perales. Brutal from Kenny's coach and brother. It's time to go for the knockout. 19:47 King Kenny: POINT DEDUCTED King Kenny sees a point deducted for excessive holding. If he's to win this, it will need to be a knock-out. 19:46 Commentators aren't happy I'm not too sure why but the commentators are complaining with Anthony Taylor's game plan. Yes, it's not making for the best watch. But you're matching him against a man with a huge reach advantage... 19:44 Kenny has to find his range King Kenny is allowing Anthony Taylor to rush him. He needs to find his range and utilise his reach advantage. There could be a knock-out here, if Taylor rushes him and Kenny can land a clean hand. Two more rounds left. 19:40 King Kenny's coach is not happy Daley Perales, brother and coach of King Kenny, is telling him he's not been good enough. He's encouraged his fighter to push Anthony Taylor back and bully him. 19:40 The celebrities are in the house Aitch is watching on. Could he walk KSI out today? 19:38 Scrappy fight so far Anthony Taylor is rushing King Kenny to get on the inside. It ends up with Kenny clenching his opponent and the pair have spent the majority of the fight holding onto each other. Scrappy. 19:33 Anthony Taylor with a wild start I've never seen anything like this. Anthony Taylor sprints at King Kenny like he's in the MMA. Kenny just grabs him before the referee separates the two. 19:32 The loudest cheer of the night so far Wow. What a reception for King Kenny. This could be the main event itself. The whole of Manchester are backing him. We're underway! 19:31 Logan Paul and Nina Agdal are in the building Logan Paul has arrived alongside his fiancee Nina Agdal. Just a reminder, if you need it, she is taking Dillon Danis to court. 19:26 UP NEXT: King Kenny vs Anthony Taylor Anthony Taylor went the distance with Tommy Fury before. He's coming in off a win against one of the highest-rated influencer boxers in Salt Papi. Could he pull off another upset and beat King Kenny next? 19:18 MY MATE NATE WINS BY UNANIMOUS DECISION The judges score it four rounds to none. It was a perfect game plan from the man fighting out of Thailand. He could go far in this scene! 19:16 Result up next That may be one of the better technical fights you'll see in influencer boxing. My Mate Nate found his range and used his jab, throwing a lot of punches. Whindersson Nunes went for the power shots and tried to knock him down. Let's see how the judges score this. For me, it's My Mate Nate or a draw. 19:08 The most respectful fight ever? It's no secret that My Mate Nate may be the nicest guy in the crossover boxing scene. He brought Whindersson Nunes Thai sweets in the press conference. Each time the bell goes, he puts his glove out to fist bump his opponent too. Into Round 3... 19:05 KSI is here Here comes the nightmare. KSI is in the building. He fights in the main event against Tommy Fury later. Can he shock the world? 19:02 My Mate Nate starting strong My Mate Nate has shown some good footwork in the first round. He has a strong jab and looks to be the better boxer technically. Whindersson Nunes is one scary guy though. 18:55 Ryan Taylor is here Ryan Taylor was supposed to face Swarmz in a prelim fight earlier today. However, he was arrested in the build-up and took to X to admit that he couldn't make weight after being in jail ahead of the fight. He's made it to the U.K. from Dubai though, and he's watching on. It could've been so different for Swarmz, who was knocked out by Ed Matthews just 30 seconds in. 18:54 UP NEXT: Whindersson Nunes vs My Mate Nate Next up is the Brazilian star Whinderson Nunes. He has over 60,000,000 followers on Instagram alone. He takes on My Mate Nate. Both of these fighters lost to King Kenny in the Kingpyn tournament earlier this year. 18:48 TAG TEAM RESULT: DRAW Pineda Coladas and WassabiLMAO in the tag team event ends in a draw. It's probably fair, but Alex Wassabi vs Luis Pineda could have been a bout of it's own, while I'd have loved to have seen B-Dave take on NichLmao himself. 18:44 Eddie Hearn is here Eddie Hearn said in recent days that his kids were begging to be in attendance tonight. Turns out he's given in - he's arrived! 18:43 Dillon Danis arrives Many were expecting him not to show up but Dillon Danis is here! The MMA star has arrived in fashion, pulling up to the arena in a Rolls Royce. 18:41 The action so far The prelims provided great entertainment earlier. We started off with DTG vs SX, with DTG coming out on top with a first round knock-out. Then came the Women's Flyweight clash as Astrid Wett came out on top by a split decision, which caused some discussion in the arena. Tempo Arts took the Misfits Heavyweight title, with another controversial decision. Then came Ed Matthews, who took the fight on just a few days' notice - and knocked Swarmz out just 30 seconds in. 18:33 Undercard underway! What a first round it's been in the first round of the tag team match up. We've seen Alex Wassabi drop Luis Pineda and make him bleed from the nose before B-Dave was tagged in and dropped Wassabi himself. This is entertainment!

They can't lose the ball as it's last play. 20:45 , 77 ' Ireland are chasing everything (24-28) Ireland can't get any clean ball as the All Blacks keep recycling it in midfield. They are showing their experience and Ireland are so desperate to score a try that would surely win the match now. 20:42 , 75 ' Taylor comes back on (24-28) Taylor is back in the fray after completing his sinbin. All Blacks back to full strength and have a lineout in Ireland's half. 20:39 , 72 ' Try held up (24-28) Ireland's maul is motoring over the line but Jordi Barrett is there to get under the ball and hold it up. All Blacks relieve the pressure as Doris then drops the kick. 20:38 , 70 ' Penalty Ireland (24-28) Sexton does brilliant to dummy and then offload with a kick then putting Barrett under pressure. His pass back infield is closed down by Aki who turns over and Ireland have another lineout five metres out. 20:36 , 70 ' Barrett kicks three points (24-28) It's another uncharacteristic penalty and this time Barrett doesn't make a mistake from the tee. 20:34 , 67 ' Barrett misses penalty (24-25) New Zealand win another penalty at the scrum as Porter is penalised again for kicking his hips out but Barrett spurs the chance. 20:29 , 64 ' PENALTY TRY IRELAND (24-25) It's a seven-point try for Ireland as they win their lineout and Taylor drags the maul down over the line. He's yellow carded and that is a penalty try for Ireland. New Zealand are down to 14-men and lead by just one point. 20:28 , 64 ' Ireland take a lineout deep in New Zealand's half (17-25) Ireland win a penalty and Sexton kicks for touch as Ireland look to try and get another try to bring them back into the game. 20:27 , 61 ' Further replacements for both sides (17-25) Both sides make further changes as the experienced Sam Whitelock comes on for his record 24th World Cup appearance. Meanwhile Ireland bring on Conor Murray to replace Gibson-Park. 20:24 , 59 ' Ireland changes (17-25) Off - Hansen, Furlong, Henderson, Van der Flier On - Bealham, Conan, McCarthy, O'Brien 20:22 , 59 ' Sexton misses penalty kick (17-25) Sexton lines his kick up and pulls his shot left to the dismay of the crowd. 20:21 , 57 ' Ireland have to respond quickly (17-25) There is some panic in the Ireland squad and they need to calm down to try and get back into this game. There's been a couple of handling errors in the last few minutes and Ireland need to try and get the ball wide quickly as the All Blacks rush men into breakdowns. Ireland win a penalty. 20:16 , 54 ' Try converted (17-25) Barrett It's a brilliant kick from Jordi Barrett as he completes the conversion from a tight angle. Ireland can't let the All Blacks score again! 20:14 , 53 ' TRY NEW ZEALAND (17-23) Jordan It's pure pace as the All Blacks combine to get the better of Ireland's defence. Jordan is sent over the line by Faingaanuku for a crucial try. What a moment that is. 20:13 , 52 ' Brilliant turnover from the All Blacks (17-18) Ireland break and go through the hands for a few phases but are punished as they too many individuals go on their own and a successful jackal follows. 20:11 , 49 ' New Zealand make solid progress (17-18) New Zealand have weathered Ireland well so far in the second half and are beginning to get some joy through physical forward play. Smith tries to exploit a lapse in concentration by picking and going but is stopped as the All Blacks push the Irish back. 20:08 , 47 ' Sheehan just can't get there (17-18) Hansen kicks to the wing for Sheehan to chase and he is in if he can get the ball but it takes a big bounce and goes over his head and dead. That would have been a certain try if he got hands to it. 20:06 , 45 ' New Zealand scrum five metres out (17-18) It's not perfect defending but the All Blacks get a scrum inside their own five-metre line and win the ball well. They clear upfield and Smith is now back on the pitch after serving his sinbin. 20:03 , 43 ' All Blacks keeping things tight in midfield (17-18) New Zealand are a man down but you wouldn't know it as they move through the gears in midfield and use their forwards to keep hold of the ball. Ireland need to get the ball wide. 20:01 Back underway in Paris (17-18) We are back underway as Ireland trail by just a single point. 19:45 HALF TIME: Ireland 17-18 New Zealand What a half of epic rugby that was! Here's hoping the next 40 minutes are just as good with Ireland trailing by just a single point. They wil need to cut out the mistakes they started the game with and have to use their mad advantage in the early minutes as Aaron Smith finishes his time in the sinbin. It's been electric heavyweight rugby but Ireland have just started to show their quality before half time. Don't go anywhere because this match has plenty of spills and thrills still to come. 19:45 , 40 ' Try converted (17-18) Sexton makes no mistake as he completes his conversion. What a game this has been so far. 19:43 , 39 ' TRY IRELAND (15-18) Gibson-Park It's try time for Ireland as the scrum-half slides over the line despite being manhandled by three All Black players. The stadium erupts in celebration. Sexton has to convert this. 19:43 , 38 ' Ireland get another penalty at the breakdown (10-18) Ireland spread the ball again and get another penalty as New Zealand look to hang on. Desperate defending on show. 19:41 , 37 ' Aaron Smith sinbinned (10-18) Smith is pinged for a deliberate knock-on and Ireland kick to the corner as they look to use their man advantage. 19:40 , 37 ' Ireland's frustrations are growing (10-18) This wasn't how things were meant to play out for Ireland as they trail by eight and have never been ahead in this match. We now have a video check for a delberate knock-on by New Zealand. 19:38 , 35 ' Conversion missed (10-18) It wasn't the most difficult kick but Mo'unga slices it and New Zealand take just five points. 19:36 , 33 ' TRY NEW ZEALAND (10-18) Savea Ireland are offside at the breakdown and give up possession that the All Blacks make no mistake with as Savea finds space on the wing and leaps over the line. That was a wingers try and don't forget Savea is a number 8! 19:35 , 31 ' Huge tackle rescues Ireland (10-13) The All Blacks are executing their gameplan almost perfectly with chips over the top wreaking havoc in the Ireland defence but just as Savea looked to build up speed he was dropped by Sheehan. Ireland turnover at just the right time. 19:32 , 29 ' Try converted (10-13) Sexton has an easy kick to complete the try and does so to reduce the deficit to just three. 19:30 , 27 ' TRY IRELAND (8-13) Aki Was it ever in doubt?! Ireland finally click and score a brilliant try through Aki. The pass to him was too high and caused him to stop but it doesn't matter as he cuts inside, steps two players and then finishes beautifully. Superb rugby. 19:28 New Zealand win Ireland's lineout (3-13) Ireland's lineout is stolen by the All Blacks in another rare lapse in concentration. They fortunately get the ball back with Sexton chasing down a kick through but New Zealand get a hand to it first. The Irish look short of ideas so far. 19:27 , 24 ' Temporary stop as the referee has lost comms (3-13) We have a momentary stop as referee Wayne Barnes explains he has lost communication with the VAR room. There is a check for a dangerous tackle on Aki but no penalty is given. Sexton isn't convinced. 19:24 , 22 ' Sexton gets Ireland's first points (3-13) The All Blacks concede a silly penalty for obstruction after the restart and Sexton kicks his penalty straight down the throat of the pitch to get Ireland their first points. 19:23 Try converted (0-13) The All Blacks increase their lead with a pinpoint kick from out wide. All Blacks lead by 13. 19:21 , 19 ' TRY NEW ZEALAND (0-11) It's beautiful individual play from Beauden Barrett as he weaves his way through a host of tackles before spreading the ball wide. They play with speed out wide and show magic hands as Leicester Faringa’anuku crosses the line. 19:20 , 18 ' New Zealand defence disrupts Ireland (0-6) Ireland mount another attack and get to within five metres but the All Blacks are so quick off the line that they force a turnover before clearing their lines. The Irish come again and concede another penalty as Josh van der Flier carries in. That's five penalties already against Ireland. 19:17 , 14 ' Barrett increases All Blacks lead (0-6) It's a long kick to reach the posts but Barrett has been here before and punts his effort over beautifully. Another three points on the scoreboard. 19:16 , 13 ' Brilliant physical battle ensuing (0-3) The two sets teams are going at this hammer and tongs as the All Blacks get the better of Ireland with Savea putting in a big hit on Doris to win a penalty. Barrett will kick for points. 19:13 , 11 ' Ireland mount their first attack (0-3) Ireland race up the other end and have a chance of scoring the game's first try but the final pass out to Lowe is overhit and he can't get to it as it dribbles out of play. All Blacks win their lineout and recycle the ball back up to the halfway line. 19:10 , 8 ' New Zealand take the lead (0-3) Richie Mo'unga kicks the penalty to get early points on the board for New Zealand. 19:08 , 5 ' Ireland's defence stands strong (0-0) The All Blacks get their first chance to test Ireland's defence and keep hold of the ball brilliantly as they slowly make ground through their forwards before trying to go wide switching the ball from wing-to-wing. They get inside the 10-metre line and play goes on for 30 phases before New Zeland then win a penalty for Ireland not rolling away. Great play all-round, 19:05 , 3 ' Ireland penalised at the scrum (0-0) Ireland show their strenght but too much of it as Andrew Porter comes across the front row when he kicks his hips out and the All Blacks get a penalty that they kick to find touch. 19:04 , 2 ' Early mistakes caused by nervous start (0-0) The nerves are on show as Ireland struggle to chase down from kick-off before New Zealand boot a clearance kick straight out of play. We then have a knock-on and the All Blacks get the first scrum. 19:01 KICK-OFF: Ireland get us underway in Paris (0-0) Johnny Sexton boots the ball in the air and we are underway. 80 minutes of high-octane action now lie ahead. 18:57 Anthems DONE The anthems are complete with Ireland's in particularly deafening as masses of supporters joined in. We are so close to getting underway, New Zealand will perform their haka and then it's GAME ON! 18:52 Here come the players... We are ready at the Stade de France as both teams emerge into a caudlron of noise in Paris. We will have the national anthems, New Zealand will perform the haka and then the real fireworks begin. Don't miss a single minute with our updates throughout the evening. 18:50 Prediction: Ireland win It's going to be tight, expect both teams to score but Ireland should have enough to seal victory tonight. Andy Farrell's side have more firepower in attack, more solidity in defence and a pack that should wear down the All Blacks. But it won't be easy. New Zealand aren't the force that dominated World Rugby previously and as far as completed teams go then Ireland have it all. Get ready because we are underway in 10 minutes. 18:43 Ireland look set to make history SHANE MCGRATH: The 9.10 train to St Denis deposited the last of the rush-hour commuters at the Stade de France station on Friday morning, and amid the dash of workers towards the office blocks that tower near the ground, were four fans in Irish jerseys. They looked older, perhaps in their late 60s, and they ambled as close to the stadium as security would permit them, looking up at the tournament paraphernalia adorning this great concrete bowl.

Mail Online 18:38 Ireland's dangerman: Bundee Aki If Ireland are to cement their place in the smi-finals then Bundee Aki will be crucial to their success tonight. The centre was actually born in New Zealand but represents Ireland after qualifying to do so and how the All Blacks will be wishing he had committed to them instead. Aki has been sensational at this World Cup so far, having made more runs (61) than any other player and scoring 20 points for the Irish. Ireland possess so many dangerous attackers but Aki is the one to watch tonight. 18:24 The stat that dents Ireland's hopes For all of their brilliance over the past 12 months, Ireland face a daunting task tonight that they previously haven't fared very well in . Despite making all but two Rugby World Cup quarter-final clashes in previous competitions, the Irish have never made it to the semi-final stage, Coincidentally at the last RWC in Japan four-years ago they were knocked out at this stage by the All Blacks in a crushing 46-14 defeat.

KSI vs Tommy Fury fight LIVE: Follow the action from the main event here 20:40 No love lost between these two We've told you already about the violence that kicked off at the weigh-in this week, but have a look for yourselves: Paul and Danis both threw a mic at each other, with Paul's face bloodied in the incident. If you have any doubts that these two are pretending for the cameras, this video will probably change your mind. 20:32 Danis ready to go! The loudmouth fighter has been drumming up anticipation for this fight, and the day is finally here. Only time will tell if he's this calm and composed when the matchup is over. 20:22 Sealed with a kiss! We're not far out from Paul-Danis now, and the former has posted a loved-up photo with fiancee Nina Agdal before the fight. Of course, Danis has also posted about Agdal quite a bit online - so much so that she got a restraining order against him! Logan Paul shares a kiss with fiancee before fight with Dillon Danis Many insults directed at Paul have surrounded his fiancee, so much so that Nina Agdal filed a $150,000 (£122,000) lawsuit and also took out a restraining order against the MMA fighter. Mail Online 20:00 Danis makes his grand entrance 19:52 Danis has kept his trolling up right until the day of the bout 19:45 Paul means business Dillon Danis's trolling of Logan Paul 's fiancee, Nina Agdal , has only provided his rival with extra ammunition, a source previously revealed to DailyMail.com. Paul is heading into the ring tonight looking to avenge the disgusting attacks on his fiancee. 'With Dillon's constant trolling, Logan's attitude has only changed to hating Dillon even more,' a source close to Paul told DailyMail.com. 'He'd love to see him arrested and be held accountable for all the trolling. Logan wants to get in the ring right now and make Dillon's face have a similar look to ground beef. He literally hates him. 'Logan is training as hard as possible, and in his mind and his team's mind, he must win. There is no other option that can happen. 'If Logan loses this fight, it will be the biggest embarrassment for him professionally ever and he will never be able to forgive himself or talk himself out of it. He wants to make Nina proud and avenge all that she has been put through. Knocking out Dillon is what needs to happen, anything else would not be a good look.' 19:36 Logan Paul is in the house Logan Paul has arrived with fiancee Nine Agdal as he prepares to fave Dillon Danis and avenge the personal attacks the model has faced from his rival. 19:29 Damage done before the fight even starts Dillon Danis was getting physical before the bout even begun when he hit Logan Paul with a microphone at their final press conference Thursday. Danis and Paul were on stage discussing their upcoming bout when the ugly scenes broke out. Danis was furious with some comments Paul had made about an alleged daughter of his. The pair engaged in a verbal row before things turned physical. Danis launched at Paul and hit the 28-year-old in the face with his microphone - connecting cleanly on Paul's forehead. Despite the cut, Logan is still prepared to go ahead with the fight tonight 19:20 Whindersson Nunes vs My Mate Nate Whindersson Nunes vs My Mate Nate is the next fight on the cards in a clash of the influencers.

One of the judges scores it 39-37 to Pineda & BDave, the next sees it 39-37 for Wassabi & NichLmao, the final judge scores it 38-38. 18:44 Inside Dillon Danis' despicable attacks Dillon Danis has dominated the headlines - and made most of them himself - in the buildup to his bout with Logan Paul and not for the right reasons. Despite both fighters seeking the advantage in the mind games stakes over one another, it was Danis who took their feud to an entirely different and toxic level. Paul's fiancee, model Nina Agdal, has been caught in the firing line as Danis reuglarly used her to target his oponent. Day by day, he began to post half-naked pictures of Agdal , and even shared a private video in which she discussed her sexual cravings. The end result was a restraining order and a lawsuit from the Dane against Danis. Mail Sport delves back over a grizzly past couple of months. 18:33 Good evening!

Pakistan were routed by seven wickets in a disappointingly one-sided clash. They collapsed from 155-2 to be all out for 191 before India coasted home to their target with 117 balls to spare. Skipper Rohit Sharma’s 86 and an inspired bowling display helped India hammer Pakistan, who were bowled out for 191. They overhauled the total with 117 balls to spare to extend their unbeaten streak against their neighbours to eight in the 50-over showpiece tournament. Rohit stood out in his 63-ball knock laced with six fours and six sixes to keep India, who began the event as favourites to win the title, unbeaten in their three matches in this edition. Pakistan now have two wins and one defeat in the 10-nation tournament. “It felt good,” said man of the match, Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah who had figures of 2-19 off nine overs. Rohit hit the ball to all parts of the ground with his delightful flicks and pulls to entertain an almost all-Indian crowd at the world´s biggest cricket stadium after Pakistanis were effectively banned from attending. India lost Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli — both for 16 — before Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit the winning four to reach 53, put on 77 runs for the third wicket and placed India comfortably on course for victory. Rohit fell attempting another hit off Shaheen Shah Afridi to get caught at mid-wicket, but Iyer and KL Rahul took the team home with ease. Bowlers set up victory after India elected to field and Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets each. Pakistan were bowled out in 42.5 overs, losing eight wickets for 36 runs in 80 balls. The total was Pakistan’s third lowest against India in the World Cup after their 173 in Sydney (1992) and 180 at Manchester (1999). Pakistan started strongly but lost their openers before skipper Babar Azam (50) and Mohammad Rizwan (49) attempted to rebuild and hit back in their stand of 82. Azam reached his fifty off 57 balls with a boundary but fell in the next over, bowled by Siraj as the crowd roared to see the back of the world´s number one ODI batsman. Kuldeep Yadav soon struck twice in an over to send back the left-handed Saud Shakeel and Iftikhar Ahmed, bowled around the legs for four after the ball deflected off the batsman´s gloves. Bumrah denied Rizwan his fifty with a slower-off cutter that rattled the stumps as Pakistan slipped to 168-6. Bumrah, playing in front of his home crowd, had a spring in his step and struck again in the next over to get Shadab Khan out for two before Pandya and Jadeja combined to wrap up the tail. “You try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible so when we started bowling, we came to know that the wicket was on the slower side and a hard length would make run-scoring more difficult,” added Bumrah. “There was no consistent turn but it was turning a little bit and I count my slower ball as a spinner so I thought it might be an option. I was trying to do that and it gripped – it was one of those days.” The hotly-anticipated match raised enormous interest with city hotels booked and desperate fans even booking full-body check ups in local hospitals to be sure of a place to sleep. A prominent hotel in the city usually charges 6,000 rupees ($72) for a deluxe room but on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the price for a day had been hiked to 70,000 rupees ($841). Only a trickle of Pakistanis, many expatriates, made it to the game after fans from across the border endured visa delays.

The Kangaroos, led by the fearsome front row duo of Payne Haas and Tino Fa’asuamaleaui, got off to a red-hot start but Samoa hung tough as the Aussies kept them in the game with some simple errors. A couple of test debutants in the centres also had outstanding nights and Australia proved too classy in the end. Read on for foxsports.com.au’s Kangaroos player ratings.

JAMES TEDESCO - 8 Broke the line with ease to go over for the game’s second try, embarrassing a classy Samoa right edge. Made seven tackle busts from just 10 runs, recorded two line breaks and ran for 142 metres. A good night out for the skipper who has endured a difficult season. It was a clear statement that he’s not done yet with representative football. 2. DYLAN EDWARDS - 7 Other than a simple error in the first half, he didn’t look out of place in his representative debut in a position somewhat foreign to him. Even on the wing, his metre-eating ways didn’t fall by the wayside, as he ran for the second-most metres of any Kangaroo (144). 3. HAMISO TABUAI-FIDOW - 9.5 Impressive test debut. Showed the turn of foot of an Everest-winner when scoring his first try from deep inside Australia’s end, making something out of nothing. “That is a side of sensational,” Andrew Voss said on Fox League. Crossed from short range to score his second try, which broke a second half stalemate. Laid a bone-crunching hit on Brian To’o late in the game. 4. KOTONI STAGGS - 9 Thought he was exceptional in his international debut. Opened up the defence early in the game but couldn’t hit the pass back inside, which would have resulted in a try. Looked threatening all night and wasn’t afraid to hit hard in defence. Scored the try he deserved with five seconds left, chasing down a lovely grubber. Kicked goals as well, ending up with a personal haul of 14 points. 5. SELWYN COBBO - 6.5 Caught napping in defence a couple of times, one of those moments resulted in a Samoa try when Murray Taulagi got behind him to chase down a grubber. Apart from that, he made some tough runs out of his own end and seemed to make all of them count. Fox League’s Corey Parker said the winger’s spot may be under pressure with Val Holmes waiting in the wings and Staggs and Tabuai-Fidow impressing in the centres. Selwyn Cobbo may be under pressure to keep his spot in the Kangaroos side according to Corey Parker. Source: Getty Images 6. CAMERON MUNSTER - 8 Seemingly had his hands in everything in the first half, setting up two tries. Threatening with the ball but did miss a couple of key tackles. Pretty decent night. 7. DALY CHERRY-EVANS - 7 Led the team around the park well and did all that he had to in a team full of stars but didn’t shine. His best moment of the night came in the dying moments when putting in a pinpoint grubber to set up a Staggs try. Solid outing. 8. PAYNE HAAS - 9.5 Played just 44 minutes but he made all of them count. Committed an early knock on but quickly put it out of his mind as soon after he barged over from ten meters out for the first try with four defenders draped over him. His first 15 minutes was sheer dominance (72 metres, four tackle busts, try), with he and front row partner Tino Fa’asuamaleaui moving the ball down the field with ease with Samoa always on the back foot during that span. Finished with 141 metres from 14 runs, six tackle busts and 13 tackles with no misses. 9. BEN HUNT - 6 Set up Tino’s first half try with some classy work from dummy-half. Wasn’t a threat running the ball, only carrying it once for four metres. Service was good but he didn’t impact the game heavily during his 41 minutes on the park.

TINO FA’ASUAMALEAUI - 9.5 He had an excellent first stint (26mins), which included a try from close range in addition to five tackle busts and 90 running metres. As mentioned, he and Payne Haas were the tone setters for the Kangaroos during their dominant first 20 minutes which saw Australia open up to a 22-0 lead. The only critique was letting a late consolation try go begging after dropping a sitter when a gaping hole opened up. 11. CAMERON MURRAY - 7 Pinned the ears back and backed himself when scoring his first half try, seeing the gap on the left edge. Worked hard all night. 12. LIAM MARTIN - 6.5 Injected himself into the game with plenty of venom in defence. Tried hard as always but others were better. 13. ISAAH YEO - 8 Gave off a lovely short ball to Payne Haas to set up the first try. Did some good things in attack and was flawless in defence, recording 27 tackles with zero misses. INTERCHANGE BENCH: 14. HARRY GRANT - 6 Split the load with Ben Hunt, playing the middle 40 minutes. Worked hard in defence as the game came to a bit of a standstill. 15. LINDSAY COLLINS - 7.5 He may not have had the impact with ball in hand as the starting front row of Haas and Tino but the Roosters big man should be pretty happy with his body of work. In just 37 minutes off the bench, he had 34 tackles. Quite the effort. Get all the latest NRL news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail.

Played 30 high-impact minutes off the bench, running for 78 metres from seven hit-ups.","pubDate":"2023-10-14 18:56:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e21f68d5dbd07322f9c9d530f8bb25b6","title":"Happy Birthday Babar Azam: Fans Wish Pakistan Cricket Team Captain As He Turns 29","link":"https://www.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/happy-birthday-babar-azam-fans-wish-pakistan-cricket-team-captain-as-he-turns-29-5488286.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Babar Azam gets showered by wishes from his fans across the world as the Pakistan cricket team captain celebrate his 29th birthday on Sunday.","content":"One of the best batters of this generation of cricketers, Pakistan captain Babar Azam turned 29 on October 15, 2023.

Indian skipper Rohit Sharma’s flowing batting form set the stage for India’s comprehensive seven-wicket victory over Pakistan. Bumrah outsmarted Rizwan just one short of a half-century, with a slow off-cutter doing the trick. And in his very next over, Bumrah got one to land on the surface and curve in towards Shadab Khan’s off-stump, cleaning up the batter. “We were bowling in the middle overs and I saw Jaddu’s ball was turning, not too much but a little bit. I count my slower ball as a spinner’s slower ball, one of those days where it came off,” Jasprit Bumrah said during the post-match presentation. He made it clear that the delivery that led to Shadab’s dismissal wasn’t a leg-cutter but rather a unique case of the white-ball reversing. “The little phase where there was reverse swing, one of the occasions when the white ball was reverse swinging,” Bumrah said on the ball that got Shadab. “It felt good. Usually you try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible. We realised the wicket is on the slower side so we wanted to bowl hard lengths. We were trying to make it as difficult as possible. Just being aware I guess. I used to ask a lot of questions when I was young and that helps me now. Now I’m experienced. In my younger days, they (seniors) were used to being troubled by me sometimes (with questions), but it helps to read the wicket and try different options,” he added. The Men in Blue are undefeated in the tournament after notching three wins in succession and will next face Bangladesh on October 17 at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune.

India bowled out Pakistan for 191 after their rivals collapsed from 155-2. They overhauled the total with 117 balls to spare to extend their unbeaten streak against their neighbours to eight in the 50-over showpiece tournament. Rohit stood out in his 63-ball knock laced with six fours and six sixes to keep India, who began the event as favourites to win the title, unbeaten in their three matches in this edition. Pakistan now have two wins and one defeat in the 10-nation tournament. “It felt good,” said man of the match, Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah who had figures of 2-19 off nine overs. Rohit hit the ball to all parts of the ground with his delightful flicks and pulls to entertain an almost all-Indian crowd at the world’s biggest cricket stadium after Pakistanis were effectively banned from attending. India lost Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli—both for 16 — before Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit the winning four to reach 53, put on 77 runs for the third wicket and placed India comfortably on course for victory. Rohit fell attempting another hit off Shaheen Shah Afridi to get caught at mid-wicket, but Iyer and KL Rahul took the team home with ease. Bowlers set up victory after India elected to field and Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets each. Pakistan were bowled out in 42.5 overs, losing eight wickets for 36 runs in 80 balls. The total was Pakistan’s third lowest against India in the World Cup after their 173 in Sydney (1992) and 180 at Manchester (1999). Pakistan started strongly but lost their openers before skipper Babar Azam (50) and Mohammad Rizwan (49) attempted to rebuild and hit back in their stand of 82. Azam reached his fifty off 57 balls with a boundary but fell in the next over, bowled by Siraj as the crowd roared to see the back of the world’s number one ODI batsman. Kuldeep Yadav soon struck twice in an over to send back the left-handed Saud Shakeel and Iftikhar Ahmed, bowled around the legs for four after the ball deflected off the batsman’s gloves. Bumrah denied Rizwan his fifty with a slower-off cutter that rattled the stumps as Pakistan slipped to 168-6. Bumrah, playing in front of his home crowd, had a spring in his step and struck again in the next over to get Shadab Khan out for two before Pandya and Jadeja combined to wrap up the tail. “You try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible so when we started bowling, we came to know that the wicket was on the slower side and a hard length would make run-scoring more difficult,” added Bumrah. “There was no consistent turn but it was turning a little bit and I count my slower ball as a spinner so I thought it might be an option. I was trying to do that and it gripped – it was one of those days.” The hotly-anticipated match raised enormous interest with city hotels booked and desperate fans even booking full-body check ups in local hospitals to be sure of a place to sleep. A prominent hotel in the city usually charges 6,000 rupees ($72) for a deluxe room but on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the price for a day had been hiked to 70,000 rupees ($841). Only a trickle of Pakistanis, many expatriates, made it to the game after fans from across the border endured visa delays.—AFP","pubDate":"2023-10-14 18:19:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","source_priority":295375,"country":["kuwait"],"category":["sports"],"language":"arabic"},{"article_id":"d594e5749586f57ac3a71842ddb71c33","title":"PM Modi hails Indian team’s “all-round excellence” in World Cup clash against Pakistan","link":"https://thenewsmill.com/2023/10/pm-modi-hails-indian-teams-all-round-excellence-in-world-cup-clash-against-pakistan/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","ANI"],"creator":["ANI"],"video_url":null,"description":"The News Mill","content":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday hailed the Indian team’s performance in the World Cup clash against Pakistan and said victory was powered by all-around excellence. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who was in the stadium in Ahmedabad to witness the match, also hailed the victory. PM Modi extended his good wishes to the Indian team for the next matches in the World Cup. “Team India all the way! A great win today in Ahmedabad, powered by all round excellence. Congratulations to the team and best wishes for the matches ahead,” he said in a post on X. PM Modi, who on Saturday inaugurated the 141st International Olympic Committee (IOC) session in Mumbai, said India is eager to host the Olympics in the country. He also informed the gathering about India’s victory in the Cricket World Cup fixture against Pakistan at the world’s largest stadium in Ahmedabad to a roar of cheers. “I congratulate Team Bharat and every Indian on this historic victory,” he said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said Team India has continued its winning streak against Pakistan in the World Cup. “Tiranga flying high. A big round of applause for our cricket team for this stupendous victory. The team continues its winning streak against Pakistan in the ODI World Cup. You all have shown how much pride seamless teamwork with a common goal can achieve for our nation. My best wishes on your unrelenting march toward winning the World Cup 2023.,” he said in a post on X. BCCI Secretary Jay Shah said the bowlers displayed clinical precision by limiting Pakistan to just 191 runs and also praised captain Rohit Sharma’s knock. “Congratulations to Team India on their remarkable performance in the #CWC2023! With three consecutive wins, they have set the tournament on fire, demonstrating their prowess on the field. Our bowlers displayed clinical precision by limiting Pakistan to just 191 runs on what appeared to be a great batting deck, while our batters showcased incredible composure and finesse during the run chase, securing a comprehensive victory. Captain @ImRo45’s blistering knock in the run chase was the driving force behind our impressive victory, demonstrating his exceptional leadership and batting prowess. Let’s maintain this winning momentum and march forward.” The Indian batters looked well poised from the beginning to chase the Pakistan total of 191 as Babbar Azam-led men suffered a collapse, losing the last eight wickets for 36 runs. India won the toss and put Pakistan to bat. Shubman Gill, who made his first appearance in the ODI World Cup, scored some scintillating hits before losing his wicket. He struck three consecutive fours off Hasan Ali in the second over of the Indian innings. Shubman was out on Shaheen Shah Afridi’s bowling and the hope his wicket may have generated among Pakistan fans was short-lived. Virat Kohli joined Rohit, who was smooth in his power hitting. Kohli also came up with some strong blows before he was caught off the bowling of Hasan Ali during the powerplay. Rohit and Shreyas took charge and strode along even as Pakistan bowlers tried hard to get a breakthrough. The sea of Indian fans, many of them dressed in blue, cheered and waved as Indian batsmen struck. Rohit fell short of his well-deserved century by 14 runs. Shaheen claimed his second wicket of the night with Rohit walked back to the pavilion with a score of 86. In his well-paced innings, Rohit crossed the milestone of 300 ODI sixes which have come in 254 matches. With 351 sixes in 308 games, former Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi leads the tally, while West Indies legend Chris Gayle hammered 331 maximums in 301 encounters. After Rohit’s departure, Shreyas 53* and KL 19* guided India to a comprehensive 7-wicket victory to make it 8-0 in the World Cup between the two arch-rivals. Amit Shah joined the spectators at the Narendra Modi Stadium to witness the World Cup clash between India and Pakistan and cheered Indian team as it scored a magnificent victory. There was an electric atmosphere in the stadium as India dominated both with the bat and ball. As soon as Indian batters scored the winning runs chasing Pakistan’s total of 191, Amit Shah and the spectators stood up to celebrate the team’s victory and laud their performance.

I'm calm, relaxed, I know what I need to do. 'He can't deal with it. I'm letting the pressure build then eventually lights out. I have to hit him and he'll understand he can't rush me, simple. I won't need luck bro.' 19:55 ANTHONY TAYLOR WINS BY UNANIMOUS DECISION All three judges score the bout 49-45 in favour of Anthony Taylor. He's the new Misfits light heavyweight champion and falls on his back in celebration . 19:52 End of the fight Anthony Taylor did what he needed to do. I'll be shocked if this isn't a win for the American. Disappointing from King Kenny. 19:49 Into the final round 'Why are you backing up and trying to box when you're losing a fight?' asks Daley Perales. Brutal from Kenny's coach and brother. It's time to go for the knockout. 19:47 King Kenny: POINT DEDUCTED King Kenny sees a point deducted for excessive holding. If he's to win this, it will need to be a knock-out. 19:46 Commentators aren't happy I'm not too sure why but the commentators are complaining with Anthony Taylor's game plan. Yes, it's not making for the best watch. But you're matching him against a man with a huge reach advantage... 19:44 Kenny has to find his range King Kenny is allowing Anthony Taylor to rush him. He needs to find his range and utilise his reach advantage. There could be a knock-out here, if Taylor rushes him and Kenny can land a clean hand. Two more rounds left. 19:40 King Kenny's coach is not happy Daley Perales, brother and coach of King Kenny, is telling him he's not been good enough. He's encouraged his fighter to push Anthony Taylor back and bully him. 19:40 The celebrities are in the house Aitch is watching on. Could he walk KSI out today? 19:38 Scrappy fight so far Anthony Taylor is rushing King Kenny to get on the inside. It ends up with Kenny clenching his opponent and the pair have spent the majority of the fight holding onto each other. Scrappy. 19:33 Anthony Taylor with a wild start I've never seen anything like this. Anthony Taylor sprints at King Kenny like he's in the MMA. Kenny just grabs him before the referee separates the two. 19:32 The loudest cheer of the night so far Wow. What a reception for King Kenny. This could be the main event itself. The whole of Manchester are backing him. We're underway! 19:31 Logan Paul and Nina Agdal are in the building Logan Paul has arrived alongside his fiancee Nina Agdal. Just a reminder, if you need it, she is taking Dillon Danis to court. 19:26 UP NEXT: King Kenny vs Anthony Taylor Anthony Taylor went the distance with Tommy Fury before. He's coming in off a win against one of the highest-rated influencer boxers in Salt Papi. Could he pull off another upset and beat King Kenny next? 19:18 MY MATE NATE WINS BY UNANIMOUS DECISION The judges score it four rounds to none. It was a perfect game plan from the man fighting out of Thailand. He could go far in this scene! 19:16 Result up next That may be one of the better technical fights you'll see in influencer boxing. My Mate Nate found his range and used his jab, throwing a lot of punches. Whindersson Nunes went for the power shots and tried to knock him down. Let's see how the judges score this. For me, it's My Mate Nate or a draw. 19:08 The most respectful fight ever? It's no secret that My Mate Nate may be the nicest guy in the crossover boxing scene. He brought Whindersson Nunes Thai sweets in the press conference. Each time the bell goes, he puts his glove out to fist bump his opponent too. Into Round 3... 19:05 KSI is here Here comes the nightmare. KSI is in the building. He fights in the main event against Tommy Fury later. Can he shock the world? 19:02 My Mate Nate starting strong My Mate Nate has shown some good footwork in the first round. He has a strong jab and looks to be the better boxer technically. Whindersson Nunes is one scary guy though. 18:55 Ryan Taylor is here Ryan Taylor was supposed to face Swarmz in a prelim fight earlier today. However, he was arrested in the build-up and took to X to admit that he couldn't make weight after being in jail ahead of the fight. He's made it to the U.K. from Dubai though, and he's watching on. It could've been so different for Swarmz, who was knocked out by Ed Matthews just 30 seconds in. 18:54 UP NEXT: Whindersson Nunes vs My Mate Nate Next up is the Brazilian star Whinderson Nunes. He has over 60,000,000 followers on Instagram alone. He takes on My Mate Nate. Both of these fighters lost to King Kenny in the Kingpyn tournament earlier this year. 18:48 TAG TEAM RESULT: DRAW Pineda Coladas and WassabiLMAO in the tag team event ends in a draw. It's probably fair, but Alex Wassabi vs Luis Pineda could have been a bout of it's own, while I'd have loved to have seen B-Dave take on NichLmao himself. 18:44 Eddie Hearn is here Eddie Hearn said in recent days that his kids were begging to be in attendance tonight. Turns out he's given in - he's arrived! 18:43 Dillon Danis arrives Many were expecting him not to show up but Dillon Danis is here! The MMA star has arrived in fashion, pulling up to the arena in a Rolls Royce. 18:41 The action so far The prelims provided great entertainment earlier. We started off with DTG vs SX, with DTG coming out on top with a first round knock-out. Then came the Women's Flyweight clash as Astrid Wett came out on top by a split decision, which caused some discussion in the arena. Tempo Arts took the Misfits Heavyweight title, with another controversial decision. Then came Ed Matthews, who took the fight on just a few days' notice - and knocked Swarmz out just 30 seconds in. 18:33 Undercard underway!

They can't lose the ball as it's last play. 20:45 , 77 ' Ireland are chasing everything (24-28) Ireland can't get any clean ball as the All Blacks keep recycling it in midfield. They are showing their experience and Ireland are so desperate to score a try that would surely win the match now. 20:42 , 75 ' Taylor comes back on (24-28) Taylor is back in the fray after completing his sinbin. All Blacks back to full strength and have a lineout in Ireland's half. 20:39 , 72 ' Try held up (24-28) Ireland's maul is motoring over the line but Jordi Barrett is there to get under the ball and hold it up. All Blacks relieve the pressure as Doris then drops the kick. 20:38 , 70 ' Penalty Ireland (24-28) Sexton does brilliant to dummy and then offload with a kick then putting Barrett under pressure. His pass back infield is closed down by Aki who turns over and Ireland have another lineout five metres out. 20:36 , 70 ' Barrett kicks three points (24-28) It's another uncharacteristic penalty and this time Barrett doesn't make a mistake from the tee. 20:34 , 67 ' Barrett misses penalty (24-25) New Zealand win another penalty at the scrum as Porter is penalised again for kicking his hips out but Barrett spurs the chance. 20:29 , 64 ' PENALTY TRY IRELAND (24-25) It's a seven-point try for Ireland as they win their lineout and Taylor drags the maul down over the line. He's yellow carded and that is a penalty try for Ireland. New Zealand are down to 14-men and lead by just one point. 20:28 , 64 ' Ireland take a lineout deep in New Zealand's half (17-25) Ireland win a penalty and Sexton kicks for touch as Ireland look to try and get another try to bring them back into the game. 20:27 , 61 ' Further replacements for both sides (17-25) Both sides make further changes as the experienced Sam Whitelock comes on for his record 24th World Cup appearance. Meanwhile Ireland bring on Conor Murray to replace Gibson-Park. 20:24 , 59 ' Ireland changes (17-25) Off - Hansen, Furlong, Henderson, Van der Flier On - Bealham, Conan, McCarthy, O'Brien 20:22 , 59 ' Sexton misses penalty kick (17-25) Sexton lines his kick up and pulls his shot left to the dismay of the crowd. 20:21 , 57 ' Ireland have to respond quickly (17-25) There is some panic in the Ireland squad and they need to calm down to try and get back into this game. There's been a couple of handling errors in the last few minutes and Ireland need to try and get the ball wide quickly as the All Blacks rush men into breakdowns. Ireland win a penalty. 20:16 , 54 ' Try converted (17-25) Barrett It's a brilliant kick from Jordi Barrett as he completes the conversion from a tight angle. Ireland can't let the All Blacks score again! 20:14 , 53 ' TRY NEW ZEALAND (17-23) Jordan It's pure pace as the All Blacks combine to get the better of Ireland's defence. Jordan is sent over the line by Faingaanuku for a crucial try. What a moment that is. 20:13 , 52 ' Brilliant turnover from the All Blacks (17-18) Ireland break and go through the hands for a few phases but are punished as they too many individuals go on their own and a successful jackal follows. 20:11 , 49 ' New Zealand make solid progress (17-18) New Zealand have weathered Ireland well so far in the second half and are beginning to get some joy through physical forward play. Smith tries to exploit a lapse in concentration by picking and going but is stopped as the All Blacks push the Irish back. 20:08 , 47 ' Sheehan just can't get there (17-18) Hansen kicks to the wing for Sheehan to chase and he is in if he can get the ball but it takes a big bounce and goes over his head and dead. That would have been a certain try if he got hands to it. 20:06 , 45 ' New Zealand scrum five metres out (17-18) It's not perfect defending but the All Blacks get a scrum inside their own five-metre line and win the ball well. They clear upfield and Smith is now back on the pitch after serving his sinbin. 20:03 , 43 ' All Blacks keeping things tight in midfield (17-18) New Zealand are a man down but you wouldn't know it as they move through the gears in midfield and use their forwards to keep hold of the ball. Ireland need to get the ball wide. 20:01 Back underway in Paris (17-18) We are back underway as Ireland trail by just a single point. 19:45 HALF TIME: Ireland 17-18 New Zealand What a half of epic rugby that was! Here's hoping the next 40 minutes are just as good with Ireland trailing by just a single point. They wil need to cut out the mistakes they started the game with and have to use their mad advantage in the early minutes as Aaron Smith finishes his time in the sinbin. It's been electric heavyweight rugby but Ireland have just started to show their quality before half time. Don't go anywhere because this match has plenty of spills and thrills still to come. 19:45 , 40 ' Try converted (17-18) Sexton makes no mistake as he completes his conversion. What a game this has been so far. 19:43 , 39 ' TRY IRELAND (15-18) Gibson-Park It's try time for Ireland as the scrum-half slides over the line despite being manhandled by three All Black players. The stadium erupts in celebration. Sexton has to convert this. 19:43 , 38 ' Ireland get another penalty at the breakdown (10-18) Ireland spread the ball again and get another penalty as New Zealand look to hang on. Desperate defending on show. 19:41 , 37 ' Aaron Smith sinbinned (10-18) Smith is pinged for a deliberate knock-on and Ireland kick to the corner as they look to use their man advantage. 19:40 , 37 ' Ireland's frustrations are growing (10-18) This wasn't how things were meant to play out for Ireland as they trail by eight and have never been ahead in this match. We now have a video check for a delberate knock-on by New Zealand. 19:38 , 35 ' Conversion missed (10-18) It wasn't the most difficult kick but Mo'unga slices it and New Zealand take just five points. 19:36 , 33 ' TRY NEW ZEALAND (10-18) Savea Ireland are offside at the breakdown and give up possession that the All Blacks make no mistake with as Savea finds space on the wing and leaps over the line. That was a wingers try and don't forget Savea is a number 8! 19:35 , 31 ' Huge tackle rescues Ireland (10-13) The All Blacks are executing their gameplan almost perfectly with chips over the top wreaking havoc in the Ireland defence but just as Savea looked to build up speed he was dropped by Sheehan. Ireland turnover at just the right time. 19:32 , 29 ' Try converted (10-13) Sexton has an easy kick to complete the try and does so to reduce the deficit to just three. 19:30 , 27 ' TRY IRELAND (8-13) Aki Was it ever in doubt?! Ireland finally click and score a brilliant try through Aki. The pass to him was too high and caused him to stop but it doesn't matter as he cuts inside, steps two players and then finishes beautifully. Superb rugby. 19:28 New Zealand win Ireland's lineout (3-13) Ireland's lineout is stolen by the All Blacks in another rare lapse in concentration. They fortunately get the ball back with Sexton chasing down a kick through but New Zealand get a hand to it first. The Irish look short of ideas so far. 19:27 , 24 ' Temporary stop as the referee has lost comms (3-13) We have a momentary stop as referee Wayne Barnes explains he has lost communication with the VAR room. There is a check for a dangerous tackle on Aki but no penalty is given. Sexton isn't convinced. 19:24 , 22 ' Sexton gets Ireland's first points (3-13) The All Blacks concede a silly penalty for obstruction after the restart and Sexton kicks his penalty straight down the throat of the pitch to get Ireland their first points. 19:23 Try converted (0-13) The All Blacks increase their lead with a pinpoint kick from out wide. All Blacks lead by 13. 19:21 , 19 ' TRY NEW ZEALAND (0-11) It's beautiful individual play from Beauden Barrett as he weaves his way through a host of tackles before spreading the ball wide. They play with speed out wide and show magic hands as Leicester Faringa’anuku crosses the line. 19:20 , 18 ' New Zealand defence disrupts Ireland (0-6) Ireland mount another attack and get to within five metres but the All Blacks are so quick off the line that they force a turnover before clearing their lines. The Irish come again and concede another penalty as Josh van der Flier carries in. That's five penalties already against Ireland. 19:17 , 14 ' Barrett increases All Blacks lead (0-6) It's a long kick to reach the posts but Barrett has been here before and punts his effort over beautifully. Another three points on the scoreboard. 19:16 , 13 ' Brilliant physical battle ensuing (0-3) The two sets teams are going at this hammer and tongs as the All Blacks get the better of Ireland with Savea putting in a big hit on Doris to win a penalty. Barrett will kick for points. 19:13 , 11 ' Ireland mount their first attack (0-3) Ireland race up the other end and have a chance of scoring the game's first try but the final pass out to Lowe is overhit and he can't get to it as it dribbles out of play. All Blacks win their lineout and recycle the ball back up to the halfway line. 19:10 , 8 ' New Zealand take the lead (0-3) Richie Mo'unga kicks the penalty to get early points on the board for New Zealand. 19:08 , 5 ' Ireland's defence stands strong (0-0) The All Blacks get their first chance to test Ireland's defence and keep hold of the ball brilliantly as they slowly make ground through their forwards before trying to go wide switching the ball from wing-to-wing. They get inside the 10-metre line and play goes on for 30 phases before New Zeland then win a penalty for Ireland not rolling away. Great play all-round, 19:05 , 3 ' Ireland penalised at the scrum (0-0) Ireland show their strenght but too much of it as Andrew Porter comes across the front row when he kicks his hips out and the All Blacks get a penalty that they kick to find touch. 19:04 , 2 ' Early mistakes caused by nervous start (0-0) The nerves are on show as Ireland struggle to chase down from kick-off before New Zealand boot a clearance kick straight out of play. We then have a knock-on and the All Blacks get the first scrum. 19:01 KICK-OFF: Ireland get us underway in Paris (0-0) Johnny Sexton boots the ball in the air and we are underway. 80 minutes of high-octane action now lie ahead. 18:57 Anthems DONE The anthems are complete with Ireland's in particularly deafening as masses of supporters joined in. We are so close to getting underway, New Zealand will perform their haka and then it's GAME ON! 18:52 Here come the players... We are ready at the Stade de France as both teams emerge into a caudlron of noise in Paris. We will have the national anthems, New Zealand will perform the haka and then the real fireworks begin. Don't miss a single minute with our updates throughout the evening. 18:50 Prediction: Ireland win It's going to be tight, expect both teams to score but Ireland should have enough to seal victory tonight. Andy Farrell's side have more firepower in attack, more solidity in defence and a pack that should wear down the All Blacks. But it won't be easy. New Zealand aren't the force that dominated World Rugby previously and as far as completed teams go then Ireland have it all. Get ready because we are underway in 10 minutes. 18:43 Ireland look set to make history SHANE MCGRATH: The 9.10 train to St Denis deposited the last of the rush-hour commuters at the Stade de France station on Friday morning, and amid the dash of workers towards the office blocks that tower near the ground, were four fans in Irish jerseys. They looked older, perhaps in their late 60s, and they ambled as close to the stadium as security would permit them, looking up at the tournament paraphernalia adorning this great concrete bowl. READ THE FULL STORY BELOW Ireland look to break World Cup hoodoo against New Zealand SHANE MCGRATH: The extent and nature of Ireland's support has been one of the stories of this World Cup, matched by the quality of the team they are cheering on. Mail Online 18:38 Ireland's dangerman: Bundee Aki If Ireland are to cement their place in the smi-finals then Bundee Aki will be crucial to their success tonight. The centre was actually born in New Zealand but represents Ireland after qualifying to do so and how the All Blacks will be wishing he had committed to them instead. Aki has been sensational at this World Cup so far, having made more runs (61) than any other player and scoring 20 points for the Irish. Ireland possess so many dangerous attackers but Aki is the one to watch tonight. 18:24 The stat that dents Ireland's hopes For all of their brilliance over the past 12 months, Ireland face a daunting task tonight that they previously haven't fared very well in . Despite making all but two Rugby World Cup quarter-final clashes in previous competitions, the Irish have never made it to the semi-final stage, Coincidentally at the last RWC in Japan four-years ago they were knocked out at this stage by the All Blacks in a crushing 46-14 defeat. Hopefully they have learnt from that. 18:18 Conor McGregor sends expletive warning to New Zealand MMA star Conor McGregor has sent an expletive message to New Zealand's All Blacks ahead of their Rugby World Cup clash against Ireland.

If you have any doubts that these two are pretending for the cameras, this video will probably change your mind. 20:32 Danis ready to go! The loudmouth fighter has been drumming up anticipation for this fight, and the day is finally here. Only time will tell if he's this calm and composed when the matchup is over. 20:22 Sealed with a kiss! We're not far out from Paul-Danis now, and the former has posted a loved-up photo with fiancee Nina Agdal before the fight. Of course, Danis has also posted about Agdal quite a bit online - so much so that she got a restraining order against him! Logan Paul shares a kiss with fiancee before fight with Dillon Danis Many insults directed at Paul have surrounded his fiancee, so much so that Nina Agdal filed a $150,000 (£122,000) lawsuit and also took out a restraining order against the MMA fighter. Mail Online 20:00 Danis makes his grand entrance 19:52 Danis has kept his trolling up right until the day of the bout 19:45 Paul means business Dillon Danis's trolling of Logan Paul 's fiancee, Nina Agdal , has only provided his rival with extra ammunition, a source previously revealed to DailyMail.com. Paul is heading into the ring tonight looking to avenge the disgusting attacks on his fiancee. 'With Dillon's constant trolling, Logan's attitude has only changed to hating Dillon even more,' a source close to Paul told DailyMail.com. 'He'd love to see him arrested and be held accountable for all the trolling. Logan wants to get in the ring right now and make Dillon's face have a similar look to ground beef. He literally hates him. 'Logan is training as hard as possible, and in his mind and his team's mind, he must win. There is no other option that can happen. 'If Logan loses this fight, it will be the biggest embarrassment for him professionally ever and he will never be able to forgive himself or talk himself out of it. He wants to make Nina proud and avenge all that she has been put through. Knocking out Dillon is what needs to happen, anything else would not be a good look.' 19:36 Logan Paul is in the house Logan Paul has arrived with fiancee Nine Agdal as he prepares to fave Dillon Danis and avenge the personal attacks the model has faced from his rival. 19:29 Damage done before the fight even starts Dillon Danis was getting physical before the bout even begun when he hit Logan Paul with a microphone at their final press conference Thursday. Danis and Paul were on stage discussing their upcoming bout when the ugly scenes broke out. Danis was furious with some comments Paul had made about an alleged daughter of his. The pair engaged in a verbal row before things turned physical. Danis launched at Paul and hit the 28-year-old in the face with his microphone - connecting cleanly on Paul's forehead.

Despite both fighters seeking the advantage in the mind games stakes over one another, it was Danis who took their feud to an entirely different and toxic level. Paul's fiancee, model Nina Agdal, has been caught in the firing line as Danis reuglarly used her to target his oponent. Day by day, he began to post half-naked pictures of Agdal , and even shared a private video in which she discussed her sexual cravings. The end result was a restraining order and a lawsuit from the Dane against Danis. Mail Sport delves back over a grizzly past couple of months. 18:33 Good evening!

Pakistan were routed by seven wickets in a disappointingly one-sided clash. They collapsed from 155-2 to be all out for 191 before India coasted home to their target with 117 balls to spare. Skipper Rohit Sharma’s 86 and an inspired bowling display helped India hammer Pakistan, who were bowled out for 191. They overhauled the total with 117 balls to spare to extend their unbeaten streak against their neighbours to eight in the 50-over showpiece tournament. Rohit stood out in his 63-ball knock laced with six fours and six sixes to keep India, who began the event as favourites to win the title, unbeaten in their three matches in this edition. Pakistan now have two wins and one defeat in the 10-nation tournament. “It felt good,” said man of the match, Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah who had figures of 2-19 off nine overs. Rohit hit the ball to all parts of the ground with his delightful flicks and pulls to entertain an almost all-Indian crowd at the world´s biggest cricket stadium after Pakistanis were effectively banned from attending. India lost Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli — both for 16 — before Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit the winning four to reach 53, put on 77 runs for the third wicket and placed India comfortably on course for victory. Rohit fell attempting another hit off Shaheen Shah Afridi to get caught at mid-wicket, but Iyer and KL Rahul took the team home with ease. Bowlers set up victory after India elected to field and Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets each. Pakistan were bowled out in 42.5 overs, losing eight wickets for 36 runs in 80 balls. The total was Pakistan’s third lowest against India in the World Cup after their 173 in Sydney (1992) and 180 at Manchester (1999). Pakistan started strongly but lost their openers before skipper Babar Azam (50) and Mohammad Rizwan (49) attempted to rebuild and hit back in their stand of 82. Azam reached his fifty off 57 balls with a boundary but fell in the next over, bowled by Siraj as the crowd roared to see the back of the world´s number one ODI batsman. Kuldeep Yadav soon struck twice in an over to send back the left-handed Saud Shakeel and Iftikhar Ahmed, bowled around the legs for four after the ball deflected off the batsman´s gloves. Bumrah denied Rizwan his fifty with a slower-off cutter that rattled the stumps as Pakistan slipped to 168-6. Bumrah, playing in front of his home crowd, had a spring in his step and struck again in the next over to get Shadab Khan out for two before Pandya and Jadeja combined to wrap up the tail. “You try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible so when we started bowling, we came to know that the wicket was on the slower side and a hard length would make run-scoring more difficult,” added Bumrah. “There was no consistent turn but it was turning a little bit and I count my slower ball as a spinner so I thought it might be an option. I was trying to do that and it gripped – it was one of those days.” The hotly-anticipated match raised enormous interest with city hotels booked and desperate fans even booking full-body check ups in local hospitals to be sure of a place to sleep. A prominent hotel in the city usually charges 6,000 rupees ($72) for a deluxe room but on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the price for a day had been hiked to 70,000 rupees ($841). Only a trickle of Pakistanis, many expatriates, made it to the game after fans from across the border endured visa delays.

The Kangaroos, led by the fearsome front row duo of Payne Haas and Tino Fa’asuamaleaui, got off to a red-hot start but Samoa hung tough as the Aussies kept them in the game with some simple errors. A couple of test debutants in the centres also had outstanding nights and Australia proved too classy in the end. Read on for foxsports.com.au’s Kangaroos player ratings.

JAMES TEDESCO - 8 Broke the line with ease to go over for the game’s second try, embarrassing a classy Samoa right edge. Made seven tackle busts from just 10 runs, recorded two line breaks and ran for 142 metres. A good night out for the skipper who has endured a difficult season. It was a clear statement that he’s not done yet with representative football. 2. DYLAN EDWARDS - 7 Other than a simple error in the first half, he didn’t look out of place in his representative debut in a position somewhat foreign to him. Even on the wing, his metre-eating ways didn’t fall by the wayside, as he ran for the second-most metres of any Kangaroo (144). 3. HAMISO TABUAI-FIDOW - 9.5 Impressive test debut. Showed the turn of foot of an Everest-winner when scoring his first try from deep inside Australia’s end, making something out of nothing. “That is a side of sensational,” Andrew Voss said on Fox League. Crossed from short range to score his second try, which broke a second half stalemate. Laid a bone-crunching hit on Brian To’o late in the game. 4. KOTONI STAGGS - 9 Thought he was exceptional in his international debut. Opened up the defence early in the game but couldn’t hit the pass back inside, which would have resulted in a try. Looked threatening all night and wasn’t afraid to hit hard in defence. Scored the try he deserved with five seconds left, chasing down a lovely grubber. Kicked goals as well, ending up with a personal haul of 14 points. 5. SELWYN COBBO - 6.5 Caught napping in defence a couple of times, one of those moments resulted in a Samoa try when Murray Taulagi got behind him to chase down a grubber. Apart from that, he made some tough runs out of his own end and seemed to make all of them count. Fox League’s Corey Parker said the winger’s spot may be under pressure with Val Holmes waiting in the wings and Staggs and Tabuai-Fidow impressing in the centres. Selwyn Cobbo may be under pressure to keep his spot in the Kangaroos side according to Corey Parker. Source: Getty Images 6. CAMERON MUNSTER - 8 Seemingly had his hands in everything in the first half, setting up two tries. Threatening with the ball but did miss a couple of key tackles. Pretty decent night. 7. DALY CHERRY-EVANS - 7 Led the team around the park well and did all that he had to in a team full of stars but didn’t shine. His best moment of the night came in the dying moments when putting in a pinpoint grubber to set up a Staggs try. Solid outing. 8. PAYNE HAAS - 9.5 Played just 44 minutes but he made all of them count. Committed an early knock on but quickly put it out of his mind as soon after he barged over from ten meters out for the first try with four defenders draped over him. His first 15 minutes was sheer dominance (72 metres, four tackle busts, try), with he and front row partner Tino Fa’asuamaleaui moving the ball down the field with ease with Samoa always on the back foot during that span. Finished with 141 metres from 14 runs, six tackle busts and 13 tackles with no misses. 9. BEN HUNT - 6 Set up Tino’s first half try with some classy work from dummy-half. Wasn’t a threat running the ball, only carrying it once for four metres. Service was good but he didn’t impact the game heavily during his 41 minutes on the park.

TINO FA’ASUAMALEAUI - 9.5 He had an excellent first stint (26mins), which included a try from close range in addition to five tackle busts and 90 running metres. As mentioned, he and Payne Haas were the tone setters for the Kangaroos during their dominant first 20 minutes which saw Australia open up to a 22-0 lead. The only critique was letting a late consolation try go begging after dropping a sitter when a gaping hole opened up. 11. CAMERON MURRAY - 7 Pinned the ears back and backed himself when scoring his first half try, seeing the gap on the left edge. Worked hard all night. 12. LIAM MARTIN - 6.5 Injected himself into the game with plenty of venom in defence. Tried hard as always but others were better. 13. ISAAH YEO - 8 Gave off a lovely short ball to Payne Haas to set up the first try. Did some good things in attack and was flawless in defence, recording 27 tackles with zero misses. INTERCHANGE BENCH: 14. HARRY GRANT - 6 Split the load with Ben Hunt, playing the middle 40 minutes. Worked hard in defence as the game came to a bit of a standstill. 15. LINDSAY COLLINS - 7.5 He may not have had the impact with ball in hand as the starting front row of Haas and Tino but the Roosters big man should be pretty happy with his body of work. In just 37 minutes off the bench, he had 34 tackles. Quite the effort. Get all the latest NRL news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail.

Played 30 high-impact minutes off the bench, running for 78 metres from seven hit-ups.","pubDate":"2023-10-14 18:56:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e21f68d5dbd07322f9c9d530f8bb25b6","title":"Happy Birthday Babar Azam: Fans Wish Pakistan Cricket Team Captain As He Turns 29","link":"https://www.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/happy-birthday-babar-azam-fans-wish-pakistan-cricket-team-captain-as-he-turns-29-5488286.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Babar Azam gets showered by wishes from his fans across the world as the Pakistan cricket team captain celebrate his 29th birthday on Sunday.","content":"One of the best batters of this generation of cricketers, Pakistan captain Babar Azam turned 29 on October 15, 2023.

Indian skipper Rohit Sharma’s flowing batting form set the stage for India’s comprehensive seven-wicket victory over Pakistan. Bumrah outsmarted Rizwan just one short of a half-century, with a slow off-cutter doing the trick. And in his very next over, Bumrah got one to land on the surface and curve in towards Shadab Khan’s off-stump, cleaning up the batter. “We were bowling in the middle overs and I saw Jaddu’s ball was turning, not too much but a little bit. I count my slower ball as a spinner’s slower ball, one of those days where it came off,” Jasprit Bumrah said during the post-match presentation. He made it clear that the delivery that led to Shadab’s dismissal wasn’t a leg-cutter but rather a unique case of the white-ball reversing. “The little phase where there was reverse swing, one of the occasions when the white ball was reverse swinging,” Bumrah said on the ball that got Shadab. “It felt good. Usually you try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible. We realised the wicket is on the slower side so we wanted to bowl hard lengths. We were trying to make it as difficult as possible. Just being aware I guess. I used to ask a lot of questions when I was young and that helps me now. Now I’m experienced. In my younger days, they (seniors) were used to being troubled by me sometimes (with questions), but it helps to read the wicket and try different options,” he added.

Bowlers set up victory after India elected to field and Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets each. Pakistan were bowled out in 42.5 overs, losing eight wickets for 36 runs in 80 balls. The total was Pakistan’s third lowest against India in the World Cup after their 173 in Sydney (1992) and 180 at Manchester (1999). Pakistan started strongly but lost their openers before skipper Babar Azam (50) and Mohammad Rizwan (49) attempted to rebuild and hit back in their stand of 82. Azam reached his fifty off 57 balls with a boundary but fell in the next over, bowled by Siraj as the crowd roared to see the back of the world’s number one ODI batsman. Kuldeep Yadav soon struck twice in an over to send back the left-handed Saud Shakeel and Iftikhar Ahmed, bowled around the legs for four after the ball deflected off the batsman’s gloves. Bumrah denied Rizwan his fifty with a slower-off cutter that rattled the stumps as Pakistan slipped to 168-6. Bumrah, playing in front of his home crowd, had a spring in his step and struck again in the next over to get Shadab Khan out for two before Pandya and Jadeja combined to wrap up the tail. “You try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible so when we started bowling, we came to know that the wicket was on the slower side and a hard length would make run-scoring more difficult,” added Bumrah. “There was no consistent turn but it was turning a little bit and I count my slower ball as a spinner so I thought it might be an option. I was trying to do that and it gripped – it was one of those days.” The hotly-anticipated match raised enormous interest with city hotels booked and desperate fans even booking full-body check ups in local hospitals to be sure of a place to sleep. A prominent hotel in the city usually charges 6,000 rupees ($72) for a deluxe room but on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the price for a day had been hiked to 70,000 rupees ($841). Only a trickle of Pakistanis, many expatriates, made it to the game after fans from across the border endured visa delays.—AFP","pubDate":"2023-10-14 18:19:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","source_priority":295375,"country":["kuwait"],"category":["sports"],"language":"arabic"},{"article_id":"d594e5749586f57ac3a71842ddb71c33","title":"PM Modi hails Indian team’s “all-round excellence” in World Cup clash against Pakistan","link":"https://thenewsmill.com/2023/10/pm-modi-hails-indian-teams-all-round-excellence-in-world-cup-clash-against-pakistan/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","ANI"],"creator":["ANI"],"video_url":null,"description":"The News Mill","content":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday hailed the Indian team’s performance in the World Cup clash against Pakistan and said victory was powered by all-around excellence. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who was in the stadium in Ahmedabad to witness the match, also hailed the victory. PM Modi extended his good wishes to the Indian team for the next matches in the World Cup. “Team India all the way! A great win today in Ahmedabad, powered by all round excellence. Congratulations to the team and best wishes for the matches ahead,” he said in a post on X. PM Modi, who on Saturday inaugurated the 141st International Olympic Committee (IOC) session in Mumbai, said India is eager to host the Olympics in the country. He also informed the gathering about India’s victory in the Cricket World Cup fixture against Pakistan at the world’s largest stadium in Ahmedabad to a roar of cheers. “I congratulate Team Bharat and every Indian on this historic victory,” he said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said Team India has continued its winning streak against Pakistan in the World Cup. “Tiranga flying high. A big round of applause for our cricket team for this stupendous victory. The team continues its winning streak against Pakistan in the ODI World Cup. You all have shown how much pride seamless teamwork with a common goal can achieve for our nation. My best wishes on your unrelenting march toward winning the World Cup 2023.,” he said in a post on X. BCCI Secretary Jay Shah said the bowlers displayed clinical precision by limiting Pakistan to just 191 runs and also praised captain Rohit Sharma’s knock. “Congratulations to Team India on their remarkable performance in the #CWC2023! With three consecutive wins, they have set the tournament on fire, demonstrating their prowess on the field. Our bowlers displayed clinical precision by limiting Pakistan to just 191 runs on what appeared to be a great batting deck, while our batters showcased incredible composure and finesse during the run chase, securing a comprehensive victory. Captain @ImRo45’s blistering knock in the run chase was the driving force behind our impressive victory, demonstrating his exceptional leadership and batting prowess. Let’s maintain this winning momentum and march forward.” The Indian batters looked well poised from the beginning to chase the Pakistan total of 191 as Babbar Azam-led men suffered a collapse, losing the last eight wickets for 36 runs. India won the toss and put Pakistan to bat. Shubman Gill, who made his first appearance in the ODI World Cup, scored some scintillating hits before losing his wicket. He struck three consecutive fours off Hasan Ali in the second over of the Indian innings. Shubman was out on Shaheen Shah Afridi’s bowling and the hope his wicket may have generated among Pakistan fans was short-lived. Virat Kohli joined Rohit, who was smooth in his power hitting. Kohli also came up with some strong blows before he was caught off the bowling of Hasan Ali during the powerplay. Rohit and Shreyas took charge and strode along even as Pakistan bowlers tried hard to get a breakthrough. The sea of Indian fans, many of them dressed in blue, cheered and waved as Indian batsmen struck. Rohit fell short of his well-deserved century by 14 runs. Shaheen claimed his second wicket of the night with Rohit walked back to the pavilion with a score of 86. In his well-paced innings, Rohit crossed the milestone of 300 ODI sixes which have come in 254 matches. With 351 sixes in 308 games, former Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi leads the tally, while West Indies legend Chris Gayle hammered 331 maximums in 301 encounters. After Rohit’s departure, Shreyas 53* and KL 19* guided India to a comprehensive 7-wicket victory to make it 8-0 in the World Cup between the two arch-rivals. Amit Shah joined the spectators at the Narendra Modi Stadium to witness the World Cup clash between India and Pakistan and cheered Indian team as it scored a magnificent victory. There was an electric atmosphere in the stadium as India dominated both with the bat and ball. As soon as Indian batters scored the winning runs chasing Pakistan’s total of 191, Amit Shah and the spectators stood up to celebrate the team’s victory and laud their performance.

After the game, Arthur heaped praise on the Indian team and expressed the intention of both teams meeting again in the final. “Yeah, I do. This Indian team is a very, very good cricket team. I think they’re very well led by Rahul and Rohit. I think they look good. I think they’ve got all bases covered and I’m looking forward to meeting them in the final again,” Arthur said in the post-match conference. Coming to the match, India won the toss and put Pakistan to bat. The ‘Men in Green’ were cruising in the first innings with skipper Babar Azam and Imam-ul-Haq settled on the pitch.

I'm calm, relaxed, I know what I need to do. 'He can't deal with it. I'm letting the pressure build then eventually lights out. I have to hit him and he'll understand he can't rush me, simple. I won't need luck bro.' 19:55 ANTHONY TAYLOR WINS BY UNANIMOUS DECISION All three judges score the bout 49-45 in favour of Anthony Taylor. He's the new Misfits light heavyweight champion and falls on his back in celebration . 19:52 End of the fight Anthony Taylor did what he needed to do. I'll be shocked if this isn't a win for the American. Disappointing from King Kenny. 19:49 Into the final round 'Why are you backing up and trying to box when you're losing a fight?' asks Daley Perales. Brutal from Kenny's coach and brother. It's time to go for the knockout. 19:47 King Kenny: POINT DEDUCTED King Kenny sees a point deducted for excessive holding. If he's to win this, it will need to be a knock-out. 19:46 Commentators aren't happy I'm not too sure why but the commentators are complaining with Anthony Taylor's game plan. Yes, it's not making for the best watch. But you're matching him against a man with a huge reach advantage... 19:44 Kenny has to find his range King Kenny is allowing Anthony Taylor to rush him. He needs to find his range and utilise his reach advantage. There could be a knock-out here, if Taylor rushes him and Kenny can land a clean hand. Two more rounds left. 19:40 King Kenny's coach is not happy Daley Perales, brother and coach of King Kenny, is telling him he's not been good enough. He's encouraged his fighter to push Anthony Taylor back and bully him. 19:40 The celebrities are in the house Aitch is watching on. Could he walk KSI out today? 19:38 Scrappy fight so far Anthony Taylor is rushing King Kenny to get on the inside. It ends up with Kenny clenching his opponent and the pair have spent the majority of the fight holding onto each other. Scrappy. 19:33 Anthony Taylor with a wild start I've never seen anything like this. Anthony Taylor sprints at King Kenny like he's in the MMA. Kenny just grabs him before the referee separates the two. 19:32 The loudest cheer of the night so far Wow. What a reception for King Kenny. This could be the main event itself. The whole of Manchester are backing him. We're underway! 19:31 Logan Paul and Nina Agdal are in the building Logan Paul has arrived alongside his fiancee Nina Agdal. Just a reminder, if you need it, she is taking Dillon Danis to court. 19:26 UP NEXT: King Kenny vs Anthony Taylor Anthony Taylor went the distance with Tommy Fury before. He's coming in off a win against one of the highest-rated influencer boxers in Salt Papi. Could he pull off another upset and beat King Kenny next? 19:18 MY MATE NATE WINS BY UNANIMOUS DECISION The judges score it four rounds to none. It was a perfect game plan from the man fighting out of Thailand. He could go far in this scene! 19:16 Result up next That may be one of the better technical fights you'll see in influencer boxing. My Mate Nate found his range and used his jab, throwing a lot of punches. Whindersson Nunes went for the power shots and tried to knock him down. Let's see how the judges score this. For me, it's My Mate Nate or a draw. 19:08 The most respectful fight ever? It's no secret that My Mate Nate may be the nicest guy in the crossover boxing scene. He brought Whindersson Nunes Thai sweets in the press conference. Each time the bell goes, he puts his glove out to fist bump his opponent too. Into Round 3... 19:05 KSI is here Here comes the nightmare. KSI is in the building. He fights in the main event against Tommy Fury later. Can he shock the world? 19:02 My Mate Nate starting strong My Mate Nate has shown some good footwork in the first round. He has a strong jab and looks to be the better boxer technically. Whindersson Nunes is one scary guy though. 18:55 Ryan Taylor is here Ryan Taylor was supposed to face Swarmz in a prelim fight earlier today. However, he was arrested in the build-up and took to X to admit that he couldn't make weight after being in jail ahead of the fight. He's made it to the U.K. from Dubai though, and he's watching on. It could've been so different for Swarmz, who was knocked out by Ed Matthews just 30 seconds in. 18:54 UP NEXT: Whindersson Nunes vs My Mate Nate Next up is the Brazilian star Whinderson Nunes. He has over 60,000,000 followers on Instagram alone. He takes on My Mate Nate. Both of these fighters lost to King Kenny in the Kingpyn tournament earlier this year. 18:48 TAG TEAM RESULT: DRAW Pineda Coladas and WassabiLMAO in the tag team event ends in a draw. It's probably fair, but Alex Wassabi vs Luis Pineda could have been a bout of it's own, while I'd have loved to have seen B-Dave take on NichLmao himself. 18:44 Eddie Hearn is here Eddie Hearn said in recent days that his kids were begging to be in attendance tonight. Turns out he's given in - he's arrived! 18:43 Dillon Danis arrives Many were expecting him not to show up but Dillon Danis is here! The MMA star has arrived in fashion, pulling up to the arena in a Rolls Royce. 18:41 The action so far The prelims provided great entertainment earlier. We started off with DTG vs SX, with DTG coming out on top with a first round knock-out. Then came the Women's Flyweight clash as Astrid Wett came out on top by a split decision, which caused some discussion in the arena. Tempo Arts took the Misfits Heavyweight title, with another controversial decision. Then came Ed Matthews, who took the fight on just a few days' notice - and knocked Swarmz out just 30 seconds in. 18:33 Undercard underway! What a first round it's been in the first round of the tag team match up. We've seen Alex Wassabi drop Luis Pineda and make him bleed from the nose before B-Dave was tagged in and dropped Wassabi himself. This is entertainment!

They can't lose the ball as it's last play. 20:45 , 77 ' Ireland are chasing everything (24-28) Ireland can't get any clean ball as the All Blacks keep recycling it in midfield. They are showing their experience and Ireland are so desperate to score a try that would surely win the match now. 20:42 , 75 ' Taylor comes back on (24-28) Taylor is back in the fray after completing his sinbin. All Blacks back to full strength and have a lineout in Ireland's half. 20:39 , 72 ' Try held up (24-28) Ireland's maul is motoring over the line but Jordi Barrett is there to get under the ball and hold it up. All Blacks relieve the pressure as Doris then drops the kick. 20:38 , 70 ' Penalty Ireland (24-28) Sexton does brilliant to dummy and then offload with a kick then putting Barrett under pressure. His pass back infield is closed down by Aki who turns over and Ireland have another lineout five metres out. 20:36 , 70 ' Barrett kicks three points (24-28) It's another uncharacteristic penalty and this time Barrett doesn't make a mistake from the tee. 20:34 , 67 ' Barrett misses penalty (24-25) New Zealand win another penalty at the scrum as Porter is penalised again for kicking his hips out but Barrett spurs the chance. 20:29 , 64 ' PENALTY TRY IRELAND (24-25) It's a seven-point try for Ireland as they win their lineout and Taylor drags the maul down over the line. He's yellow carded and that is a penalty try for Ireland. New Zealand are down to 14-men and lead by just one point. 20:28 , 64 ' Ireland take a lineout deep in New Zealand's half (17-25) Ireland win a penalty and Sexton kicks for touch as Ireland look to try and get another try to bring them back into the game. 20:27 , 61 ' Further replacements for both sides (17-25) Both sides make further changes as the experienced Sam Whitelock comes on for his record 24th World Cup appearance. Meanwhile Ireland bring on Conor Murray to replace Gibson-Park. 20:24 , 59 ' Ireland changes (17-25) Off - Hansen, Furlong, Henderson, Van der Flier On - Bealham, Conan, McCarthy, O'Brien 20:22 , 59 ' Sexton misses penalty kick (17-25) Sexton lines his kick up and pulls his shot left to the dismay of the crowd. 20:21 , 57 ' Ireland have to respond quickly (17-25) There is some panic in the Ireland squad and they need to calm down to try and get back into this game. There's been a couple of handling errors in the last few minutes and Ireland need to try and get the ball wide quickly as the All Blacks rush men into breakdowns. Ireland win a penalty. 20:16 , 54 ' Try converted (17-25) Barrett It's a brilliant kick from Jordi Barrett as he completes the conversion from a tight angle. Ireland can't let the All Blacks score again! 20:14 , 53 ' TRY NEW ZEALAND (17-23) Jordan It's pure pace as the All Blacks combine to get the better of Ireland's defence. Jordan is sent over the line by Faingaanuku for a crucial try. What a moment that is. 20:13 , 52 ' Brilliant turnover from the All Blacks (17-18) Ireland break and go through the hands for a few phases but are punished as they too many individuals go on their own and a successful jackal follows. 20:11 , 49 ' New Zealand make solid progress (17-18) New Zealand have weathered Ireland well so far in the second half and are beginning to get some joy through physical forward play. Smith tries to exploit a lapse in concentration by picking and going but is stopped as the All Blacks push the Irish back. 20:08 , 47 ' Sheehan just can't get there (17-18) Hansen kicks to the wing for Sheehan to chase and he is in if he can get the ball but it takes a big bounce and goes over his head and dead. That would have been a certain try if he got hands to it. 20:06 , 45 ' New Zealand scrum five metres out (17-18) It's not perfect defending but the All Blacks get a scrum inside their own five-metre line and win the ball well. They clear upfield and Smith is now back on the pitch after serving his sinbin. 20:03 , 43 ' All Blacks keeping things tight in midfield (17-18) New Zealand are a man down but you wouldn't know it as they move through the gears in midfield and use their forwards to keep hold of the ball. Ireland need to get the ball wide. 20:01 Back underway in Paris (17-18) We are back underway as Ireland trail by just a single point. 19:45 HALF TIME: Ireland 17-18 New Zealand What a half of epic rugby that was! Here's hoping the next 40 minutes are just as good with Ireland trailing by just a single point. They wil need to cut out the mistakes they started the game with and have to use their mad advantage in the early minutes as Aaron Smith finishes his time in the sinbin. It's been electric heavyweight rugby but Ireland have just started to show their quality before half time. Don't go anywhere because this match has plenty of spills and thrills still to come. 19:45 , 40 ' Try converted (17-18) Sexton makes no mistake as he completes his conversion. What a game this has been so far. 19:43 , 39 ' TRY IRELAND (15-18) Gibson-Park It's try time for Ireland as the scrum-half slides over the line despite being manhandled by three All Black players. The stadium erupts in celebration. Sexton has to convert this. 19:43 , 38 ' Ireland get another penalty at the breakdown (10-18) Ireland spread the ball again and get another penalty as New Zealand look to hang on. Desperate defending on show. 19:41 , 37 ' Aaron Smith sinbinned (10-18) Smith is pinged for a deliberate knock-on and Ireland kick to the corner as they look to use their man advantage. 19:40 , 37 ' Ireland's frustrations are growing (10-18) This wasn't how things were meant to play out for Ireland as they trail by eight and have never been ahead in this match. We now have a video check for a delberate knock-on by New Zealand. 19:38 , 35 ' Conversion missed (10-18) It wasn't the most difficult kick but Mo'unga slices it and New Zealand take just five points. 19:36 , 33 ' TRY NEW ZEALAND (10-18) Savea Ireland are offside at the breakdown and give up possession that the All Blacks make no mistake with as Savea finds space on the wing and leaps over the line. That was a wingers try and don't forget Savea is a number 8! 19:35 , 31 ' Huge tackle rescues Ireland (10-13) The All Blacks are executing their gameplan almost perfectly with chips over the top wreaking havoc in the Ireland defence but just as Savea looked to build up speed he was dropped by Sheehan. Ireland turnover at just the right time. 19:32 , 29 ' Try converted (10-13) Sexton has an easy kick to complete the try and does so to reduce the deficit to just three. 19:30 , 27 ' TRY IRELAND (8-13) Aki Was it ever in doubt?! Ireland finally click and score a brilliant try through Aki. The pass to him was too high and caused him to stop but it doesn't matter as he cuts inside, steps two players and then finishes beautifully. Superb rugby. 19:28 New Zealand win Ireland's lineout (3-13) Ireland's lineout is stolen by the All Blacks in another rare lapse in concentration. They fortunately get the ball back with Sexton chasing down a kick through but New Zealand get a hand to it first. The Irish look short of ideas so far. 19:27 , 24 ' Temporary stop as the referee has lost comms (3-13) We have a momentary stop as referee Wayne Barnes explains he has lost communication with the VAR room. There is a check for a dangerous tackle on Aki but no penalty is given. Sexton isn't convinced. 19:24 , 22 ' Sexton gets Ireland's first points (3-13) The All Blacks concede a silly penalty for obstruction after the restart and Sexton kicks his penalty straight down the throat of the pitch to get Ireland their first points. 19:23 Try converted (0-13) The All Blacks increase their lead with a pinpoint kick from out wide. All Blacks lead by 13. 19:21 , 19 ' TRY NEW ZEALAND (0-11) It's beautiful individual play from Beauden Barrett as he weaves his way through a host of tackles before spreading the ball wide. They play with speed out wide and show magic hands as Leicester Faringa’anuku crosses the line. 19:20 , 18 ' New Zealand defence disrupts Ireland (0-6) Ireland mount another attack and get to within five metres but the All Blacks are so quick off the line that they force a turnover before clearing their lines. The Irish come again and concede another penalty as Josh van der Flier carries in. That's five penalties already against Ireland. 19:17 , 14 ' Barrett increases All Blacks lead (0-6) It's a long kick to reach the posts but Barrett has been here before and punts his effort over beautifully. Another three points on the scoreboard. 19:16 , 13 ' Brilliant physical battle ensuing (0-3) The two sets teams are going at this hammer and tongs as the All Blacks get the better of Ireland with Savea putting in a big hit on Doris to win a penalty. Barrett will kick for points. 19:13 , 11 ' Ireland mount their first attack (0-3) Ireland race up the other end and have a chance of scoring the game's first try but the final pass out to Lowe is overhit and he can't get to it as it dribbles out of play. All Blacks win their lineout and recycle the ball back up to the halfway line. 19:10 , 8 ' New Zealand take the lead (0-3) Richie Mo'unga kicks the penalty to get early points on the board for New Zealand. 19:08 , 5 ' Ireland's defence stands strong (0-0) The All Blacks get their first chance to test Ireland's defence and keep hold of the ball brilliantly as they slowly make ground through their forwards before trying to go wide switching the ball from wing-to-wing. They get inside the 10-metre line and play goes on for 30 phases before New Zeland then win a penalty for Ireland not rolling away. Great play all-round, 19:05 , 3 ' Ireland penalised at the scrum (0-0) Ireland show their strenght but too much of it as Andrew Porter comes across the front row when he kicks his hips out and the All Blacks get a penalty that they kick to find touch. 19:04 , 2 ' Early mistakes caused by nervous start (0-0) The nerves are on show as Ireland struggle to chase down from kick-off before New Zealand boot a clearance kick straight out of play. We then have a knock-on and the All Blacks get the first scrum. 19:01 KICK-OFF: Ireland get us underway in Paris (0-0) Johnny Sexton boots the ball in the air and we are underway. 80 minutes of high-octane action now lie ahead. 18:57 Anthems DONE The anthems are complete with Ireland's in particularly deafening as masses of supporters joined in. We are so close to getting underway, New Zealand will perform their haka and then it's GAME ON! 18:52 Here come the players... We are ready at the Stade de France as both teams emerge into a caudlron of noise in Paris. We will have the national anthems, New Zealand will perform the haka and then the real fireworks begin. Don't miss a single minute with our updates throughout the evening. 18:50 Prediction: Ireland win It's going to be tight, expect both teams to score but Ireland should have enough to seal victory tonight. Andy Farrell's side have more firepower in attack, more solidity in defence and a pack that should wear down the All Blacks. But it won't be easy. New Zealand aren't the force that dominated World Rugby previously and as far as completed teams go then Ireland have it all. Get ready because we are underway in 10 minutes. 18:43 Ireland look set to make history SHANE MCGRATH: The 9.10 train to St Denis deposited the last of the rush-hour commuters at the Stade de France station on Friday morning, and amid the dash of workers towards the office blocks that tower near the ground, were four fans in Irish jerseys. They looked older, perhaps in their late 60s, and they ambled as close to the stadium as security would permit them, looking up at the tournament paraphernalia adorning this great concrete bowl. READ THE FULL STORY BELOW Ireland look to break World Cup hoodoo against New Zealand SHANE MCGRATH: The extent and nature of Ireland's support has been one of the stories of this World Cup, matched by the quality of the team they are cheering on. Mail Online 18:38 Ireland's dangerman: Bundee Aki If Ireland are to cement their place in the smi-finals then Bundee Aki will be crucial to their success tonight. The centre was actually born in New Zealand but represents Ireland after qualifying to do so and how the All Blacks will be wishing he had committed to them instead. Aki has been sensational at this World Cup so far, having made more runs (61) than any other player and scoring 20 points for the Irish. Ireland possess so many dangerous attackers but Aki is the one to watch tonight. 18:24 The stat that dents Ireland's hopes For all of their brilliance over the past 12 months, Ireland face a daunting task tonight that they previously haven't fared very well in . Despite making all but two Rugby World Cup quarter-final clashes in previous competitions, the Irish have never made it to the semi-final stage, Coincidentally at the last RWC in Japan four-years ago they were knocked out at this stage by the All Blacks in a crushing 46-14 defeat. Hopefully they have learnt from that. 18:18 Conor McGregor sends expletive warning to New Zealand MMA star Conor McGregor has sent an expletive message to New Zealand's All Blacks ahead of their Rugby World Cup clash against Ireland. Ahead of the match, Irishman McGregor has taken to social media to send a message to Ireland's opponents, stating that his country aren't scared of anyone.

See for yourself below. 17:50 Ireland are on the rise but the All Blacks stand in their way Ireland come into tonight's Parisian clash against the All Blacks as favourites and deservedly so given their status as the No.1 team in the world, but New Zealand are a formidable opponent.

If you have any doubts that these two are pretending for the cameras, this video will probably change your mind. 20:32 Danis ready to go! The loudmouth fighter has been drumming up anticipation for this fight, and the day is finally here. Only time will tell if he's this calm and composed when the matchup is over. 20:22 Sealed with a kiss! We're not far out from Paul-Danis now, and the former has posted a loved-up photo with fiancee Nina Agdal before the fight. Of course, Danis has also posted about Agdal quite a bit online - so much so that she got a restraining order against him! Logan Paul shares a kiss with fiancee before fight with Dillon Danis Many insults directed at Paul have surrounded his fiancee, so much so that Nina Agdal filed a $150,000 (£122,000) lawsuit and also took out a restraining order against the MMA fighter. Mail Online 20:00 Danis makes his grand entrance 19:52 Danis has kept his trolling up right until the day of the bout 19:45 Paul means business Dillon Danis's trolling of Logan Paul 's fiancee, Nina Agdal , has only provided his rival with extra ammunition, a source previously revealed to DailyMail.com. Paul is heading into the ring tonight looking to avenge the disgusting attacks on his fiancee. 'With Dillon's constant trolling, Logan's attitude has only changed to hating Dillon even more,' a source close to Paul told DailyMail.com. 'He'd love to see him arrested and be held accountable for all the trolling. Logan wants to get in the ring right now and make Dillon's face have a similar look to ground beef. He literally hates him. 'Logan is training as hard as possible, and in his mind and his team's mind, he must win. There is no other option that can happen. 'If Logan loses this fight, it will be the biggest embarrassment for him professionally ever and he will never be able to forgive himself or talk himself out of it. He wants to make Nina proud and avenge all that she has been put through. Knocking out Dillon is what needs to happen, anything else would not be a good look.' 19:36 Logan Paul is in the house Logan Paul has arrived with fiancee Nine Agdal as he prepares to fave Dillon Danis and avenge the personal attacks the model has faced from his rival. 19:29 Damage done before the fight even starts Dillon Danis was getting physical before the bout even begun when he hit Logan Paul with a microphone at their final press conference Thursday. Danis and Paul were on stage discussing their upcoming bout when the ugly scenes broke out. Danis was furious with some comments Paul had made about an alleged daughter of his. The pair engaged in a verbal row before things turned physical. Danis launched at Paul and hit the 28-year-old in the face with his microphone - connecting cleanly on Paul's forehead.

One of the judges scores it 39-37 to Pineda & BDave, the next sees it 39-37 for Wassabi & NichLmao, the final judge scores it 38-38. 18:44 Inside Dillon Danis' despicable attacks Dillon Danis has dominated the headlines - and made most of them himself - in the buildup to his bout with Logan Paul and not for the right reasons. Despite both fighters seeking the advantage in the mind games stakes over one another, it was Danis who took their feud to an entirely different and toxic level. Paul's fiancee, model Nina Agdal, has been caught in the firing line as Danis reuglarly used her to target his oponent. Day by day, he began to post half-naked pictures of Agdal , and even shared a private video in which she discussed her sexual cravings. The end result was a restraining order and a lawsuit from the Dane against Danis. Mail Sport delves back over a grizzly past couple of months. 18:33 Good evening!

Pakistan were routed by seven wickets in a disappointingly one-sided clash. They collapsed from 155-2 to be all out for 191 before India coasted home to their target with 117 balls to spare. Skipper Rohit Sharma’s 86 and an inspired bowling display helped India hammer Pakistan, who were bowled out for 191. They overhauled the total with 117 balls to spare to extend their unbeaten streak against their neighbours to eight in the 50-over showpiece tournament. Rohit stood out in his 63-ball knock laced with six fours and six sixes to keep India, who began the event as favourites to win the title, unbeaten in their three matches in this edition. Pakistan now have two wins and one defeat in the 10-nation tournament. “It felt good,” said man of the match, Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah who had figures of 2-19 off nine overs. Rohit hit the ball to all parts of the ground with his delightful flicks and pulls to entertain an almost all-Indian crowd at the world´s biggest cricket stadium after Pakistanis were effectively banned from attending. India lost Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli — both for 16 — before Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit the winning four to reach 53, put on 77 runs for the third wicket and placed India comfortably on course for victory. Rohit fell attempting another hit off Shaheen Shah Afridi to get caught at mid-wicket, but Iyer and KL Rahul took the team home with ease. Bowlers set up victory after India elected to field and Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets each. Pakistan were bowled out in 42.5 overs, losing eight wickets for 36 runs in 80 balls. The total was Pakistan’s third lowest against India in the World Cup after their 173 in Sydney (1992) and 180 at Manchester (1999). Pakistan started strongly but lost their openers before skipper Babar Azam (50) and Mohammad Rizwan (49) attempted to rebuild and hit back in their stand of 82. Azam reached his fifty off 57 balls with a boundary but fell in the next over, bowled by Siraj as the crowd roared to see the back of the world´s number one ODI batsman. Kuldeep Yadav soon struck twice in an over to send back the left-handed Saud Shakeel and Iftikhar Ahmed, bowled around the legs for four after the ball deflected off the batsman´s gloves. Bumrah denied Rizwan his fifty with a slower-off cutter that rattled the stumps as Pakistan slipped to 168-6. Bumrah, playing in front of his home crowd, had a spring in his step and struck again in the next over to get Shadab Khan out for two before Pandya and Jadeja combined to wrap up the tail. “You try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible so when we started bowling, we came to know that the wicket was on the slower side and a hard length would make run-scoring more difficult,” added Bumrah. “There was no consistent turn but it was turning a little bit and I count my slower ball as a spinner so I thought it might be an option. I was trying to do that and it gripped – it was one of those days.” The hotly-anticipated match raised enormous interest with city hotels booked and desperate fans even booking full-body check ups in local hospitals to be sure of a place to sleep. A prominent hotel in the city usually charges 6,000 rupees ($72) for a deluxe room but on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the price for a day had been hiked to 70,000 rupees ($841). Only a trickle of Pakistanis, many expatriates, made it to the game after fans from across the border endured visa delays.

The Kangaroos, led by the fearsome front row duo of Payne Haas and Tino Fa’asuamaleaui, got off to a red-hot start but Samoa hung tough as the Aussies kept them in the game with some simple errors. A couple of test debutants in the centres also had outstanding nights and Australia proved too classy in the end. Read on for foxsports.com.au’s Kangaroos player ratings.

JAMES TEDESCO - 8 Broke the line with ease to go over for the game’s second try, embarrassing a classy Samoa right edge. Made seven tackle busts from just 10 runs, recorded two line breaks and ran for 142 metres. A good night out for the skipper who has endured a difficult season. It was a clear statement that he’s not done yet with representative football. 2. DYLAN EDWARDS - 7 Other than a simple error in the first half, he didn’t look out of place in his representative debut in a position somewhat foreign to him. Even on the wing, his metre-eating ways didn’t fall by the wayside, as he ran for the second-most metres of any Kangaroo (144). 3. HAMISO TABUAI-FIDOW - 9.5 Impressive test debut. Showed the turn of foot of an Everest-winner when scoring his first try from deep inside Australia’s end, making something out of nothing. “That is a side of sensational,” Andrew Voss said on Fox League. Crossed from short range to score his second try, which broke a second half stalemate. Laid a bone-crunching hit on Brian To’o late in the game. 4. KOTONI STAGGS - 9 Thought he was exceptional in his international debut. Opened up the defence early in the game but couldn’t hit the pass back inside, which would have resulted in a try. Looked threatening all night and wasn’t afraid to hit hard in defence. Scored the try he deserved with five seconds left, chasing down a lovely grubber. Kicked goals as well, ending up with a personal haul of 14 points. 5. SELWYN COBBO - 6.5 Caught napping in defence a couple of times, one of those moments resulted in a Samoa try when Murray Taulagi got behind him to chase down a grubber. Apart from that, he made some tough runs out of his own end and seemed to make all of them count. Fox League’s Corey Parker said the winger’s spot may be under pressure with Val Holmes waiting in the wings and Staggs and Tabuai-Fidow impressing in the centres. Selwyn Cobbo may be under pressure to keep his spot in the Kangaroos side according to Corey Parker. Source: Getty Images 6. CAMERON MUNSTER - 8 Seemingly had his hands in everything in the first half, setting up two tries. Threatening with the ball but did miss a couple of key tackles. Pretty decent night. 7. DALY CHERRY-EVANS - 7 Led the team around the park well and did all that he had to in a team full of stars but didn’t shine. His best moment of the night came in the dying moments when putting in a pinpoint grubber to set up a Staggs try. Solid outing. 8. PAYNE HAAS - 9.5 Played just 44 minutes but he made all of them count. Committed an early knock on but quickly put it out of his mind as soon after he barged over from ten meters out for the first try with four defenders draped over him. His first 15 minutes was sheer dominance (72 metres, four tackle busts, try), with he and front row partner Tino Fa’asuamaleaui moving the ball down the field with ease with Samoa always on the back foot during that span. Finished with 141 metres from 14 runs, six tackle busts and 13 tackles with no misses. 9. BEN HUNT - 6 Set up Tino’s first half try with some classy work from dummy-half. Wasn’t a threat running the ball, only carrying it once for four metres. Service was good but he didn’t impact the game heavily during his 41 minutes on the park.

TINO FA’ASUAMALEAUI - 9.5 He had an excellent first stint (26mins), which included a try from close range in addition to five tackle busts and 90 running metres. As mentioned, he and Payne Haas were the tone setters for the Kangaroos during their dominant first 20 minutes which saw Australia open up to a 22-0 lead. The only critique was letting a late consolation try go begging after dropping a sitter when a gaping hole opened up. 11. CAMERON MURRAY - 7 Pinned the ears back and backed himself when scoring his first half try, seeing the gap on the left edge. Worked hard all night. 12. LIAM MARTIN - 6.5 Injected himself into the game with plenty of venom in defence. Tried hard as always but others were better. 13. ISAAH YEO - 8 Gave off a lovely short ball to Payne Haas to set up the first try. Did some good things in attack and was flawless in defence, recording 27 tackles with zero misses. INTERCHANGE BENCH: 14. HARRY GRANT - 6 Split the load with Ben Hunt, playing the middle 40 minutes. Worked hard in defence as the game came to a bit of a standstill. 15. LINDSAY COLLINS - 7.5 He may not have had the impact with ball in hand as the starting front row of Haas and Tino but the Roosters big man should be pretty happy with his body of work. In just 37 minutes off the bench, he had 34 tackles. Quite the effort. Get all the latest NRL news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail.

Played 30 high-impact minutes off the bench, running for 78 metres from seven hit-ups.","pubDate":"2023-10-14 18:56:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e21f68d5dbd07322f9c9d530f8bb25b6","title":"Happy Birthday Babar Azam: Fans Wish Pakistan Cricket Team Captain As He Turns 29","link":"https://www.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/happy-birthday-babar-azam-fans-wish-pakistan-cricket-team-captain-as-he-turns-29-5488286.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Babar Azam gets showered by wishes from his fans across the world as the Pakistan cricket team captain celebrate his 29th birthday on Sunday.","content":"One of the best batters of this generation of cricketers, Pakistan captain Babar Azam turned 29 on October 15, 2023.

Indian skipper Rohit Sharma’s flowing batting form set the stage for India’s comprehensive seven-wicket victory over Pakistan. Bumrah outsmarted Rizwan just one short of a half-century, with a slow off-cutter doing the trick. And in his very next over, Bumrah got one to land on the surface and curve in towards Shadab Khan’s off-stump, cleaning up the batter. “We were bowling in the middle overs and I saw Jaddu’s ball was turning, not too much but a little bit. I count my slower ball as a spinner’s slower ball, one of those days where it came off,” Jasprit Bumrah said during the post-match presentation. He made it clear that the delivery that led to Shadab’s dismissal wasn’t a leg-cutter but rather a unique case of the white-ball reversing. “The little phase where there was reverse swing, one of the occasions when the white ball was reverse swinging,” Bumrah said on the ball that got Shadab. “It felt good. Usually you try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible. We realised the wicket is on the slower side so we wanted to bowl hard lengths. We were trying to make it as difficult as possible. Just being aware I guess. I used to ask a lot of questions when I was young and that helps me now. Now I’m experienced. In my younger days, they (seniors) were used to being troubled by me sometimes (with questions), but it helps to read the wicket and try different options,” he added.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who was in the stadium in Ahmedabad to witness the match, also hailed the victory. PM Modi extended his good wishes to the Indian team for the next matches in the World Cup. “Team India all the way! A great win today in Ahmedabad, powered by all round excellence. Congratulations to the team and best wishes for the matches ahead,” he said in a post on X. PM Modi, who on Saturday inaugurated the 141st International Olympic Committee (IOC) session in Mumbai, said India is eager to host the Olympics in the country. He also informed the gathering about India’s victory in the Cricket World Cup fixture against Pakistan at the world’s largest stadium in Ahmedabad to a roar of cheers. “I congratulate Team Bharat and every Indian on this historic victory,” he said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said Team India has continued its winning streak against Pakistan in the World Cup. “Tiranga flying high. A big round of applause for our cricket team for this stupendous victory. The team continues its winning streak against Pakistan in the ODI World Cup. You all have shown how much pride seamless teamwork with a common goal can achieve for our nation. My best wishes on your unrelenting march toward winning the World Cup 2023.,” he said in a post on X. BCCI Secretary Jay Shah said the bowlers displayed clinical precision by limiting Pakistan to just 191 runs and also praised captain Rohit Sharma’s knock. “Congratulations to Team India on their remarkable performance in the #CWC2023! With three consecutive wins, they have set the tournament on fire, demonstrating their prowess on the field. Our bowlers displayed clinical precision by limiting Pakistan to just 191 runs on what appeared to be a great batting deck, while our batters showcased incredible composure and finesse during the run chase, securing a comprehensive victory. Captain @ImRo45’s blistering knock in the run chase was the driving force behind our impressive victory, demonstrating his exceptional leadership and batting prowess. Let’s maintain this winning momentum and march forward.” The Indian batters looked well poised from the beginning to chase the Pakistan total of 191 as Babbar Azam-led men suffered a collapse, losing the last eight wickets for 36 runs. India won the toss and put Pakistan to bat. Shubman Gill, who made his first appearance in the ODI World Cup, scored some scintillating hits before losing his wicket. He struck three consecutive fours off Hasan Ali in the second over of the Indian innings. Shubman was out on Shaheen Shah Afridi’s bowling and the hope his wicket may have generated among Pakistan fans was short-lived. Virat Kohli joined Rohit, who was smooth in his power hitting. Kohli also came up with some strong blows before he was caught off the bowling of Hasan Ali during the powerplay. Rohit and Shreyas took charge and strode along even as Pakistan bowlers tried hard to get a breakthrough. The sea of Indian fans, many of them dressed in blue, cheered and waved as Indian batsmen struck. Rohit fell short of his well-deserved century by 14 runs. Shaheen claimed his second wicket of the night with Rohit walked back to the pavilion with a score of 86. In his well-paced innings, Rohit crossed the milestone of 300 ODI sixes which have come in 254 matches. With 351 sixes in 308 games, former Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi leads the tally, while West Indies legend Chris Gayle hammered 331 maximums in 301 encounters. After Rohit’s departure, Shreyas 53* and KL 19* guided India to a comprehensive 7-wicket victory to make it 8-0 in the World Cup between the two arch-rivals. Amit Shah joined the spectators at the Narendra Modi Stadium to witness the World Cup clash between India and Pakistan and cheered Indian team as it scored a magnificent victory. There was an electric atmosphere in the stadium as India dominated both with the bat and ball. As soon as Indian batters scored the winning runs chasing Pakistan’s total of 191, Amit Shah and the spectators stood up to celebrate the team’s victory and laud their performance.
