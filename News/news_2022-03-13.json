He told the Bangladesh Cricket Board that he was “mentally fatigued and physically stressed” and withdrew himself from contention for the South Africa tour after being named to the squad. But Shakib had a change of heart three days after he was rested from all formats until April 30, following a meeting with board president Nazmul Hassan in Dhaka. “Shakib is available for all the formats for the South Africa tour. He will travel to South Africa tomorrow,” Nazmul told reporters after the meeting. The 34-year-old had been criticised by commentators following his sudden withdrawal, but Nazmul urged fans to show consideration to the national side. “We have to remember that the senior players go through tremendous pressure,” he said. “We have to play 14 ODIs, 15 T20Is this year, and we have to play eight Tests as well. It’s tough for our senior players to play all these matches. We have to understand it,” he added. Shakib told reporters that he had finalised a plan for him to compete over the next year, with the board to decide when he should be rested. The series against South Africa will start with the first ODI on March 18 at Centurion. Durban and Port Elizabeth will also host one Test match each. Members of the Bangladesh ODI squad have already departed for the series.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India reignite World Cup bid with win over West Indies","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/940984-india-reignite-world-cup-bid-with-win-over-west-indies","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"HAMILTON: India unleashed a powerhouse batting performance to crush the West Indies by 155 runs in Hamilton on Saturday and revive their Women’s Cricket World Cup campaign.Centuries for Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur anchored a record-breaking innings of 317-8 before India’s...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-13 01:00:00","full_description":"HAMILTON: India unleashed a powerhouse batting performance to crush the West Indies by 155 runs in Hamilton on Saturday and revive their Women’s Cricket World Cup campaign. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ Centuries for Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur anchored a record-breaking innings of 317-8 before India’s spinners skittled the West Indies for 162. The total was India’s highest at a Women’s World Cup and the best by any team so far at this year’s tournament, surpassing the 310 posted by Australia against England. Mandhana and Kaur’s 184-run partnership was also a record for India at a Women’s World Cup. Mandhana made 123 off 119 balls, while Kaur scored 109 from 107. The win gives India a huge morale boost and keeps them in the running for a semi-final spot after a lacklustre loss to New Zealand last Thursday. It also continues India’s dominant record against the West Indies at World Cups, giving them a 7-0 record over the Caribbean team at the one-day showcase. But the West Indies entered the match as the surprise package of this year’s tournament, with upset wins over hosts New Zealand and defending champions England. India won the toss and elected to bat, starting aggressively and clearly intent on avoiding the slow scoring that cost them dearly against New Zealand. “We realised we hadn’t made a good start in the last game and we really wanted to come out on a positive note,” Mandhana said. “It’s all about momentum and we discussed keeping the momentum high from the first over.” Yastika Bhatia smashed 19 runs off the first two overs and was given a life on 20 when Aaliyah Alleyne missed a catch. Shakera Selman made no mistake when she caught and bowled Bhatia for 20, helping slow the run rate. India were 125-3 at the mid-way point in the innings when Mandhana and Kaur stepped up the run rate. Mandhana’s second ODI century included 13 fours and two sixes, while Kaur’s fourth ODI ton included 10 fours and two sixes. The West Indies took a flurry of wickets late in the innings but by then the damage had been done. They made a promising start to the run chase, racing to 81 without loss after 10 overs.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Hammer tons: Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur hit centuries as India register massive 155-run win over West Indies","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/hammer-tons-smriti-mandhana-harmanpreet-kaur-hit-centuries-as-india-register-massive-155-run-win-over-west-indies-377365","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Hamilton, March 12 Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur slammed centuries as India produced a splendid batting display to notch up a comprehensive 155-run win over West Indies to bring their campaign back on track at the ICC Women's World Cup here today.

The first Test in Rawalpindi was one of the most dour affairs in recent memory, played on a lifeless pitch prepared to nullify Australia’s bowlers. It was expected that the wicket for the second Test in Karachi would produce a more lively affair, but day one was once again marred by long, drab periods. Watch Australia’s Tour of Pakistan on Kayo. Every Test, ODI and T20 Live & On-Demand. New to Kayo? Try 14-Days Free Now > Khawaja gets 100! | 00:56 For about 40 uninterrupted minutes in the third session, Pakistan bowled spin outside leg-stump to Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith in a bid to dry up the runs. It worked, but the sheer disinterest in taking a wicket, even with some reverse swing on offer for its fast bowlers, painted a concerning picture for the Pakistani mindset. Former captain Waqar Younis was appalled in commentary, saying: “The tactics I’m seeing at the moment is like we’re looking for a draw on the first day. “It’s ridiculous.” Former England Test batter and commentator Rob Key described it as an “incredibly negative passage of play”, while sports anchor Sawera Pasha said they were “mysterious tactics from Pakistan. Geo News journalist Arfa Feroz Zake said Pakistan had erred by turning its cheek on its long record of producing quality fast bowlers. “Pakistan has a history of producing matchwinning fastbowlers but Pakistan plans to win Test matches at home courtesy dead low slow turning pitches,” he tweeted. “Isn’t it underestimating the talent of your own pacers? Test matches based on batters defending against spinners are boring.” It raises the question over how Pakistan aims to achieve a result in this three-Test series — its first at home against Australia since 1998. DAY ONE NEWS TALKING POINTS: Pakistan’s ‘utter c**p’ ploy; why Khawaja has exposed unfair Aussie debate ‘ONE OF THE GREAT STORIES’: Khawaja inspiring a generation as Pakistan-born star hits century ‘MORTIFIED’: Screamer stuns in late Smith nightmare; Khawaja soars as ‘ridiculous’ Pakistan tactics torched ‘SOMEONE GIVE HIM A HUG’: Image sums up ‘devastated’ Marnus’ duck disaster Smith falls to outrageous catch | 02:32 Comments from Pakistan Cricket Board chair Ramiz Raja after the first Test suggested that Pakistan would create low and slow pitches that would nullify Australia’s strengths. “We need to beat Australia and we need to prepare our strategy accordingly,” Ramiz said. “The strategy is for low-bouncy tracks where reverse can happen, where LBW and bowled will be in play, where our spinners can show their performance and where the batters, who have grown up on low-bounce pitches, can utilise that advantage.” This was somewhat understandable for the first Test with fast bowlers Hasan Ali and Faheem Ashraf unavailable. But even on their return to partner star quick Shaheen Shah Afridi, Pakistan has shown a lack of faith in its own strengths while putting Australia’s on a pedestal. That is an argument being put forward by ESPNcricinfo’s Pakistan-based writer Danyal Rasool, who lamented Pakistan’s tactics on day one. In a column for the publication, he said that Pakistan cricket has long admired Australia to the point of a “distinctly odd level of worship”. As such, he believes that after losing a crucial toss, Pakistan has simply surrendered to Australia. “When, two sessions into a Test match that was still nip and tuck, Pakistan walked out onto the field alongside Usman Khawaja and Steven Smith, it felt inescapably like Pakistan didn’t just revere Australia, they also feared them,” he wrote. At the time, Pakistan’s quicks had bowled 10 of the past 13 overs which were hit for just 16 runs. The pressure was building but instead of looking to capitalise through Shaheen Afridi, Hasan or Faheem, Pakistan went into its shell. “Rather, as it turned out, Australia didn’t have to fight for those spoils so much as they watched them handed over meekly on a golden platter,” Rasool wrote. Marnus goes for 0 after RAPID run out | 00:53 “Instead, a small pocket of fans watched bemused as Babar let Sajid Khan, the most expensive bowler on the day, bowl alongside Nauman Ali, who had been about as incisive as a newborn’s teeth.” He argued that being timid, and self-preservation “came naturally” for Pakistan against Australia. The brakes were put on Australia whose run rate at the end of the day was 2.78, down from 4.55 after 20 overs. Nonetheless, it reached stumps at 3-251 and almost certain to post a big score that will take the game away from Pakistan. Asked to explain the tactics after play, wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan defended captain Babar Azam and denied that they were negative. “We wanted to dry the runs after Australia made good use of the advantage they gained by winning the toss,” he said. “Such tactics cannot be considered as negative as other big teams also do these things and thankfully our bowlers did make a comeback” Australia has made more than 350 runs when batting first against Pakistan 17 times, winning 12 of those matches, and never losing.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Needs to be outlawed': Cricket world fumes over 'ridiculous' act","link":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/australia-pakistan-2022-cricket-fumes-ridiculous-act-220459671.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-12 22:04:59","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/ad2dd1a0-a24f-11ec-bdef-497bd7d36559","source_id":"yahoo","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia sent in by NZ at World Cup","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-sent-in-by-nz-at-world-cup-c-6036632","keywords":null,"creator":["Ben McKay"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia face the daunting prospect of batting first on a Basin Reserve green top in their Women's Cricket World Cup clash with New Zealand.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-12 22:00:29","full_description":"Australia have lost the toss and been sent in on a green top for their crunch Women's Cricket World Cup clash with New Zealand.

Frantic action and frenetic entertainment. On a manic Saturday, as many as 16 wickets fell, runs were blazed at a rate of four an over, sixes and fours flew, the twilight sky lit up beatifically to be the background of numerous picture-perfect selfies and groupies, tinseltown celebrities flocked in. Pink ball Tests are quite a spectacle—like the slowest and oldest format paint-brushed in the colours of the youngest and supposedly the most colourful format. A repackaging to woo the new-age audience to the age-old format. Days like these would save Test cricket from its imminent death. There is crowd, there is action, there is fun, there is life.

Was it not superficial? Was it not a perverse thrill? The pleasures a game on a pitch like this can produce is mind-numbingly inferior in quality. Almost like a farce. Almost sadism. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png The pitch, after all, is the soul of a good game. Akin to a canvas for a painter, the muse for a writer, the model for a sculptor. Good pitches promise good contests. By good it implies not fast-paced action, but balanced, absorbing contests.

(AP Photo/Aijaz Rahi) A great batsman or a great bowler might transcend the surface, its instincts and impulses, but a pitch, a day one pitch especially, should not be so diabolical in its characteristics. It was but a poor advertisement for Test cricket—just as the Rawalpindi one was last week. That seemed anaesthetised; this one hyper-activated. Both are dangerous for the game’s health. For a pitch to turn, or bounce, or bounce and turn, even on day one in the subcontinent, is not a crime. But not perhaps so extravagantly, so unplayably, especially on a first day, not from the seventh over of the day, not if puffs of dust are blowing into the face of the batsmen from the wicket as early as the seventh over. Not least when invariable bounce kinks in from the 15th over. The combination of all these elements made batting an ordeal, where you not only require skills to survive, but also slices of good fortune. When fortune outweighs skills on the balance, a contest becomes meaningless.

(AP Photo/Aijaz Rahi) Only a shred of wood helped Hanuma Vihari survive a daisy-cutter that landed on good length and just shot along the ground. Virat Kohli was not so fortunate. He sprung back to a shortish ball to work it on the leg-side. Only that the ball hardly bounced, it just shot all along, hitting him just above his ankle. Kohli stood in the follow-through in half-shock and half-bewilderment, his mouth agape. Experienced as he is, he might not have been dismissed with a flukier ball as this on Day One. Fluke—that exactly was it. There was no involvement of the bowler’s skill or the lack of skill of the batsman. Such variables did not matter after a point, as it was reduced to a game of fortune. There was nothing Kohli could have done better. Or Ravindra Jadeja a few overs later. He shifted back to cut a length ball off Lasith Embuldeniya. Maybe, knowing the nature of the strip he shouldn’t have, but it is one of his staple shots, a muscle-memory stroke. He went for it, but the ball bounced so awkwardly into him that he was totally blindsided by the ball, as if it had springs attached to it. Not even fast bowlers would produce that sort of devious lift, even from back of length area in the subcontinent. Jadeja was not as shocked as Kohli was, he wore a face of quiet resignation as if he knew it. There were plenty of other instances wherein the batsmen could just push their bat at the ball and hope the edge eluded them or the ball kept low, when they just gasped and sighed. Both Rohit Sharma and Vihari would have expected the ball to spin so sharply across them. When a wicket starts to behave like this from the first hour of the first session of the first day, there has to be something wrong with the game itself and the thought behind serving such a wicket. To think what perdition awaits this Test match sends a chilly shiver through the spine. Just imagine the tantrums it would throw once the cracks open up (that is if the match lasts that long). Great batsmen are made to look average; average batsmen are made to look great. It says a lot about the ineptness of Sri Lanka’s bowling that they let India off the hook towards the end. Certainly, it is not what cricket wants. Whatever be the reasoning behind this farce, be it more points to boost the points-tally in the WTC table or wooing the crowd in the pretence of faster action, the most fundamental aspect of the game, that is the pitch should not be held hostage to greed. Eventually, it would end up destroying the essence of Test cricket, its purpose and the very joy it brings. And cricket boards world over should reassess their pitch strategies. Pink-ball Test is an innovative concept, but only if used wisely, lest it would bite cricket back.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Those who are complaining are just boring”: When Michael Vaughan compared Virat Kohli’s on-field character to that of Shane Warne’s","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-those-who-are-complaining-are-just-boring-when-michael-vaughan-compared-virat-kohlis-on-field-character-to-that-of-shane-warnes/","keywords":["Cricket","Michael vaughan","Shane Warne","Virat Kohli"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"When Michael Vaughan compared Virat Kohli’s on-field antics to Shane Warne’s after he allegedly took a jibe at England’s Barmy Army.

He was taking a shot at the Barmy Army with his trumpet signs to the stands. I love it.

The White Ferns have won two out of three fixtures in the ongoing tournament and are currently third in the table. Meanwhile, Australia have won both their fixtures and are in second position in the standings. Both sides have already faced each other in a warm-up match, where New Zealand won the match by nine wickets. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) The 2022 Women's World Cup is swiftly underway and the points table is starting to take shape. In match number 11, the hosts New Zealand Women take on Australia Women to reignite the Trans-Tasmanian rivalry. Both teams sit on 4 points with a couple of wins but the hosts have played a game more. New Zealand succumbed to a shock narrow loss in the tournament opener against West Indies but since then they have pulled up their socks and look a formidable side. After making short work of Bangladesh, they put on a commanding display against India. Everyone in the top four has got atleast one good score in the tournament and their pacers certainly found their mojo back in the last game. Talking about their rivals, they simply are the team to beat. After escaping defeat against arch-rivals England in their opening fixture, the Aussies sealed an easy win over Pakistan and their top order too has runs on the board. Leggie Alana King continues to impress and with Alyssa Healy firing the hosts will be very aware of the threat this Aussie side possesses. Australia will certainly look to make it 3 wins out of 3 but don't count the White Ferns out of the contest just yet as they possess enough talent in their ranks to defeat any team. This match though means a bit more to the hosts as they have already lost once and will not want to slip up at this stage of the competition when the other sides are hot on their heels. So will the Aussies run rampant again? Or will the hosts taste victory against their neighbours?","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/u1agn08_new-zealand-afp_625x300_12_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Test Cricket in pain”: Mohammad Hafeez laments over Karachi pitch for Pakistan vs Australia 2nd Test match","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-test-cricket-in-pain-mohammad-hafeez-laments-over-karachi-pitch-for-pakistan-vs-australia-2nd-test-match/","keywords":["Cricket","Mohammad Hafeez"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mohammad Hafeez laments over Karachi pitch condition during the ongoing second Test match between Pakistan and Australia.

The four-time IPL winner for CSK was on Saturday unveiled as RCB skipper to take the baton from their longest standing captain, Virat Kohli who took charge ahead of IPL 2013. \"Even with him (Kohli) not being the captain, that energy he brings to himself and to the team is hugely important for us. We'll try and use that as best as we can,\" Du Plessis said in a virtual media interaction, on the sidelines of the RCB captain-launch event. The former South Africa skipper further said Kohli has brought about transformation to Indian cricket with his captaincy. \"His (Kohli) performance as a cricket player has been probably one of the greatest, so huge respect for what he's done not only with the bat in his hand but also in captaincy perspective, he's changed Indian cricket,\" Du Plessis said. \"I've seen that happen over time. Playing against India for so long, I could see that shift, his leadership footprint has brought in the Indian team -- a competitive, fit Indian team that was fighting fire with fire as no Indian team ever did before. \"He's got an extremely strong leadership style and that rubs off obviously on players underneath him and that is something that we would still need. Apart from Kohli, the team has players like Glen Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik, who have captaincy expertise in the franchise cricket. \"So for me, it's easy to pull that knowledge, but the tricky part is to always have clarity. I think that's where teams really do well... So I suppose that's where my responsibility comes in,\" he said with a clarity in his mind. The team will sorely miss the 360-degree AB de Villiers, one of the greatest batters of the modern day game as he announced his retirement from all forms of the game last year in November just ahead of the IPL retention. \"It's huge shoes to fill in. There is no cricketer in the world that will try to fill in AB's shoes. Those shoes are too big. I've got big feet but they're never going to match AB's feat. I wouldn't even try, he's an absolute great of the game,\" Du Plessis said of his former South African teammate. Alongside the overwhelming 20,014 international runs in his repertoire, De Villiers also boasts of records of fastest fifty, century and 150 in ODIs. He also managed to rack up 4522 runs from 157 matches that he has played for RCB at an astonishing average and an electrifying strike rate. \"He mentioned throughout his career that it'd be nice if I could join him yet RCB so the timing is obviously not great now that he has decided to retire and also retired three years ago in International cricket. \"Unfortunately, we won't be playing together. But it's nice that one friend replaces another. And there's something nice to that story,\" he added. Director of cricket operations Mike Hesson however said they would look at different options including that of Dinesh Karthik to play the finisher's role in De Villiers' absence. \"In terms of the middle order, we've got DK who's obviously a nice power player and an experienced finisher as well, likely to play that role. We're not looking to replace AB with one player. It's an unrealistic expectation, but within the squad and within our batting group we've filled a lot of those holes.\" \"But yeah, there will never be another ABD and if there is one, I'd love to find him and love to watch and play,\" Hesson said. On his captaincy philosophy, Du Plessis said he would look to build a 'relational' style in his captaincy and would look to form a bond with his teammates. \"For me, first and foremost, my style would be a relational style. It will be to connect with a player and start to get to know everyone. As I said, I come in from the outside, so the first part of how I suppose the journey for me would be to build relationships.\" \"From thereon, you try to find out whether small things make each individual tick and how to get the best out of them,\" Du Plessis said. Promoted Asked about his goals, he said: \"I'm not different to any other player. I'm very competitive. I played the game to win. For me, there's always a real focus on how you do that and the process to get there. \"As a batsman, I want to be one of the best performing batters every time I go out there. There's an end goal but I focus more on the process and actually looking at them,\" he concluded.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/0ugs5buo_virat-kohli-faf-du-plessis-bcci_625x300_12_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"UFC’s Javid Basharat ‘sad’ he can’t walk out with Afghanistan flag, but still proud to represent his people","link":"https://www.mmafighting.com/2022/3/12/22973247/javid-basharat-sad-he-cant-walk-out-afghanistan-flag-but-still-very-proud-to-represent-his-people","keywords":null,"creator":["Damon Martin"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Photo by Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC Javid Basharat would love nothing more than to walk to the octagon for his UFC debut this weekend with the flag of Afghanistan wrapped around his shoulders. Sadly, that won’t be allowed. According to the bantamweight prospect, a similar request was denied when Basharat attempted to earn his UFC contract on the UFC’s Contender Series, and he’s still not allowed to carry the flag for his home nation as he prepares to meet Trevin Jones on the UFC Vegas 50 preliminary card. “Unfortunately, I’m not [allowed],” Basharat told MMA Fighting. “I asked them, they said no. It’s just very annoying. It’s sad, but it is what it is. I don’t know much about politics to know as to why, and I don’t know anything about these legal documents and stuff, but they won’t allow the Afghanistan flag. “What annoys me more is not having it on my T-shirt and my fight kit because they’re going to be limited versions. There’s not that many Afghan fighters. There’s only Nasrat [Haqparast] right now in the UFC. I wanted to have a kit with the Afghan flag on it and my name on it, you know?” Basharat knows how much representation matters, especially given the volatility that has enveloped Afghanistan for more than 40 years. He would love the chance to give the people in his home country someone they could root for on an international stage like the UFC, while also potentially inspiring them to find hope when it seems like they may be constantly surrounded by despair. “I want these people to feel like they’re still important,” Basharat said. “You have to be proud of your country. That’s where your blood is from, and you have greatness within you. The thing is with the Afghan kids right now, they don’t have much to look up to. There’s a few people doing well, like the cricket team, but they don’t have that much to look up. I just want to be another person they can look up to. Not just kids but the whole nation. “These little things, they matter. Unfortunately, we live in a time where the sport’s athletes are the best representation of the country, because politically, everybody’s a mess. I just want to be proud of that. I want to represent that.” Basharat doesn’t know why exactly his request to walk out with the Afghanistan flag has been denied, although he harbors no ill will toward the UFC. It’s the company’s decision to make. Of course, he’s not alone when it comes to confounding decisions — Brian Kelleher was recently told by the UFC that he couldn’t walk out with a peace flag after he initially wanted to use the flag from Ukraine for his fight at UFC 272. “It is bizarre, but at the same time, I don’t think it’s the UFC’s fault,” Basharat said. “I think there’s commissions and God knows what goes on behind the scenes. So I don’t know, but I don’t think it’s the UFC’s fault, I have a feeling. They’re usually cool with that stuff. “It’s better for them as marketing to have you represent your country, but there must be more to it behind the scenes. It is annoying, it is frustrating, but it is what it is. I’ll be the walking flag [for Afghanistan].” As far as his fight goes, Basharat is anxious to prove himself in the UFC and build upon his perfect 11-0 record. He still possesses a 100-percent finishing rate. Basharat was happy to get a more established opponent like Jones for his debut, because it’s exactly the type of fight he wasn’t able to land while competing on the European regional circuit when he was first making waves in the sport. “If you look at my record, I don’t have that many fights against top competition as Trevin,” Basharat said. “That literally comes down to not being able to get fights in Europe. These Americans don’t understand how easy it is to get fights here. In Europe, it’s a nightmare, especially during COVID. Some of the guys on my record, they don’t have deep résumés but they’re actually decent fighters. “Trevin is a great fighter. I keep saying this, the way he fought his last fight, that’s not Trevin. I know what weight cuts do to you, and during all those weight cuts, he had do like three in a month. I give Trevin his props. I’m not deluded and thinking Trevin’s not a good fighter. He is a good fighter. But it’s a good time for me to show how good I really am.”","pubDate":"2022-03-12 16:30:00","full_description":"Javid Basharat would love nothing more than to walk to the octagon for his UFC debut this weekend with the flag of Afghanistan wrapped around his shoulders. Sadly, that won’t be allowed. According to the bantamweight prospect, a similar request was denied when Basharat attempted to earn his UFC contract on the UFC’s Contender Series , and he’s still not allowed to carry the flag for his home nation as he prepares to meet Trevin Jones on the UFC Vegas 50 preliminary card. “Unfortunately, I’m not [allowed],” Basharat told MMA Fighting. “I asked them, they said no. It’s just very annoying. It’s sad, but it is what it is. I don’t know much about politics to know as to why, and I don’t know anything about these legal documents and stuff, but they won’t allow the Afghanistan flag. “What annoys me more is not having it on my T-shirt and my fight kit because they’re going to be limited versions. There’s not that many Afghan fighters. There’s only Nasrat [Haqparast] right now in the UFC. I wanted to have a kit with the Afghan flag on it and my name on it, you know?” Basharat knows how much representation matters, especially given the volatility that has enveloped Afghanistan for more than 40 years. He would love the chance to give the people in his home country someone they could root for on an international stage like the UFC, while also potentially inspiring them to find hope when it seems like they may be constantly surrounded by despair. “I want these people to feel like they’re still important,” Basharat said. “You have to be proud of your country. That’s where your blood is from, and you have greatness within you. The thing is with the Afghan kids right now, they don’t have much to look up to. There’s a few people doing well, like the cricket team, but they don’t have that much to look up. I just want to be another person they can look up to. Not just kids but the whole nation. “These little things, they matter. Unfortunately, we live in a time where the sport’s athletes are the best representation of the country, because politically, everybody’s a mess. I just want to be proud of that. I want to represent that.” Basharat doesn’t know why exactly his request to walk out with the Afghanistan flag has been denied, although he harbors no ill will toward the UFC. It’s the company’s decision to make. Of course, he’s not alone when it comes to confounding decisions — Brian Kelleher was recently told by the UFC that he couldn’t walk out with a peace flag after he initially wanted to use the flag from Ukraine for his fight at UFC 272 . “It is bizarre, but at the same time, I don’t think it’s the UFC’s fault,” Basharat said. “I think there’s commissions and God knows what goes on behind the scenes. So I don’t know, but I don’t think it’s the UFC’s fault, I have a feeling. They’re usually cool with that stuff. “It’s better for them as marketing to have you represent your country, but there must be more to it behind the scenes. It is annoying, it is frustrating, but it is what it is. I’ll be the walking flag [for Afghanistan].” As far as his fight goes, Basharat is anxious to prove himself in the UFC and build upon his perfect 11-0 record.

A date has yet to be announced for the memorial service at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground, Warne’s home turf and scene of many of his exploits. A statue of him already graces the 100,000-capacity venue, and now a grandstand will be named in his honour. Leg-spin bowlers who deliver a consistent threat have always been a rarity in the game, and even Warne made an unremarkable debut in 1992 as an afterthought in a unit built around fast bowlers. But that changed in 1993 on the big stage, facing England in the Ashes for the first time. A bit slimmer and with a shock of blond hair and stud earring — more rock star than cricketer — his first ball was a gem: drifting one way, landing and then turning sharply in the other direction before hitting the stumps. It was quickly dubbed the “Ball of the Century” and a legend was born. Even if you didn’t know much about cricket, you’d stop to watch Warne and his remarkable feats — packaged with charisma that propelled him into mainstream consciousness, where he remained with books, documentaries and even a musical based on his life. His wide appeal rested on the paradox of an uncultivated everyman along with undeniable sporting genius. He could read game situations better than most, thinking steps ahead of the rest. It made him a hero to both jocks and cricket nerds. Bowlers usually hand their sweater or hat to the umpire as they enter a match. With Warne, you could almost picture him telling the umpire to hold his beer while he slowly lumbered up to bowl, cigarette dangling from his lips. And yet, there was no doubt he worked hard on his game — just in his own way. Elaborate coaching sessions and nutrition plans weren’t for him. A heavy smoker, he was content with pizza and french fries. Late in his career, he clashed with cerebral Australia coach John Buchanan, who emphasized data analysis and mental exercises. This was anathema to Warne, who just wanted to enjoy the sport guided by his instincts. When asked about the coach, he famously quipped: “The coach is something you travel in to get to a game.” This was music to the ears of many cricket fans: You tell ’em, Warney. His game involved theatrics — creating tension and, most important, anticipation. He would stand at the top of his mark, staring down at the batter while he spun the ball, tossing it from one hand to the other. Fans watched and wondered what he was thinking. Which of the lethal deliveries in his arsenal would he unleash? Warne knew the batter was thinking the same thing. Just like that, he was in his opponent’s head. Warne literally put Daryll Cullinan, one of South Africa’s finest cricketers of the 1990s, on a psychologist’s couch. Cullinan fancied himself one of the best batters in the world, but had a tough time deciphering Warne and revealed to the press that he’d sought professional help. When they faced off next, in the 1997 Boxing Day test match in Melbourne, Warne greeted Cullinan with two words — “Hourly rates?” — before dismissing him for no score, along with a few more jibes. Most brash, blond Australian cricket stars fade after they retire from competition. Not Warne. The highlights got even brighter after he retired from international cricket in 2007 as the most successful bowler in test history with 708 wickets, a world record at the time. His star status, affability and cricket insight made the transition to television commentary seamless. Famous for having a good time, Warne not only always knew where the party was, he brought it with him. Warne counted the likes of Mick Jagger, Elton John, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay’s Chris Martin as friends, and a high-profile engagement to actor Elizabeth Hurley after retirement kept him in more than just the sports pages. Warne also had an unparalleled sense of occasion, putting on a show on the biggest stages including the 1999 World Cup semifinals and final, plus several Ashes series. With all of that, plus the “Ball of the Century,” Warne’s legend is secure. He loved life and cricket and gave both his all. There will simply never be another.

Australia batter Usman Khawaja can do no wrong in the middle of a splendid batting form. Khawaja, who scored his 11th Test century on the first day of the second Test against Pakistan in Karachi today, has been scoring runs for fun since his international comeback earlier this year. Coming on the back of twin centuries against England in Sydney, Khawaja scoring another ton means that he now has three Test centuries across six innings (479 runs at an average of 119.75) in 2022. In what is Khawaja’s second Test century against Pakistan and in the sub-continent, it is his third away from home. Had Khawaja scored three more runs in the first Test in Rawalpindi, he would’ve had another Test century under his belt. Khawaja, who will resume batting alongside nightwatchman Nathan Lyon (0*) from his overnight score of 127* tomorrow, has all the time and skill to register a career-best knock in the country of his birth. With the surface at the National Stadium a near-replica of what it was at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, Khawaja wouldn’t get a better opportunity of scoring a daddy hundred. While a brisk 82-run opening partnership alongside David Warner (36) had set the tone for Khawaja on Saturday, a 159-run partnership for the third wicket alongside Steven Smith (72) had witnessed the 35-year old player reaching to the three-figure mark. It was in the 64th over that Khawaja had run a single off Pakistan spinner Sajid Khan to complete his century. Callum Ferguson eulogizes Usman Khawaja for century in Karachi Test Khawaja, who received accolades from numerous high-profile names for extending his run-spree, also impressed former Australia batter Callum Ferguson today. A domestic stalwart himself, Ferguson has been witness to Khawaja grinding runs for Queensland over the years across Australia’s domestic tournaments. Even in Ferguson’s last representative match for South Australia last year, Khawaja had scored 50 (56) in a Marsh Cup match in Brisbane. What a performance from @Uz_Khawaja.
