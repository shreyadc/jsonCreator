The South Australian was ruthless against the White Ferns on Sunday, taking the wickets of Suzie Bates, Amelia Kerr and Frances Mackay in a lethal spell. Her favourite wicket was Kerr, nominated by coach Matthew Mott as the world's most improved batter, who she snared in slips thanks to Beth Mooney's athletic leap. \"Moons' catch was pretty special. It was a pretty big screamer and the girls were up and about,\" Brown said. Brown's last wicket left the Kiwis at 5-35 and helped Australia to a 141-run win - their second-biggest ever ODI margin over New Zealand. It was a fine return from Brown, especially given her poor 0-40 off six against England that saw her sit out Australia's win over Pakistan. While her teammates defeated Pakistan, Brown went to the nets. \"During the Pakistan match I had a bit of a bowl, a bit of a trundle with Ben Sawyer our bowling coach,\" she said. \"He helped me with a few tips and cues to bowl to try and go a bit fuller, and I guess swing it a bit more ... that put me in good stead for that New Zealand match.\" And her teammates were glowing in their reviews. \"I don't think I've ever seen Darce bowl that well,\" Ash Gardner said while Ellyse Perry added she did \"amazingly well\". Even Brown was surprised. \"I felt like I was in pretty good control with the ball. I don't usually feel like that,\" she said. \"It's probably up there (with my best spells) with how I felt with control and rhythm and I guess pace.\" Next up is the Windies, who have beaten New Zealand and England already but arrive at the Basin Reserve off a big loss to India. Brown is eager to crack in against Stafanie Taylor and Deandra Dottin, two of world cricket's most explosive batters. \"It'd be an awesome challenge. We played against them in a practice match, and (Dottin) whacked me around a little bit,\" she said. However, Brown's selection isn't assured, given her young age and the riches available to captain Meg Lanning. Against New Zealand, the skipper made the tough call to leave out world No.1-ranked ODI bowler Jess Jonassen in favour of pace. \"We had a really tough selection ... JJ missed out and she's a world class bowler and has done extremely well for us for a long time,\" Lanning said. \"We felt that extra pace option was the way to go. It worked today but on another day it might not.\" Brown said she would understand whichever way the call went. \"I want to play every single game,\" she said. \"But with the path of young fast bowlers there's been a fair few injuries.

New Zealand are regarded as a realistic chance to make the final of the one-day showcase, but the lopsided result is a warning to all teams in the tournament that Australia remain the gold standard. While their top order had a rare off day, Australia’s batting depth shone through, highlighted by half-centuries from Ellyse Perry and Tahlia McGrath. “That’s the beauty of our batting line-up, we’ve got some players who can rescue an innings and build the platform that allows us to play like we did at the back end,” captain Meg Lanning said. New Zealand made a excellent start with the ball. Alyssa Healy departed for 15 with a mis-timed pull shot as she tried to lift the run rate, followed by Lanning on five. Australia were reduced to 56-3 when Rachael Haynes was bowled by Lea Tahuhu for 30 in the 16th over and limped to 113-4 before Beth Mooney dragged the ball on to her stumps, also for 30. Perry and McGrath then combined for a crucial 101-run stand. Ashleigh Gardner contributed a quickfire cameo of 48 runs from 18 balls but Australia’s total looked within reach. Tahuhu was the pick of New Zealand’s bowlers with 3-53. The home side never looked close to achieving the 270-run target as Australia’s bowlers set about dismantling their batting line-up. Teen speedster Darcie Brown had the best figures with 3-22 but the entire attack contributed to a dominant performance. Amy Satterthwaite offered the only real resistance for New Zealand with 44, but the rest of their batters failed to fire.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"I see cricket with the eyes of a cricketer: Ramiz","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/941278-i-see-cricket-with-the-eyes-of-a-cricketer-ramiz","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KARACHI: Putting weight behind his recent statement he had made about the Pindi pitch, the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ramiz Raja said that he is a cricketer first and then the chairman.“I am a cricketer first and then the chairman and I see cricket with the eyes of a cricketer,”...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-14 01:00:00","full_description":"KARACHI: Putting weight behind his recent statement he had made about the Pindi pitch, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja said that he is a cricketer first and then the chairman. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ “I am a cricketer first and then the chairman and I see cricket with the eyes of a cricketer,” Ramiz told reporters here on Sunday. “I understand there was frustration from fans and there was also my frustration. It was important to clarify how the Pindi pitch had been prepared,” the PCB chairman said. A few days ago, Ramiz had issued a detailed statement about the Pindi wicket, Pakistan’s strength and other relevant matters. He termed Australia’s tour to Pakistan as a big achievement of the host country. “It’s a big achievement for us. Australia sent their best team and you saw the fans' excitement. When quality players play, fans come to the stadium and excitement is seen and cricket is reviving,” Ramiz said. “We made terrific efforts and have reached this level and we are hopeful to win this series,” said Ramiz, also a former Pakistan captain. “It’s very meaningful as a perception becomes clear from a security and cricket point of view,” Ramiz was quick to add. He said that the PCB aims to put life in its tracks but it will take some time. “We will try to put life in the pitches but it will take some time. I had said that it will take time to redo the wickets and in Test cricket we are very much behind from infrastructure and pitches point of view. There is still cricket left in the series,” the PCB chief said.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SA-W vs ENG-W Dream11 Team Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Hints: Captain, Probable Playing 11s, Team News; Injury Updates For Today’s SA-W vs ENG-W ODI World Cup Match at Bay Oval, Mount Maunganui 6:30 AM IST March 14","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/sa-w-vs-eng-w-dream11-team-prediction-fantasy-cricket-hints-captain-probable-playing-11s-team-news-injury-updates-for-today-s-sa-w-vs-eng-w-odi-world-cup-match-at-bay-oval-mount-maunganui-630-am-ist-march-14-2445021.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa vs England Women Dream11 Team Prediction South Africa Women vs England Women ICC Women's World Cup ODI- Check My Dream11 Team, Best players list of SA-W vs ENG-W, South Africa women Dream11 Team Player List, England women Dream11 Team Player List, Dream11 Guru Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Playing Tips.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-13 23:30:00","full_description":"South Africa and England women will take on each other in the 13th match of the ICC Women's World Cup 2022.

South Africa are unbeaten in the tournament so far, having beaten Bangladesh and Pakistan in the first two games of their campaign. England, on the other hand, have lost both their opening two games -- to Australia and the West Indies -- and will look to bounce back with a win on Monday. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) The matches of Women's World Cup, 2022 are coming thick and fast and game number 13 sees a clash between South Africa Women and England Women. Both these sides have had a contrasting story so far as England are yet to open their account while South Africa have won their first two games of the tournament. The defending champions, England Women had two close games against Australia and West Indies but they ended up on the losing side in both of those. The English side has been inconsistent in all the departments and they have failed to put in a good team performance. Heather Knight's side has also dropped a lot of catches in the field and that has cost them big time. They will need to pull their socks up and give it their all against a side which will be high on confidence coming into this clash. Talking about South Africa Women, they have fared reasonably well so far but they too, haven't been at their best when it comes to batting. Their batters are getting good starts but have failed to go on and get a big one. Having said that, they did put on decent runs on the board against Pakistan Women but it was their bowling which won them the game in the end. They have quality in their bowling department with the likes of Shabnim Ismail, Ayabonga Khaka and Marizanne Kapp and the English batters have their task cut out if they are to get back to winning ways.

Captained by Bismah Maroof, Pakistan are currently bottom of the table and have lost all their three matches. They lost to South Africa by six runs in their previous fixture. Meanwhile, Bangladesh, captained by Nigar Sultana Joty, have also lost both their matches in this tournament. They lost their previous match to New Zealand by nine wickets. With two points at stake, both sides will be aiming for a win and climb up in the table. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) The caravan continues to move ahead as Bangladesh Women lock horns against Pakistan Women in game number 12 of the ICC Women’s World Cup, 2022 . Both teams are yet to open their account on the points table and are languishing at the bottom of the points table and will be looking at this game as their best opportunity to get a win under the belt. Pakistan Women have lost all their three games but have shown signs of improvement in the last game after getting beaten comprehensively by India and Australia in their opening two encounters. They went down against South Africa in a close encounter and if they can show more composure in crucial junctures of the game, a win might just be around the corner. Their bowling has been pretty good in the competition so far with both paces and spinners putting up notable performances. However, the batting unit has failed to deliver in pretty good batting conditions and that has meant that they have ended on the losing side on each occasion. They need to bring more urgency in their batting and the likes of Bismah Maroof and Nida Dar are more than capable to do so. Bangladesh Women, on the other hand, had a decent outing in their opening game against South Africa but failed to cross the line against a more experienced lineup. They have similar batting issues to deal with and their batters need to step up if they want to register a win in this game. It’s an interesting clash with two flawed batting units going against each other and the one that overpowers the other one, will most probably win this encounter. Pakistan look like a stronger unit on paper with more experience in their ranks but Bangladesh also have enough talent to make this an interesting watch. A very crucial game for both these teams and the one that they would like to win at any cost. Who will finally open the account on the points table?","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/95m34vcg_pakistan-afp_625x300_13_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket fan enters ground, clicks selfie with Kohli before being chased away by police","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/cricket-fan-enters-ground-clicks-selfie-with-kohli-before-being-chased-away-by-police-7818291/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-13 16:42:21","full_description":"In a minor security breach, three fans entered the playing area towards the end of the second day of the second Test between India and Sri Lanka and one of them managed to click a selfie with Virat Kohli before being whisked away by the security personnel.

Significant feats both certainly were, yet neither woman was the day’s biggest story from Hamilton on Saturday. The batting of Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur was.

They deserved all the praise that came their way. The achievements of Mithali and Jhulan may not have got as much attention as they probably would have on another day. Neither would have complained, though. Mithali Raj (left) and Jhulan Goswami (right) have been to Indian women’s cricket what Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev were to the men’s.

Mithali and Jhulan have been the two strongest pillars of this popular Indian women’s team for the longest time. They have been to Indian women’s cricket what Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev were to the men’s. READ | Could not have asked anything better, says India skipper Raj after 155-run win When Mithali and Jhulan started out, a couple of decades ago, it was almost the dark age for women’s cricket in the country. There was little money, few opportunities, and very little coverage in the media. If Mithali and Jhulan still managed to get some space in the newspapers, or in the television news bulletins occasionally, those days, that was because they have been so good at what they did. Raj and Jhulan's latest records have to be celebrated -- not just because they may not be around for long to make more, but because they are important ones, too. (File Photo) - GETTY IMAGES It wasn’t merely runs that followed from Mithali’s bat. There were records, too. It wasn’t just that wickets Jhulan’s bowling produced. There were records, too. Their latest records have to be celebrated. Not just because they may not be around for long to make more – they are both 39 – but because they are important ones, too. And they remind us how durable these two women have been. When somebody walks out to toss for the 24th time in a World Cup match, it is a milestone to be proud of. No woman had taken as many steps towards a cricket pitch to flip a coin. ALSO READ | Harmanpreet does well when she has her back to wall: Smriti Mithali, who broke the record of Australia’s Belinda Clark, had captained India for the first time at the 2005 World Cup; she had led her team to the final. It was in that very tournament in South Africa that Jhulan took her first World-Cup wicket. Seventeen years later, she took her 40th at Hamilton, as she went past the record of Lynette Fullston, another Australian.","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Just hope one of the commentators doesn’t doze off”: Twitter reactions and funniest memes on PAK vs AUS Karachi snoozefest","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-just-hope-one-of-the-commentators-doesnt-doze-off-twitter-reactions-and-funniest-memes-on-pak-vs-aus-karachi-snoozefest/","keywords":["Cricket","PAK vs AUS","PAK vs AUS Memes","Pakistan vs Australia"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"PAK vs AUS Karachi: The pitches for the Pakistan vs Australia test series have been boring and the Twitterati has made some funny memes on it.

Kapil Dev had smashed 50 runs in just 30 balls while playing against Pakistan in Karachi.

His innings comprised 7 fours and 2 sixes within a span of 28 balls -- an unlikely stat in the red-ball format of the game. Pant's blistering knock came to an end at the score of 51, when he was caught and bowled by left-arm spinner Praveen Jayawickrama on a tossed-up delivery.

The 155-run win, coming 48 hours after a 62-run loss to New Zealand at the same venue, now puts India on top of the points table and gives their NRR a huge boost in the race to semifinals. Mithali Raj's decision to bat first on a used pitch was validated early on by Yastika Bhatia's 21-ball 31. After getting her first boundary with an outside edge flying over slip, Yastika pulled Chinelle Henry thrice in the arc from deep mid-wicket to backward square leg.

Harmanpreet then reached her fifty with a loft over long-off for four. As Smriti and Harmanpreet's partnership began to grow, West Indies began to fumble in the field. Misfields, dropped chances and missed run-outs began to creep in as Smriti got some luck on her side in nervous 90s. Smriti then reached her century with a pull through square leg off Hayley. Hayley came under further attack from Smriti as she slammed a hat-trick of boundaries. Though Smriti found deep mid-wicket on the pull off Shamilia, Harmanpreet hit Dottin for a four and six and reached her century with a single through long-on. Harmanpreet fell in the 49th over as the outside edge on the paddle went to the 'keeper. Pooja Vastrakar, Richa Ghosh and Jhulan Goswami fell in quick succession but India had crossed the 300-mark by then. In reply, Deandra began by cracking two fours through cover and over slip off Meghna Singh. Jhulan Goswami teased her on the off-stump line but Deandra replied with successive boundaries over mid-wicket and extra cover. From the other end, Hayley started with a drive in the gap between backward point and over off Meghna. Hayley then smacked a wayward Jhulan for a hat-trick of fours before Deandra hit two more fours in a row to take 21 runs off the over. Hayley was given a reprieve at 23 when she was dropped by substitute fielder Taniya Bhatia.

During the second day of the second Test of the ongoing Sri Lanka’s tour of India in Bengaluru, former India captain Virat Kohli was dismissed cheaply. Kohli, who continues to be without an international century in over two years, registering another low score has resulted in his Test average dropping below 50 for the first time in four and a half years. Coming in to bat at No. 4 in the 31st over, all Kohli could score was 13 (16) with the help of a lone boundary. Kohli, who had become a victim of low bounce in the first innings on Day 1, was found wanting in front of the stumps for the second day in a row. It all happened on the fourth delivery of the 36th over when Kohli went a tad bit too much on the back foot against an arm ball from Sri Lanka spinner Praveen Jayawickrama. Having struck on his pad after failing to read the arm ball, Kohli didn’t even opt for a review as he was quite plumb in front of the stumps. Considering how the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is nothing less than a home ground for Kohli, the spectators must have expected the right-hand batter to do much better than scoring 23 and 13 across two innings. Virat Kohli Test average In 171 Test innings over a decade, Kohli has scored 8,043 runs at an average of 49.95 and a strike rate of 55.69. Kohli, who has scored 27 centuries and 28 half-centuries in this format, had last scored an international century against Bangladesh during India’s first-ever pink-ball Test match at the Eden Gardens in 2019. That’s now 73 consecutive innings for Virat Kohli in international cricket without a century.#INDvSL — Nic Savage (@nic_savage1) March 13, 2022 In 30 Test innings since his last century, Kohli has been able to score just 841 runs at a disappointing average of 28.03 including six half-centuries.
