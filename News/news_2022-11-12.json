I feel many things as I reflect on this ride so far, but most of all I feel pride, joy and optimism. As a Black Fern OG, I feel pride in being part of the whakapapa of the team, along with many other girls, women and men who supported women’s rugby when the system and society said we shouldn’t, couldn’t, wouldn’t and can’t. This weekend is proof that we should, we could, we can, and we did. Take a bow trailblazers, troublemakers and go-getters! This tournament is for you all. I feel joy when I’m at the games, and I know the optimism and passion that went into organising and planning this tournament that has created an amazing, uplifting experience. A walk around the concourse at Eden Park reveals an ocean of smiling faces, lots of children, and more diversity than I’ve seen at a rugby game in ages. People are talking about the games in clubs, pubs, households, workplaces and congregating spaces. People are no longer seeing women’s rugby as a novelty; we are no longer the bridesmaids. Sports fans are now debating tactics, game plans, selections and key moments, and they know many of the players by name. The Wā Poi initiative has been a wonderful way to connect with our culture and with each other throughout this World Cup — and believe me the poi paki has been a huge stress relief, and poi rere a great way to express joy! Last but not least, I feel optimism. The theme of this tournament was all about the ngaru (wave) and its unstoppable energy — that’s been seen on the pitch and in the crowds in Whangārei, Auckland and beyond. From the 83-year-old Thai man we adopted as our kaumātua in the hosting lounge, to the boys and girls (and their parents!) who queue for ages after games to catch a glimpse of superstars like Portia Woodman, Ruby Tui and Amy Rule (we can’t forget the tight five!). The momentum around women’s sport is building and New Zealand is playing a role in that with the Women’s Cricket World Cup, the RWC21, the Fifa Women’s World Cup, and the IWG World Conference Women & Sport. No matter what the outcome tonight, Black Ferns I thank you for letting us “hear your rumble” and ngā mihi to all the teams for “bringing it” to Aotearoa. Thanks to all the fans from Aotearoa and beyond for joining the party. Let’s keep this unstoppable energy going. As the Black Ferns share at the end of their haka: He tia, he tia, Te Moana nui-a-Kiwa, mai nga tōpito, ki nga moutere, o te ao whānui e. Let us proceed, to the seas, from the corners of the island (Aotearoa) to the neighbouring islands, and around the world. Dan Carter: ‘This is their time, their moment’ Dan Carter: \"This is the dream you’ve carried for so long. This is the reason you’ve sacrificed so much.\" Photo / Photosport On their path to the Rugby World Cup final, the Black Ferns have done more than win a few games of rugby — they have united the country. To the players, I say: Thank you. Thanks for being yourselves. Thanks for expressing yourselves on the field with such a beautiful style of play — and thanks for being such authentic, genuine and high-energy characters off the field. The Black Ferns’ energy is infectious. You can clearly see they love what they are doing. We are so used to watching the All Blacks, I love seeing these women with their fresh take on a new style of women’s rugby. Knowing the challenges many of the players have overcome to get here makes them even more inspiring. Unlike the men, they’ve only recently gone professional — that means they’ve made major sacrifices in study, work, and even in their family lives. They’ve made those sacrifices in the hope we can all celebrate New Zealand winning another Rugby World Cup. They’ve done it for us. Their path has been tough. This tournament was meant to take place last year — Covid-19 derailed that. And when they did return to action, they got hammered on last year’s European tour. France and England had developed so much faster than New Zealand, and we got left behind. The Black Ferns have used their challenges as motivation. Now they can match — and defeat — any side in the world. You can see their raw emotion when they play. There’s a lot more to these women than just a game of rugby. I’ve been lucky enough to be invited into the group on a couple of occasions. I’m there to share my knowledge and experience, but I’m the one that walks away feeling energised. I feed off their love and their energy. I’ve only been in a couple of times, but I feel like I’m part of their whānau. This is a young side that will get stronger and stronger. The more New Zealand supports them, the better they can be. Tonight they can add an amazing page to the team’s rich history — this is their time, their moment to enhance the legacy of the Black Ferns jersey and build on the rich heritage created by the women who have gone before them. I was 5 years old when I watched the All Blacks win the 1987 Rugby World Cup final. From that moment, I wanted to be an All Black. Back then, some of my Southbridge teammates were girls, and they didn’t really have a clear pathway to fulfilling their dreams of playing for their country. Today — with the Portia Woodmans and Ruby Tuis on screen and carving it up — the path is being cleared for those kids to follow. I’ve been lucky enough to play in a World Cup final, so I know what these girls are going through. Our support does matter. If you’re at home, tune in. At the ground, scream your lungs out! When you’re only up by one point and you’re on your defensive line — as they were last week — you can feel the energy from the crowd. Tonight, the Eden Park faithful are the 16th player. Thank you, New Zealand for getting behind these women. I know you’ll be with me tonight, behind the team when it matters most. To the girls: do what you’ve always done — be yourselves. Enjoy the game. This is the dream you’ve carried for so long. This is the reason you’ve sacrificed so much, worked so hard behind closed doors, the countless hours put into extra training when no one was watching. Accountable only to yourselves. Now is the time to be yourself, to go out there and express yourself. You’ve got this!","content":"Dr Farah Palmer: ‘Take a bow trailblazers’ It’s been a rollercoaster ride — and there’s one more loop-de-loop left for the Black Ferns to experience tonight.

They will face Pakistan in the final. In the final match of the 50 over World Cup cricket series held in Australia in 1992, Pakistan – England teams clashed. Pakistan team led by Imran Khan won the title. Now after 30 years the expectations are high as the two teams meet in the T20 World Cup on the same soil. Also, Pakistani fans are comparing the current World Cup series with the 1992 World Cup series. In this case, like Imran Khan, the current captain of the Pakistan team, Babar Azam, will become the Prime Minister of the country, Sunil Gavaskar, the former player of the Indian team, has said. Gavaskar jokingly said this while commenting on the Indian team’s match yesterday. In it, fellow commentators laughed and said, “If Pakistan wins the World Cup, Babar Azam will become the Prime Minister of Pakistan after another 26 years i.e. 2048.” After winning the World Cup in 1992, Imran Khan became the Prime Minister of Pakistan after 26 years. Similarly, Babar Azam will become the Prime Minister of Pakistan after 26 years if he wins this World Cup.

After 44 matches spanning nearly a month, the Melbourne Cricket Ground will host the deciding game to determine who joins the West Indies as the only two-time winners since the tournament’s inception in 2007. Pakistan tasted victory in 2009 when they beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final, while England won it a year later with a seven-wicket win over Australia. England will be favourites against a Pakistan side who have roared back from losing their first two matches of the tournament. Rain could though spoil the party with a 100 per cent chance of showers forecast and even severe thunderstorms. A reserve day has been set aside on Monday but the weather is again expected to be bleak, raising the prospect of a washout and the unthinkable — the trophy being shared. A minimum of 10 overs per side is needed to constitute a game, compared to five during the group stages. If the match starts on Sunday but isn’t finished, it will resume on Monday from where it was halted. Organisers on Friday tweaked the rules to give two hours’ extra play on Monday should it be needed to complete the match. Three games at the MCG in the Super 12 stage fell victim to rain. Notwithstanding the elements, Buttler is confident England can finish the job after routing India by 10 wickets in the semi-finals. Resurgent Pakistan beat New Zealand by seven wickets to earn the right to meet them. “I think we’re a good team, I think that’s probably where the performance comes from,” Buttler said. “Some brilliant players in the team. When they play their best, we’re a tough team to beat. Incredibly dangerous side, huge confidence in the group.” England have selection decisions to make with batsman Dawid Malan and fast bowler Mark Wood missing the semi-final injured. They were replaced by Phil Salt, who was not required to bat, and Chris Jordan, who took 3-43. “We will see how they pull up and hopefully progress to be available for selection come the final,” said Buttler of Malan and Wood. Buttler’s brilliant 80 and Alex Hales’s blistering 86 did the damage against India, with the South Asian giant’s esteemed bowling attack having no answers. Who will handle the pressure? Pakistan pace spearheads Mohammad Nawaz and Shaheen Shah Afridi will be tasked with blunting the in-form openers on Sunday. Pakistan team mentor Matthew Hayden said that was key to the final. “It’s obvious really, isn’t it — quality fast bowling against quality batting, it’s why you watch the game,” said the former Australian great, who was Pakistan’s batting coach at the 2021 World Cup, when they made the semi-finals and was recruited again this year. “But we’ve got four quicks that really make an impact and can create some sustainable damage inside 20 overs. Our side has six genuine options and a seventh as well should it be required. So I think the bases are covered.” Both teams know each other well, playing a seven-game T20 series in Pakistan ahead of the World Cup, which England won 4-3. “I think the time we had in Pakistan, it was great for the group,” said Buttler. “It’s going to be an amazing occasion,” he added of the final at the MCG. “It’s certainly something to be relished, to be enjoyed, and I’ll just encourage us to play with the same freedom.” Hayden said the two teams were “even steven”. “On the day, who handles the pressure, who’s got their game preparation spot on, who can handle their emotions, it’s how they start and how they finish,” he said. “All those cliches of the sport, they matter in the big games.” —Agencies T20 World Cup: ‘Dangerous’ England face Pakistan in final but rain threatens added by KR Desk on 12:45 am November 12, 2022 View all posts by KR Desk → KR Desk Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-11-11 19:15:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The ‘goose bumps’ moment awaiting Smith at home","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/golf/cameron-smith-opens-up-on-his-massive-year-liv-golf-relationships-with-pga-players-and-plans-for-the-future/news-story/e80a5dd5546c30cc5aa5d1a4ca900695","keywords":["Golf news"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Bakers of Brisbane beware … Cameron Smith is coming home.","content":"“I have not had a decent meat pie in three years … I cannot wait for that,’’ Smith said from his home in Jacksonville, Florida.Smith’s status in golf – he’s the sport’s new $150 million man and prize signing for Greg Norman’s LIV golf troupe – may have changed since he was last in Brisbane but his tastebuds haven’t.Reigning British Open champion Smith returns home for the first time in three years this week as the headline act for the Australia PGA championship at Royal Queensland Golf Club from November 24-27. He will land as a global star, a more mature man and a superior golfer than the understated craftsman who quietly slipped abroad pre-Covid three years ago.But deep down he hasn’t changed at all.The self-confessed rev-head hopes to drive a few hot laps of Willowbank Raceway which he occasionally did before his left. While he has been away his uncle Trev opened a coffee shop at Brendale “so I’m going to turn to up and put a bit of s*** on him.’’Smith once said he planned to open his own coffee shop when he retired and it’s still a chance even though he might now be able to afford to buy the plantation as well as the shop.“That is something I would still like to do. I love coffee.’’Amidst all the promotional mayhem there will be less conspicuous reunion which promises to be one of the great experiences of his life.Smith will walk through the front door of the laidback Wantima Golf Club where he was raised and greet members who have known him since he was a schoolboy. He will be carrying the famed Claret Jug which is the trophy from the 150th British Open at St Andrews this year which Ian Baker-Finch calls the biggest major tournament in the history of golf. “Honestly, I cannot wait for that moment – I am getting goose bumps thinking about it. I just think it is one of the coolest things for a little club like that to have the British Open trophy in its clubhouse. It’s just going to be unreal. I am looking forward to them having a drink out of it.“I am getting more and more excited by the day. First and foremost it will be awesome to see my extended family and a couple of mates and I think playing golf in front of my home crowd will be massive.’’It’s been quite a ride for the player who started golf with his clubs contained in a plumbing pipe fastened to his father Des’s bag with his watershed year including …THE DECISIONSmith’s decision to sign with LIV in a contract speculated to be around $150 million changed the balance of power between LIV and the traditional tours.Before Smith joined LIV the outfit was criticised as being stocked with former greats in decline. Suddenly they had a newly minted British Open champion. “It was definitely a stressful time leading up to make all those decisions. I spoke to a lot of good people, my mum and dad a lot of good friends.“I have absolutely got no regrets. At the start it was definitely scary making a career move like that, it being a fresh tour.“But from what I have seen over the past five events it is going the right direction.“I think the fans love it a lot which is really important for our sport because it gets a lot of people playing golf. Even if it is just for a whack here or there and having a beer. The more eyes on golf the better.’’LIV’S FUTURECritics of LIV have questioned whether the Saudi Arabian royal family who launched the project will stay in golf long term.Smith has no sense of this and believes the concept may last for decades. “I don’t think they are looking for a short term thing. They have put in a fair bit of money. Over the course of 10, 20, 30 years they are definitely going to see a return.“I played my first event in Boston and I was blown away by the number of people who were there. The set-up and structure around the golf course was definitely different to what I had been used to. But people love it.“The music around the golf course. The DJ after the round. You get to see people having a really good time. That’s different to just sitting there and being quiet and having a beer and clapping every five or 10 minutes.“Team golf has not really existed (on the traditional tours) apart from a couple of events. It’s exciting. For me growing up with sports like cricket and rugby league team sport just makes me feel like a kid again. I have not had that feeling forever so it’s been a really nice change.’’THE FALLOUTThe traditional tours have been trading barbs with LIV with the likes of Rory McIlroy speaking out against Norman’s men and Scottie Scheffler once appearing to deliberately walk on Smith’s line when he was putting. But Smith says life has not been uncomfortable.“I wouldn’t say it has been hard at all. Definitely some of my mates are still out on the PGA tour and they are still my mates. They respect my decision. “A few of them don’t agree with it but we still have a beer and a laugh and are really good friends. That is the most important thing to me.“(PGA member) Billy Horschel lives just down the road from me. He has been a big spokesman for the (PGA) tour (yet) he is the one who sticks out for me the most. We still have a laugh and are probably going to go fishing at the end of this week before I go home.’’Inside the LIV tent Smith has enjoyed the company of, among others, fellow Queenslander Jed Morgan. “He is one of the best kids you would ever meet, definitely a bit of a larrikin. His golf game has a really high ceiling. He will be one of the best players to come from Australia in the years to come. Jed was one of the first winners of my scholarship so I have known him for four of five years. We have lots of good fishing trips. He’s funny.’’THEN AND NOWSo what is the difference in Smith from the man who returns from the one who left three years ago?“I would like to think I am still the same person. The old boy (father Des) would be the first to tell me if I am getting out of line. He is not afraid of a bit of confrontation with me. He hasn’t told me much lately which is nice.“As a golfer I feel as if I have progressed a lot since I was last home. There has been a lot of hard work and maturing as a golfer and a person as well.“I just think I don’t let things get to me as much as what they used to. That comes with age. I remember playing in my teenage years and just every bad shot and bad break would really get to me. Now I know so much more about the game. I realise the game of golf isn’t fair sometimes.

Daniel Hughes’ one-day numbers are excellent but the Australian ODI top order is tough to crack.

The beehive shows all of England’s boundaries generally came from balls on a considerably tighter line. Arup Ghosh November 12th, 2022 0:28:05 IST India react following the T20 World Cup cricket semifinal between England and India in Adelaide, Australia, Thursday, Nov. 10, 2022. England defeated India by ten wickets. (AP Photo/James Elsby) There are losses and then there are losses. India, at Adelaide, were trounced, walloped, whipped, slaughtered. But behind every win and every loss in sport, there are a multitude of causes and circumstances. So, keeping jingoism and a fan’s passion aside, here’s a step-by-step dissection of the what, how and why. T20 World Cup: Full coverage | Schedule | Results | Points Table | News | Photos The T20 format is foremost a young person’s game. It needs a barrel of young blood, fearless to the core and willing to die for the cause rather than deriving solace from a smattering of anaemic averages. Unfortunately, despite the stupendous success of the Indian Premier League (IPL), India’s batters by and large still live in a long-forgotten era. The openers should walk in believing they have to keep up the strike rate, take the pressure off the middle order, maximizing the run rate when the Powerplay’s fielding restrictions are in place for the first 6 overs and not worry too much about settling down. In fact, that is where precisely India lost the plot right through the tournament. “I’m just staggered by how they play T20 cricket for the talent they have. They have the players, but just do not have the right process in place. They have to go for it. Since winning the 50 over World Cup on home soil in 2011 what have they done? Nothing. India are playing a white-ball game that is dated and have done for years,” former England captain Michael Vaughan and Ashes hero wrote in his column. Looking at it closely, the manner in which both teams (semi-final) handled the two Powerplays provided a hook on which the story unfolded. India scrounged around for 38 in the first 6 overs for 1 wicket. This Indian team looked old today #T20WorldCup — S.Badrinath (@s_badrinath) November 10, 2022 In sharp dissimilitude, England slammed 63 in 6 overs without breaking into a sweat. Read that as without losing a wicket. The carnage continued signalling the fact even if India had scored another 25 it may have still lost. India captain Rohit Sharma was quick to blame his bowlers. After all, losing a semi-final by 10 wickets is a hard pill to swallow. “I thought we still batted pretty well at the back end to get to that score, but we weren’t good enough with the ball,” Rohit said at the post-match presentation. “It was definitely not a wicket where a team could come and chase down [that target] in 16-17 overs. But yeah, these things happen. Like I said, with the ball we just didn’t turn up today.” Rohit blaming the lines bowled by India is a tad inexplicable. “We wanted to keep it tight, not give room, we looked at Adelaide pretty well, we know where the runs are scored. Square of the wicket is what we were quite aware of, and that’s where all the runs went today. Keeping it tight is something we spoke of but from there if the batsman plays a good shot we’ll take it. But that is something that didn’t happen today and that is a little disappointing.” However, the marvels of modern technology leave no room for anyone to duck. Ball-tracking data indicates Rohit Sharma was erroneous to say his bowlers didn’t bowl the right lines. The beehive (Cric Viz) shows all of England’s boundaries generally came from balls on a considerably tighter line. It meant India’s bowlers were on a tight line unlike what Rohit was suggesting. England bowled more bowls down leg and wide than India who were more effective at staying on a tight stump line. There is merit in the argument, buttressed by Sunil Gavaskar in his post-match analysis, that once the ball stops swinging India’s bowling attack – minus a genuine quick or a wrist spinner – lacked any threat. But, what Rohit pointed was not accurate. India lost because its batting order needs a serious rejig. And introspection to boot. There is a prevalent belief that going for par-scores is enough to see the side through as it would hope to ride on the rival’s batting weaknesses. India’s biggest batting problem in this World Cup stemmed from its openers. They still have this fond notion to settle in, take the game deep and then go berserk in the death overs. Frankly, those days have long gone extinct. Hurtful loss. Forever grateful to our fans who create electrifying atmosphere, no matter where we play. Thankful for the undying support for each other, proud of the hardwork put in by this team &support staff. Proud to play for my country🇮🇳 We will reflect &come back stronger! pic.twitter.com/EeuLz45kgl — Surya Kumar Yadav (@surya_14kumar) November 11, 2022 “They (openers) have to go for it. Why do they give the opposition bowlers the first five overs to bed in? We know in T20 cricket the stats tell you a team needs a spinner who can turn it both ways. India have plenty of leg-spinners. Where are they?,” asked Vaughan. Even with the team selection India pushed too many wrong buttons. The selectors were driven with a defensive and outdated mindset: 1. Rishabh Pant should have opened, bringing in the left-right combination 2. Sky (Suryakumar Yadav) ought to have been No. 3. He is India’s best bat in this format and needed more time at the top 3. There was no place for DK as the finisher at age 37 in T20s 4. Sanju Samson, Ishan Kishan and Umran Malik were missed 5. Injuries to Bumrah and Jadeja were gaping holes which were left unplugged 6. Spinners Chahal, Kuldeep have good strike rates but were dropped 7. Bad use of Powerplays cost India dearly 8. Poor analysis of Australian pitches where there was hardly any swing meant good rival batters could hit through with impunity 9. India lost to South Africa; somehow scrambled home against Pakistan and almost lost to Bangladesh “How they have not maximised someone like Rishabh Pant is incredible,” Michael Vaughan said. Aussie great Ian Chappell found it “ridiculous” that India weren’t playing Rishabh regularly. “Even in their own backyard at the 2016 World T20 they did not reach the final. They were nowhere last year. This time it took an outrageous innings by Virat Kohli, probably the best in T20 of all time, to beat Pakistan in the group stages. They massively underachieve for their skill levels,” added Vaughan. Truly bewildering is Suryakumar Yadav, the world’s top-ranked T20I batsman, follows Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli. He had to either open or bat at No. 3. In a short-duration match of a little over 90 minutes the conditions don’t change appreciably. The specious plea of letting Virat to “anchor” the innings was also wrong. Joe Root, Kane Williamson, Steve Smith, are all batters in the classic mould but they aren’t roaring hits in T20. Therefore, Virat’s averages per innings in T20Is is irrelevant. It is his strike rate which matters the most. A higher strike rate and a lower average is indicative that a batter takes risks, scores quickly and lets others in the slipstream row hard. In the semi-final match, Hardik’s dynamite finish led India to a total of 168. It created the facetious impression that India had latched onto a par score. This when India had allowed Adil Rashid to bowl his spinners for 4 overs for 20 runs and scalped 1. According to the PitchViz model – which uses ball-tracking data to assess a par total – the par score on that pitch was 176, – typically amounting to around 10% win probability. Playing against England, it was known they bat deep and audaciously. So, another 20-25 runs were needed to be anywhere near par. But the hammering India took meant even those extra runs may have been insufficient. “They have a left-armer in Arshdeep Singh who swings it back into the right-handers. So what do they do defending 168? They put on Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowling outswing to give Jos Buttler and Alex Hales width. Where is the left-arm seamer swinging it in to Buttler and Hales in the first over? Madness,” Michael Vaughan added. T20 batsmen must be strategically open to taking risks for quick runs. There is no scope for selfishness. Sides like England have imbibed the train of thought of the limited overs game. The teams of the sub-continent still struggle to do so. The absurdity of hosting a blockbuster like IPL and yet staring at a very bare ICC trophy cabinet is difficult to ignore. To sum it up, former England captain Nasser Hussain put it very succinctly: “It’s not India’s personnel. It’s their mindset.” The author is CEO of nnis Read all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.

Alex Hales and Jos Buttler ripped apart the Indian attack with consummate ease in the semifinal on Thursday, leading England to the final where they meet Pakistan on Sunday at the MCG. Wassan said the specialised coaching staff is required to guide the players in the slam-bang format. \"We can't have the same coaching staff for the T20 and Test cricket . You hire the best for the T20 format. Why didn't we hire AB de Villers for the T20 World Cup as a mentor? He could have guided the team better.

In 2007, we hardly had stars, the team was comprised of youngsters, they played freely and they won the title. We are relying too much on our bigger names to deliver all the time,\" Wassan, who played four Tests and nine ODIs for India, said it's a wrong notion that excelling in IPL will guarantee success in international cricket. \"We also wrongly thought that the expertise of IPL will translate into World Cup success. India is just faltering in big matches in do-or-die situations,\" he said. The 54-year-old, who now works as an expert, is of the opinion that India should pick only the most suited players for the T20 format. \"We have five ex-captains and eight players who play Test format, competing in T20s.

Heavy rain is expected on Sunday’s match-day and also the reserve day on Monday as a multi-year La Nina weather phenomenon continues to drench much of eastern Australia. The tournament has already seen a slew of Super 12 matches washed out, though the semi-finals passed without disruption in Sydney and Adelaide. While the forecast could put a dampener on the crowd at the MCG, organisers will plough ahead with the starting time of 7 pm (1.30pm IST) on Sunday and hope each side can squeeze 10 overs in, the minimum required for the final. If forced to reschedule, the match would start at 3 pm (9.30am IST) on Monday, with players and officials on notice to be prepared to play well into the evening if the weather forces it. However, Melbourne is known for having “four seasons in one day”, particularly in spring, and forecasts are often wide of the mark. Pakistan played a full game against India in their Super 12 blockbuster at the MCG despite a dire outlook for rain. Rain was expected on Friday, too, but Pakistan trained under leaden skies at the MCG without ever running for cover. Pakistan team mentor Matthew Hayden, who accurately predicted struggling captain Babar Azam would return to form with the bat in the semi-final against New Zealand, was banking on the weather to cooperate. “Today there was a great chance of rain and here we are,” Hayden told reporters at the MCG. “The wicket looks excellent … Who knows the weather here in Melbourne? “On the day, I’m sure that Melbourne is going to open up enough to have a 10-over match.”","pubDate":"2022-11-11 18:44:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenorthlines","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'There are players in mid 30s...', Sunil Gavaskar makes BIG statement on Team India's T20 cricket future","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/t20-world-cup-2022-there-are-players-in-mid-30s-sunil-gavaskar-makes-big-statement-on-team-indias-t20-cricket-future-2534112.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"After the loss in the T20 World Cup chances are that senior players will slowly be retired from the shortest format of cricket and Hardik Pandya will lead the team in the next world cup.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-11 17:55:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pro Kabaddi League: Pardeep Narwal stars in UP Yoddhas win over Haryana Steelers; U Mumba edge Puneri Paltan","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/pro-kabaddi-league-pardeep-narwal-stars-in-up-yoddhas-win-over-haryana-steelers-u-mumba-edge-puneri-paltan-11614141.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pro Kabaddi League: Pardeep Narwal stars in UP Yoddhas win over Haryana Steelers; U Mumba edge Puneri Paltan","content":"Sports Pro Kabaddi League: Pardeep Narwal stars in UP Yoddhas win over Haryana Steelers; U Mumba edge Puneri Paltan In the evening's other two games, U Mumba edged Puneri Paltan 34-33 in the Maharashtra Derby, while Patna Pirates got the better of Jaipur Pink Panthers in a 37-30 victory.

Having suffered a defeat in the 2016 final, Saweety looked in no mood to settle for another silver this time round as she displayed sheer confidence before winning the bout 5:0. Up against the local favourite Islam Husaili, Alfiya (81+kg) handed India its fourth gold in the women’s section after her opponent was disqualified by the judges towards the end of the first round. This was Indian women’s third best performance at the prestigious tournament in terms of winning gold medals, after seven gold medals in 2005 and five in 2003. Meanwhile, debutant Minakshi (52kg) signed off with a silver medal as she fell to a 1-4 defeat against 2017 Youth World Championships bronze medalist Kinoshita Rinka of Japan. On Saturday, five-time Asian Championships medallist Shiva Thapa (63.5kg) will look to clinch his second gold medal when he takes to the ring against Abdullaev Ruslan of Uzbekistan.

FP Trending November 11th, 2022 17:28:37 IST File image of IPL trophy. iplt20.com Team India endured utter humiliation by England in the T20 World Cup semi-final on Thursday following a below-par performance by the Indian bowlers. The merciless English side crushed the Indian team quite easily in Adelaide, outperforming them in every aspect of the game, and securing a spot in Sunday’s title bout against Pakistan. After the massive 10-wicket defeat, Indian fans showered brutal criticism on the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). India has advanced to the knockout stages of numerous ICC competitions since the 2015 ODI World Cup. However, they have always come out on the losing end. The Indian squad has underperformed in the later stages of an ICC competition six times so far. Referring to the scenario, fans pinned their blame on the Indian Premier League (IPL). According to many users, Indian players do not focus on international cricket; they are only concerned about the cash-rich franchise league. Additionally, they made fun of players who excelled in the Indian Premier League but failed to do the same in the Indian outfit. Numerous memes from all across the country surfaced on different social media platforms. An angry fan said, “Time to boycott IPL so that Indian players can focus on international cricket. It’s high time now.” Time to boycott IPL so that Indian players can focus on international cricket.

During the post-match press conference, India head coach Rahul Dravid warned that though participating in franchise T20 leagues abroad may have its benefits, it could result in the elimination of Test cricket from the nation’s cricketing structure. Apart from the T20 Blast and The Hundred, England has benefited from other franchise T20 competitions while Indian cricketers only compete in the IPL and the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy on the home circuit.

AP Following India’s T20 World Cup semi-final exit against England on Thursday, experts and fans alike have wondered why the same set of players handle the pressure much well during the Indian Premier League. T20 World Cup Home | Schedule | Results | Points Table | T20 World Cup News | Photos Pakistan bowling great Wasim Akram also pointed out that many of the young Indian pacers don’t carry their pace into the international matches after a strong IPL season. The 56-year-old retired pacer pointed out that somebody like Avesh Khan bowled really quick during IPL but was bowling in 130s for India during Asia Cup, where he also withdrew later on with health concerns. “Something I noted about Indian bowlers during Asia Cup. They drop pace post IPL.” Akram said on A Sports. “For instance, Avesh Khan was bowling consistently at 145kmph but after one season of IPL they play the pace drops to 130-135 kmph. So BCCI need to check the reason behind that because he got paid some 12-13 crore Indian money.” “I think IPL need to have a pay cap for young players so that they understand bhook hoti kya hai , what it feels to be hungry. If I was earning Rs 24 crore a month then I don’t think I will work that hard once IPL is done. The culture we come from, hum khud ko dheela chhod dete hain .” Also, present at the show was Waqar Younis, who pointed out that modern pacers often drop pace to utilise the swing and that can’t be an approach for a fast bowlers, whose prime strength is speed. “I don’t know exactly why they are dropping pace but when I used to play and then worked as a coach, I always emphasised on bowling quickly. If you are quick then bowl quick, that’s what Wasim and I did throughout our careers. If you have pace, you learn the other bits. But if you slow it down and swing the ball, then somewhere T20 cricket and modern-day coaching is at fault for that. I don’t know what’s being taught in the Indian camp but pace matters,” Younis said. Akram added his further bit to the conversation saying that during his heydays, former Pakistan captain and legend Imran Khan pushed him to bowl even when he was tired so that it makes him faster but the approach has changed among youngsters with the advent of T20 cricket. “Back when I was young and was playing a drawn Test match, the general idea was to rest your frontline bowlers but Imran Khan bowled a four-over spell with all his mights and asked me to do the same from the other end. That’s because when you are tired you use all your energy to bowl fast, you increase your speed as it strengthens your muscle. The more you bowl, the faster you get. But nowadays the general idea among bowlers is that I have to bowl 18 deliveries and leave but that’s not how it works,” Akram said.

T20 वर्ल्ड कप में ऐसा रहा है इंग्लैंड का परफॉर्मेंस इंग्लैंड टीम पहली बार साल 2009 T20 वर्ल्ड कप के फाइनल में पहुंची थी. इस टूर्नामेंट के फाइनल मैच में इंग्लैंड की टीम ऑस्ट्रेलिया को हराकर पहली बार चैंपियन बनी थी. वहीं, इंग्लैंड टीम दूसरी बार साल 2016 T20 वर्ल्ड कप के फाइनल में पहुंची थी, लेकिन फाइनल मैच में वेस्टइंडीज के खिलाफ हार का सामना करना पड़ा था. साल 2016 T20 वर्ल्ड कप भारत में खेला गया था. इसके अलावा इंग्लैंड टीम ने साल 2021 T20 वर्ल्ड कप में सेमीफाइनल तक का सफर किया था, लेकिन सेमीफाइनल में न्यूजीलैंड ने हरा दिया था. क्या दूसरी बार चैंपियन बनेगी इंग्लैंड टीम? वहीं, इंग्लैंड टीम साल 2022 T20 वर्ल्ड कप (T20 World Cup 2022) के फाइनल में पहुंच चुकी है. इंग्लैंड के सामने फाइनल मैच में पाकिस्तान की टीम होगी. इंग्लैंड और पाकिस्तान के बीच फाइनल मैच 13 नवंबर को मेलबर्न क्रिकेट ग्राउंड (Melbourne Cricket Ground) पर खेला जाएगा. दरअसल, T20 वर्ल्ड कप के इतिहास में तीसरी बार इंग्लैंड टीम फाइनल में पहुंची है, इससे पहले साल 2010 में चैंपियन बनी थी. हालांकि, T20 वर्ल्ड कप 2016 के फाइनल में वेस्टइंडीज के खिलाफ हार का सामना पड़ा था. इस तरह अगर इंग्लैंड टीम पाकिस्तान को हराने में कामयाब रहती है, तो यह टीम दूसरी बार T20 वर्ल्ड कप चैंपियन बनेगी. ये भी पढ़ें- T20 World Cup 2022: इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ हार के बाद छलका सूर्यकुमार यादव का दर्द, सपोर्ट के लिए फैंस को कहा थैंक्स","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-11 11:41:42","image_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Will rain ruin the T20 World Cup Final?","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/will-rain-ruin-the-t20-world-cup-final/video/f937a3930f3564099fac616c51f5b495","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket World Cup: There is fear that a weather forecast of rain may ruin the chance of playing the T20 World Cup Final in Melbourne.","content":"Cricket World Cup: There is fear that a weather forecast of rain may ruin the chance of playing the T20 World Cup Final in Melbourne.","pubDate":"2022-11-11 11:36:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs ENG 2022: इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ हार पर भड़के भारतीय फैंस, पूछा- कब तक रवि अश्विन और केएल राहुल को झेलोगे?","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup-semi-final-loss-fans-on-social-media-are-questioning-rohit-sharma-captaincy-2257205","keywords":null,"creator":["अभिनव आज़ाद"],"video_url":null,"description":"T20 World Cup 2022 Rohit Sharma: T20 वर्ल्ड कप में टीम इंडिया का सफर थम गया है. दरअसल, रोहित शर्मा (Rohit Sharma) की टीम को सेमीफाइनल मैच में इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ हार का सामना करना पड़ा. इस मैच में जोस बटलर (Jos Buttler) की टीम ने भारतीय टीम को 10 विकेट से हराया. बहरहाल, टीम इंडिया का वर्ल्ड कप जीतने का सपना टूट गया है. भारतीय टीम की इस हार के बाद सोशल मीडिया (Social Media) पर फैंस लगातार अपनी प्रतिक्रिया दे रहे हैं. साथ ही सोशल मीडिया पर फैंस रोहित शर्मा की कप्तानी समेत कई प्वॉइंट्स पर फैंस सवाल खड़े कर रहे हैं. हार के बाद भड़के भारतीय फैंस सोशल मीडिया पर हार के बाद भड़के फैंस का कहना है कि रोहित शर्मा ने कप्तान के तौर पर कई गलतियां कीं. साथ ही फैंस का मानना है कि केएल राहुल और रवि अश्विन को प्लेइंग इलेवन में सामिल करना गलती थी. क्या आईपीएल रिकार्ड्स देखकर रोहित शर्मा को कप्तान बनाया गया? भारतीय टीम लगातार खराब प्रदर्शन करने वाले केएल राहुल और रवि अश्विन को क्यों ढ़ो रही है. इसके अलावा फैंस का मानना है कि लेग स्पिनर युजवेन्द्र चहल को प्लेइंग इलेवन में शामिल नहीं करना बड़ी गलती थी. #captaincy #dhoni they praise rohit sharma for his captaincy in ipl and blame dhoni for his perfomance i just want to know where is mi lobbythere is huge difference between international cricket and IPL I think kohli was better captain than sharma pic.twitter.com/TpJdZ9p0Jj — Abhay (@Abhay58291030) November 10, 2022 Rohit sharma's 0(1) would have helped india more than this knock pic.twitter.com/29DlpsnU8h — M.

From Amul’s comic strip in newspapers to Zomato’s memes on Instagram, all news stories become a part of their jest. But Myntra’s latest post targeting Indian cricketer KL Rahul has raised a few eyebrows. The right-handed batsman has been party to lethal trolling online for his consistent poor performance in key matches at the ICC T20 World Cup being held in Australia. Joining the troll brigade on Thursday was the e-commerce fashion brand Myntra . Posting a picture of a tee that read “out of this world”, the brand scratched out the last three words of the phrase highlighting the word ‘out’. In the caption, they wrote, “KL Rahul’s fav t-shirt.” A large number of people seemed to have tagged others, while some indulged in a heated discussion. Some found the brand at fault for taking a ‘cheap shot’ at the batsman, and some others defended the supposed joke. “Precisely this. However, in the quest of being quirky, you, as a well-known brand, shouldn’t demean your men’s national cricket team’s VC. Trolls do this..you shouldn’t,” wrote a user. “Well amplifying on trending content is good but not at the cost of defaming players, sometimes the opponent does play well and you can’t help it and no player stays in form forever. Would love to see what @myntra does when KL hits a century. Have some shame @myntra,” wrote another user.
