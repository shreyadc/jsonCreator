In a dead rubber, talismanic batter Virat Kohli gave Indian fans tons of reasons to be happy. As captain Rohit Sharma was rested, Kohli was promoted to open the batting. What followed next was something which anyone could have predicted, leaving Kohli himself surprised. Kohli ended his drought of not scoring a century in international cricket for 1020 days with a sensational career-best 122 off just 61 balls, laced with 12 fours and six sixes, at a strike-rate of 200. The 33-year old also completed 3500 runs during the course of the innings, becoming the second men's player to the landmark in T20Is after Rohit Sharma. He also completed 100 sixes in his T20I career, becoming the 10th men's player to reach the milestone. Kohli's 122 not out is also the 13th highest score in men's T20Is and the highest by an Indian player after Rohit's 118 against Sri Lanka. After a rollicking opening stand of 119 off 76 balls, with stand-in captain KL Rahul making 65 of those runs, Kohli accelerated amazingly from 59 off 40 balls to get his next 63 runs off just 21 balls to score a long-standing 71st international century. With this, Kohli also equalled Ricky Ponting for the second-most international hundreds after Sachin Tendulkar, who has 100 centuries. On the back of Kohli's century, India made a mammoth 212/2, the highest score in the Asia Cup 2022 tournament so far. Then, senior pacer Bhuvneshwar's spell of 5/4, with lots of swing and hitting the right areas consistently, dismantled the Afghanistan challenge, eventually restricting them to 111/8 in 20 overs. It was a day to forget for Afghanistan, who arrived into this game less than 24 hours after a one-wicket heartbreak against Pakistan in Sharjah. They dropped catches, including of Kohli on 28, looked jaded and simply weren't at their best.

Kohli, rated as one of the best players of his generation, had not reached three figures in international cricket in almost three years. The 33-year-old looked back to his best in Dubai on Thursday as he smashed 122 not out off 61 balls to fire India to 212-2 against Afghanistan. Opening the batting, Kohli shared a 119-run partnership with KL Rahul and ended the innings with 12 fours and six sixes. In reply, Afghanistan stuttered to 111-8, although the 101-run defeat will not hurt too much as it was a dead-rubber, with both teams already through to the knockout stages. Speaking at the halfway stage, an emotional Kohli said: ‘I feel very blessed, very grateful right now. The last two and a half years have taught me a lot. ‘I have put a lot of things in perspective and, actually, I was a bit shocked because this was the format I least expected a century to come in any time soon. Kohli smashed 122 not out off 61 balls (Picture: Getty) ‘I have been working hard and this was just a moment which was very special for me and the team as well.’ Kohli kissed his wedding ring after reaching his long-awaited hundred and added: ‘I’m standing here like this right now because things have been put into perspective and one person stood by me through all these difficult times, [his wife] Anushka [Sharma]. ‘This hundred is especially dedicated to her and our little daughter Vamika.’ Kohli was left out of multiple India tours before returning to the team for the Asia Cup. On his time away, Kohli said: ‘It taught me a lot of things, when I came back I wasn’t desperate. I was grateful for what God blessed me with. ‘People were talking about me not getting a hundred but I looked at how much he has given me already, so that really calmed me down, that relaxed me, I was just happy to come back. India crushed Afghanistan in the Asia Cup dead-rubber (Picture: Getty) ‘I understood after taking a break how tired I actually was mentally and physically. I think it was a blessing in disguise for me. ‘I wanted to be the best version of myself for the team, and when I came here, when I started playing in the nets, I felt like my old rhythm was coming back. It was just about getting those performances in the middle again.’ Asked how he intended to celebrate his 71st international century, Kohli added: ‘I’m going to turn 34 in November, so celebrations are a thing of the past!’ MORE : England v South Africa Test match suspended following Queen’s death MORE : Ben Stokes speaks out on Alex Hales England recall for T20 World Cup For more stories like this, check our sport page.

The course and practice facilities will be closed Friday. The England and Wales Cricket Board said Friday’s play in the second Test between England and South Africa at the Oval would not take place. Horse racing meetings in Britain were suspended on Thursday night and Friday, with the governing body wanting to “remember her extraordinary life and contribution to our sport and our nation.” Domestic rugby matches in England and Scotland were called off on Thursday and games will not be played over the weekend, either.

The English Football League, which runs the three divisions below the Premier League, called off its games that had been scheduled to be played Friday evening and said a decision would be made on Friday morning about weekend games after discussions with the British government and wider sport. Manchester United’s Europa League game against Real Sociedad did take place hours after the queen’s death was announced. There was a minute’s silence before kick-off at Old Trafford, with both teams wearing black armbands and the flags at stadium lowered to half-staff as a sign of respect.

Brazil soccer great Pele tweeted about his admiration for the queen ever since meeting her in person in 1968 when she visited the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro. “Her deeds have marked generations,” Pele wrote. “This legacy will last forever.” The All England Club, home of the Wimbledon tennis tournament, said the queen undertook her duties “with great wisdom, dignity and charm for 70 years.” The Queen was the royal patron of the Welsh Rugby Union, which thanked her for “years of service on this profoundly sad day.” AP Sports news, results and expert commentary.

British horse racing chiefs also suspended events after the death of the British monarch, who showed an intense passion for the sport throughout her life. Here is a rundown on which sports are still going ahead after the tragic news. FOOTBALL Wednesday morning’s Europa League games involving Manchester United and West Ham United went ahead, with a minute’s silence held at both Old Trafford and London Stadium. As for this weekend’s English Premier League games, Mail Sport reports that clubs are “almost certain” that games will be postponed. The Premier League said it was “deeply saddened” by the queen’s death. The EFL said in a statement that “fixtures will be discussed with the Government and the wider sport sector during the period ahead and an appropriate announcement will be made at the earliest opportunity.” GOLF Play in the opening round of the European PGA Championship has been suspended and there will be no play at all on Friday following the death of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, organisers said Thursday. The death of the 96-year-old sovereign, the longest-serving monarch in British history, was announced while Thursday’s first round of the European Tour’s flagship event was still in progress at the Wentworth course, southwest of London. “Out of respect for Her Majesty and the Royal Family, play has been suspended at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth Club for the remainder of Thursday and flags at Wentworth Club will be lowered to half-mast,” said a European tour statement. “Furthermore, no play will take place at the BMW PGA Championship on Friday and the golf course and practice facilities will be closed. “Further updates on the resumption of play will be provided in due course.” England’s Andy Sullivan and Tommy Fleetwood, together with Norway’s Viktor Hovland, were the joint clubhouse leaders at eight under par, after the trio all shot rounds of 64, when play was suspended. The tournament had been taking place against the backdrop of the bitter civil war in golf sparked by the creation of the ‘rebel’ LIV Tour. Several players from the Saudi-backed LIV series are competing at Wentworth this week, a decision four-time major champion Rory McIlroy, who has remained loyal to the established European and US PGA tours, said he found “hard to stomach”. McIlroy shot 68 on Thursday. CRICKET Elsewhere, cricket chiefs announced that Friday’s play between England and South Africa in the third Test at the Oval would not take place following the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said in a statement that updates would be “provided in due course”. Wednesday’s first day in London was washed out without a ball bowled. The three-match series is locked at 1-1. “Following the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Friday’s play between England and South Africa Men at The Oval, along with all scheduled matches in the (women’s domestic) Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, will not take place,” said an ECB statement. “For fixtures beyond Friday, updates will be provided in due course.” TENNIS The US Open will go ahead as planned on Friday, with the tournament instead paying tribute to Queen Elizabeth II with a moment silence and photo montage ahead of the first women’s semi-final. A message on Twitter from Wimbledon, where the queen previously served as a patron, read: “We wish to convey our deepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences to The Royal Family on the sad passing of Her Majesty The Queen.” FORMULA 1 The Italian Grand Prix will also go ahead as planned at this stage, with Formula 1 president and CEO Stefano Domenicali saying: “Formula 1 sends its deepest condolences to the Royal Family and to the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.” HORSE RACING The British Horseracing Authority said the sport was in mourning. “Her Majesty has been one of the greatest and most influential supporters in the history of horseracing,” the BHA said. “Her passion for racing and the racehorse shone brightly throughout her life”. The BHA’s statement added: “It is right, therefore, that all racing is suspended for today and tomorrow as we begin to grieve Her Majesty’s passing and remember her extraordinary life and contribution to our sport and our nation.”","pubDate":"2022-09-08 20:41:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sporting events cancelled after Queen Elizabeth dies","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/others/2022/09/09/sporting-events-cancelled-after-queen-elizabeth-dies","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - The world of sport reacted to the death of Queen Elizabeth on Thursday with a raft of cancellations across cricket, golf and rugby, while others paid tribute by holding a minute's silence.

The queen, Britain's longest-reigning monarch and a towering presence on the world stage for seven decades, died peacefully at her home in Scotland aged 96. The second day of the third and deciding cricket test between England and South Africa at the Oval on Friday was suspended as a mark of respect, while matches in the domestic Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy were called off. At Wentworth, which is hosting the BMW PGA golf Championship, the flagship event of Europe's DP World Tour, play was suspended on Thursday, with organisers later cancelling Friday's second round. \"She was truly an inspiration to people the world over ... no play will take place at the BMW PGA Championship on Friday and the golf course and practice facilities will be closed,\" the Tour said in a statement. Peter Forster, captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club, said the queen's 70-year patronage was a \"great honour\". \"Following her accession in 1952, Her late Majesty graciously accepted the Patronage of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews ... although not a golfer, Her late Majesty's 70-year patronage of the club was a great honour for its members,\" said Forster. Saracens' game against Northampton Saints in the Premiership Rugby Cup later on Thursday was postponed while Scottish Rugby has suspended all domestic watches this weekend. The British Horseracing Authority has also suspended all events for two days. A minute's silence was observed before Europa League soccer games featuring British teams on Thursday, while the U.S. Open tennis championships and motor racing's Formula One will also hold a period of silence. World Athletics president Sebastian Coe hailed the queen for her role in the successful staging of the 2012 London Olympics. \"In the most demanding of roles, she has shown exceptional leadership, grace, wisdom and fortitude, touching us across the full fabric of society, including sport,\" said Coe. \"I will never forget her total commitment to the success of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\" (Reporting by Dhruv Munjal in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris)","pubDate":"2022-09-08 20:35:00","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/09/09/1730194.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my","country":["malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"From handing World Cup to Bobby Moore to London 2012 ‘parachuting’, The Queen added grandeur to iconic sporting moments","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/19752468/the-queen-world-cup-london-2012-iconic-sporting-moments/","keywords":["Sport","Horse racing","London Olympics 2012","Royal Family","World Cup Features"],"creator":["Dave Kidd"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"SHE handed the Jules Rimet Trophy to Bobby Moore, she “parachuted” out of a helicopter at the London Olympics opening ceremony and she refused Dennis Lillee an autograph at an Australia v England Test match.

A decade ago, The Queen stole the show in Danny Boyle’s 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, where Daniel Craig — as James Bond — was seen arriving at Buckingham Palace to escort the monarch into a chopper. Her Majesty delivered the line “Good evening, Mr Bond” before her stunt double was seen leaping out of the aircraft over the stadium in Stratford, before The Queen herself arrived to take her seat, with the Duke of Edinburgh alongside her. This sketch — kept secret even from the rest of the Royal family — was a key part of a ceremony, widely regarded as a triumph, which led to a golden summer for British sport.

In recent years, her grandson Prince William — the President of the FA and a keen Aston Villa fan — has usually done the honours at English domestic football’s showpiece event. Her Majesty never revealed any footballing allegiances. West Ham fans believed she was one of their own, although Prince Philip denied it when asked by Hammers co-owner Karren Brady, and Cesc Fabregas once claimed she had admitted to supporting Arsenal. The Queen was a regular at Lord’s Test matches throughout the majority of her reign, attending 26 of them, with her husband Prince Philip an avid cricket fan, a keen player in his youth and a former MCC president. England and the visiting team usually lined up on the outfield to shake hands with Her Majesty during the tea interval, before sending her off with three “hip, hip hoorays”. But during the 1977 Centenary Test between Australia and England in Melbourne, Aussie fast bowler Lillee broke with protocol to ask The Queen for her autograph — even having pen and paper handy. The monarch politely declined, although a signed photo was sent to Lillee days later. Despite Wimbledon’s regal feel and its proximity to Buckingham Palace, The Queen was not a tennis fan — only ever attending the Championships on four occasions. But these occasional visits did include the 1977 ladies’ singles final, when Virginia Wade became the most recent British woman to win the title. Despite her relative lack of interest in most mainstream sports, The Queen was a devoted attendee of the Highland Games at Braemar — held close to Balmoral Castle during her regular summer stay there — where she is said to have genuinely enjoyed the caber-tossing and tug-of-war. The Commonwealth Games were also close to her heart, as a symbol of the group of nations — mainly former British Empire colonies — of which she was the Head. But horse racing was by far and away The Queen’s favourite sport and although her racing manager John Warren described her as a “small fish in a huge pond” and “very much a second division owner”, her horses won four of the five English classics Only The Derby eluded Her Majesty — although in 2011 her horse, Carlton House, went in as favourite only to lose a shoe on the Epsom Downs and ended up finishing third. Warren insisted The Queen read the Racing Post every morning and watched recordings from Channel 4 Racing and the Racing Channel most evenings. While her attendances at other sporting events understandably became less frequent during her latter years, Royal Ascot remained one of her favourite occasions of the year. The “sport of kings” was very much the sport of The Queen — but her attendance at many other major events added extra grandeur.

It read: \"The Premier League is deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Her Majesty The Queen, Elizabeth II. \"Our thoughts and condolences are with The Royal Family and everyone around the world mourning the loss of Her Majesty.\" The Government is not planning to enforce a shutdown in sport as the UK enters 10 days of national mourning following the passing of the longest-reigning Sovereign in British history.

It was his first international ton since November 2019. After the Indian innings ended, Kohli headed back to the dressing room. His teammates lauded him for his knock and shook his hand. Interestingly, during those moments, Virat Kohli told Bhuvneshwar Kumar : You can watch the video below: Kohli played one of the best innings in T20I cricket history. The 33-year-old shattered multiple records en route to his 122 off 61 balls. His knock comprised 12 fours and six sixes. Eventually, the entire Afghanistan team failed to match Kohli's score, finishing with 111/8 in 20 overs. They played 60 more balls than Kohli but could not better his score.

The former India skipper finally found his 71st international century, a feat that also made him the top scorer for India in T20 Internationals.As much as the century was a treat in sheer class and confidence, much akin to the Kohli we had come to see, it was also an inning that will surely once more throw up questions about where in the Indian batting order should Kohli be. The noise to promote him as an opener will now just get louder.Kohli did come in as opener in this last Super 4 match of the tournament for both sides, since skipper Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, and Yuzvendra Chahal were rested to bring in Dinesh Karthik, Axar Patel, and Deepak Chahar. As Kohli and stand-in skipper KL Rahul were sent in to bat, several things came up as a stark difference from what has been India’s approach till now.For once, neither batter was in any mad rush to go after the bowling. In contrast, they were sedate. But neither missed an opportunity to score. Quite a stark contrast from the manner in which India had been going after the bowling in the Asia Cup till now.The milestone we’d all been waiting for and here it is!71st International Century for @imVkohli 🔥💥#AsiaCup2022 #INDvAFGpic.twitter.com/hnjA953zg9— BCCI (@BCCI) September 8, 2022Kohli was in his zone from the beginning. One dropped catch at the long-on fence aside, he was spotless. What made things more noticeable was how completely at ease Kohli looked.There were no shouts of dismay at missing an easy chance to score, nor were there any frowns or muttered curses.But none of that took away from the sheer class of a Virat Kohli in full flow. He was finding the gaps with his rapier-like blade and almost all of his six sixes were clean and assured.The running between the wickets was also top-notch as always. The Afghan bowlers didn’t really know where to deliver when Kohli, and also Rahul, were at the crease.Two quick dismissals of Rahul (after 119 runs for the opening wicket) and Suryakumar Yadav – six runs later – did not change anything for Kohli, who also managed to radiate his confidence to Rishabh Pant, who has been anything but poised through the tournament.Eventually, when the century came, Virat Kohli did not jump in the air, he did not punch it, nor were there any loud exultations. He simply took off his helmet, and smiled.Read: ‘This hundred is for Anushka and for our little daughter Vamika’: Virat Kohli dedicates 71st century to his familyIt was a smile of sheer joy, relief, and contentment. Here was a man who was happy with who he had become, how he had faced his demons and had come to realise what and who were more important in his life. It was a celebration of the sheer joy for a man who had met his difficulties and overcome them. He was a man who had attained moksha.The runs, despite the near-serene mindset, came at a blazing pace. 122 not out off just 61 deliveries, a strike rate of 200 with six 6s and 12 boundaries.That was Kohli the man. Kohli the cricketer, on the other hand, will now send the Indian think-tank scurrying. The thought process of the Indian team does not see Kohli as an opener, irrespective of how he bats. But the current duo of Sharma and Rahul have not really been too convincing. Both have this tendency to go for the runs, but without sticking around too long.Up the order, Kohli gets that much more time to play. Even at one-drop, he has more often than not been the backbone of the Indian batting.But the problem that lies with India is that Sharma cannot be played anywhere but as an opener. He is the kind of batter who needs the space that the first six overs of the Powerplay provide and surely, he is not half the runner between the wickets that Kohli is. So, as things stand, Sharma can’t be budged from that position.Watch: Virat Kohli says ‘Abhi hai cricket baaki,’ after smashing his 71st international centuryTo be fair, it may now be too late to make any radical changes from what the Indian side will eventually look like, in terms of personnel or batting order. So, one can only hope that the other top batters too find their mojo.But Thursday night belonged to Kohli. Even as India wrapped up a facile win over Afghanistan, any questions about him and his mindset have hopefully now been consigned to the dustbin where they belong. Here was a man who had just rediscovered himself, and may have surprises in store for all. Even for himself.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

During the penultimate match of the ongoing ‘Super 4’ stage of the Asia Cup 2022 between India and Afghanistan at the Dubai International Stadium, a maiden T20I century from Virat Kohli and an economical five-wicket haul from Bhuvneshwar Kumar (4-1-4-5), paved the way for a massive victory – by 101 runs for team India, in what was a dead rubber with both the teams already crashed out of the tournament. However, the Indian Cricket fans in general, and Kohli fans in particular were blessed with a visual spectacle of the highest order, which perhaps did manage to somewhat brush off their team’s performance in the Asia Cup under the carpet for a night, as the 33-year-old not only ended his century drought, but did it with a maiden T20I century of the highest order. Kohli brought up his ton in mere 53 balls, and went on to eventually amass 122* (61) under his name, with the help of 12 Fours and 6 Sixes, at a strike rate of 200. His 119-run first-wicket stand alongside KL Rahul (62 off 41), ultimately helped team India post a massive total of 212/2 in their 20 Overs. Post smashing his century and treading all the way back towards his team dug-out, Kohli acknowledged the praises and congratulatory words from his fellow teammates, who were standing near the boundary cushion to greet their former captain. Post meeting the likes of Hardik Pandya, Yuzvendra Chahal, and head coach Rahul Dravid, Kohli finally shook Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s hands and exclaimed, “Abhi hai Cricket baaki (There is Cricket left in me).” While one cannot ascertain the context in which Kohli spoke those words, it perhaps had to do with the people commenting negatively on Virat’s remaining Cricketing career, after going through a rare, extended slump in batting form for quite some months now.

On Thursday, however, Kumar used the best of the conditions for the five-wicket spell, which came right after Virat Kohli set the stage on fire by ending his prolonged wait for a 71st international century (122 not out). His ton took Rohit Sharma-less India to a mammoth 212/2 in the first innings of the dead rubber.“It was my day as I was getting the wickets (in the powerplay). If you look at the white ball it doesn’t swing much, but it did swing a lot today. I think wherever I was bowling, I was getting wickets,” Kumar said at the post-match presentation ceremony.When asked about what went wrong in the last two games against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Kumar said there wasn’t much help on the offer for the bowlers.“If you look at those two matches – one against Pakistan and the other one against Sri Lanka, there wasn’t much swing. It’s quite unpredictable with the white ball,” he said.The match also saw Deepak Chahar find space in the line-up as he was added to the squad in place of Avesh Khan earlier today.“Chahar is coming off an injury, but he can also swing the ball both ways, he will need some time.

Their innings ended at 111 for eight in 20 overs.However, the night belonged to Kohli who warmed a billion hearts with a special innings.His unbeaten effort off 61 balls got him his first hundred since November 2019 and 71st overall, equalling Ricky Ponting's tally of international centuries. He is now only behind Sachin Tendulkar in the all-time list. It was also Kohli's maiden ton in the shortest format.With Rohit Sharma being rested for India's final game of the tournament, stand-in skipper K L Rahul (62 off 41) and Kohli shared an entertaining 119 off 76 balls for the opening wicket.Kohli started toying with the field and bowlers towards the end of the innings, enough indication that he was back to his best. The knock from Rahul was his most confident one ever since he came back from injury.The openers played brilliantly against the spinners, including Rashid Khan (0-33), an area they needed to address heading into the T20 World Cup.It was vintage Kohli on display as he stepped out to the spinners, pierced the field perfectly and even played a rare sweep shot.That sweep shot came in the sixth over bowled by Mujeeb Ur Rehman. The next ball he came down the track to hit a straight six.The former India captain also got lucky on his way to a memorable hundred as he was dropped in the deep off Mohammad Nabi in the eight over.With India at 87 for no loss in 10 overs and Kohli on song, India looked set for a massive total.It was raining boundaries in the last five overs as Kohli reached the elusive three figure mark with a crisp pull shot off pacer Fareed Ahmed. He took his helmet off, hugged his teammate Rishabh Pant and smiled in disbelief before kissing his necklace as part of his celebration.He ended the innings in style by smashing two sixes and a four off Fazalhaq Farooqi to push India past 200. The disdain with which he hammered the bowlers and his nimble feet movement showed 'King Kohli' was well and truly back.Another stroke that displayed Kohli's supreme confidence was when he stepped out to loft the wily Rashid for a maximum over deep midwicket.Kohli is no stranger to the opening position and after his sensational effort, the case for keeping him at the top alongside Rohit has also been opened.It was a clinical display from India in their final game of the Super 4s but their pre-mature exit from another multi-team tournament has raised more questions ahead of the T20 World Cup starting next month.India's constant chopping and changing in the playing eleven and lack of bowling depth hurt them in the continental event.With the series against Australia and South Africa lined up before the ICC event Down Under, the Indian think tank has a lot left to do.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-08 17:39:29","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/9/2022_9$largeimg_418515637.JPG","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Abhi hai cricket baaki’, says Virat Kohli after smashing his international 71st century in Asia Cup 2022; Watch","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/abhi-hai-cricket-baaki-says-virat-kohli-after-smashing-his-international-71st-century-in-asia-cup-2022-watch-11213831.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"‘Abhi hai cricket baaki’, says Virat Kohli after smashing his international 71st century in Asia Cup 2022; Watch","content":"Virat Kohli was ecstatic after he brought up his 71st international century and said that he has a lot of cricket left in him after the completion of India’s innings against Afghanistan at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday.Kohli scored a massive 122 off 61 deliveries, scoring at a strike rate of 200 and surpassing Rohit Sharma’s 117 to become the highest scorer for India in a T20I innings.After the Indian innings, team members including Batting Coach Vikram Rathore, Head Coach Rahul Dravid, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Hardik Pandya, Yuzvendra Chahal, and others came out to the field to greet Kohli for his achievement.The players congratulated him and hugged him as the master was back to his best, hitting a century after more than 1000 days.While Bhuvi greeted him, he said “abhi hai cricket baaki.”Watch the video here:Kohli saying “Abhi hai cricket baaki” to Bhuvi ❤️😭 pic.twitter.com/S4QZLDfLRF— Rohan (@RoroBoro98) September 8, 2022Kohli dedicated his century to his family – wife Anushka Sharma and daughter Vamika and also kissed his ring while celebrating the century.India beat Afghanistan by 101 runs as they were restricted to 111/8 while chasing after India put up a mammoth 212 on the scoreboard.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

During the 11th match of the ongoing 15th edition of the Asia Cup between India and Afghanistan in Dubai, India beat Afghanistan by 101 runs in a dead-rubber to avoid a last-position finish at the Super 4 points table. Chasing a 213-run target, Afghanistan perhaps struggled to counter fatigue of playing back-to-back matches in different cities before countering India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar. As a result, all Afghanistan managed was 111/8 in 20 overs crossing the 100-run mark only because of veteran India wicket-keeper batter Dinesh Karthik conceding 18 runs in his first over in international cricket. A maiden T20I half-century at a strike rate of 108.47 for Afghanistan batter Ibrahim Zadran (64*) might have given him some confidence but did no good for the team. A second T20I five-wicket haul for Kumar saw him picking career-best bowling figures of 4-1-4-5. Regaining his knack after two dismal performances at the same venue, Kumar was able to swing the new ball at will reducing the opposition to 9/4 in three overs. Only the fifth T20I five-wicket haul among Indian bowlers, Kumar picked the 14th best T20I bowling figures among all bowlers. An economy rate of 1 witnessed Kumar registering the joint eighth-best economy rate in this format. A tad bit unlucky to not win the Player of the Match award in spite of a magnificent spell, Kumar lost the match award to former captain Virat Kohli. Opening the batting only for the ninth time in his 96th T20I innings, Kohli brought a sigh for relief to a million of Indians after scoring a long-awaited 71st international century . Having scored 122* (61) with the help of 12 fours and six sixes at a strike rate of 200, Kohli made the most of a 119-run opening partnership alongside captain KL Rahul (62) to power India to 212/2 in 20 overs.

The brilliant spell came right after Virat Kohli set the stage on fire by ending his prolonged wait for a 71st international century (122 not out) to take Rohit Sharma-less India to a mammoth 212/2 in the first innings of the dead rubber.Making most of the pressure of the huge target, Kumar sprung into action with the new ball as he picked two wickets in the first over of the second innings. Hazratullah Zazai (0 run off 4 balls) was the first to fall prey to the pacer, who caught him plum lbw with a length delivery around the middle and leg stump. A ball later, Zazai’s partner Rahmanullah Gurbaz fell for a first-ball nought too as the pacer castled from the length.Kumar’s menacing run continued in the second over as well with two more scalps. Karim Janat (2) was the pacer’s next victim as Kumar’s back of a length delivery outside the off stump swung away from the batter before taking an outside edge to Kohli at first slip.Najibullah Zadran tried to resist Kumar’s wrath but could only last two balls in front of him as Kumar castled him for a duck in the same over to leave Afghans stuttering at 9/4 by the end of the third over. Kumar bowled it full and swung it in to beat Najibullah’s flick.Kumar came close to taking another wicket (could have been his sixth of the night) in his third over when he made a loud lbw appeal for Mohammad Nabi but the umpire turned it down. A DRS review also couldn’t overturn the decision as the impact was just outside the off stump.His fifth wicket eventually came in his final over in Azmatullah Omarzai, who chipped a slow knuckleball straight to Dinesh Karthik at cover. Kumar also finished the over without a giving a run as his spell at the end of the over read 4-1-4-5. At the time, Afghans were reeling at 21/6 in 7 overs as Arshdeep Singh removed Mohammad Nabi (7) an over ago.India eventually won the match by 101 runs as their opponents managed to play the 20 overs with 111/8 on the board. Ibrahim Zadran’s 59-ball 64 not ensured Afghans has one less embarrassment for the night.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
