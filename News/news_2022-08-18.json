The first day of the first Test of South Africa’s tour of England 2022 at Lord’s was dominated by visiting pacers before weather took the onus of domination upon itself to wash out almost a couple of sessions. A four-member pace attack reduced the hosts to 116/6 in 32 overs after inviting them to bat first. Had it not been for batter Ollie Pope’s eighth Test half-century, England were in store for a proper batting collapse in the first session of a Test match. In what started with South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada making early inroads by dismissing English opening batters namely Alex Lees (5) and Zac Crawley (9), it was taken over by Anrich Nortje picking three all-important wickets of Jonny Bairstow (0), Ben Stokes (20) and Ben Foakes (6). In between Rabada and Nortje, left-armer Marco Jansen also made his presence felt on the back of finding former England captain Joe Root (8) in front of the stumps. Holding one end with utmost assurance, Pope scored four boundaries at a strike rate of 70.11 whilst watching his teammates struggling in front of him. While the morning session was expected to be washed out by rain on Day 1 at Lord’s, weather gods made some changes resulting in more damage in terms of loss of overs. In case you’re wondering which way the slope runs at Lord’s… #ENGvSA pic.twitter.com/EXkmcPYjsn — Melinda Farrell (@melindafarrell) August 17, 2022 If AccuWeather’s weather forecast for Day 2 is to be believed, it appears to be a far better day, at least on paper. The biggest upshot from observing the weather prediction for Thursday is that the rain probability is expected to remain in a single-digit figure throughout the day in London. Hence, a proper day of Test cricket without any major rain interruption wouldn’t be asking for too much. Even if rain forces players to return to their respective dressing rooms, the interruption shouldn’t be as long as it was on Wednesday. 11:00 AM – 20 degree (Rain Probability – 2%). 12:00 PM – 21 degree (Rain Probability – 2%). 01:00 PM – 22 degree (Rain Probability – 3%). 02:00 PM – 23 degree (Rain Probability – 4%). 03:00 PM – 24 degree (Rain Probability – 4%). 04:00 PM – 24 degree (Rain Probability – 4%). 05:00 PM – 24 degree (Rain Probability – 6%). 06:00 PM – 24 degree (Rain Probability – 6%). 06:00 PM – 24 degree (Rain Probability – 6%).","pubDate":"2022-08-17 21:05:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Labuschagne ready to ‘sink teeth’ into fatherhood and cricket","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/big-bash-news-cricket-about-to-take-back-seat-for-fathertobe-marnus-labuschagne-as-he-signs-on-with-brisbane-heat/news-story/7b2c2116deb31297d6f27d7b9372f4fe","keywords":["Big Bash News","Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Big Bash and little feet will be themes of a life-changing summer for father-to-be Marnus Labuschagne.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-17 20:32:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Harare Sports Club records: Harare ODI records batting and bowling and highest innings total list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-harare-sports-club-records-harare-odi-records-batting-and-bowling-and-highest-innings-total-list/","keywords":["Cricket","India","India tour of Zimbabwe 2022","Zimbabwe"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Harare Sports Club records: Harare Sports Club has already hosted four international matches this month.

Followed categories will be added to My News. One day international matches were once the marquee event of the Australian home summer, but the 50-over format is slowly being wiped from the cricket calendar. The International Cricket Council unveiled the men’s Future Tours Programme on Wednesday afternoon AEST, detailing Australian fixtures over the next four-year cycle. According to the FTP, the Australian men’s team is scheduled to play 15 home ODI between July 2023 and June 2027 — less than four matches per season. Watch South Africa’s Tour of England. Every ODI & T20 Live & On-Demand on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > In the 2023/24 home summer, for example, the only ODI cricket the national men’s team will play is a three-match bilateral series against the West Indies. Earlier this century, the 15-match triangular ODI series was a celebrated feature of the Australian home summer, but the Big Bash League’s popularity has dominated the January window since its inauguration in 2011. It serves as another example of why the 50-over format is slowly losing its relevance in the sport — last month, England captain Ben Stokes announced his retirement from ODI cricket at 31. “Three formats are just unsustainable for me now,” he wrote on Instagram. “Not only do I feel that my body is letting me down because of the schedule and what is expected of us, but I also feel that I am taking the place of another player who can give their all.” Speaking to reporters last month, Australian batter Usman Khawaja argued the other two formats were slowly overshadowing one-day cricket . “Fifty-over cricket is probably the toughest on the body … you ask any cricketer, 50-over cricket is very tough work,” he explained. “You’ve got Test cricket, which is the pinnacle, you’ve got T20 cricket which obviously has leagues around the world, great entertainment, everyone loves it, and then there’s one-day cricket, and I feel like that’s probably the third ranked out of all of them. “I think personally one-day cricket is dying a slow death, but at the end of the day, there’s still one-day cricket to be had. There’s still the World Cup, which I think is really fun and enjoyable to watch. “Other than that, I’m probably not into one-day cricket much either. “Something has to give, because you can’t have all three formats all together playing all the games; you’re going to have to decide and choose. “I don’t know how it’s going to go. I think T20 cricket’s here to stay definitely, Test cricket’s here to stay definitely. But what happens to one-day cricket?” Pat Cummins of Australia. Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images The FTP also confirmed the blockbuster Border-Gavaskar Trophy between Australia and India will be become a five-Test affair, with the Aussies next hosting their fierce subcontinent rivals in 2024/25. The Australian men’s team has fixtures scheduled across all three formats against both England and India every playing year between now and the 2026/27 season. Cricket Australia has also pushed for a clearer window in January, so international-quality talent will be available for the BBL. Meanwhile, the national women’s side will have a home Test match scheduled every summer between 2023/24 and 2025/26, facing South Africa, England and India. The Aussie women’s team will also host England for a stand-alone multi-format Ashes series in January 2025. “We are delighted to have secured extensive high-quality content across both the women’s and men’s programs in a schedule that encompasses many of our key priorities for Australian Cricket,” Peter Roach, Cricket Australia’s Head of Cricket Operations and Scheduling, said in a statement. “In addition to our ICC mandated World Test Championship (men’s) and ODI (women’s) opponents, the increase to a reciprocal five Test Border-Gavaskar series is a significant milestone and will greatly enhance the enduring rivalry and respect that exists between the Australian and Indian men’s teams. “Our world champion women’s team have produced epic encounters against both India and England in recent years and to lock in multiple home and away series, including a stand-alone women’s Ashes in 2025, is a terrific outcome. “We recognise our responsibilities to the game globally and the positive impact we can have on emerging markets and feel this schedule also supports those goals. “Importantly, most of our home content will remain in our traditional window for both men and women, including a largely uninterrupted international window for the WBBL and greater flexibility for Australian players to participate in the BBL.” Australia's Patrick Cummins celebrates with teammates.

Failing to do so, the two teams will now meet in a three-match ODI series. Readers must note that it is going to be the 10th bilateral ODI series (seventh in Zimbabwe) between Zimbabwe and India. A stupendous record sees India having an 8-1 series lead to their name when it comes to this format against this opposition.

With their solitary bilateral ODI series victory against India coming way back in 1997, the hosts have a lot of scope for improvement and a lot to play for in this series.

The first ODI of India’s tour of Zimbabwe 2022 will be played in Harare tomorrow. The first of a three-match series will resume international cricket between these two teams after six years. The last Zimbabwe-India ODI was also played at the Harare Sports Club when India had chased a 124-run target in the 22nd over with all their 10 wickets intact. In what was also a second-string Indian team despite playing under former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the visitors had registered a 3-0 series victory. In some form on the back of remaining unbeaten in ICC T20 World Cup 2022 Qualifier and defeating Bangladesh in both white-ball formats, Zimbabwe wouldn’t have had a better preparation before hosting India. ALSO READ: India Playing 11 for 1st ODI vs Zimbabwe in Harare India, on the other hand, will continue to take the field as a dominating force in spite of missing several first-choice players. Leading India for the second time in this format, KL Rahul will have all the eyes on him in what will be his first match in representative cricket since Indian Premier League 2022.

Most sought-after team commercially, the ‘Men In Blue’ will play 38 Tests, 42 ODIs and 61 T20Is in the five-year period and focus on shortest format is an indicator how priorities across formats will be changing. The ODI bilaterals will remain but mostly be three-match series. India expectedly has a choc-a-bloc calender but as usual there won’t be any bilateral cricket series with Pakistan due to obvious political reasons. The 12 Members will play a total of 777 international matches – 173 Tests, 281 ODIs and 323 T20Is – in the 2023-2027 FTP cycle compared to the 694 in the current one. This includes the next two cycles of the ICC Men’s World Test Championship, multiple ICC events and a host of bilateral as well as tri-series action. As far as India’s schedule is concerned, the traditional India versus Australia Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, that used to be a four-match affair for a long time will become five-Test series. India will be playing five-Test series against both England and Australia and also on the T20 front, there are a lot of five-match series which is on expected lines with the broadcasters demand with premium advertisement rates for short-form matches. During the next FTP cycle, India would be travelling to West Indies (July-Aug 2023) for a full tri-format series including 2 Tests, 3 ODIs and 3 T20Is. The marquee five-Test home series against England will be tentatively held between Jan-March in 2024. While Australia is visiting India early next year to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in a four-Test series as a part of previous cycle, India’s next big trip Down Under is in December-January, 2024-25 when they play Australia in a five-Test series for the first time since 1991. In this cycle, India will host Bangladesh for a two-Test series in September 2024.   India to get 27 ODIs before ’23 ODI WC starting with Zimbabwe series —————————————————————————– The Indian team will play 27 ODI games before it plays the 2023 50-over World Cup in India scheduled in October-November next year. The 27 ODIs starts with India’s series against Zimbabwe in Harare from Thursday. The chunk among the 27 ODIs is from the previous FTP cycle which also include home three-match series against South Africa and an away three-match event against New Zealand just after T20 World Cup.   Australia and England to play 40 and 43 Tests respectively —————————————————————- Australia and England during the same five-year phase will be playing 40 and 43 test matches respectively, which is a few games more than India. The inaugural World Test Champions New Zealand in the next cycle have 32 Tests earmarked, while South Africa in the same duration play only 29 Tests. They mostly play two and some three-Test series. Pakistan have only 27 Tests between May, ’23-April ’27 while Sri Lanka and West Indies play 25 longest format games each respectively.

While Tendulkar went on to become a cricketing legend, Kambli's career was cut short by a series of failures.","content":"Former Indian cricketer Vinod Kambli opened up on his financial struggles for the first time as he reached out for job via an interview. In a conversation with an English daily, Kambli said that he and his family are surviving only of a BCCI pension, which is not enough. He says that he has seeked helped from Mumbai Cricket Association in the past as well. He was earlier employed as a coach at Sachin Tendulkar's academy in Nerul but he had to travel very far for this. \"I am a retired cricketer, who is completely dependent on the pension from the BCCI. My only payment [source of income] at the moment is from the Board, for which I am really thankful and grateful. It takes care of my family,\" Kambli said. The 50-year-old said that he is on a look out for a job in cricket. He wants to work with the youngsters and is ready to serve Mumbai cricket in any capacity. \"I know Mumbai have retained Amol [Muzumdar] as their head coach, but if anywhere I am needed, I am there. We have played together and we were a great team. That’s what I want them [current Mumbai team] to do…to play as a team. I was seeking help from the MCA [Mumbai Cricket Association]. I came into the CIC [Cricket Improvement Committee], but it was an honorary job. I went to the MCA for some help. I have a family to look after. I told the MCA many times that if you require me, I am there whether it is at the Wankhede Stadium or at BKC. Mumbai cricket has given me a lot. I owe my life to this game,\" said Kambli. When asked whether Sachin has come forward to help him, he said, \"He knows everything, but I am not expecting anything from him. He gave me the TMGA (Tendulkar Middlesex Global Academy) assignment. I was very happy. He has been a very good friend. He has always been there for me,” Kambli said. Kambli and Sachin burst on to the cricket scene together. While Tendulkar went on to become a cricketing legend, Kambli's career was cut short by a series of failures. Kambli made his international debut in an ODI vs Pakistan at Sharjah Cricket Stadium in 1991. He played his first Test vs England in 1993 at Eden Gardens. In his international career that lasted a total of 9 years, he played 104 ODIs and 17 Tests, scoring 1084 and 2477 runs each in two formats.","pubDate":"2022-08-17 13:35:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Men's FTP '23-'27: India to play 38 Tests, 42 ODIs; no series vs Pakistan","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/men-s-ftp-23-27-india-to-play-38-tests-42-odis-no-series-vs-pakistan-122081701045_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India expectedly has a choc-a-bloc calender but as usual there won't be any bilateral cricket series with Pakistan due to obvious political reasons.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-17 13:28:00","image_url":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1220817/thumb-122081701045.jpg","source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sir Andrew Strauss hopes review will make English game ‘cleaner and more simple’","link":"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/sir-andrew-strauss-hopes-review-will-make-english-game-cleaner-and-more-simple-41918489.html","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sir Andrew Strauss hopes his performance review of English cricket can help make the domestic game “a little bit cleaner and more simple” and called for the buy-in of the 18 first-class counties.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-17 13:12:42","image_url":"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/80de1/41918486.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/bpanews_68578b43-3229-469f-acbe-5c9323ec1aa0_1","source_id":"belfasttelegraph","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Make that a really good 2 hours”: Herschelle Gibbs celebrates South Africa’s bowling performance in Lord’s test against England","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-make-that-a-really-good-2-hours-herschelle-gibbs-celebrates-south-africas-bowling-performance-in-lords-test-against-england/","keywords":["Cricket","herschelle gibbs","South Africa tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former South African batter Herschelle Gibbs has lauded the performance of South African bowlers in the Lord’s test against England.

The Lord’s in England is hosting the first test of the 3-match series between England and South Africa. England’s performance has been great at home under the duo of Ben Stokes and Joe Root, but South African bowlers had other plans, and they just went through the top-order of the English side. Dean Elgar won the toss and opted to bowl first on a seaming track, and the pacers of the South African side took no time in proving the decision of their captain right. The Proteas went with four pacers in Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Marco Jansen and Lungi Ngidi. Kagiso Rabada was at his best, and he removed both openers of England at the team’s score of 25 runs. Marco Jansen took the all-important wicket of Joe Root, whereas Anrich Nortje removed the in-form Jonny Bairstow, who could not open his account. Ben Stokes also got out on Nortje’s delivery. Herschelle Gibbs celebrates South Africa’s bowling performance at Lord’s Former South African batter Herschelle Gibbs has appreciated the bowling efforts by the South African team in the first two hours of the game. Till Lunch on day 1, England managed to score 100 runs for the loss of 5 wickets. Gibbs called it a really good two hours for the South African bowlers. “Sorry Make that a really good 2hrs,” Herschelle Gibbs tweeted. Sorry Make that a really good 2hrs #ENGvSA #proteas — Herschelle Gibbs (@hershybru) August 17, 2022 Gibbs scored 8094 ODI runs, courtesy of 21 centuries, whereas he also has 6167 test runs under his belt. He was one of the best South African batters to play the game. During the 2008 U-19 World Cup, Virat Kohli called Herschelle Gibbs his favourite cricketer. Gibbs’ career most reckoning achievement has to be the moment when he became the first player in international cricket to hit six sixes in an over. He achieved the feat against the Netherlands in the 2007 World Cup in West Indies.

Pope is unbeaten on 51 and will resume in the afternoon session with Ben Foakes after England lost captain Ben Stokes with the final delivery before the interval. Stokes had looked to attack the bowling and reached 20 from 30 balls before he was caught by third slip Keegan Petersen off seamer Anrich Nortje (2-37). South Africa won the toss and elected to bowl under overcast skies, with Stokes conceding at the toss he would have done the same. It was perfect conditions for the tourists' venomous four-prong pace attack on a wicket that looks a little 'two-paced', with deliveries rising off a surprising length and making it difficult for the batsmen to feel confident of their strokeplay. Kagiso Rabada (2-26), who was an injury doubt going into the game, made an excellent start, dismissing both England openers cheaply to catches behind the wicket. Alex Lees (5) went too hard at a delivery just outside his off-stump and was caught comfortably by wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne, while Zak Crawley (9) edged Radaba to a diving Aiden Markram at second slip. Crawley now has single figures in eight of his last 11 test innings, with former England batsman Mark Butcher suggesting in Sky Sports coverage of the test that the selectors were \"cruel\" to keep playing him. Joe Root (8) scored a superb unbeaten century at Lord's earlier this summer but could not replicate that as he was trapped leg before wicket by left-arm seamer Marco Jansen, the in-swinging ball shown to be clipping the leg stump. Jonny Bairstow has also had a golden summer but he produced a shot to forget when he missed a straight delivery from Nortje and was bowled for a duck. The match is the first of three tests in the series, with matches to be played at Old Trafford (Aug. 25-29) and The Oval (Sept. 8-12).
