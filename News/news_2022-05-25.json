East Bengal are currently without investment after their association with Shree Cement Limited came to an end last month. The Kolkata club, who play in the country’s top flight, are believed to now be in a perilous position. Ganguly, who is the president of Board of Control for Cricket in India, speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, said: “Yes we have spoken to them and others also. “It will take 10 to 12 more days to know who will be the entity.” When asked whether United are coming as an investor, Ganguly clarified: “No no, as an owner.” Ganguly is helping the Glazer family to oversee the deal.

Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson batted superbly well in the recently concluded Indian Premier League 2022 Qualifier 1 against Gujarat Titans in Kolkata but there’s an aspect of captaincy which he has suffered majorly in this season. Coin toss, which is neither in his hands nor can be improved, continues to trouble Samson in IPL 2022. Having lost the toss in 13 out of 15 matches this season thus far, Samson has lost the most tosses in an IPL season. Addressing the same after failing to defend a 189-run target at the Eden Gardens tonight, Samson acknowledged that luck plays a role in T20s especially with respect to the toss. “Luck plays a huge role [in this format]. The toss plays a huge role. It all comes down to what you want to do. I think [what is] controllable is to just come back and play some expressive cricket. Hoping for a good result in the next game,” Samson told Star Sports. In spite of losing an early wicket after being asked to bat first, Rajasthan put on board a dominating 189/6 in 20 overs on the back of opening batter Jos Buttler (89) and Samson (47) contributing significantly. However, Royals were found on the wrong end of a David Miller finishing masterclass as the 32-year old player scored 68* (38) with the help of three fours and five sixes including three consecutive sixes when his team needed 16 runs in the final over. One more game, one more chance – the dream is still alive. 💗 #HallaBol | #RoyalsFamily pic.twitter.com/nDwV3GtlQC — Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) May 24, 2022 RR will now face the winner of IPL 2022 Eliminator in Qualifier 2 on Friday.","pubDate":"2022-05-24 20:25:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘If I had played those 11 months I would have crossed 10000 runs in Test cricket’ – Sehwag Open Talk","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/if-i-had-played-those-11-months-i-would-have-crossed-10000-runs-in-test-cricket-sehwag-open-talk/","keywords":["Sports","Cricket","India","Sehwag","Virender Sehwag"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai: Former Indian cricketer Sehwag has said that if he had played for the Indian Test team for those 11 months, he would have scored over 10,000 runs in Test cricket.

Sehwag is one of the action batsmen of the Indian team. He played international cricket for India from 1999 to 2013. He has played in a total of 374 international cricket matches. This includes 104 Test matches. He has scored 8586 runs in Test cricket alone. He holds the record for most runs scored in a single innings for India in Test cricket. In 2008, he scored 319 runs in a single innings against South Africa at the Chepauk Stadium in Chennai. This is the highest score by a single Indian batsman to date. In second place he is with 309 runs. Karun Nair is in third place with 303 runs. “If I had played those 11 months alone I would have definitely crossed 10000 runs in Test cricket. At times it hurts a lot,” Sehwag said. He has not been named in the Indian Test squad since January 2007. He was suffering in poor form. Exactly 11 months later, in the Test series against Australia in 2008, he got a chance in the Indian team. Sehwag, who made his Test debut for India in 2001, played until 2013. .","pubDate":"2022-05-24 20:05:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Miller blitz sends Gujarat to IPL final in debut season","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/05/25/cricket-miller-blitz-sends-gujarat-to-ipl-final-in-debut-season","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Gujarat Titans stormed into the final of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in their debut season after David Miller's blistering half-century secured a seven-wicket victory against Rajasthan Royals in Tuesday's qualifier in Kolkata. Read full story","content":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Gujarat Titans stormed into the final of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in their debut season after David Miller's blistering half-century secured a seven-wicket victory against Rajasthan Royals in Tuesday's qualifier in Kolkata. Needing 16 off the final over from Prasidh Krishna, Miller smashed three sixes in a row to book their place in Sunday's final on their home ground in Ahmedabad. South African Miller's unbeaten 68 off 38 balls earned him the man-of-the-match award. Inaugural champions Rajasthan can still make the final by beating the winners of Wednesday's eliminator between Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bangalore. Rajasthan posted a strong 188-6 after being put into bat at Eden Gardens. Jos Buttler, the tournament's leading scorer, had gone five innings without a fifty and the Englishman bounced back with a breezy 89. Buttler initially scored at a run-a-ball rate while skipper Sanju Samson smashed 47 off 26 balls at the other end. Buttler was on 43 when Gujarat captain Hardik Pandya slipped at long off trying to take a regulation catch. Buttler milked 46 off the subsequent 17 balls he faced and was eventually run out in the final delivery of the innings. Gujarat lost opener Wriddhiman Saha in the first over but Shubman Gill and Matthew Wade scored 35 each to keep their chase on track. Gill and Wade fell in quick succession but Pandya, who made an unbeaten 40, and Miller saw Gujarat home with a century stand for the unbroken fourth wicket. \"We wanted us to finish the game, that was the conversation in the middle,\" Pandya said after the win. \"When we started the tournament, I obviously wanted to win the tournament, it's a dream.\" Rajasthan captain Samson said batting got easy in the second innings. \"We'll come back stronger,\" Samson said. \"I think we've been playing some really good cricket throughout the tournament... we'll try to come back and play some good cricket.\" (Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; editing by Toby Davis)","pubDate":"2022-05-24 19:12:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thestar_my","country":["malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"David Miller IPL auction 2022: David Miller IPL 2022 price and IPL career","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-david-miller-ipl-auction-2022-david-miller-ipl-2022-price-and-ipl-career/","keywords":["Cricket","Gujarat Titans","IPL 2022","Rajasthan Royals","David Miller","GT","Indian Premier League","rajasthan royals","RR"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"David Miller IPL auction 2022 price: The South African batter played a match-winning knock in Indian Premier League Qualifier 1.

During Qualifier 1 of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Gujarat Titans and Rajasthan Royals in Kolkata, Gujarat Titans beat Rajasthan Royals by 7 wickets to qualify for the final in their inaugural season itself. Sealing a 189-run chase means that GT have registered a second-best IPL run-chase at the Eden Gardens and third-highest in an IPL playoff match. An unbeaten match-winning 106-run fourth-wicket partnership between captain Hardik Pandya (40*) and David Miller (68*) formed the fulcrum of Titans’ second-highest run chase. Needing 104 runs to win off 63 deliveries when Miller walked out to bat at No. 5, the left-handed batter was instrumental in hitting three fours and five sixes to win the match with three balls to spare. Requiring 30 runs off 14 balls, Miller hit RR spinner Yuzvendra Chahal for a six to not let a victory remain out of reach. Pacer Obed McCoy giving away only seven runs in the penultimate over resulted in Gujarat needing to score 16 runs in one over to win the match. It was at this point in time that Miller smashed Prasidh Krishna for three consecutive sixes to win the match in a stupendous fashion. Miller, who had registered himself for IPL 2022 mega auction in the price category of INR 1 crore, had remained unsold on the first day of the auction in Bengaluru earlier this year. It was on the second day that Miller invited interest from Rajasthan and Gujarat with the latter acquiring his services for INR 3 crore. In 104 IPL matches now, Miller has scored 2,423 runs at an average and strike rate of 36.16 and 137.35 respectively. In what was Miller’s 40th T20 half-century at the Eden Gardens tonight, it was his 12th in the IPL, third against RR, second for GT and at this venue.

During the ‘Qualifier 1’ fixture of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, the Gujarat Titans (GT) have blown away the Rajasthan Royals (RR) by 7 wickets, to advance towards the grand finale in what is their maiden season in the marquee league. En route the target of 189, the GT were handed a blow only on the second delivery of the chase, when the in-form Wriddhiman Saha, headed back to the pavilion at the score of naught. However, the chase got well on track as Matthew Wade (35 off 30) joined hands with Shubman Gill (35 off 21) to stitch together a 72-run stand for the second wicket in mere 42 deliveries. With 50 runs required off the last five Overs, the match clearly titled in favour of GT, with 7 wickets still in the bank. However, some clever use of variations by Trent Boult and Obed McCoy, meant that they did not hand their opposition that one big Over which was needed to seal the deal. Resultantly, the equation boiled down to 16 required off the final 6 deliveries. But, three back-to-back Sixes smashed by the in-form David Miller (68* off 38) off the first three deliveries bowled by Prasidh Krishna, meant that Gujarat had their flight tickets booked for the grand finale of IPL 2022 in front of their home crowd in Ahmedabad. All in all, the match-winning partnership of 106* runs off mere 60 deliveries between Miller and skipper Hardik Pandya (40* off 27) for the 4 th wicket, snatched victory from the RR clutches. David Miller hit those last 3 consecutive sixes and kept chewing his gum so nonchalantly like he was playing gully cricket and not an IPL semi final at a packed Eden Gardens. Great temperament & talent #IPL2022 — Viren Rasquinha (@virenrasquinha) May 24, 2022 A hard-to-swallow loss for sure for the RR on a challenging pitch to bat on, but the road is not over as yet for the Sanju Samson-led team in IPL 2022. They will get another shot at claiming a place in the grand finale, when they would face one of Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) or Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in ‘Qualifier 2’ on May 27, at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The winner of today’s ‘Eliminator’ match between RCB and LSG, would face RR next, as the latter would get one more chance to make it through to the final (on May 29), courtesy of finishing amongst the top-2 sides after the end of the league stage. Another loss in the ‘Eliminator’ as well, and RR would crash out of IPL 2022.","pubDate":"2022-05-24 18:27:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"GT vs RR Highlights, IPL 2022 Match Scorecard: Miller-Pandya Star As Gujarat Won By 7 Wickets - India.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMizAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2d0LXZzLXJyLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtaXBsLTIwMjItc2NvcmVjYXJkLXBsYXlvZmZzLXF1YWxpZmllci1lZGVuLWdhcmRlbnMta29sa2F0YS1ndWphcmF0LXdvbi1ieS03LXdpY2tldHMtZ3QtcmVhY2gtaXBsLTIwMjItZmluYWxzLXBhbmR5YS1kYXZpZC1taWxsZXItam9zLWJ1dHRsZXItcGFyYWctNTQxMDE4Mi_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"GT vs RR Highlights, IPL 2022 Match Scorecard: Miller-Pandya Star As Gujarat Won By 7 Wickets  India.comLive Cricket Score - GT vs RR, 1st Qualifier, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzT20 Time Out LIVE | Qualifier 1 - Gujarat vs Rajasthan  ESPNcricinfo‘You should simply play on your skills’ – Mohammed Shami plays down Jos Buttler scare ahead of Qualifier 1  CricTrackerGT vs RR Highlights IPL 2022 Qualifier 1: Miller, Pandya Star as Gujarat Titans Beat Rajasthan Royals to Enter Final  News18View Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-24 18:13:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 GT vs RR, HIGHLIGHTS, Qualifier 1: David Miller, Hardik Pandya power GT into IPL 2022 final","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/gt-vs-rr-qualifier-1-live-cricket-score-ipl-2022-match-scorecard-live-update-gujarat-titans-vs-rajasthan-royals-indian-premier-league-live-streaming-today-10708251.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022 GT vs RR, HIGHLIGHTS, Qualifier 1: David Miller, Hardik Pandya power GT into IPL 2022 final","content":"23:45 (IST)That's it from our side for the game.

Riyan Parag, and not Jos Buttler — who was batting on 80 at that point — was on strike. Parag dashed back for a brace in the first delivery after getting a thick leading edge, and got off strike the next ball with a single.Buttler then boosted his hopes of equalling Virat Kohli's record of four centuries in a single season with a six off the next delivery, clobbering the ball over long on. Dayal though, snuffed out those hopes with a fine comeback, bowling a dot off the fourth and conceding just two off the fifth.Buttler though, was caught well short of the crease at the striker's end in the fifth delivery while pushing for a second that was never on offer to begin with. Unfortunately for the Titans, Dayal had also overstepped in the delivery as the no-ball hooter went off.That was followed by even more drama in the following ball as Dayal bowled a wide, meaning the Free Hit got extended to the following delivery, but a breakdown in communication between Parag and new batter Ashwin resulted in both getting stranded at the striker's end, and the latter getting run out. Parag did give Ashwin a long, hard look before making his way back to the dugout, while his senior teammate chose to look away.Ashwin eventually closed out the Rajasthan innings with a brace off the last ball.Here's how Cricket Twitter reacted to some of the events in the final over: Ashwin's face, while looking at Parag... 😄— KSR (@KShriniwasRao) May 24, 2022 Parag not dancing. — Gaurav Sethi (@BoredCricket) May 24, 2022  What kind of comedy is this.— Himanish Ganjoo (@hganjoo153) May 24, 2022  Follow live updates on Qualifier 1 of IPL 2022 between GT and RR hereRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPl Live Score UpdateLatest IPL Schedule 2022, and , IPl 2022 Points tableEntertainment News here.

Samson struck a six off Yash Dayal off the first ball that he faced, and was on a roll thereafter as he single-handedly took on the Gujarat attack until he was dismissed in the 10th over.Buttler's cautious approach though, was beginning to hurt the Royals, whose run rate was below eight at the halfway mark despite the fireworks of Samson's bat. Padikkal, who came in after Samson's exit, did give RR a boost in the 14th over with a six and two consecutive fours off R Sai Kishore, but he was dismissed for 28 the very next over.Part of his cautious approach was the fact that the Royals were also looking to bat through Rashid Khan's overs without taking much risk. The Afghan leg-spinner bowled three straight overs after getting introduced right after the powerplay, as well as the 16th, and conceded just 15 from his quota in what was yet another stellar display.At the end of the 16th over, Buttler was batting on 39 off 38 deliveries, 14 of which were dot balls, and the pressure was starting to mount on Samson's men.The late burstButtler might have been patient for three-quarters of his stay at the crease, which might have led to a few angry posts on social media, he more than made up for it by teeing off in the slog overs, helping Rajasthan collect 61 off the next four and in the process, bringing up his fourth half-century of the season.Buttler smashed Dayal for four boundaries as 18 were plundered in the 17th over, and collected another three off Joseph in the following over. He would collect his first six of the innings in the final ball of the penultimate over, bowled by Shami, smashing the ball over long off, and would collect another three balls later off Dayal, by which time he was batting in the 80s and hoping to get as close to the three-figure mark as possible. Jos Buttler tonight:First 38 balls - 39 runs.Last 18 balls - 50 runs.- 89 (56) - What an acceleration by Jos The Boss, a fantastic innings on this pitch.Cometh the hour, cometh the man! pic.twitter.com/7e7bMbbTUd— Mufaddal Vohra (@mufaddal_vohra) May 24, 2022 Jos Buttler could have been out for 43 off 40 if Hardik Pandya hadn't slipped.

Had Hardik Pandya not slipped in front of the boundary rope at long off, Dayal would've bagged Buttler's wicket in the second ball of the 17th and who knows how many runs that would've saved for the Titans.Two balls later, he would collect a boundary after a misfield by Joseph at short third man and two overs later, would be dropped by Rashid at the midwicket region off Shami's bowling.He would eventually get run out off a no-ball in the final delivery while pushing for a non-existent second.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPl Live Score UpdateLatest IPL Schedule 2022, and , IPl 2022 Points tableEntertainment News here.

Under Hardik's captaincy, newcomers GT finished at the top of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 table and are currently playing the Qualifier 1 against Rajasthan Royals (RR) at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. Hardik's focus and composure impressed has impressed Shastri, especially for coming up the batting order to lead GT from the front with the bat. \"Hardik has been most impressive as a leader but what I liked most about him were his focus and his composure. He has had his eyes on the ball from the outset. He thrived on that responsibility of being captain - he had mentioned over there that it was for his home state where he was born and he was brought up. It's that added pressure and he thrived on it. \"He accepted that responsibility by coming up the order because he knew he might not be bowling in all the matches. So to stay relevant, to stay as a leader leading from the front he had to come up that one position or two positions up the order,\" Shastri said on Star Sports. Shastri, who expected Hardik to bowl in GT's crucial Qualifier 1 against RR on Tuesday, was proved right as the GT skipper did bowl two overs. Hardik also dismissed RR's key middle-order batter Devdutt Padikkal for 28 off 20 balls. RR set a target of 189 for GT. #PapaPandya to the rescue 💙 #SeasonOfFirsts #AavaDe #GTvRR #TATAIPL pic.twitter.com/NIMhGYRXzP The former India captain also said that GT would not have anything to lose against RR as the winner will book a place in the final, while the loser will get another opportunity when they play the winner of the Eliminator in Qualifier 2. \"Gujarat have nothing to lose, they have played excellent cricket and they have got.. just like (Jos) Buttler for Rajasthan Royals, they have Shubman Gill who is due for runs and if he starts off, he can score very quickly,\" added Shastri. GT were in the magnificent form before the playoffs as they became the first team to reach the IPL 2022 playoffs. They won 10 of their 14 matches and sealed the top position on the table. Hardik has led GT from the front, scoring 413 runs and hitting four half-centuries. This is already his best run with the bat in an IPL season.","pubDate":"2022-05-24 16:38:41","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/05/24/500x300_1293978-ipl-2022.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Somerset coach Jason Kerr backs T20 despite sluggish Blast ticket sales","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/24/somerset-coach-jason-kerr-backs-t20-despite-sluggish-blast-ticket-sales","keywords":["Vitality Blast T20","Twenty20","Somerset","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Simon Burnton"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kerr: ‘The Blast is going from strength to strength’Competition from the Hundred affecting lower-profile gamesOver the last 20 years Twenty20 cricket has risen from obscurity to dominate much of the cricketing world, but still the 20th season of the competition currently known as the Vitality Blast starts on Wednesday in the midst of a potentially existential crisis.Though all available tickets for finals day have long been snapped up, disappointing sales have been reported for many of the less high-profile fixtures, and some are questioning its place in an overcrowded calendar since the England and Wales Cricket Board’s laser focus has switched to the Hundred, the rival micro-format which launched last summer.

Though all available tickets for finals day have long been snapped up, disappointing sales have been reported for many of the less high-profile fixtures, and some are questioning its place in an overcrowded calendar since the England and Wales Cricket Board’s laser focus has switched to the Hundred, the rival micro-format which launched last summer. Ollie Robinson given chance to prove form and fitness against New Zealand Read more “The Hundred is completely on its own, but people want to play in T20 competitions around the world and the more successful they are in the Blast, the more likely they are to find opportunities abroad,” says Jason Kerr, head coach of a Somerset side that after losing to Kent in last year’s final start this year’s event against the same opponents on Wednesday evening. “They are very different products, but for me the Blast is going from strength to strength.” Somerset were also in action on the first-ever day of domestic T20 cricket, in June 2003, when they lost to Warwickshire and all-rounder Wes Durston rather missed the point in declaring: “I only wish that it could have gone on for longer.” Kerr insists there has been “a huge improvement” across the competition over the last two decades. “The depth of batting in the majority of sides is massive – there’s no tailenders any more, anyone can come in and clear the rope and win games,” he says. “So many players bat 360 degrees now, their strength is enormous, the advances have been huge – and the attention to detail, the statistical side of T20, has been completely transformed.” So too have the potential rewards. Somerset’s Will Smeed is a good example of the opportunities T20 success can bring: the 20-year-old – who has never played a senior match longer than 20 overs a side – did well enough in last year’s competition (and also, it must be said, in the Hundred) to secure winter contracts with Bangla Tigers in the Abu Dhabi T10, and with Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Premier League, where he hit two 90-plus scores in six innings and departed with his reputation further inflated. Quetta Gladiators' Will Smeed hits out in the Pakistan Super League in February 2022. Photograph: Arif Ali/AFP/Getty Images It increasingly seems a young man’s game: nationally six of the top 10 run-scorers in last year’s competition were 25 or under, and three of Somerset’s top five in the final were under 23, players who have never known life without T20 and for whom the skillset required comes naturally. This will be particularly tested this year, with the competition moved earlier in the season and many clubs going into it with little more than a day’s format-specific training. “I’m hoping there’ll be big crowds and actually better cricket,” Kerr says. “A couple of years ago when the 50-over competition was earlier in the year scores were high, the pitches a bit fresher. There are advantages. There’s always a natural buzz at T20, a different crowd, a different atmosphere and a different kind of pressure. More than anything it’s an opportunity to entertain the public. I’m expecting the standard to be higher than ever.”","pubDate":"2022-05-24 16:37:25","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d09efd589a6e8a035534ad46384ab0f02a9203/0_172_3734_2240/master/3734.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=04cb89a2912aa789e52afc933cc91a09","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Namibia seal historic series win after spin-dominated series finale Zimbabwe | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz - Cricbuzz","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbS5jcmljYnV6ei5jb20vY3JpY2tldC1uZXdzLzEyMjM2OC9uYW1pYmlhLXNlYWwtaGlzdG9yaWMtc2VyaWVzLXdpbi1hZnRlci1zcGluLWRvbWluYXRlZC1zZXJpZXMtZmluYWxlLXppbWJhYndl0gGGAWh0dHA6Ly9tLmNyaWNidXp6LmNvbS9hbXAvY3JpY2tldC1uZXdzLzEyMjM2OC9uYW1pYmlhLXNlYWwtaGlzdG9yaWMtc2VyaWVzLXdpbi1hZnRlci1zcGluLWRvbWluYXRlZC1zZXJpZXMtZmluYWxlLXppbWJhYndlLWNyaWNidXp6Y29t?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Namibia seal historic series win after spin-dominated series finale Zimbabwe | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzNamibia 3-2 Zimbabwe: A look back at the Eagles' history-making series  International Cricket CouncilRecent Match Report - Namibia vs Zimbabwe 5th T20I 2022  ESPNcricinfoZIM vs NAM Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Namibia Tour of Zimbabwe, 5th T20I  Cricket AddictorNamibia strive for series win in fifth T20I  International Cricket CouncilView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-24 16:28:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LSG vs RCB Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022 - Cricket Addictor","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL2NyaWNrZXRhZGRpY3Rvci5jb20vZmFudGFzeS1jcmlja2V0L2xzZy12cy1yY2ItZHJlYW0xMS1wcmVkaWN0aW9uLWZhbnRhc3ktY3JpY2tldC10aXBzLWRyZWFtMTEtdGVhbS1wbGF5aW5nLXhpLXBpdGNoLXJlcG9ydC1pbmp1cnktdXBkYXRlLXRhdGEtaXBsLTIwMjItMi_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LSG vs RCB Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-24 16:26:58","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: RR spinner R Ashwin REVEALS when he will stop playing cricket - WATCH","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ipl-2022-rr-spinner-r-ashwin-reveals-when-he-will-stop-playing-cricket-watch-2466936.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"For Ravichandran Ashwin, IPL 2022 has been about exploring less traversed areas, whether it was growing as a finisher with the bat or giving the team a blazing start as a pinch hitter.","content":"India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin says he has “found a purpose in life”, which is pushing the experimental boundaries without worrying much about the criticism that comes your way when you choose an uncharted terrain. Ashwin is relishing one of his “happiest IPL seasons” even as his 11 wickets and 183 runs won’t exactly describe the kind of impact he has made on the Rajasthan Royals’ campaign. Ashwin, the T20 batter has been as much a revelation as Ashwin, the bowler, who bamboozled the dangerous Andre Russell with a gem that can easily be counted as one of the best deliveries this season. “This is one very different year as far as I am concerned as a cricketer and a person. Truth be told, this has easily been one of the happiest years of my experience at the IPL,” Ashwin told Rajasthan Royals' social media team in an interview. In conversation with a cricketer-scientist-legend. Now playing: #RoyalsFamily | #GTvRR | @ashwinravi99 pic.twitter.com/b25zJdmuht — Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) May 24, 2022 For Ashwin, this year has been about exploring less traversed areas, whether it was growing as a finisher with the bat or giving the team a blazing start as a pinch hitter. “Nothing to do with performance and qualifications. It is about how much I have enjoyed in terms of performance. The day I stop experimenting, the day I stop losing the passion for that, is the day I will be done with game,” Ashwin, India’s second-highest wicket-taker in Tests, said. “I have been able to my thought processes to a different level this year. How do I coin this, it’s tricky? They call it freedom of expression,” said the current Indian team’s only “cricket scientist”. The delivery he bowled from round the wicket to beat Russell neck and crop in a tense game against KKR was a signal that “some things are just meant to be.” “I am one of those very lucky few people who have found the purpose of life. The happiest moment for me was dismissing Russell in the KKR game. I genuinely believed that turned the tide. “Previous day at practice, I worked on running from different angles over the wicket. First time I executed that, the game was in balance and he got out, then Yuzi hattrick happened. From that moment I felt things are meant to be,” he said. But the experiment could have gone south but Ashwin was ready for that. “Earlier, I have tried this and it didn’t work and people questioned. I don’t know how people would have reacted if it didn’t work, but it worked.” “It’s been a journey, I have made a lot of mistakes. Years ago we had this head coach Duncan Fletcher and I would go and ask him, how do I improve this, how do I improve that, how do I get better? He said only way you get better is by making mistakes and failing in front of people.” Never settling for less. #RoyalsFamily | #TATAIPL2022 | #HallaBol pic.twitter.com/BEJEeOWBZE — Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) May 23, 2022 “That’s what I have done all my life. I have received a lot of criticism from people on how I have tried to expand beyond the realms sometimes people may feel, ‘Why the hell is he doing such things? Is he over-ambitious, is he trying to do too much? “But that’s just me, if you try to take that out of me you won’t get this person. So I come with a lot of problems. If I am utilised and given the form of expression I require, I think I can explore boundaries,” he said. For Ashwin, the “greatest strength of this team has been playing with freedom and no expectations.” “We should continue that and put a lot of pressure on whoever is coming up against us in rest of games that’s left for us.” He feels that the team might be onto something special. “It’s a good beginning. Last time we qualified was when Shane Warne was around. Looks like we are on to something special. It’s been a great effort if I look back at season. “We have had our low moments but we have been pretty standard in how we have managed our inner space. Honeymoon with RR has been very good and hope it continues,” he said.","pubDate":"2022-05-24 16:10:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sarfaraz Khan brother: Sarfaraz Khan father name and family details","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-sarfaraz-khan-brother-sarfaraz-khan-father-name-and-family-details/","keywords":["Cricket","Musheer Khan","Ranji Trophy 2021-22","sarfaraz khan"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sarfaraz Khan brother: 18-year-old Musheer Khan has made his way into the Mumbai squad for the knock-out phase of Ranji Trophy 2021-22.

God has been kind. It’s his (Musheer) and my father’s hard work. Lot of sacrifices have gone into making us cricketers,” Sarfaraz Khan, who played for the Delhi Capitals (DC) in the ongoing season, told The Indian Express after Musheer’s selection. Sarfaraz Khan father name and family details Sarfaraz and brother Musheer would perhaps not have traversed their Cricketing journey without the contribution of their father cum coach Naushad Khan. Doing odd jobs to make the family ends meet, Naushad Khan stayed with his family in the slums of Mumbai, while ably coaching his sons as well, to achieve their collective dream to make it to the Indian Cricket team one fine day. Sarfaraz’s other family members include his mother Tabassum Khan, and an elder brother Moin Khan.

What followed was an exhibition of some of the finest hitting of the cricket ball on display this season as Samson toyed with the Gujarat attack, collecting five fours and another couple of maximums — both collected off Alzarri Joseph's bowling.Though he missed out on his half-century, which would have been his third this season, by a whisker, Samson did earn plenty of plaudits on microblogging website Twitter.

Arguably England’s best player now has the weight of captaincy and being their regular match-winner for a busy summer of cricket ahead. Stokes is the new England men’s Test captainAFP As soon as Root announced he was stepping down, there was only ever one candidate to replace him and that was Stokes as no one else’s place in the side is safe… So a new era begins, and it will be fascinating to see how Stokes does, given that he lost his only previous Test as captain against the West Indies in 2020. And New Zealand are a tough opponent to start off against. Kane Williamson’s team won the inaugural ICC World Test Championship last year and are more than capable of ensuring the Durham all-rounder gets off to the worst possible start. Things can’t get much worse after the series in the West Indies, but they may do against a well-drilled, efficient outfit in the Kiwis. However, Brendon McCullum is England’s new head coach and knows New Zealand inside out. Root stepped down as England captain following a dismal run of resultsGetty England v New Zealand first test: Date and start time The first Test between England and New Zealand will start on Thursday, June 2 and it is due to run until Monday, June 6.

Both were dropped for the tour to the Windies, where the visitors toiled in the field. Anderson might turn 40 in July, but he knows just how to bowl in English conditions and has taken 640 Test wickets in a glittering career. Broad is also approaching the end, but he still offers England a lot. There is no place for Jos Buttler, despite his incredible form in the IPL, so Ben Foakes will continue with the gloves. Matthew Fisher, Dan Lawrence, Ollie Robinson and Matthew Parkinson miss out after being part of the West Indies tour side. Mark Wood, Saqib Mahmood and Chris Woakes are all injured. There is a first call-up for Durham bowler Matthew Potts, who has taken 35 wickets in the first six matches of the season, including four five-wicket hauls. Yorkshire’s Harry Brook has been in sensational form with the bat in the County Championship, scoring 758 runs at an average of over 150.

Rob Key, managing Director for England, said: “This is the start of a new era for our Test team under the stewardship of Ben and Brendon. “With a blend of youth and experience, we have selected an exciting squad that can compete with New Zealand in next month’s Test series. “We have rewarded players in Harry Brook and Matty Potts who have had outstanding starts to the County season, and they deserve the opportunity to stake a claim at this level. “It promises to be a mouthwatering series, and I can’t wait for the team to start against a very good New Zealand side. It is a fascinating prospect for everyone connected with the sport in this country.” On being picked to be Test captain, Stokes told talkSPORT: “I don’t think that’s a job that is an easy thing that is ever easy to turn down for anybody. “Obviously you’ve got to put some thought into it, not just a ‘yeah alright I’ll have a go’ because there’s a lot of things to consider, but there was no hesitation.” On the new era, Anderson told talkSPORT: “I’m no stranger to bringing about change within a team environment and I can’t wait to get started. “You’d probably say that Rob and Brendon are slightly left field picks for those roles considering the sort of people that had those roles in the past, but I think it’s an exciting time.” “Certainly with Brendon as Test coach, having played against him a lot and seeing him as New Zealand captain, seeing how forward thinking he was, how attacking he was, it’s just an exciting time.” Offer Of The Day 888Sport: Bet £10, Get £30 in Free Bets + £10 Casino Bonus* – CLAIM HERE New customers only.

So far, in 14 games, Buttler has scored 629 runs at an average of 48.38 and with a strike rate of 146.96. Although, he has slowed down and he will be challenged by Gujarat’s excellent pace bowling attack, his form will go a long way in determining how Rajasthan fare in this match against Gujarat.His match-up with Mohammed Shami will be an interesting one to watch out for as the pacer comes into this match with some excellent wicket-taking performances. The Indian pacer has been very good in the powerplay overs and so far in 14 games, he has picked up 18 wickets.The England wicket-keeper batter has managed scores of 2, 2, 7 — in his last-three outings and Rajasthan would hope he hits his stride in this crucial match.Following Jos Buttler is Lucknow Super Giants captain KL Rahul, who is a run-machine in the IPL. After 14 matches, the right-hander has notched up 537 runs at an average of 48.82 and with a strike-rate of 135.He is closely followed by his opening partner Quinton de Kock – who has found some great form in the last few matches. In 14 games, the left-hander has scored 502 runs at an average of 38.62. The combination of Rahul and de Kock will be crucial when Lucknow Super Giants lock horns with the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Eliminator at the Eden Gardens on 25 May.Looking at the prolific run-scorers of this tournament, it is no surprise that Rajasthan Royals and Lucknow Super Giants find themselves in the playoffs since their top order has always given them solid starts and the same will be expected in these crunch games.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPl Live Score UpdateLatest IPL Schedule 2022, and , IPl 2022 Points tableEntertainment News here.

With luck on their side, RCB were the last team to qualify for the IPL 2022 playoffs after Mumbai Indians (MI) defeated Delhi Capitals (DC) in their final league game. According to Pathan, RCB's recent performances in the league stage have made them a dangerous side and they should not be taken lightly in the playoffs.

But the rest of the teams will be scared of them now. They are coming on the back of an emphatic win in their previous game and Virat Kohli seems to have regained his form which is the biggest positive. \"He seems to have found his mojo back. His match-winning half-century (in their final league game vs Gujarat Titans) will bode well for the team while the rest of the batters are also chipping in with valuable contributions. No side can take a team like RCB for granted now. All three teams above them will be wary of RCB,\" Pathan said on 'Cricket Live' on Star Sports. After struggling almost throughout the group stage, Kohli finally looked settled in RCB's final league game. Kohli scored a 54-ball 73 in RCB's successful chase of 169 against GT. Considering the eight-wicket victory came against table-toppers GT, it would have certainly boosted Kohli and his teammates' confidence. Meanwhile, former England spinner Graeme Swann also believes RCB might blank the rest of the teams after sneaking into the playoffs. \"I've got this feeling that Royal Challengers Bangalore after somehow sneaking in by the back door might surprise everybody,\" added Swann.","pubDate":"2022-05-24 15:03:55","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/05/24/500x300_1293969-ipl-2022.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Comparing Rishabh Pant to MS Dhoni is 'not fair', says Sourav Ganguly","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/ipl-2022-comparing-rishabh-pant-to-ms-dhoni-is-not-fair-says-sourav-ganguly-744613","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pant has received massive criticism for his leadershipDhoni has captained CSK to 4 IPL titlesBoth DC and CSK have failed to qualify for IPL 2022 playoffs","content":"IPL 2022: Comparing Rishabh Pant to MS Dhoni is ‘not fair’, says Sourav GangulyIPL 2022: Comparing Rishabh Pant to MS Dhoni is ‘not fair’, says Sourav GangulyRishabh Pant should not be compared with MS Dhoni, according to Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief Sourav Ganguly. The former India captain has said it is unfair to make the comparison considering Dhoni's vast experience is unmatched by Pant, who is just starting out as a leader. \"Don't compare Pant with MS Dhoni. Dhoni has so much experience. He has captained 500-plus games in IPL, Tests, and ODIs. So it's not fair for Rishabh to be compared with Dhoni,\" Ganguly was quoted by PTI, as saying. Pant was on the receiving end of massive criticism after his side Delhi Capitals (DC) failed to make it to the playoffs of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022. In the must-win final league game against Mumbai Indians (MI), DC skipper Pant made a tactical blunder as he did not use the Decision Review System (DRS) against Tim David in a tense chase. Ultra Edge replays suggested that David had edged the delivery from Shardul Thakur early in his innings but Pant did not take the review despite his teammates urging him to do so. MI's David went on to play a match-winning knock of 34 off 11 balls. A win over MI would have taken DC to the playoffs but Pant's mistake was seen as one of the main reasons for their early exit.This is just one part of the team and the other part is you guys - our fans and supporters.

Rohit had a poor run with the bat as well as he scored just 268 runs in 14 innings at an average of 19.14 and at a modest strike rate of 120.17. \"Everybody is human. There will be mistakes but Rohit's record as captain is outstanding. Five IPL titles, Asia Cup winner, he has won whatever he has captained, so his record as captain is outstanding. Mistakes will happen because they are all human,\" the former India captain added further. Ganguly backs Rohit, Kohli: A matter of time, they will be at their bestGanguly also said Virat Kohli's match-winning fifty against Gujarat Titans in RCB's final league game is a much-needed boost of confidence for the former India captain. Backing both Kohli and Rohit, Ganguly said: \"They are very good players. I'm sure they will be back among runs. They play so much cricket that at times they go out of form. Kohli played very well in the last game, especially when it was required for RCB. That's why he (Kohli) was so happy that RCB qualified.

Pujara has been a regular in the Indian Test cricket team’s XI since 2010. This is because of his batting prowess in Test cricket. The one who stands and relaxes. He played 162 Test innings for India and scored 6713 runs. This includes 18 cents and 32 half cents. He has been out for single-digit runs in about 9 innings in the last 10 Tests. Due to that he did not get a chance in the team in the Test series against Sri Lanka. The 34-year-old said his return to the Indian team was seen as a challenge. It was at this point that he recorded four consecutive centuries for Sussex in the county cricket series in England. As a result, he has now returned to the team. “I can not believe Pujara’s return to the team. It’s an expression of his commitment to comeback cricket. MSK Prasad said. The Indian cricket team is scheduled to play a Test match against England on English soil in July. Pujara has been selected in that team. .","pubDate":"2022-05-24 13:59:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gujarat Titans vs Rajasthan Royals: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/gujarat-titans-vs-rajasthan-royals-live-score-over-qualifier-1-t20-1-5-updates-3005521","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Gujarat Titans vs Rajasthan Royals from Eden Gardens, Kolkata.

Fuller and around off, Samson heaves it over mid-wicket and collects his third boundary. Has hit one biggie also. 14 from the over, the ploy to give Shami an extra over has not worked for Hardik. 4.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Struck well. Aerial for a while but away from the fielder. A touch short in length, around off, Samson hammers it off the back foot towards mid on. The fielder there dives across to his left but it falls wide and races behind. 4.4 overs (1 Run) Short in length, on middle, Buttler turns and pulls it to deep square leg for a single. 4.3 overs (0 Run) A yorker on middle at 144 clicks, Buttler digs it out down to mid on. Three dots now after five wides. 4.2 overs (0 Run) On a good length, around off, Buttler punches from the back foot but not in the gap, finds the cover fielder. 4.1 overs (0 Run) Lands it on a length around off, Buttler stays back and pushes it to covers. 4.1 overs (5 Runs) FIVE WIDES! Not an ideal start to a new over. Shami fails to control his line and the inward movement takes it further away from the batter and the keeper. All the action happened down the leg side and it's a bonus boundary for Rajasthan at fine leg. Will Hardik Pandya take a gamble of giving Shami his third over in the Powerplay? Yes, here is Shami with his third over! 3.6 overs (0 Run) Delivers it on a shortish length around leg, Samson gets behind the line and defends it down. 10 from the over! 3.5 overs (0 Run) In the channel outside off, short in length, Sanju watches it closely and allows it through to the keeper. 3.4 overs (0 Run) On a length, around middle and off, Samson punches from the back foot to wide mid off. 3.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Another one from the flashing blade of Sanju Samson. Back of a length, around off and angling away, Samson packs a punch from the back foot. Doesn't bother to keep it down and sends it blazing through extra cover. 3.2 overs (0 Run) Angles across a full ball, outside off, Samson allows it through to the keeper. There seems to be some problem with the ball as the six went into the crowd. The umpires have changed the ball and the action resumes... 3.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Goodness, me! Sanju has effortlessly dismissed this one. Yash Dayal serves a length ball, around leg, Sanju Samson picks it off his pads and lofts it nonchalantly over long on. Will Yash Dayal continue after a successful first over? Yes, he will. 2.6 overs (0 Run) Close to off, on a length and moving back in, Buttler tries to play close to his body but gets an inside edge onto the front pad. 2.5 overs (0 Run) Beauty from Shami! Another inswinger to beat the inside edge of Buttler's bat. It's a great contest. Jos is trying to hit through the line but is not reading the variations accurately all the time. 2.5 overs (1 Run) Wide! Slips a length ball down the leg side, Buttler tries to flick bt misses. 2.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Connects this time and connects well. Shami comes up with an outswinger this time. Lands it on a length and outside off, Buttler plays it with the movement and crunches it through covers. He is not trying to hit it hard this evening, just caressing his shots in the gap. 2.3 overs (0 Run) Beaten! Shami delivers an inswinger, on a length and outside off, Buttler tries to punch it from the back foot but it beats the inside edge of his bat. 2.2 overs (2 Runs) Around middle and leg, on a length, Jos eases it through square leg and returns for the second run. 2.1 overs (0 Run) Shortish and around off, Buttler mistimes his shot back towards the bowler. The skipper, Sanju Samson walks in at number 3. 1.6 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT BEHIND! Yashasvi Jaiswal walks. Brilliant from the young man. Yash Dayal had Yashasvi Jaiswal in his pocket in this over. He outfoxed him on many occasions with the movement and the change in length and this time, Dayal forced an outside edge. He hurls it around off, on a length and shaping away, Yashasvi Jaiswal tries to drive but only manages to edge it behind. Wriddhiman Saha catches it, they appeal, the umpire stays still but Yashasvi Jaiswal turns and starts to walk. 1.5 overs (2 Runs) A miscued shot! Yash Dayal digs it in short to surprise the batter, Yashasvi Jaiswal plays a reactive pull shot, without any timing, it just clears the infield at mid-wicket. Two runs are taken. 1.4 overs (0 Run) Spears it in, very full and around middle, Yashasvi Jaiswal keeps it out back towards the bowler. 1.3 overs (0 Run) On a length and around off, Yashasvi Jaiswal mistimes his punch on the off side. 1.2 overs (0 Run) Fuller and close to off, shaping away a bit, Yashasvi Jaiswal drives it off the front foot to mid off. 1.1 overs (0 Run) A gentle delivery from Yash Dayal. He serves it in the zone outside off, taking it away from the batter with the seam movement, Jaiswal flashes his bat at it but fails to connect. Yash Dayal will start from the other end. 0.6 over (4 Runs) FOUR! Great timing again from the bat of Buttler and he seems to have regained his lost touch already. Shami pitches it up and lands it around off, Buttler strokes it elegantly through extra cover. Once it beats the fielder inside the ring, it's always a boundary. 0.5 over (0 Run) Shami returns to bowling on a length and around off, Jos Buttler allows it through to the keeper. 0.4 over (4 Runs) FOUR! Off the mark in style! Shami delivers it full and outside off, Buttler leans into the drive and caresses it through the gap between mid off and extra cover. It races away on this lightning-quick outfield. 0.3 over (0 Run) Watchful from Jos! Shami hurls across a length ball, close to off and it shapes away off the seam, Buttler watches the line and shoulders arms. 0.2 over (1 Run) Rajasthan are away! Back of a length, around middle and angling in, Yashasvi Jaiswal works it behind square leg and opens his account with a single. 0.1 over (0 Run) Shami begins from 'round the wicket for the left-hander. He angles in a length ball around middle and leg, Yashasvi Jaiswal tries to flick but misses. It clips his pads and drops next to the pitch. We are all set to begin! The two umpires make their way out to the middle. The Gujarat players make their way out to the middle as well and they are greeted with a big roar from this jam-packed Eden Garden crowd. Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal are the openers for Rajasthan. Mohammad Shami has the new cherry in his hand. Here we go... We are in the City of Joy, folks! It's a fresh pitch and we might see a fresh approach from both these teams today. They have power-hitters in their lineup and they will need them to shine tonight as Eden Gardens has seen 16.7 sixes per game since 2018 in the Indian T20 League. Rashid Khan comes up for a quick chat. The Afghan says that it's a great opportunity for them, to play in Qualifier 1. Adds that they want to keep everything simple. Further says that as a team they want to learn from their mistakes and enjoy the game. Tells that he has played in the playoffs before and in one final, and that experience will help him in this game. States that it's all about enjoying the game and giving 100 per cent. Shares that he was missing his line and length in the first few games, so he focused on that, worked on target bowling, and that's how he got better. Feels that they have played enough cricket all around the world, so they just need to adjust as soon as possible to the conditions, and most of the players have played here before. Hopes that they will do that quickly. Sanju Samson, the skipper of Rajasthan, says that they have done quite well batting first and tells that it looks like a decent wicket. Adds that it is important to focus on this game and it is important to keep the emotions aside and focus on cricket. Mentions that they have been playing good cricket and they just need to continue that and keep it simple. Informs that they are playing an unchanged XI. Hardik Pandya, the skipper of Gujarat, says they want to bowl first as the pitch looks like a decent one to bat on. Adds that there have been no games here in the last few months, so it will be good to know what you are chasing. Shares that they reached safely here and they have prepared well. Mentions that they want to treat this game as a simple one and not create demons in their heads. Wants his team to make sure that the intensity is high and that they are aware of what the situation demands. Informs about the only change as Lockie Ferguson gets replaced by Alzarri Joseph. Rajasthan (Unchanged Playing XI) - Yashasvi Jaiswal, Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson (C) (WK), Devdutt Padikkal, Ravichandran Ashwin, Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Trent Boult, Yuzvendra Chahal, Prasidh Krishna, Obed McCoy. Gujarat (Playing XI) - Wriddhiman Saha (WK), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya (C), David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Yash Dayal, Alzarri Joseph (In place of Lockie Ferguson), Mohammad Shami. TOSS - The coin goes up and lands in favour of Gujarat. They have elected to BOWL first. Pitch Report - Matthew Hayden is down for the pitch report. He says that the ground is magnificent but it is not big. Tells that the pitch has a lot of grass cover and quicks will come into play. Adds that there is black soil here and he expects pacers to get some bounce. The Aussie reckons that there won't be much turn as it is a fresh pitch. Mentions that 170-180 will be a par score here and he expects the team winning the toss to bowl first. The forecast was worrying but the good thing is that it's not raining and the players are out on the field, going through their warm-up drills. Let's hope the conditions remain the same and we get 40 overs of uninterrupted action. There is a slight chance of rain playing a spoilsport in the city of joy, and already two hours have been added over the originally stipulated 200 minutes of match time. In case a minimum five-over game cannot be completed, the result will be determined by a Super Over. However, the standings of the league stage will be considered in determining the winner if the playing conditions do not allow even the Super Over to take place. The rain threat is not that alarming, and in all possibilities, we shall have a full game. Let's hope that our not-so-beloved friend, i.e. rain, stays away. Gujarat came out on top in the group stage game between these two teams earlier in the season. Will the same story continue tonight? Or will Rajasthan avenge that defeat and book a place in the final for the first time since the inaugural season? Rajasthan, on the other hand, looked like one of the most complete outfits right from the start of the tournament, and their final position at the end of the league stage was almost on the expected lines given the strength of their squad. Jos Buttler and Yuzvendra Chahal have been outstanding with bat and ball respectively, but the form of Buttler in the second half of the season will be a bit of concern. However, the stage is big and expect big players from both teams to bring their A-game in this crunch game. Gujarat were the table-toppers in the group stage and were the one team that truly played like a team this season. Their bowling was always going to be their stronger suit, but the way their batting group has stepped up has been pleasantly surprising for many. The top order and especially the number 3 spot is still a concern, but the likes of David Miller, Rahul Tewatia and Rashid Khan have timed and again proved their worth with the bat to show the never-say-die attitude of this team. Hardik Pandya, the skipper, has also played a key role with his all-round abilities and captaincy and let's see how they go about their business in this big game. Hello and a very warm welcome to Qualifier 1 of the 2022 season of the Indian T20 League where Gujarat will lock horns against Rajasthan at the iconic Eden Gardens in Kolkata. These two have been the best teams of the season and are rightly contesting for a direct place in the summit clash. The losing team though won't be knocked out and will enjoy the perks of finishing in the top two by unlocking yet another shot in Qualifier 2. That said, both sides would want to avoid the longer route to the grand finale. Fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a thrilling ride as both teams come out all guns blazing this evening. ...
