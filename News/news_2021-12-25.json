Harbhajan had announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on Friday. The 41-year-old spinner has played 103 Tests, 236 ODIs and 28 T20Is for Men in Blue. He scalped 294 wickets in limited-overs cricket. \" Harbhajan Singh has had a phenomenal career with Team India. He has been a part of many memorable victories both at home and away. He played his cricket with grit and passion and wore his heart on his sleeve. His fighting spirit and his zeal to perform for India when the team was under pressure is something that always stood out. His presence on the field lifted everyone's morale,\" said Jay Shah in an official BCCI release. \"While he played a major role with the ball, picking up wickets aplenty, it must be remembered that he has also played some crucial knocks with the bat, helping us get over the line. I wish him the best for all his future endeavours and wish to see him being closely associated with the game,\" he added. Harbhajan had played his last red-ball match against Sri Lanka in 2015 while his last ODI was against South Africa in the same year. His last game for India was a T20I against UAE in the 2016 Asia Cup. Since then, he was not picked for the Indian side. Harbhajan retires after scalping 417 wickets in 103 Tests at an average of 32.46. The 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 World Cup winner is also the first Indian to scalp a Test hat-trick. Overall, Jalandhar-born cricketer has played 367 international games and claimed 711 international wickets and scored 3,569 international runs.

The Twitter handle @icelandcricket, run by the Icelandic Cricket Association, enjoys huge popularity among fans due to its rib-tickling tweets. On Friday, a tweet by the account featuring the names of Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and Australian batting great Don Bradman went viral on the micro-blogging site. “Context and luck is everything in life. If Ravi Ashwin had been born in Sri Lanka, he would probably end his career with as many wickets as Muralitharan. If Don Bradman had been born in Iceland, he'd have scored no international runs and been a below par fisherman. That's life,” the account tweeted. Context and luck is everything in life.

The tweet was an instant hit among fans and was widely retweeted on Friday. Many tweets from the @icelandcricket Twitter handle have gone viral in the past. In 2019, the account had reacted to Ambati Rayudu's omission from India's World Cup squad by asking the batter to apply for permanent residency in Iceland. Promoted “(Mayank) Agarwal has three professional wickets at 72.33 so at least @RayuduAmbati can put away his 3D glasses now. He will only need normal glasses to read the document we have prepared for him. Come join us Ambati. We love the Rayudu things,” the account had tweeted at the time.

On one occasion, a joke at the expense of Afghanistan bowler Rashid Khan led to Iceland Cricket being slammed on Twitter. After Rashid went for 110 runs in an ODI World Cup game in 2019, the account tweeted: “We've just heard that Rashid Khan has scored Afghanistan's first century of the #CWC19! Wow! 110 from 56 balls.

Both Dravid and Kohli are currently with the Indian Test side in South Africa preparing for the three-match Test series which begins with the Boxing Day Test in Centurion on Sunday. Dravid, a former India captain, and someone who has played a lot of cricket with Harbhajan, described the off-spinner as a \"great competitor\" and \"a great team man\". \"Harbhajan had many ups and downs in his career but he has always come out fighting. Great competitor and a great team man, someone you wanted to go to battle with. Obviously, one of those great performers for India,\" Dravid told bcci.tv. Dravid picked the 32 wickets that the off-spinner took against Australia in 2001 in just three Tests as the \"highlight\" of Harbhajan's career and lauded the Punjab cricketer for winning many matches for India along with the legendary Anil Kumble. \"To be a great sort of partner along with Anil Kumble, part of so many of our great wins during that period, it's a pleasure and privilege to play alongside him. Highlight of Bhajji's career was 32 wickets and just to see the way he came back after being dropped from the team, the way he carried that attack in absence of Anil Kumble was phenomenal,\" the 'Wall' said. Indian captain Virat Kohli stressed on Harbhajan's remarkable numbers, which make him India's second highest wicket-taker behind Anil Kumble in international cricket. Promoted \"711 international wickets is no mean feat and you can be proud of your achievement. It's a blessing to play for the country but to play for that long is a different thing altogether,\" Kohli said. \"I cherish all those moments with you and how you backed me to the hilt when I came into the Indian team. We share a great friendship off the field,\" he added. Harbhajan retired with 417 wickets in 103 Tests. Harbhajan represented India in 236 ODIs, in which he picked up 269 wickets. He also picked up 25 wickets in 28 T20Is for India.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/31smn7r8_virat-kohli-twitter_120x90_25_December_21.jpg","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"US vs Ireland 1st ODI called-off due to COVID-19 virus","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/international/usa-vs-ireland-1st-odi-cancelled-covid-19-pandemic-cricket-news/article38033795.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["AP"],"video_url":null,"description":"USA Cricket said one umpire tested positive for COVID-19, but the other three scheduled to officiate were deemed close contacts, so none of the crew would be available for the match.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-25 03:13:55","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar"},{"title":"England playing 11 Boxing Day test: Four changes locked in by England for the Ashes 2021-22 third test at Melbourne","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-england-playing-11-boxing-day-test-four-changes-locked-in-by-england-for-the-ashes-2021-22-third-test-at-melbourne/","keywords":["Cricket","Boxing Day Test","England playing 11","The Ashes"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"England playing 11 Boxing Day test: England have announced their playing 11 for the Boxing Day Test at the MCG in Melbourne.

In a career spanning more than two decades, Harbhajan picked up truckloads of wickets across formats in what was a truly decorated career. Harbhajan Singh has been a part of India's 2007 World T20 and ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 winning teams. Harbhajan has also won the Indian Premier League (IPL) thrice with Mumbai Indians (MI) and once with Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Harbhajan was also the captain of MI when they won the Champions League T20 title in 2011. While his success in Tests and One-Day Internationals is well-documented, it is fair to point out Harbhajan Singh's success in the shortest format. Harbhajan, the T20 bowler, has made innumerable match-winning contributions in international cricket, as well as the IPL. Harbhajan represented India in 28 T20 internationals and picked up 25 wickets at a miserly economy rate of 6.21. In the IPL, Harbhajan played 10 seasons for the Mumbai Indians before representing the Chennai Super Kings for a couple of seasons. His final IPL appearance was with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2021. Overall, in 163 IPL appearances, Harbhajan scalped 150 wickets while he holds the record for the most dot balls bowled in the history of the tournament. On that note, let's revisit five of Harbhajan Singh's finest performances in all T20 cricket: In Qualifier 1 of IPL 2015 pit, Chennai Super Kings were up against Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Electing to bat first, the West Indian duo of Lendl Simmons and Kieron Pollard powered MI to a score of 187/6. In reply, CSK were in a spot of bother before Faf du Plessis and Suresh Raina put the innings back on track with a solid partnership. The 11th over of the innings saw Harbhajan Singh break open the contest in favor of MI. He prized out Suresh Raina with a flighted delivery and had the southpaw chip one straight back at him. Immediately after, Harbhajan had CSK skipper MS Dhoni trapped plumb in front for a golden duck to completely turn the tables. Harbhajan finished with figures of 2/26 from his four overs and CSK were bowled out for 162. The spell went a long way in putting MI into the summit clash. There they came up trumps against CSK yet again to lift their 2nd IPL title. This was perhaps one of Harbhajan Singh's lesser talked about contributions to India. The semifinal of the inaugural ICC World T20 2007 saw India and Australia lock horns at Kingsmead in Durban. Powered by a blistering 30-ball 70 from Yuvraj Singh, India racked up 188/5 in the first half. Australia's chase was powered by Matthew Hayden and Andrew Symonds and they were in pole position to overhaul the target. The game was in the balance when both batters were dismissed. However, with 30 to win off three overs, the pressure was on. It was down to Harbhajan Singh to then deliver a crucial 18th over and boy, did the offie step up! In what was a masterclass in defensive bowling, Harbhajan yorked Michael Clarke first ball to rattle the leg pole. He then followed it up with darts fired in very full and gave all of three runs off the remainder of the over. That brought the equation to 27 needed off the last two overs. The duo of RP Singh and Joginder Sharma then held their nerves to put India into the final. Harbhajan Singh had figures of 1/24. With the context of the game heading into the 18th over, his spell went a long way in ensuring India pulled off a tight defense. Harbhajan Singh picked up his first and only five-wicket haul in the IPL during the 2011 season. It was at the Wankhede Stadium against Chennai Super Kings where Harbhajan led the way for Mumbai Indians' thrilling eight-run win. Asked to bat first, MI were struggling for a good part of the innings before a blistering 87 from Rohit Sharma powered them to a competitive 164/4. In reply, CSK were in control of the chase despite a couple of early wickets. This was thanks to Mike Hussey and Subramaniam Badrinath steering the ship. Harbhajan picked up the all-important wicket of Suresh Raina prior to the Hussey-Badrinath stand. Hussey and skipper MS Dhoni fell quickly but with Badrinath looking solid with a lot of batting to come, CSK were still favorites. Enter Harbhajan Singh. The veteran offie took out Anirudha Srikkanth before scalping three wickets in the 18th over to register his maiden five-for in the IPL. Harbhajan's spell of 5/18 derailed the CSK chase and catapulted MI to an eight-run victory. Mumbai Indians lost their first four games in IPL 2015 and were staring down the abyss early in the competition. In a must-win clash against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in Bengaluru, MI racked up a mammoth 209/7. This was courtesy of half-centuries from Unmukt Chand and Lendl Simmons. In reply, the RCB innings never got going with Chris Gayle struggling to get his timing right. With the pressure of the dot balls piling up, skipper Rohit Sharma introduced Harbhajan Singh into the attack in the fifth over. The set Manvinder Bisla was first castled by the veteran. Harbhajan then returned to put Gayle out of his misery in the ninth over, bowling him through the gate. AB de Villiers came out all guns blazing, not showing respect to a certain Lasith Malinga either. With MI under pressure, Rohit turned to Harbhajan and he responded with the wicket of Rilee Rossouw - once again, bowled. Once de Villiers was dismissed soon after, the result was a formality. Harbhajan was awarded the Player of the Match in what was his 100th IPL appearance. Ahead of the ICC World T20 2012, Harbhajan Singh had lost his place in the Indian team to fellow off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin . However, Harbhajan was in line for a comeback having been named in India's squad for the marquee event in Sri Lanka. In India's second Group A fixture against England in Colombo, Harbhajan Singh was brought back for his first international game in over a year. It turned out to be a memorable outing for the 'Turbanator' who had the English batters dancing to his tunes. Defending 170, India's bowlers didn't put a foot wrong with the English batters looking clueless from start to finish. It started with an early double-wicket burst from Irfan Pathan. Then the duo of Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla bamboozled the English middle-order with combined figures of 8-3-25-6. Harbhajan castled Eoin Morgan off just the second delivery he sent down, before scalping three more to finish with 4/12 off his four overs. His spell also included two maiden overs, as England folded for a paltry score of 80. Unsurprisingly, Harbhajan walked away with the Player of the Match award.","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2021/12/a32a3-16403689827615-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda"},{"title":"As A Youngster I Used To Look Up To Harbhajan Singh: Monty Panesar","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/as-a-youngster-i-used-to-look-up-to-harbhajan-singh-who-is-a-spinner-and-wears-a-patka-monty-panesar-2670463","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has announced retirement from all forms of cricket and tributes and wishes are pouring in from all corners for 'Turbanator'.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-24 18:57:56","full_description":"Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has announced retirement from all forms of cricket and tributes and wishes are pouring in from all corners for 'Turbanator'. Monty Panesar, the first Indian-origin Sikh cricketer, was inspired by Harbhajan as a youngster. \"He is one of the great spinners I have always admired and even when I was a youngster. You look up to someone as a youngster who looks like you, who is a spinner, who wears a patka, plays for India and I thought, maybe, I can do the same. He was a huge inspiration for me. \" Monty Panesar told ANI. Harbhajan Singh has represented India in 103 Test matches, 236 ODIs and 28 T20Is. For former England cricketer Monty Panesar it was the 2001 Test series against the then mighty Australia that shot him to fame. \"It is great to see Indian 'Turbanator' have such a successful career. I think people are going to remember him for the 2001 Test series against Australia which was sort of his introduction to international cricket and it was a phenomenal series. He is one of the most successful bowlers in all formats for India among spinners,\" Monty Panesar said. Harbhajan Singh has retired after scalping 417 wickets in 103 Tests at an average of 32.46. The member of 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 World Cup-winning teams is also the first Indian to scalp a test hat-trick. Overall, Jalandhar-born cricketer has played 367 international games and claimed 711 international wickets and scored 3,569 international runs. Promoted Harbhajan played his last red-ball match against Sri Lanka in 2015 and his last ODI was against South Africa in the same year. His last game for India was a T20I against UAE in the 2016 Asia Cup.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/pm484o78_harbhajan-singh-afp_625x300_24_December_21.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"Finally, there’s more to watch at the MCG than just grass growing","link":"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/finally-there-s-more-to-watch-at-the-mcg-than-just-grass-growing-20211224-p59k0e.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Greg Baum"],"video_url":null,"description":"Whether dealing with a well-set batsman, an accurate bowler or the pandemic, patience is the key.

One was the deliverance of Melbourne Football Club, which waited 58 years to win another premiership and then had to wait a little longer again to ritualise it at home at the MCG . They’ll say it was all worth it now. Their well-practised patience was their virtue and became their reward. It’s a dictum for our times. The other was the plentiful grass that grew on the pitch for a Victoria-NSW Sheffield Shield match last month and augurs well for an entertaining Boxing Day contest. The pitch for the last MCG Ashes Test four years ago was as action-packed as a hangover. Alison Mitchell welcomes the enlivening. The pioneering English commentator has been a regular on ABC and Seven for eight years and remembers too well Boxing Day matches that were not so much timeless as endless. “I don’t think anyone wants to revert to those matches of four or five years ago,” she said. Mitchell still thrills to the occasion of this cricket match gift-wrapped in a festive season. “Pushing through the post-Christmas lunch slumber, or having a strategic nap in the afternoon because you know you’ve got to be awake for the first ball,” she said. “It’s a competition to see who can stay up the longest? Can you make it to lunch?” Yep, Boxing Day can be a long game in itself. Martin Pakula knows about long games. As an avid Carlton fan, he’s been waiting 26 years, suddenly and improbably the second longest premiership hiatus in the AFL. As Victoria’s Minister for Sport, Tourism and Major Events, he’s had to authorise too many cancellations, cuts and curbs. “As I get older, I get more nostalgic and wistful about the Boxing Day Test,” Pakula said. “I was there when Lillee broke Lance Gibbs record in 1981. I was one of the idiots giving Hadlee a hard time in ’87. So seeing the fixture endure through this pandemic is really very significant to me. It’ll be pretty uplifting seeing a big crowd stream through the gates on Sunday, and I don’t think I’ll be the only one feeling that way.” A well populated (and inoculated) MCG on Boxing Day mid-morning will be a sight for sore eyes and heads. For the Long Room, it’s been a long time. But what can they expect? In Adelaide, England’s bowlers tried to play a long game and Australia outlasted them . One of the effects of the long game is to exaggerate everything, for better and worse. Now, after two defeats, England are internally riven, externally ridiculed and at a low ebb . Moreover, there is no country so prone to beating up on itself. “We’re so flipping good at self-doubt in this country,” David Lloyd once said. Lloyd - Bumble to all - is a former Test cricketer and England coach who retired this week after 22 years as a TV pundit. Self-doubt is rarely Australia’s problem even when it should be. With their captain, Pat Cummins restored to the team, and Marnus Labuschagne this week supplanting England captain Joe Root as the No.1 batsman in the world , they’re riding high. For England, it could be a very long game. “I can’t see how England can turn around 2-0 to win the Ashes,” said Mitchell. “I hope they can find a way to win a match of the remaining three.” England’s batting frailties are plain to see , but the back-ups are pre-tried and in any case have had minimal practice on tour. “It might just be that in the cycle of things, Australia have better players in their top six than England do,” Mitchell said. The forecast, not to be confused with the modelling, is set fair. The turnstiles will be open early. The MCC has warned people to make time for the extra formalities on the way in . It’s the long game, remember. In Adelaide, some ABC and BBC callers had to isolate because of a positive case. Mitchell was not involved, and since she is double-vaccinated and takes precautions does not fear contracting COVID-19. But she does worry about being contact-traced. “We obviously can’t work from home,” she said. “You just have to minimise your lifestyle so you’re not at risk.” She does wonder why rapid antigen tests are not part of the regime. In England, she cannot enter a media centre without evidence of a negative lateral flow test, the rapid antigen equivalent. The MCC sees COVID-19 safety as the long haul. “Our role as managers of the venue is to ensure that people feel safe and comfortable returning to such events where big crowds gather,” said Fox. “This is an outlook not just for the Test but also our remaining summer of cricket fixtures, and with an eye towards the 2022 AFL season. “There will be risks as we get used to living with the virus. However, the continued wellbeing of our members, fans, staff, players and administrators is critically important and at the forefront of our operational plans. “We have a Victorian government-endorsed COVIDSafe plan in place for this reason, and we’re very confident in our processes.” Let the long game … resume.

He also kept the dressing room atmosphere light and that is something really important.\" Ganguly, who captained India to a historic series win over Australia in 2001, with Harbhajan picking a hat-trick -- the first by an Indian bowler in the format -- added: \"His first full Test series against Australia in 2001 is the greatest that I have seen where one bowler single-handedly won the series. \"He was a captain's delight. As a bowler, he hated putting fielders in the deep. Bhajji has been an absolute match winner. He should be proud of what he has achieved. I want to tell him that the new innings in his life will be as exciting.\" Earlier on Friday, Harbhajan posted a video on YouTube announcing his retirement. \"There comes a time in life, you have to take tough decisions and you have to move on. From the past year, I wanted to make an announcement, and I was waiting for the right time to share the moment with all of you,\" Harbhajan said. Promoted \"Today, I am taking retirement from all formats of cricket. Mentally, I retired earlier but couldn't announce it. In any case, I have not been playing active cricket for some time but due to my commitment with Kolkata Knight Riders, I wanted to stay with them for the IPL (2021) season. But during the season, I had already made up my mind to retire,\" he added. \"Like every cricketer, I wanted to bid adieu, wearing an Indian jersey but destiny had other plans. For whichever team I have played, I have played with 100 per cent commitment, so that my team finishes on top.\"","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/epm2f1f_ganguly-harbhajan-afp_625x300_24_December_21.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"Factbox-Cricket-Australia v England - Third Ashes test","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2021/12/24/factbox-cricket-australia-v-england---third-ashes-test","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - Following is a factbox on the third Ashes test match between Australia and England, which starts on Sunday.

In a freewheeling chat with PTI, he spoke about his journey, the captains he played under, how Indian cricket could do with a bit more empathy and also the infamous 'Monkeygate' and the emotional toll it took on him. Excerpts Do you feel that you announced the retirement a bit late? Well, I must admit that the timing isn't right. I am late and there are no two ways about it (he last played for India in 2016). Normally, I have been a very punctual person all my life, stickler for (being on) time. Perhaps, this is one time, when I have been late. It's just that while being on the road, I missed the timing. But trust me, I am punctual. Has Indian cricket been fair to you in last few years? Look, life can always be looked at from two different prisms. If I see from where I started as a small town boy from Jalandhar with absolutely no idea about worldly matters to where I ended, I can only count my blessings and thank the almighty, thousand times over. Even then, it won't be enough to show how grateful I am because of cricket. But then if I look at things from a different prism, may be a thought would cross my mind that I could have had a different end to my cricket career. It's always a case of \"What If' in life, \"Yun hota toh kya hota\". But, then there's no point having regrets. What's the use in having regrets about what all happened five years back. Yes, I could have retired from the cricket ground, may be I could have retired earlier. But then, no regrets because when I look back, what I have got far outweighs what I didn't. No need to be bitter if I see where I started. Do you have any regrets about the 'Monkeygate' scandal involving Andrew Symonds? Do you feel angry about how it unfolded? Obviously it was something that was uncalled for. Whatever happened during that day in Sydney shouldn't have happened and also what it led to. It was really unnecessary. But forget about who said what. You and I both know truth has two sides. No one cared about my side of the truth in the whole episode. No one cared what I went through in those few weeks and how I was mentally sinking. I have never extensively given my side of the story but people will know about it in my upcoming autobiography. What I went through shouldn't have happened to anyone. You have 711 International wickets and 18 years between 1998 and 2016 in which nearly 800 days on the ground. How do you sum up your journey? Great. It's been a roller-coaster journey. Loads of ups and downs. But that's how life is. Even sea waves have crests and troughs isn't it? Very blessed to have played for India for so long. If you played 377 games for India, well that's not a bad number. What would have happened if I wouldn't have been an India cricketer? Where would I have been and what would I have done with my life? Indian cricket gave me an identity. This is a forever debt and I will not be able to pay off. I am what I am because of he institution called Indian cricket. When I look back and see the kind of greats that I have played with -- Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag, MS Dhoni, Zaheer Khan. And last but not least, what a privilege it was to be Anil Kumble's bowling partner. An absolute legend who taught me a lot. You picked 32 wickets against Australia in 2001 Test series, won the 2007 T20 World Cup and also 2011 ODI World Cup. Which one is your favourite cricketing moment? For every cricketer, you need that one performance after which people will sit up and take serious notice. 2001 versus Australia was my watershed moment. If 32 wickets and a hat-trick wouldn't have happened against a team of that might, who would have spoken about me? I could well have ended being a footnote. Australia series ne mera wajood banaya. Mera astitva ke saath juda hai. (It's intrinsic to my identity). It proved that I won't disappear after one or two series. It proved I belonged here. Indian cricket was in a mess in 2000 after the match-fixing scandal. People had lost faith in the game. To bring them back to the stadium and make them fall in love with the game, you needed those 32 wickets or that 281 by VVS. It was a turnaround that Indian cricket needed. It was magical. Did you speak to all your teammates individually before announcing retirement? Well, I spoke to the BCCI president Sourav Ganguly, the man who made me the player I became. I told him about my decision. I also spoke to BCCI secretary Jay Shah and informed him about my decision. Both were very welcoming and wished me well. In my journey, BCCI had played a big role and I am indebted to them. I spoke to Mumbai Indians owner Akash Ambani as the franchise had a big role in my life. Everyone is very special to me, who have been a part of my journey. Some like Sachin paaji, Dada, VVS (Laxman), Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh), Viru (Virender Sehwag), Ashu (Ashish Nehra) are like family. You played most of your cricket under Sourav Ganguly and MS Dhoni. Give us a sense of how you would compare them as leader of men? It's a simple answer for me. Sourav Ganguly hand held me at that juncture of my career when I was a 'No One'. But when Dhoni became the captain, I was a \"Someone\". So you need to understand the big difference. Dada knew I had skills but didn't know whether I will deliver. In case of Dhoni, he knew that I have been there and done that. He knew that I have won matches before him and will win a few for him also. In life and in profession, you need that one person, who will guide you at the proper moment and Sourav was that man for me. If Sourav wouldn't have fought for me and got me in the team, who knows, today you might not be taking this interview of mine. Sourav is the leader who made me what I am. But yes, Dhoni certainly was a very good captain and he carried the legacy of Sourav and with Dhoni, together we fought some great battles that I will certainly cherish. But coming back to the phase after the 2011 England tour where you had that abdominal muscle tear and post that you hardly played Tests till 2016. Don't you feel that establishment back then, both in the team and outside could have given you greater support? No doubt things could have been better. After I came back from injury in 2011, where did I get enough chances? It just kept spiralling downward. Before I realised, I was pushed out of scheme of things. Promoted Yes, if at that point, if someone would have cared for me and in a broader sense, how Indian cricket handled its players, may be my career could have been different. But no regrets. Those who were decision makers did what they felt was right. So I have nothing to say. Yes, I was bitter back then but when I now look at things, no bitterness.

The first Test match of India’s tour of South Africa 2021-22 will commence in Centurion from December 26 (Sunday). The Boxing-Day Test will kick-start a busy international season for both the teams as they will be playing non-stop cricket both at home and away from now onwards. India, who haven’t won a Test series in South Africa, wouldn’t have got a better venue than the SuperSport Park to start proceedings of this tour. Readers must note that two out of their three Test victories in South Africa have come at the SuperSport Park. Having won both their Tests in Centurion so far, it would be extremely special for India to win their first three Tests at an overseas venue. As far as the hosts are concerned, even they have a stellar Test record in Centurion winning 21 and losing just two (both against India) out of their 26 Test here. Centurion, whose last Test was the Boxing Day Test of 2020, will be hosting one after an exact year. Super Sport Park cricket stadium Test records Talking about the highest run-scorers in Test matches at this venue, there are no points for guessing that former South African batters namely Hashim Amla (1,356), Jacques Kallis (1,267), AB de Villiers (1,257), Mark Boucher (656) and Ashwell Prince (581) dominate the list.

The top-five wicket-takers in Centurion Tests are Dale Steyn (59), Makhaya Ntini (54), Kagiso Rabada (35), Morne Morkel (32) and Kallis (31). A slight difference in the bowling department is the presence of an active pacer in Rabada. Below is the list of Top five wicket-takers in Centurion Tests among active players: S.

Harbhajan announced his retirement through a video he posted on social media on Friday. \"There comes a time in life, you have to take tough decisions and you have to move on. From the past year, I wanted to make an announcement, and I was waiting for the right time to share the moment with all of you. Today, I am taking retirement from all formats of cricket. Mentally, I retired earlier but couldn't announce it. In any case, I have not been playing active cricket for some time but due to my commitment with Kolkata Knight Riders, I wanted to stay with them for the IPL (2021) season. But during the season, I had already made up my mind to retire,\" Harbhajan said. \"Like every cricketer, I wanted to bid adieu, wearing an Indian jersey but destiny had other plans. For whichever team I have played, I have played with 100 per cent commitment, so that my team finishes on top,\" he added. \"Whatever I have managed to achieve in my life, it is thanks to the blessings of my Guruji Sant Harcharan Singh. He gave direction to my life and all his teachings will continue to stay with me. My father Sardar Sardev Singh Plaha and my mother Avtar Kaur Plaha have struggled a lot to make sure my dreams come true. It's thanks to their hardwork that I could play international cricket.\" Promoted Here are some of the reactions from the cricket fraternity: Harbhajan is a World Cup winner in both ODIs and T20Is and is among only four Indian bowlers to take more than 400 wickets in Test cricket. He was also the first Indian to take a hat-trick in Tests for India.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/pnmvupeo_harbhajan-singh-afp_625x300_24_December_21.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"}]}
