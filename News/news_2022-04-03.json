The Men in Green beat Aaron Finch's men by nine wickets to win the 3-match series by a scoreline of 2-1. Australia beat Pakistan in the series opener. However, Babar Azam and Co. bounced back in style by recording back-to-back wins, thereby securing this ICC Cricket World Cup Super League series. Courtesy of this win, Pakistan have returned to the eighth position in the standings. Earlier today, New Zealand overtook them by defeating the Netherlands in the second ODI of their 3-match series. Meanwhile, the Australian cricket team failed to enter the Top 3 of the points table. They have 70 points to their name from 12 matches. Bangladesh, England and India occupy the top three spots in the standings. Opening batter Imam-ul-Haq played an important role in Pakistan's 2-1 series win against the Aussies. The left-handed batter scored a ton in the first ODI. However, the other batters could not back him, resulting in Pakistan's defeat. Imam continued in the same vein and smashed another century in the second ODI. Babar Azam supported him with a ton in that game as Pakistan pulled off their highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket history. In the final match of the series that took place earlier today, Imam remained not out on 89 runs off 100 balls to help Pakistan chase a 211-run target in 37.5 overs. Babar top-scored with a 115-ball 105 while Haris Rauf and Mohammad Wasim took three wickets each in the first innings.

With this win GT are now ranked third in the points table. Gujarat had a tough job in hand as they were to defend 171 runs. GT skipper took the work in his hand as he bowled the second over of the innings and took the wicket of Tim Seifert on the very first ball. After the first wicket, Mandeep Singh joined in the middle. The duo stitched a small partnership before Prithvi was sent back by Lokie for 10. With two wickets down inside the powerplay, DC wanted a partnership. However, Mandeep was dismissed in the same over by Lokie. The game was drifting away from Delhi but the partnership between captain Rishabh Pant and last game's hero Lalit Yadav steadied DC's ship. The pair took Delhi's total near 100. Unfortunately, Yadav got run out in the 12th over of the match, thanks to an acrobatic effort by Abhinav Manohar. Rishabh was then joined by Rovman Powell in the middle. A small partnership was building and thus GT skipper brought back his lead pacer Lokie, who then removed dangerous-looking Pant on 43. DC were keeping their hopes high as the required rate was within reach. However, wickets kept tumbling at one end while Powell stood at the non-striker's end. In the end, Mohammad Shami removed Powell on 20 to end DC's chase. Earilier, Shubman Gill struck an imperious 84 off just 46 balls to power Gujarat Titans to 171 for six. Gill, who struck six boundaries and four sixes during his stunning innings, and captain Hardik Pandya (31) revived the Titans innings with a 65-run partnership for the third wicket as they lost Matthew Wade (1) and (13) cheaply after being asked to bat. Wade was out in the third ball of the innings off (3/23) while (1/32) bamboozled Shankar, who went for a slog sweep only to see his stumps cart-wheeling. Gill was in imperious form during his knock as he made amends of his cheap dismissal -- zero runs -- in the previous match. He hoisted Axar Patel for a six early on and then smashed the same bowler for another maximum in the 16th over. His best shot was the straight six off Kuldeep in the 15th over. He was finally out in the 18th over off (2/34) with Axar Patel taking an easy catch at deep mid-wicket. Gill and Hardik denied the DC bowlers any success for 7.5 overs, while adding 65 runs during that crucial period after the Titans were 44 for two in the seventh over. Hardik took time to settle down but just when he getting into his grooves, he got out, hitting straight to Powell at long-on off the bowling of Ahmed. The Titans captain struck four boundaries during his 27-ball knock. David Miller and Rahul Tewatia contributed unbeaten 20 and 14 respectively.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gujarat Titans vs Delhi Capitals: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/gujarat-titans-vs-delhi-capitals-live-score-over-match-10-t20-16-20-updates-2859311","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Gujarat Titans vs Delhi Capitals from Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune.

Pandya also began really well and so did Shami. Rashid was not at his best but got the important wicket of Thakur. Rahul Tewatia, Varun Aaron and Shankar filled in as the 5th bowler and that is where the game slipped out of Gujarat's hand. They went for over 10 per over. However, the rest bowled really well at the end and helped their side get over the line. Coming to the game now, it swung like a pendulum, from one way to the other. To be honest, Delhi had it in their bag as they headed into the last 5 overs but they just could not hold their nerve. The problem for them was wickets in heaps. They lost that at the beginning. Then there was a superb stand between Pant and Lalit Yadav who got them back into the game. Then the partnership between Powell and Pant turned the tide towards Delhi. However, three in quick time put the responsibility of taking them over the line on Powell. His wicket though was the killer blow and in the end, they have fallen well short. Two games and two matches of the highest quality! Also, to everyone's surprise, both the times, it is the side batting first who have come out on top. That is so not the trend in this tournament. Gujarat is only the second team this season to have defended a total and they have done so brilliantly. Also, it just shows how difficult it is to defend with dew around. No dew in both the games and scores which were being tracked down easily have been defended. 19.6 overs (1 Run) Tossed up on middle. Kuldeep Yadav sweeps it but gets a top edge. The ball falls short of the deep square leg fielder and a single is taken. So a comfortable win for Gujarat in the end. They win by 14 runs! 19.5 overs (0 Run) A fuller delivery on off. Kuldeep Yadav drives it to the cover fielder in the ring. 19.4 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Kuldeep Yadav decides to have some fun now! Tossed up on middle. Kuldeep Yadav dances down the track and tonks it over long on for a maximum. 19.3 overs (1 Run) On the shorter side again, around off. Mustafizur Rahman punches it to sweeper cover for a single. 19.2 overs (1 Run) Shorter one on middle. Yadav pulls it to deep backward square leg for a single. 19.1 overs (0 Run) A flatter delivery and pushed outside off. Kuldeep Yadav leaves it alone. However, the umpire does not call it wide. 18.6 overs (1 Run) Off the splice and only one! Shorter and on the body, Yadav looks to pull, it goes off the splice towards mid on for one. 24 needed from the last over! 18.5 overs (0 Run) Another short one and on the body, this is guided to point. 18.4 overs (0 Run) That is a sharp bumper, he really bent his back on this one. Yadav looks to pull but misses. 18.3 overs (1 Run) Goes full and around off. Mustafizur Rahman drives it to long on for a single. 18.2 overs (0 Run) Back of a length, outside off. Mustafizur Rahman dabs it square on the off side. 18.1 overs (1 Run) On a length, on middle. Yadav works it to square leg for a single. 17.6 overs (0 Run) Dropped! Goes short, around off. Mustafizur Rahman looks to upper cut it but ends up slicing it towards fine leg. The fielder there does well to catch it but the ball pops out as his elbow hits the ground. Dot ball. 17.5 overs (1 Run) Ohh...direct hit and that would have been game over! A full delivery on off. Yadav drives it to mid off and there is a mix-up between the batters. There is a shy at the batter's end but the direct hit is missed. A single taken. 17.4 overs (1 Run) A full toss angling into the body from 'round the wicket. Mustafizur Rahman manages to defend it towards the off side and takes a single. So no hat-trick for Shami! Mustafizur Rahman is the last man in. 17.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! EDGED AND TAKEN! Two in two for Shami and Gujarat just the one wicket away. Shorter and on middle, Khaleel looks to fend it away, it goes off the outside edge and it is taken by the keeper by moving to his right. Khaleel Ahmed walks out to the middle now. 17.2 overs (0 Run) OUT! THREE REDS! Powell goes and that should be the game for Gujarat! Another lovely slower one, on middle, holds in the surface a touch. Powell is way too early in the swing, he misses and gets hit on the pad. An appeal and the finger is raised. Powell reviews in desperation. Replays roll in and it shows he has to walk back and also take a review along. Delhi will need something spectacular from the rest to win this now. 17.1 overs (1 Run) A run from the first ball! Good from Kuldeep! Lucky run but a run! Outside off, Yadav pushes at it, it goes off the inside edge past the off pole and down to fine leg for one. Powell on strike. 16.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Deft! A welcome boundary to end the over and that is not the end Ferguson would have wanted, to his spell and the over. 30 needed in 18. Outside off, clever batting. Ferguson guides it past short third man and into the third man fence. 16.5 overs (1 Run) On the bounce! Shorter and on middle, Yadav pulls, it goes towards deep square leg, on the bounce for one. Ferguson has one ball to go, can he get Powell? 16.4 overs (0 Run) A dot! Outside off, Yadav looks to guide it past the keeper but is beaten. 16.3 overs (1 Run) Powell is happy to play this over out, understands this is Fergusons' last who is the best bowler today. Just watches it and guides it towards point for one more. 16.2 overs (1 Run) Yadav now gives strike over to Powell, just what he needs to do! On middle, this is tucked around the corner for one. Kuldeep Yadav is the next batter in. 16.1 overs (1 Run) A slower one on middle, Powell works it on the leg side for one. Just what Gujarat wanted, Powell of strike and Kuldeep on strike. 15.6 overs (0 Run) OUT! LBW! Rashid Khan strikes now and Delhi lose their seventh wicket now! It's a googly again that pitches on middle. Thakur looks to flick it but misses. The ball hits him on the pads and there is an appeal. The umpire raises his finger. However, Shardul Thakur decides to review it. The replays roll in and the UltraEdge shows no bat involved. The Ball Tracker rolls and it shows three reds so, Thakur has to walk back as the original decision stays. 38 needed now from 24 balls! 15.5 overs (2 Runs) A googly on middle and leg. Shardul Thakur works it to fine leg for a couple. 15.4 overs (0 Run) A googly on middle and leg. Shardul Thakur looks to clip it but misses. The ball brushes his pads and goes to the keeper. Wade fails to collect it cleanly again. 15.4 overs (5 Runs) FIVE WIDES! Bonus runs for Delhi! Full and down the leg side. Thakur looks to clip it but misses. Wade misses it too and the ball races away for a boundary. 15.3 overs (0 Run) A full delivery and outside off. Thakur pushes it to short third man. 15.2 overs (1 Run) Pushed quicker on middle and leg. Powell works it to deep square leg for a single. 15.1 overs (0 Run) A flatter and slightly shorter delivery on middle and leg. Powell looks to work it towards the leg side but gets hit high on the pads.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637845381446732327.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CSK vs PBKS Head to Head in IPL history: Chennai Super Kings vs Punjab Kings records and stats IPL 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-csk-vs-pbks-head-to-head-in-ipl-history-chennai-super-kings-vs-punjab-kings-records-and-stats-ipl-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","CSK","IPL 2022","Punjab Kings","chennai super kings","csk","Indian Premier League","PBKS"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"CSK vs PBKS Head to Head in IPL history: The SportsRush presents for you the Head to Head statistics for IPL 2022 Match 11.

CAUGHT BEHIND! Lockie Ferguson picks the second wicket off the over and gets rid of Axar Patel now. It is short and down the leg side. Patel looks to pull it but gets a faint part of his blade. The ball goes right of Wade and he takes a good low catch to his right. Gujarat now inch ahead in this game. 46 needed now from 31 balls! 14.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Short ball and punished! It is a short ball on middle. Patel pulls it to deep mid-wicket for a boundary! 14.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Lovely shot, good timing by Patel and the skipper, Hardik Pandya misfields too to allow a boundary! This is fuller on off. Patel creams the drive through covers, Pandya moves to his right to stop it but it goes through for a boundary. 14.2 overs (0 Run) A yorker on off. Axar Patel blocks it out. DRINKS! The game is heading to a really good finish! The wicket of Pant means it is evenly balanced! We have seen what Axar is capable off and he has Powell on the other side. Gujarat have quality bowlers to come now. Who will come out on top? Powell holds the key for Delhi we believe and his wicket will turn the game in the favor of the bowling side. 14.1 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! What an inspired bowling change from Hardik Pandya! Lockie Ferguson is brought into the attack and strikes straightaway! Gets the big fish and this is a huge moment in the game. Lockie Ferguson comes 'round the wicket and serves it short, around off.

An expnesive one but a wicket in it. 11.5 overs (1 Run) NOT OUT! Powell is in! Good work through from Shankar! On middle, this is worked to the left of the bowler. Pant calls for one. Shankar gets to the ball and hits the stumps at the keeper's end. It is taken upstaris, replays show that Powell is in. Rovman Powell is the next man in. 11.4 overs (0 Run) OUT! RUN OUT! That is the only way this stand looked like it would be broken! Lucky dismissal and Gujarat needed this big time! On the pads, Pant works it to square leg. Yadav is off for a run but is sent back as it goes straight to the fielder. Lalit slips as he turns, Abhinav Manohar throws it to the bowler who whips the bails off. It is taken upstairs. Replays show that Shankar did step on the stumps before he caught the ball but only one bail fell. He dislodged the other bail with the ball in his hand. OUT flashes on the big screen, Pant is not happy with the decision but Lalit has to walk back. 11.3 overs (0 Run) A dot! Need a lot more do Gujarat! A slowe one outside off, Pant comes down the track and swings but misses. Pant knows he needs to score big in this over and is going after every ball. 11.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! This is poor bowling, very poor to be honest! On the pads, Pant flicks it over short fine leg and gets a boundary. Shankar under huge pressure now. 11.2 overs (1 Run) WIDE!

On middle, the slog sweep is out, it goes just over the mid-wicket fence. 9.1 overs (0 Run) Flatter and on off, this is pushed to covers. 8.6 overs (1 Run) This lands in no man's land! On middle, a slower one. Yadav chips it up in the air but it lands safe in the mid on region. One taken. 8.5 overs (1 Run) Pant misses out there! Shorter and on the body, Pant looks to pull but misses, it hits the body and goes towards the right of the keeper for one. Had he got it a little fine, it would have been a boundary. 8.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Up and over! Smacked away! Shorter in length and well outside off, Pant moves across and slaps it over point for a boundary. 8.3 overs (0 Run) On the shorter side and outside off, Pant looks to cut but underedges it on the off side to point. 8.2 overs (1 Run) Another shorter one, this holds in the surface a touch. It is pulled towards deep mid-wicket for one. 8.1 overs (1 Run) Short and this is pulled hard towards deep mid-wicket for one. 7.6 overs (1 Run) 9 from the over then! Shorter and outside off, this is cut through point for one. An expensive start from Rashid. 7.5 overs (1 Run) Flatter and on middle, this is worked through mid-wicket for one. 7.4 overs (1 Run) The googly, Pant looks to defend, this goes off the outer half through point for one. 7.3 overs (1 Run) Flatter and oiutside off, this is guided through point for one. 7.2 overs (1 Run) The sweep is out, this is played through square leg for one. Delhi getting a move on now. 7.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Welcome into the attack, Rashid! That is so clever! Flatter and on off, Pant plays it late and guides it past the slip fielder and into the fence. DRINKS! Great start for Gujarat with the ball. The skipper, Hardik Pandya decided to share the new ball with Shami and got the wicket in the very first ball. Shaw and Mandeep Singh started building a partnership after that but Lockie Ferguson just blew away both of them in his first over and brought Gujarat right on the top. However, Pant and Lalit Yadav have got enough talent to take Delhi to safer shores here but they need these two to carry on. Rashid Khan is into the attack now. 6.6 overs (1 Run) Back of a length, around off. Pant punches it to deep cover for a single. 6.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Outside edge, very difficult chance for Wade behind the stumps! Back of a length, around off. Pant looks to heave it across the line. However, he gets a thick outside edge. The ball goes over Wade. He looks to catch it with his left hand but fails to pouch it. A boundary. 6.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! That's what Pant can do! Goes short on middle at 142 kph. Pant pulls it to deep mid-wicket for a boundary. 6.3 overs (1 Run) Again beaten by the pace! Goes full and around leg. Yadav looks to clip it but misses. The ball hits his pads and goes towards the leg side. A single taken. 6.2 overs (0 Run) Pacy short ball on middle. Yadav looks to pull it but is too late on the shot. 6.1 overs (1 Run) What an effort from Rashid Khan near the ropes! A good-length delivery, on off. Pant looks to push it away. However, he gets a thick outside edge towards third man. Khan runs to his right and dives to stop it. A single taken. 5.6 overs (0 Run) Good bouncer on middle to end the Powerplay. Yadav looks to pull it but completely miscues it and the ball falls behind square on the leg side. After Powerplay, Delhi are 43/3! 5.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Lalit Yadav seems to be carrying the form of the last game. Lands on a length, on off. Yadav just covers the line of the ball and slams it towards deep mid-wicket for a boundary. 5.4 overs (0 Run) On the shorter side, on off. Yadav pulls but gets the bottom of his blade. The ball falls short of mid on. 5.3 overs (0 Run) On a length, on off. Yadav looks to defend but gets the inside edge onto his pad. 5.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Good shot! It is full, on off. Yadav drills it straight down the ground for a boundary. 5.1 overs (1 Run) Shami goes 'round the wicket and serves it full on leg. Pant clips it to fine leg for a single. However, there is a mix-up between the batters as Pant looks for a second run but is sent back on time and he gets back into his crease with a dive.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637845351471446743.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"AUS W vs ENG W Head to Head Record in ODIs: Australia vs England Women’s World Cup stats","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-aus-w-vs-eng-w-head-to-head-record-in-odis-australia-vs-england-womens-world-cup-stats/","keywords":["Cricket","Australia Women","England Women","ICC Women's World Cup 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"AUS W vs ENG W Head to Head: The SportsRush presents for you the Head to Head statistics for AUS-W vs ENG-W World Cup final.

After the Powerplay Pant introduced Kuldeep Yadav into the attack and the Chinaman bowler dismissed Shankar in his very first ball. Hardik Pandya joined Gill to take Gujarat`s total beyond the 50-run mark in the seventh over. These two notched up a 50-run partnership in just 38 balls and Gill went on to score his half-century off just 32 balls and Gujarat Titans managed to reach the triple-figure mark in 13.1 overs.

There is something for the bowlers in it. This game hangs in the balance at the moment. A good second half awaits. Shubman Gill is down for a chat. He says that it felt good to contribute runs for himself and team, He adds that the plan was to keep rotating the strike whenever possible. Tells that the wicket is good and it was holding a bit in the start but got better as the game progressed. Mentions that anything between 165-180 is a good score on this wicket and hopes that they can defend it. Delhi started off well, they were really good for the first 10 overs. The likes of Mustafizur Rahman, Kuldeep Yadav and Thakur bowled decently up front. However, they leaked a lot of runs from the 10th over to the 16th. They, though came back strongly by picking up wickets at regular intervals towards the end. Gujarat did not have the best of starts with the bat as they lost a wicket early. Shankar and Gill then steadied things but Shankar fell immediately after the Powerplay. Pandya then came in and formed another stand with Gill. It was slow going for the first 10 but then the two upped the ante. However, both Gill and Pandya fell at the wrong time. When Gill was batting 180 or even 190 looked possible but after his wicket, the boundaries were difficult to come by and in the end they have fallen short of that mark. Delhi have done extremely well to keep the score to under 180 but Gujarat won't be very disappointed with where they are at the moment. The score is probably just about par, especially with no signs of dew as of now. 19.6 overs (1 Run) A bye to end the innings! A slower length ball, outside off and angling across the batter. Khan goes for a big swing across the line but misses. The ball goes to the keeper off the bounce and the batters run a bye. Rashid Khan is the next man in. 19.5 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT!

Gujarat have accelerated brilliantly after the first Drinks break! The platform is laid now for the likes of Miller to go big. 180 is surely in sight for them but the question is, can they get to that score? Delhi on the other hand, need to take wickets if they have to stem the run flow or they will be chasing a big total. Mustafizur Rahman is back on. 15.6 overs (6 Runs) SIX! This time a flat bullet!

The ball hits his pads and there is a stifled appeal. However, it is going down leg and the batters run a leg bye as the ball goes towards the off side. 5.1 overs (1 Run) Goes fuller on off. Gill pushes it to mid off and takes a quick single.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637845273336662249.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LIVE Score GT vs DC, IPL 2022: At halfway mark, Gujarat struggle at 66-2","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/live-score-gt-vs-dc-ipl-2022-pant-wins-toss-opts-to-bowl-at-mca-pune-122040200760_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Catch all the Live Scores and Updates from GT vs DC here.

We have a different bowling line-up so we will bowl. We felt comfortable chasing after the first game,” Pant told Star Sports at the toss. Meanwhile, a brave Gujarat Titans captain Hardik Pandya disclosed that he wanted to bat first at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium tonight. Providing reasons for the same, Pandya seemed to be unafraid of going against the flow. “To be honest, we were going to bat. There is a breeze, so we don’t expect dew. We trained here and we didn’t see much of dew, which is the reason why we wanted to bat,” Pandya told Star Sports at the toss. Why is David Warner not playing vs Gujarat Titans today?
