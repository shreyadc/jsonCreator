Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.Earlier, Sports personalities expressed their best wishes for the national team ahead of Sunday’s T20 World Cup clash against India, terming the encounter crucial and urging the Green Shirts to play with passion.Olympic gold medalist Arshad Nadeem prayed for the team’s success and advised the players to compete with courage and determination.Pakistani squash legend Jahangir Khan conveyed his good wishes, saying he hoped the team would enter the field fully prepared. He noted that defeat is part of the game but emphasised the importance of testing one’s strength to the fullest.Hockey Olympian Islahuddin described the Pakistan-India contest as the biggest match in the world, adding that the national squad is balanced with a strong bowling attack and solid fielding. He said maintaining control of the situation before the match was a significant achievement by PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and that the team’s morale was high.Tennis star Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi also expressed optimism, saying Pakistan can cause a big upset today.Both sides will enter the match unbeaten after two matches, with India currently at the top of Group A owing to a superior net run-rate.Anticipation is building for another high-voltage encounter between the arch-rivals.Speaking at the pre-match press conference on Saturday, India captain Suryakumar Yadav described the fixture as unique in world cricket.“If you play any game, there is always pressure. And when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion,” he said.“No matter how much you say it’s just another game, at the back of your mind, you know which game you are going to play.”Yadav added that his side would look to keep things simple and focus on execution.“Whatever hard work we have done, whatever practice we have been doing, we try to execute it in the games.”India could be boosted by the return of opener Abhishek Sharma, who was hospitalised with a stomach infection ahead of the match against Namibia but has reportedly recovered in time for Sunday’s clash.Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha welcomed the prospect of Sharma’s return.“I hope Abhishek Sharma plays tomorrow. I hope he’s recovering well. We want to play against the best,” he said.Yadav responded lightheartedly: “If he wants him to play, then we will play him tomorrow.”Much of the pre-match discussion has centred on Pakistan off-spinner Usman Tariq, whose sling-arm action has drawn attention and debate.With the Colombo surface expected to aid spin, Tariq could prove pivotal.“He is definitely a trump card for us,” Agha said, while acknowledging speculation surrounding the bowler’s unconventional style.“Before such an important match, there is a lot of talk about mind games.”Yadav, however, insisted his team would adapt.“Sometimes there is a question in the exam that is out of the syllabus. You can’t leave that question. You have to adapt in your own way,” he remarked.“He is a different character when he comes to bowl. But we can’t just surrender. We practise with similar types of bowlers.”Both teams have navigated early challenges in the tournament.India recovered from a slow start against the USA before producing a commanding performance against Namibia.Pakistan, meanwhile, edged past the Netherlands in a tight opener and followed it up with a more assured win over the USA.Historically, India came on top in previous T20 World Cup clashes, winning seven of the eight previous encounters.Pakistan’s only victory came in the 2021 edition, when Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan guided their side to a 10-wicket triumph in Dubai.Despite the statistics, both captains stressed the importance of starting afresh.“We don’t have a good record in the World Cups, but whenever you play a new match, you have to play good cricket to win,” Agha said.Yadav echoed that sentiment, warning against complacency.“You can’t carry what has happened in the past onto the ground. Sometimes it creates complacency. If you want to be in control and have a relaxed mind, it is important to always start fresh.”With momentum, pride and the top spot in Group A on the line, Sunday’s clash promises another gripping chapter in the India-Pakistan rivalry.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["none@none.com (web desk)"],"language":"english","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2026-02-15 13:08:11","pubDateTZ":"UTC","fetched_at":"2026-02-15 13:40:47","image_url":"https://i.aaj.tv/large/2026/02/15180957c150e08.webp","video_url":null,"source_id":"aaj_tv","source_name":"Aaj English Tv","source_priority":179387,"source_url":"https://english.aaj.tv","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/aaj_tv.jpg","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"2529e854bfe722cab60793b9eae74453","link":"https://www.thedailyjagran.com/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-icc-t20-world-cup-2026-handshake-controversy-continues-suryakumar-yadav-salman-agha-ind-vs-pak-toss-update-colombo-10298869","title":"IND vs PAK: Controversy Continues!

Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.Earlier, Sports personalities expressed their best wishes for the national team ahead of Sunday’s T20 World Cup clash against India, terming the encounter crucial and urging the Green Shirts to play with passion.Olympic gold medalist Arshad Nadeem prayed for the team’s success and advised the players to compete with courage and determination.Pakistani squash legend Jahangir Khan conveyed his good wishes, saying he hoped the team would enter the field fully prepared. He noted that defeat is part of the game but emphasised the importance of testing one’s strength to the fullest.Hockey Olympian Islahuddin described the Pakistan-India contest as the biggest match in the world, adding that the national squad is balanced with a strong bowling attack and solid fielding. He said maintaining control of the situation before the match was a significant achievement by PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and that the team’s morale was high.Tennis star Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi also expressed optimism, saying Pakistan can cause a big upset today.Both sides will enter the match unbeaten after two matches, with India currently at the top of Group A owing to a superior net run-rate.Anticipation is building for another high-voltage encounter between the arch-rivals.Speaking at the pre-match press conference on Saturday, India captain Suryakumar Yadav described the fixture as unique in world cricket.“If you play any game, there is always pressure. And when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion,” he said.“No matter how much you say it’s just another game, at the back of your mind, you know which game you are going to play.”Yadav added that his side would look to keep things simple and focus on execution.“Whatever hard work we have done, whatever practice we have been doing, we try to execute it in the games.”India could be boosted by the return of opener Abhishek Sharma, who was hospitalised with a stomach infection ahead of the match against Namibia but has reportedly recovered in time for Sunday’s clash.Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha welcomed the prospect of Sharma’s return.“I hope Abhishek Sharma plays tomorrow. I hope he’s recovering well. We want to play against the best,” he said.Yadav responded lightheartedly: “If he wants him to play, then we will play him tomorrow.”Much of the pre-match discussion has centred on Pakistan off-spinner Usman Tariq, whose sling-arm action has drawn attention and debate.With the Colombo surface expected to aid spin, Tariq could prove pivotal.“He is definitely a trump card for us,” Agha said, while acknowledging speculation surrounding the bowler’s unconventional style.“Before such an important match, there is a lot of talk about mind games.”Yadav, however, insisted his team would adapt.“Sometimes there is a question in the exam that is out of the syllabus. You can’t leave that question. You have to adapt in your own way,” he remarked.“He is a different character when he comes to bowl. But we can’t just surrender. We practise with similar types of bowlers.”Both teams have navigated early challenges in the tournament.India recovered from a slow start against the USA before producing a commanding performance against Namibia.Pakistan, meanwhile, edged past the Netherlands in a tight opener and followed it up with a more assured win over the USA.Historically, India came on top in previous T20 World Cup clashes, winning seven of the eight previous encounters.Pakistan’s only victory came in the 2021 edition, when Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan guided their side to a 10-wicket triumph in Dubai.Despite the statistics, both captains stressed the importance of starting afresh.“We don’t have a good record in the World Cups, but whenever you play a new match, you have to play good cricket to win,” Agha said.Yadav echoed that sentiment, warning against complacency.“You can’t carry what has happened in the past onto the ground. Sometimes it creates complacency. If you want to be in control and have a relaxed mind, it is important to always start fresh.”With momentum, pride and the top spot in Group A on the line, Sunday’s clash promises another gripping chapter in the India-Pakistan rivalry.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["none@none.com (web desk)"],"language":"english","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2026-02-15 13:08:11","pubDateTZ":"UTC","fetched_at":"2026-02-15 13:40:47","image_url":"https://i.aaj.tv/large/2026/02/15180957c150e08.webp","video_url":null,"source_id":"aaj_tv","source_name":"Aaj English Tv","source_priority":179387,"source_url":"https://english.aaj.tv","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/aaj_tv.jpg","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"2529e854bfe722cab60793b9eae74453","link":"https://www.thedailyjagran.com/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-icc-t20-world-cup-2026-handshake-controversy-continues-suryakumar-yadav-salman-agha-ind-vs-pak-toss-update-colombo-10298869","title":"IND vs PAK: Controversy Continues!
