I thought this was (the) right time for me to decide.” Tamim’s decision came just two days after he came under heavy criticism for deciding to play against Afghanistan in the first ODI of a three-match series, despite admitting to not being 100 percent fit. Bangladesh Cricket Board President Nazmul Hassan led the criticism, calling the player’s professionalism into question. Tamim scored 13 off 21 balls in a 17-run defeat to a side Bangladesh would be expected to beat. The 34-year-old batsman scored 8,313 runs in the 241 ODIs he played for Bangladesh, hitting 14 centuries – both run-scoring statistics being the highest by any Bangladeshi batsman. The veteran left-hander scored 5,134 runs from the 134 innings he played in 70 Tests, scoring 10 hundreds. He retired from Twenty20 internationals in 2022. ‘Fearless batting’ Former Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar led tributes to Tamim. “One of the greatest batsman Bangladesh ever produced,” he said. Ashfaque Nipun, one of Bangladesh’s top filmmakers, said: “You will always be remembered for your fearless batting days Tamim Iqbal.” Tamim is the only Bangladeshi to have scored centuries in all three formats of the game. The batsman is from a cricketing family in Chittagong – his uncle Akram Khan and elder brother Nafees Iqbal also represented Bangladesh – and established himself as one of the country’s most dependable players. He burst into international cricket with a powerful six off a stunned Zaheer Khan against India in the 2007 ODI World Cup in the West Indies. It was only Tamim’s fifth one-day international, but the first against any serious opposition, and his 51 against India helped Bangladesh take a five-wicket win. In 2010, he became the first Bangladeshi to score a century at Lord’s before his four consecutive fifties played a big part in the country’s journey towards their first Asia Cup final in 2012.","content":"“Yesterday against Afghanistan was my last international game, I am retiring from international cricket effective right now,” Tamim told reporters.

The Australian national anthem was largely respected by the Headingley crowd, but loud boos greeted Aussie opener Usman Khawaja and David Warner at the crease. The atmosphere was even more febrile by the end of the first over, after Stuart Broad dismissed Warner and immediately proceeded to rev up the crowd on the Western Terrace . Earlier in the day, a smattering of boos welcomed Pat Cummins on the field for the pre-match toss. The hosts' anger with their rivals over the controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow at Lord's has shown no sign of dissipating in the days since Australia won the second Test at the Home of Cricket, with fans incensed with the morally questionable act committed by Alex Carey. A smattering of boos greeted Australian captain Pat Cummins (left) at the toss The end of the Australian national anthem was greeted by loud boos from the crowd David Warner (left) and Usman Khawaja walked to the crease to a hostile reception After ducking out of the way of a Cameron Green bouncer, Bairstow - who had been standing in his crease - scratched his mark before walking down the wicket to talk to Stokes , thinking that the ball was dead. Carey, noticing Bairstow leave his ground, stumped his rival wicketkeeper, with the umpires deeming that the ball was still alive. The Lord's crowd was enraged by the Australians' behaviour and they were greeted by a volatile Long Room at the lunch break , with the MCC later apologising after the players were upset by the members' actions. Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport But the Leeds masses opted not to relent in expressing their disgust towards the Aussies and were heard booing the players ahead of play on Thursday. Barmy Army spokesman George Gallantree warned that a hostile atmosphere would await the Aussies. 'It's going to be louder than a Taylor Swift concert on the Western Terraces in the afternoon after the fans have had a few Tetley Bitters,' Gallantree told News Corp. 'Lord's is more of a library compared to Headingley.' Despite the controversial nature of Sunday's antics, Cummins believes his side behaved exceptionally well at Lord's. Stuart Broad immediately whipped up the crowd in a frenzy after removing Warner The Aussie opener walked back to the pavilion to a cascade of boos after being dismissed ‘It doesn’t really bother me to be honest,’ said Cummins when first asked how he felt about his integrity being questioned. ‘I think the way our team has conducted ourselves over the last couple of years has been flawless and we’ve been fantastic. 'I think that was shown again on day five at Lord’s.' But was an opportunity missed for you to do something positive for the game? ‘We’ve all moved on and as I said the other day we’ve done nothing wrong,’ said Cummins after first bizarrely bringing up the Trevor Chappell underarm bowling incident from the 1970s. ‘A hundred per cent I think it’s a real thing,’ said Cummins when asked about the spirit of cricket. ‘At times I think there’s nuance about it and people see it a little bit differently. You talk about cricket as a gentleman’s sport and you want to regain respect for the opposition and umpires and fans at all times. 'It’s one of the strengths of our game. I think our players were outstanding in that regard.’ Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Share or comment on this article: Ashes: Australia BOOED by Headingley crowd following Jonny Bairstow incident e-mail Add comment Comments 7 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Dominic Hogan Host commentator 11:33 Seven overs: Australia 31-1 (Labuschagne 11, Khawaja 6) Huge cheers greet Mark Wood at the Kirkstall Lane End, as he replaces Broad after just three overs. He extracts a good amount of away swing first ball up too as it flies past Labuschagne at a decent 90mph. And it's woken up the Barmy Army trumpeter who is giving us our first real song of the day in honour of the new bowler. Wood continues to taunt Labuschagne with his raw pace, and his third blasts past the batter at 95mph. He'd only bowled two balls before that one! The fourth takes a thunk as it hits the pad of Labuschagne well outside the line of the stumps, but such is the speed of the delivery that it flies to the boundary for four more byes behind Bairstow. A block for the fifth and the sixth really snorts up at Labuschagne who does well not to flick it up to the slips A brilliant, threatening first over from Wood which will give the visitors something to consider. 11:29 Six overs: Australia 27-1 (Labuschagne 12, Khawaja 6) Robinson is finding his length now to the left-handed Khawaja, who doesn't bite and just leaves it. He tries to get a run off the third delivery after a fairly high block, but quickly decides against with the fielder steaming in. The fourth finds an edge, though, but it doesn't quite carry to Stokes at fifth slip after Khawaja plays it with soft enough hands. Huge shout for LBW after the fifth delivery initially, but Stokes is having none of it - it did look a little high. Nothing coming from the final ball of the over as Robinson wraps up a very good maiden over. 11:25 Five overs: Australia 27-1 (Labuschagne 12, Khawaja 6) A single for Khawaja off Broad's first delivery of his third over before a typically flamboyant leave from his partner, who then flicks one through mid-wicket for a couple of runs. The fourth ball catches an outside edge off Labuschagne, but he plays it well into the ground with soft hands, but Brook does really well to stop it at third slip. Labuschagne then clips the fifth ball through mid-wicket once again, but this time he can find the boundary for the fourth boundary already, before blocking the final. It's a very quick out-field as the ball just flies away from anyone who comes close. England's Stuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of Australia's David Warner 11:20 Four overs: Australia 20-1 (Khawaja 5, Labuschagne 6) Robinson comes in again from the Football Stand End, and can't tempt Labuschagne into a shot early doors, as he leaves the first three. The fourth though comes back across the leg side a touch and Labuschagne punishes with a four through mid wicket. A brief shout for LBW off the fifth but there was a decent inside edge off it onto the Aussie's pads, before Robinson finishes with a better delivery that is blocked easily enough by Labuschagne. 11:16 Three overs: Australia 16-1 (Khawaja 5, Labuschagne 2) Broad is back in and a couple of dots start the over before a ball with a bit more behind it flies passed Jonny Bairstow on the leg side and runs away for four byes. Wood saves a single at mid-on from before Khawaja hits a good drive through long off for four. 11:11 Two overs: Australia 8-1 (Khawaja 1, Labuschagne 2) Robinson will bowl from the other end, and it's two dots to start his first over. Labuschagne gets off the mark before a no ball from Robinson. Khawaja also up and running now with a single before his recently-arrived team-mate blocks the penultimate ball, following up with a close shave as Robinson narrowly, narrowly avoids his outside edge with a real beauty. 11:07 One over: Australia 5-1 (Khawaja 0, Labuschagne 1) The roars go up a notch as Broad tries to get the crowd going as he prepares to bowl at the new man at the crease, Manus Labuschagne. The Aussie No 3 gets something on a ball that was coming in at his pads and sees out the last ball of a dramatic opening over. 11:03 WICKET - Warner 4 c Crawley, b Broad Warner's gone! The opener plays at a slightly wider delivery and it catches the edge and flies through to Zak Crawley in the slips who takes a really brilliant catch as that one absolutely flew at him. Warner is gone in the first over, and once again it's Stuart Broad who removes him. 11:01 First ball It'll be Stuart Broad with it as the Notts bowler marks out his run-up and prepares to come in at his old foe David Warner. The 37-year-old comes in and bowls from the Kirstall Lane End and the Aussie clips it off his toes for four! 10:58 They're out on the pitch And now the unofficial England cricket national anthem does the rounds at Headingley, as Jerusalem blares out with the England side out on the pitch led of course by the skipper Ben Stokes to huge cheers. A fair few boos for Warner and Khawaja as they also make their way out to the middle. We're all set for a tremendous Test match, so don't go anywhere! 10:56 Can England make it 3-2? So less than five minutes to go now. England are backing themselves to pull off a 3-2 win and take this one, but how do you rate their chances? Australia have looked to have answers for almost everything that the hosts can throw at them - will we get something different at Headingley? It's time for the national anthems, and the first ball is now just moments away. Australia captain Pat Cummins and England captain Ben Stokes wait for the coin toss ahead of Day One 10:52 Some home favourites A few very popular Yorkshiremen in this England side. Brook, Root and Bairstow will all be out in front of a home crowd. Harry Brook of England throws a ball up during a training session before the 3rd Test Jonny Bairstow congratulated by fellow Yorkshireman Joe Root as he reaches his half-century 10:47 Rapid Wood's back in the side By all reports, Mark Wood was bowling some absolutely rapid stuff in practice ahead of the third Test, and that could be the missing ingredient from England's bowling in the first two Tests. Josh Tongue looked the most dangerous of the pace attack at Lord's, and is quicker than the likes of Anderson, Broad and Robinson, but Wood takes that pace to a whole new level, and is well capable of blasting his way through much of this Aussie batting line-up. The concern will be his fitness, have gone without a lot of cricket as a result of both paternity leave and injuries, but if he can get going at Headingley this morning then he will surely bring England a real point of difference. Mark Wood of England warms up England v Australia, The Ashes, 3rd Test, Day One 10:43 First Test in four years for Marsh Mitch Marsh comes in after Cummins mentioned a slight injury to Green, having last played a Test match in four years. His last opponent? England in the fifth Ashes Test of the 2019 series. The all-rounder took seven wickets in the match, including a five-for in the first innings and added 41 runs with the bat.

Mitch Marsh returns to Ashes team for Australia's clash with England Cummins has made a trio of alterations to his side, with Todd Murphy replacing Lyon, Scott Boland returning for Hazlewood while Green is replaced by Mitch Marsh. Mail Online 10:35 Boos for Carey The announcer goes through the teams and, suffice to say, the Yorkshire crowd will waste no time making their thoughts heard on the visitors. The biggest boo of all is of course saved for a certain Alex Carey. 10:33 Australia team news Cummins comes to the mic and is immediately booed. The skipper admits he would have bowled too before giving us his team news. Murphy, Marsh and Boland in for the injured Lyon, Green and Hazlewood. A slight smirk as Hussain brings up the hostile crowd... 10:31 Stokes puts Australia in to bat first Stokes straight away puts the visitors in to bat after Cummins incorrectly called tails. 10:30 Toss time Here we go... England win the toss! 10:29 Green on the wicket Mail Sport columnist Nasser Hussain has had a look at the wicket for Sky, and there's a fair amount of grass on the track, which means the ball will likely do a bit under the cloud. With sun forecast for tomorrow - which will favour the batting side - it looks a toss to win, putting the opponent in to bat with the hope of bowling them out for a good day under the sun tomorrow. Rainbow Laces colours on the stumps ahead of Day One of the Ashes 3rd Test match 10:26 Yorkshire has not forgotten Suffice it to say that the Yorkshire locals won't be forgetting Bairstow's dismissal in a hurry. And security at Headingley is set to be beefed up, too, with the toxicity rising after Lord's. Headingley chiefs will ramp up security ahead of third Ashes Test EXCLUSIVE: Mail Sport understands that the dramatic scenes at Lord's have formed part of the planning for what promises to be an incredibly hostile atmosphere in Yorkshire for the Australians. Mail Online Credit: @TheBarmyArmy - New painting outside of Headingley… 10:19 Another Headingley miracle? Fact of the matter is that England need to win this Test if they are to have any hopes of winning the Ashes, 2-0 down after back-to-back defeats. But when you're an England player looking for a miracle, Headingley is probably the first place you'd want to be. Stokes' heroics in 2019, Bob and Beefy in 1981 - will we get a third Ashes hero at this iconic ground from the England camp this week, or will it be a comprehensive victory for the visitors to wrap up a first overseas Ashes win in 22 years? 10:14 Some reaction to THAT run out issue We've heard a lot about the spirit of cricket, and whether it was infringed upon by Carey, but the reality is that the umpires gave the decision out, and off Bairstow trudged. If you've missed any of the fall out from that seismic moment in Ashes history, then here's a select few reactions to the issue that should give you a little bit of context for just how everyone is feeling about this one. STUART BROAD: It amazes me NOT ONE Aussie thought the appeal was wrong STUART BROAD: We saw it with Mitchell Starc's catch on Saturday evening: all of Australia thought it was out, all of England, me included, thought it was not out. Mail Online Pat Cummins defends controversial Jonny Bairstow dismissal PAUL NEWMAN: Pat Cummins today insisted his Australian players were 'outstanding' at Lord's and insisted he would act in exactly the same way if faced with another Jonny Bairstow situation. Mail Online Brendon McCullum says Australia have to 'live with' stumping decision The third Test of an increasingly fractious series starts at Headingley on Thursday, with Australian coach Andrew McDonald saying he was 'disappointed' by McCullum's reaction. Mail Online Michael Vaughan on why England haven't aimed up in Ashes Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan has outlined his belief that Brendon McCullum's team are hiding behind the 'spirit of cricket' defence when it comes to their sub-par Ashes performances. Mail Online 10:08 Hosts XI Not too far from the toss now. We already know who will be playing for the hosts, of course, but for a little refresher, take a look at the story below. The headlines are Wood, Woakes and Alli in, Pope, Anderson and Tongue are out. England make THREE changes for must-win third Ashes Test at Headingley England vice-captain Ollie Pope was ruled out of the rest of the summer with the dislocation of his right shoulder suffered at Lord's and Lawrence could have been a direct replacement at three. Mail Online 10:05 The visitors are in the building The visitors are in the house! You'd expect Carey has a tough few days in store in Yorkshire, deep Bairstow country.

Bairstow's stumping that, depending on which side of the world you hail from, was or wasn't in the spirit of the game has dominated the headlines ever since that fateful Sunday at the Home of Cricket. With England deep into their chase of 371 to win the second Test and Bairstow recently arriving at the crease, the last real able-bodied helped for Stokes on his war path, the Yorkshire keeper-batter had his stumps removed after wandering out of his crease a little too sharpish for Carey's liking at the end of the over. He was given out, and England ultimately fell short in their run chase, and since that moment pundits, coaches, and players former and current have had their say on the dismissal, and yet still nobody can agree on it, and it doesn't look like they will any time soon. Mind you, Broad's theatrical calls of 'in' and checking with Australia players if he could leave his crease hardly helped. Whatever your opinion - unforgiveable carelessness from Bairstow or shamefaced opportunism from Carey - at least it's got everyone talking about the cricket!

Well, as Test matches go, there wasn't a lot missing from Lord's was there? It had everything - an eco-protest, breath-taking fast bowling, a series-ending injury, a sublime century for the ages, and just a smidge of controversial decisions going both ways. We'll be getting into that particular incident in a bit naturally, but it's worth remembering what a feast of action we had just a few days ago. For those of you who missed it... Seven things we learned from second Ashes Test After winning the toss, the England captain put the Australians in to bat, with the visitors putting on 416 in an innings that saw many point fingers at the hosts' poor bowling at an overcast Lord's. Mail Online 09:44 Weather check A quick look at the weather, and it looks to be a typical British summer's day up in sunny Yorkshire. That's right, cloud cover predicted for most of the day, with a suggestion of sunlight breaking through towards the early evening. A hint of rain on the cards at around 11am, and again at 5pm, but no deluge the likes of which we saw at Lord's forecast. Saturday and Monday look somewhat less positive on the weather front, but Friday looks a gorgeous day for batting with the sun shining all day. It looks a great toss to win, this. Not that there's ever really a bad toss to win, mind. There is cloud cover predicted for most of the day, with a suggestion of sunlight breaking through towards the early evening. 09:40 Quick look at the pitch Bumble has been out early this morning to give us all a sneak preview of the wicket.

Morning everyone and welcome to Mail Sport's coverage of day one of the third Ashes Test! It has hardly been four days since we were all roaring Ben Stokes on and gasping in shock at... well, we all know what... and watching Australia tighten their grip on the Ashes as the matches come thick and fast in this hectic series. We've got about an hour and half until first ball, which should give us plenty of time to go through the fall-out that is still falling out from Lord's, as well as build up to a Test that - needless to say - is bound to have a bit of bite to it.

Morgan and Hughes have been trading verbal volleys on social media in the aftermath of Jonny Bairstow's controversial dismissal on Day Five of the second Test at Lord's . The former fast bowler turned down the chance to appear on the 'Piers Morgan Uncensored’ show, and was incensed when Morgan shared his refusal on social media. 'Life’s pretty good when you jump on social media and you see some moron like Pies Morgan having a crack at you,' Hughes said on SENQ’s Breakfast with Pat and Heals on Thursday. 'A producer of his show asked me privately if I wanted to go on his show and I declined respectively and said ‘no I don’t want to’ and then he puts it to social media. Merv Hughes has branded Piers Morgan a 'moron' as their Twitter spat intensified Morgan bemoaned Australian cricketers and journalists had shunned his invitations to debate Jonny Bairstow's dismissal on his TV show Bairstow (middle) was controversially run out by Alex Carey after wandering down the wicket 'Like I said, he’s an attention-seeker and a flog.' Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Hughes and Morgan were involved in a social media spat after the Aussie great slammed England fans for branding the Aussies as 'cheats' as tempers flared at Lord's after Bairstow was controversially dismissed. The England batsman ducked a Cameron Green bouncer that was the last ball of the over, marked his ground and then walked forward to talk to batting partner Ben Stokes . Australia wicket-keeper Alex Carey seized the opportunity to throw the ball at the stumps and effectively ran Bairstow out - even though it was classified as a stumping. The incident has reignited the debate between the adhering to the laws of the game and playing in the right spirit. But Hughes, who played 53 Tests for Australia, said Carey and Aussie captain Pat Cummins had nothing to apologise for . 'Throw up spirit of cricket and bad sportsmanship, that’s what happens when rules and laws go against your argument,' he wrote on Twitter. 'So pull your head in, apologise, and get on with life.' Hughes branded Morgan a 'flog' and an 'attention-seeker' on social media His comments prompted Morgan to invite him on his show. 'Want to come on my show and debate this tonight, Merv?,' he tweeted. Hughes' response was typically succinct: 'I've been asked and answered privately Piers- why would you take it to social media?' In the same tweet, Hughes branded Morgan a 'flog' and an 'attention-seeker'. On Monday, the British broadcaster bemoaned Australian cricketers and journalists had shunned his invitations to debate Bairstow's dismissal on his show. 'We can’t get a single Australian cricketer or journalist to come on to defend yesterday’s outrage,' Morgan said. 'Any takers? Or should I assume you’ve all realised it’s beyond defending.' Australian cricket commentator and The Final Word podcast co-host Geoff Lemon explained why Aussie cricketers and journalists had declined Morgan's invitation Australian cricket commentator and The Final Word podcast co-host Geoff Lemon replied: 'This is why we declined, champion. 'We don’t need to help you make money by berating people on air. We all have actual work to do.' The third Ashes Test starts at Headingley on Thursday with Australia needing to avoid defeat to retain the urn for the fourth consecutive time. Victory in Leeds would secure Australia's first series win in England since 2001.

England captain Ben Stokes won the toss on a green Headingley wicket, and continued his preference for bowling first in home conditions in what is a must-win third Ashes Test for the hosts. Marsh comes in as one of three changes for Australia, with Scott Boland replacing fellow pace bowler Josh Hazlewood after selectors opted to put him on ice for the match. Todd Murphy makes his return to Test cricket as expected, with fellow spinner Nathan Lyon out for the rest of the series with a calf tear. Green was ruled out of the match on Thursday morning with a sore hamstring, an injury medical staff believe he picked up in the 43-run second Test win at Lord's last week as Australia took a 2-0 lead. Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport England have also made three changes, with Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood into the team for James Anderson, Josh Tongue and the injured Ollie Pope. Australia have asked for extra security around their families for this match, with a hostile reception expected following the dramas of the Lord's Test. A draw for Australia will mean they retain the Ashes, while a win would wrap up the series with two Tests still to play.

Bangladesh Cricket Board President Nazmul Hassan led the criticism, calling the player’s professionalism into question. Tamim scored 13 off 21 balls in a 17-run defeat to a side Bangladesh would be expected to beat.

The batsman is from a cricketing family in Chittagong – his uncle Akram Khan and elder brother Nafees Iqbal also represented Bangladesh – and established himself as one of the country’s most dependable players. He burst into international cricket with a powerful six off a stunned Zaheer Khan against India in the 2007 ODI World Cup in the West Indies. It was only Tamim’s fifth one-day international, but the first against any serious opposition, and his 51 against India helped Bangladesh take a five-wicket win. In 2010, he became the first Bangladeshi to score a century at Lord’s before his four consecutive fifties played a big part in the country’s journey towards their first Asia Cup final in 2012.","content":"“Yesterday against Afghanistan was my last international game, I am retiring from international cricket effective right now,” Tamim told reporters. He broke into tears as he made the announcement, with the press conference broadcast live on national television. “There was no sudden reason behind this, I was thinking about it for quite some time,” he added. “I was talking about it with my family members for a few days. I thought this was (the) right time for me to decide.” Tamim’s decision came just two days after he came under heavy criticism for deciding to play against Afghanistan in the first ODI of a three-match series, despite admitting to not being 100 percent fit. Bangladesh Cricket Board President Nazmul Hassan led the criticism, calling the player’s professionalism into question. Tamim scored 13 off 21 balls in a 17-run defeat to a side Bangladesh would be expected to beat.

The Australian national anthem was largely respected by the Headingley crowd, but loud boos greeted Aussie opener Usman Khawaja and David Warner at the crease. The atmosphere was even more febrile by the end of the first over, after Stuart Broad dismissed Warner and immediately proceeded to rev up the crowd on the Western Terrace . Earlier in the day, a smattering of boos welcomed Pat Cummins on the field for the pre-match toss. The hosts' anger with their rivals over the controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow at Lord's has shown no sign of dissipating in the days since Australia won the second Test at the Home of Cricket, with fans incensed with the morally questionable act committed by Alex Carey. A smattering of boos greeted Australian captain Pat Cummins (left) at the toss The end of the Australian national anthem was greeted by loud boos from the crowd David Warner (left) and Usman Khawaja walked to the crease to a hostile reception After ducking out of the way of a Cameron Green bouncer, Bairstow - who had been standing in his crease - scratched his mark before walking down the wicket to talk to Stokes , thinking that the ball was dead. Carey, noticing Bairstow leave his ground, stumped his rival wicketkeeper, with the umpires deeming that the ball was still alive. The Lord's crowd was enraged by the Australians' behaviour and they were greeted by a volatile Long Room at the lunch break , with the MCC later apologising after the players were upset by the members' actions. Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport But the Leeds masses opted not to relent in expressing their disgust towards the Aussies and were heard booing the players ahead of play on Thursday. Barmy Army spokesman George Gallantree warned that a hostile atmosphere would await the Aussies. 'It's going to be louder than a Taylor Swift concert on the Western Terraces in the afternoon after the fans have had a few Tetley Bitters,' Gallantree told News Corp. 'Lord's is more of a library compared to Headingley.' Despite the controversial nature of Sunday's antics, Cummins believes his side behaved exceptionally well at Lord's. Stuart Broad immediately whipped up the crowd in a frenzy after removing Warner The Aussie opener walked back to the pavilion to a cascade of boos after being dismissed ‘It doesn’t really bother me to be honest,’ said Cummins when first asked how he felt about his integrity being questioned. ‘I think the way our team has conducted ourselves over the last couple of years has been flawless and we’ve been fantastic. 'I think that was shown again on day five at Lord’s.' But was an opportunity missed for you to do something positive for the game? ‘We’ve all moved on and as I said the other day we’ve done nothing wrong,’ said Cummins after first bizarrely bringing up the Trevor Chappell underarm bowling incident from the 1970s. ‘A hundred per cent I think it’s a real thing,’ said Cummins when asked about the spirit of cricket. ‘At times I think there’s nuance about it and people see it a little bit differently. You talk about cricket as a gentleman’s sport and you want to regain respect for the opposition and umpires and fans at all times. 'It’s one of the strengths of our game. I think our players were outstanding in that regard.’ Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Share or comment on this article: Ashes: Australia BOOED by Headingley crowd following Jonny Bairstow incident e-mail Add comment Comments 7 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Dominic Hogan Host commentator 11:33 Seven overs: Australia 31-1 (Labuschagne 11, Khawaja 6) Huge cheers greet Mark Wood at the Kirkstall Lane End, as he replaces Broad after just three overs. He extracts a good amount of away swing first ball up too as it flies past Labuschagne at a decent 90mph. And it's woken up the Barmy Army trumpeter who is giving us our first real song of the day in honour of the new bowler. Wood continues to taunt Labuschagne with his raw pace, and his third blasts past the batter at 95mph. He'd only bowled two balls before that one! The fourth takes a thunk as it hits the pad of Labuschagne well outside the line of the stumps, but such is the speed of the delivery that it flies to the boundary for four more byes behind Bairstow. A block for the fifth and the sixth really snorts up at Labuschagne who does well not to flick it up to the slips A brilliant, threatening first over from Wood which will give the visitors something to consider. 11:29 Six overs: Australia 27-1 (Labuschagne 12, Khawaja 6) Robinson is finding his length now to the left-handed Khawaja, who doesn't bite and just leaves it. He tries to get a run off the third delivery after a fairly high block, but quickly decides against with the fielder steaming in. The fourth finds an edge, though, but it doesn't quite carry to Stokes at fifth slip after Khawaja plays it with soft enough hands. Huge shout for LBW after the fifth delivery initially, but Stokes is having none of it - it did look a little high. Nothing coming from the final ball of the over as Robinson wraps up a very good maiden over. 11:25 Five overs: Australia 27-1 (Labuschagne 12, Khawaja 6) A single for Khawaja off Broad's first delivery of his third over before a typically flamboyant leave from his partner, who then flicks one through mid-wicket for a couple of runs. The fourth ball catches an outside edge off Labuschagne, but he plays it well into the ground with soft hands, but Brook does really well to stop it at third slip. Labuschagne then clips the fifth ball through mid-wicket once again, but this time he can find the boundary for the fourth boundary already, before blocking the final. It's a very quick out-field as the ball just flies away from anyone who comes close. England's Stuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of Australia's David Warner 11:20 Four overs: Australia 20-1 (Khawaja 5, Labuschagne 6) Robinson comes in again from the Football Stand End, and can't tempt Labuschagne into a shot early doors, as he leaves the first three. The fourth though comes back across the leg side a touch and Labuschagne punishes with a four through mid wicket. A brief shout for LBW off the fifth but there was a decent inside edge off it onto the Aussie's pads, before Robinson finishes with a better delivery that is blocked easily enough by Labuschagne. 11:16 Three overs: Australia 16-1 (Khawaja 5, Labuschagne 2) Broad is back in and a couple of dots start the over before a ball with a bit more behind it flies passed Jonny Bairstow on the leg side and runs away for four byes. Wood saves a single at mid-on from before Khawaja hits a good drive through long off for four. 11:11 Two overs: Australia 8-1 (Khawaja 1, Labuschagne 2) Robinson will bowl from the other end, and it's two dots to start his first over. Labuschagne gets off the mark before a no ball from Robinson. Khawaja also up and running now with a single before his recently-arrived team-mate blocks the penultimate ball, following up with a close shave as Robinson narrowly, narrowly avoids his outside edge with a real beauty. 11:07 One over: Australia 5-1 (Khawaja 0, Labuschagne 1) The roars go up a notch as Broad tries to get the crowd going as he prepares to bowl at the new man at the crease, Manus Labuschagne. The Aussie No 3 gets something on a ball that was coming in at his pads and sees out the last ball of a dramatic opening over. 11:03 WICKET - Warner 4 c Crawley, b Broad Warner's gone! The opener plays at a slightly wider delivery and it catches the edge and flies through to Zak Crawley in the slips who takes a really brilliant catch as that one absolutely flew at him. Warner is gone in the first over, and once again it's Stuart Broad who removes him. 11:01 First ball It'll be Stuart Broad with it as the Notts bowler marks out his run-up and prepares to come in at his old foe David Warner. The 37-year-old comes in and bowls from the Kirstall Lane End and the Aussie clips it off his toes for four! 10:58 They're out on the pitch And now the unofficial England cricket national anthem does the rounds at Headingley, as Jerusalem blares out with the England side out on the pitch led of course by the skipper Ben Stokes to huge cheers. A fair few boos for Warner and Khawaja as they also make their way out to the middle. We're all set for a tremendous Test match, so don't go anywhere! 10:56 Can England make it 3-2? So less than five minutes to go now. England are backing themselves to pull off a 3-2 win and take this one, but how do you rate their chances? Australia have looked to have answers for almost everything that the hosts can throw at them - will we get something different at Headingley? It's time for the national anthems, and the first ball is now just moments away. Australia captain Pat Cummins and England captain Ben Stokes wait for the coin toss ahead of Day One 10:52 Some home favourites A few very popular Yorkshiremen in this England side. Brook, Root and Bairstow will all be out in front of a home crowd. Harry Brook of England throws a ball up during a training session before the 3rd Test Jonny Bairstow congratulated by fellow Yorkshireman Joe Root as he reaches his half-century 10:47 Rapid Wood's back in the side By all reports, Mark Wood was bowling some absolutely rapid stuff in practice ahead of the third Test, and that could be the missing ingredient from England's bowling in the first two Tests. Josh Tongue looked the most dangerous of the pace attack at Lord's, and is quicker than the likes of Anderson, Broad and Robinson, but Wood takes that pace to a whole new level, and is well capable of blasting his way through much of this Aussie batting line-up. The concern will be his fitness, have gone without a lot of cricket as a result of both paternity leave and injuries, but if he can get going at Headingley this morning then he will surely bring England a real point of difference. Mark Wood of England warms up England v Australia, The Ashes, 3rd Test, Day One 10:43 First Test in four years for Marsh Mitch Marsh comes in after Cummins mentioned a slight injury to Green, having last played a Test match in four years. His last opponent? England in the fifth Ashes Test of the 2019 series. The all-rounder took seven wickets in the match, including a five-for in the first innings and added 41 runs with the bat.

The biggest boo of all is of course saved for a certain Alex Carey. 10:33 Australia team news Cummins comes to the mic and is immediately booed.

England win the toss! 10:29 Green on the wicket Mail Sport columnist Nasser Hussain has had a look at the wicket for Sky, and there's a fair amount of grass on the track, which means the ball will likely do a bit under the cloud. With sun forecast for tomorrow - which will favour the batting side - it looks a toss to win, putting the opponent in to bat with the hope of bowling them out for a good day under the sun tomorrow. Rainbow Laces colours on the stumps ahead of Day One of the Ashes 3rd Test match 10:26 Yorkshire has not forgotten Suffice it to say that the Yorkshire locals won't be forgetting Bairstow's dismissal in a hurry.

Headingley chiefs will ramp up security ahead of third Ashes Test EXCLUSIVE: Mail Sport understands that the dramatic scenes at Lord's have formed part of the planning for what promises to be an incredibly hostile atmosphere in Yorkshire for the Australians. Mail Online Credit: @TheBarmyArmy - New painting outside of Headingley… 10:19 Another Headingley miracle? Fact of the matter is that England need to win this Test if they are to have any hopes of winning the Ashes, 2-0 down after back-to-back defeats. But when you're an England player looking for a miracle, Headingley is probably the first place you'd want to be. Stokes' heroics in 2019, Bob and Beefy in 1981 - will we get a third Ashes hero at this iconic ground from the England camp this week, or will it be a comprehensive victory for the visitors to wrap up a first overseas Ashes win in 22 years? 10:14 Some reaction to THAT run out issue We've heard a lot about the spirit of cricket, and whether it was infringed upon by Carey, but the reality is that the umpires gave the decision out, and off Bairstow trudged. If you've missed any of the fall out from that seismic moment in Ashes history, then here's a select few reactions to the issue that should give you a little bit of context for just how everyone is feeling about this one. STUART BROAD: It amazes me NOT ONE Aussie thought the appeal was wrong STUART BROAD: We saw it with Mitchell Starc's catch on Saturday evening: all of Australia thought it was out, all of England, me included, thought it was not out. Mail Online Pat Cummins defends controversial Jonny Bairstow dismissal PAUL NEWMAN: Pat Cummins today insisted his Australian players were 'outstanding' at Lord's and insisted he would act in exactly the same way if faced with another Jonny Bairstow situation. Mail Online Brendon McCullum says Australia have to 'live with' stumping decision The third Test of an increasingly fractious series starts at Headingley on Thursday, with Australian coach Andrew McDonald saying he was 'disappointed' by McCullum's reaction. Mail Online Michael Vaughan on why England haven't aimed up in Ashes Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan has outlined his belief that Brendon McCullum's team are hiding behind the 'spirit of cricket' defence when it comes to their sub-par Ashes performances. Mail Online 10:08 Hosts XI Not too far from the toss now. We already know who will be playing for the hosts, of course, but for a little refresher, take a look at the story below. The headlines are Wood, Woakes and Alli in, Pope, Anderson and Tongue are out. England make THREE changes for must-win third Ashes Test at Headingley England vice-captain Ollie Pope was ruled out of the rest of the summer with the dislocation of his right shoulder suffered at Lord's and Lawrence could have been a direct replacement at three.

Bairstow's stumping that, depending on which side of the world you hail from, was or wasn't in the spirit of the game has dominated the headlines ever since that fateful Sunday at the Home of Cricket. With England deep into their chase of 371 to win the second Test and Bairstow recently arriving at the crease, the last real able-bodied helped for Stokes on his war path, the Yorkshire keeper-batter had his stumps removed after wandering out of his crease a little too sharpish for Carey's liking at the end of the over. He was given out, and England ultimately fell short in their run chase, and since that moment pundits, coaches, and players former and current have had their say on the dismissal, and yet still nobody can agree on it, and it doesn't look like they will any time soon. Mind you, Broad's theatrical calls of 'in' and checking with Australia players if he could leave his crease hardly helped. Whatever your opinion - unforgiveable carelessness from Bairstow or shamefaced opportunism from Carey - at least it's got everyone talking about the cricket!

Well, as Test matches go, there wasn't a lot missing from Lord's was there? It had everything - an eco-protest, breath-taking fast bowling, a series-ending injury, a sublime century for the ages, and just a smidge of controversial decisions going both ways. We'll be getting into that particular incident in a bit naturally, but it's worth remembering what a feast of action we had just a few days ago. For those of you who missed it... Seven things we learned from second Ashes Test After winning the toss, the England captain put the Australians in to bat, with the visitors putting on 416 in an innings that saw many point fingers at the hosts' poor bowling at an overcast Lord's. Mail Online 09:44 Weather check A quick look at the weather, and it looks to be a typical British summer's day up in sunny Yorkshire. That's right, cloud cover predicted for most of the day, with a suggestion of sunlight breaking through towards the early evening. A hint of rain on the cards at around 11am, and again at 5pm, but no deluge the likes of which we saw at Lord's forecast. Saturday and Monday look somewhat less positive on the weather front, but Friday looks a gorgeous day for batting with the sun shining all day. It looks a great toss to win, this. Not that there's ever really a bad toss to win, mind. There is cloud cover predicted for most of the day, with a suggestion of sunlight breaking through towards the early evening. 09:40 Quick look at the pitch Bumble has been out early this morning to give us all a sneak preview of the wicket.

It has hardly been four days since we were all roaring Ben Stokes on and gasping in shock at... well, we all know what... and watching Australia tighten their grip on the Ashes as the matches come thick and fast in this hectic series. We've got about an hour and half until first ball, which should give us plenty of time to go through the fall-out that is still falling out from Lord's, as well as build up to a Test that - needless to say - is bound to have a bit of bite to it.

Morgan and Hughes have been trading verbal volleys on social media in the aftermath of Jonny Bairstow's controversial dismissal on Day Five of the second Test at Lord's . The former fast bowler turned down the chance to appear on the 'Piers Morgan Uncensored’ show, and was incensed when Morgan shared his refusal on social media. 'Life’s pretty good when you jump on social media and you see some moron like Pies Morgan having a crack at you,' Hughes said on SENQ’s Breakfast with Pat and Heals on Thursday. 'A producer of his show asked me privately if I wanted to go on his show and I declined respectively and said ‘no I don’t want to’ and then he puts it to social media.

Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Hughes and Morgan were involved in a social media spat after the Aussie great slammed England fans for branding the Aussies as 'cheats' as tempers flared at Lord's after Bairstow was controversially dismissed. The England batsman ducked a Cameron Green bouncer that was the last ball of the over, marked his ground and then walked forward to talk to batting partner Ben Stokes . Australia wicket-keeper Alex Carey seized the opportunity to throw the ball at the stumps and effectively ran Bairstow out - even though it was classified as a stumping. The incident has reignited the debate between the adhering to the laws of the game and playing in the right spirit. But Hughes, who played 53 Tests for Australia, said Carey and Aussie captain Pat Cummins had nothing to apologise for . 'Throw up spirit of cricket and bad sportsmanship, that’s what happens when rules and laws go against your argument,' he wrote on Twitter. 'So pull your head in, apologise, and get on with life.' Hughes branded Morgan a 'flog' and an 'attention-seeker' on social media His comments prompted Morgan to invite him on his show. 'Want to come on my show and debate this tonight, Merv?,' he tweeted. Hughes' response was typically succinct: 'I've been asked and answered privately Piers- why would you take it to social media?' In the same tweet, Hughes branded Morgan a 'flog' and an 'attention-seeker'. On Monday, the British broadcaster bemoaned Australian cricketers and journalists had shunned his invitations to debate Bairstow's dismissal on his show. 'We can’t get a single Australian cricketer or journalist to come on to defend yesterday’s outrage,' Morgan said. 'Any takers? Or should I assume you’ve all realised it’s beyond defending.' Australian cricket commentator and The Final Word podcast co-host Geoff Lemon explained why Aussie cricketers and journalists had declined Morgan's invitation Australian cricket commentator and The Final Word podcast co-host Geoff Lemon replied: 'This is why we declined, champion. 'We don’t need to help you make money by berating people on air. We all have actual work to do.' The third Ashes Test starts at Headingley on Thursday with Australia needing to avoid defeat to retain the urn for the fourth consecutive time. Victory in Leeds would secure Australia's first series win in England since 2001.

England captain Ben Stokes won the toss on a green Headingley wicket, and continued his preference for bowling first in home conditions in what is a must-win third Ashes Test for the hosts. Marsh comes in as one of three changes for Australia, with Scott Boland replacing fellow pace bowler Josh Hazlewood after selectors opted to put him on ice for the match. Todd Murphy makes his return to Test cricket as expected, with fellow spinner Nathan Lyon out for the rest of the series with a calf tear. Green was ruled out of the match on Thursday morning with a sore hamstring, an injury medical staff believe he picked up in the 43-run second Test win at Lord's last week as Australia took a 2-0 lead. Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport England have also made three changes, with Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood into the team for James Anderson, Josh Tongue and the injured Ollie Pope. Australia have asked for extra security around their families for this match, with a hostile reception expected following the dramas of the Lord's Test. A draw for Australia will mean they retain the Ashes, while a win would wrap up the series with two Tests still to play.

The 34-year-old left-hander made the shock announcement a day after his team lost the opening ODI against Afghanistan here. \"This is the end for me. I have given my best. I have tried my best.

PCB image Zaka Ashraf, who was the favourite to become the next Pakistan Cricket Board head, on Thursday, took charge as the chairman of a new 10-member PCB management committee. The committee has been formed by the Pakistan government for a period of four months. The management committee will hold its first meeting in Lahore on Thursday. The decision to make Ashraf the committee head comes after PCB had to postpone the Board election after the formation of its board of governors — which elects the new chairman — was challenged in multiple courts around the country.

The PCB election of its new chairman was postponed on June 26 after Baluchistan High Court accepted the petition of Gul Mohammad Kakar, a former member of the PCB management committee, and set a hearing for July 17.

In 2010, he became the first Bangladeshi to score a century at Lord’s before his four consecutive fifties played a big part in the country’s journey towards their first Asia Cup final in 2012.","pubDate":"2023-07-06 10:03:10","image_url":"https://i.samaaenglish.tv/large/2023/07/061500579166977.jpg?r=150310","source_id":"samaaenglish","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The Ashes: Australia booed by Headingley crowd ahead of England Test","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12270119/The-Ashes-Australia-booed-Headingley-crowd-ahead-England-Test.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The hosts' anger with their rivals over the controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow at Lord's has shown no sign of dissipating in the days since Australia won the second Test.","content":"Australia stars David Warner and Usman Khawaja BOOED at Headingley as Pat Cummins' side receive hostile reception following volatile Lord's Test Australia have received a frosty welcome to Headingley by England fans The English remain incensed by the Aussies' behaviour at Lord's Pat Cummins's side were roundly booed by fans ahead of the third Test Live Ashes third Test: Follow all the action from Headingley Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport By Ollie Lewis For Daily Mail Australia Published: 10:58, 6 July 2023 | Updated: 11:32, 6 July 2023 e-mail 7 View comments Australia unsurprisingly received a hostile welcome to Headingley as England fans aimed boos at Pat Cummins ' side ahead of the third Ashes Test. The Australian national anthem was largely respected by the Headingley crowd, but loud boos greeted Aussie opener Usman Khawaja and David Warner at the crease. The atmosphere was even more febrile by the end of the first over, after Stuart Broad dismissed Warner and immediately proceeded to rev up the crowd on the Western Terrace . Earlier in the day, a smattering of boos welcomed Pat Cummins on the field for the pre-match toss. The hosts' anger with their rivals over the controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow at Lord's has shown no sign of dissipating in the days since Australia won the second Test at the Home of Cricket, with fans incensed with the morally questionable act committed by Alex Carey. A smattering of boos greeted Australian captain Pat Cummins (left) at the toss The end of the Australian national anthem was greeted by loud boos from the crowd David Warner (left) and Usman Khawaja walked to the crease to a hostile reception After ducking out of the way of a Cameron Green bouncer, Bairstow - who had been standing in his crease - scratched his mark before walking down the wicket to talk to Stokes , thinking that the ball was dead. Carey, noticing Bairstow leave his ground, stumped his rival wicketkeeper, with the umpires deeming that the ball was still alive. The Lord's crowd was enraged by the Australians' behaviour and they were greeted by a volatile Long Room at the lunch break , with the MCC later apologising after the players were upset by the members' actions. Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport But the Leeds masses opted not to relent in expressing their disgust towards the Aussies and were heard booing the players ahead of play on Thursday. Barmy Army spokesman George Gallantree warned that a hostile atmosphere would await the Aussies. 'It's going to be louder than a Taylor Swift concert on the Western Terraces in the afternoon after the fans have had a few Tetley Bitters,' Gallantree told News Corp. 'Lord's is more of a library compared to Headingley.' Despite the controversial nature of Sunday's antics, Cummins believes his side behaved exceptionally well at Lord's. Stuart Broad immediately whipped up the crowd in a frenzy after removing Warner The Aussie opener walked back to the pavilion to a cascade of boos after being dismissed ‘It doesn’t really bother me to be honest,’ said Cummins when first asked how he felt about his integrity being questioned. ‘I think the way our team has conducted ourselves over the last couple of years has been flawless and we’ve been fantastic. 'I think that was shown again on day five at Lord’s.' But was an opportunity missed for you to do something positive for the game? ‘We’ve all moved on and as I said the other day we’ve done nothing wrong,’ said Cummins after first bizarrely bringing up the Trevor Chappell underarm bowling incident from the 1970s. ‘A hundred per cent I think it’s a real thing,’ said Cummins when asked about the spirit of cricket. ‘At times I think there’s nuance about it and people see it a little bit differently. You talk about cricket as a gentleman’s sport and you want to regain respect for the opposition and umpires and fans at all times. 'It’s one of the strengths of our game. I think our players were outstanding in that regard.’ Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Share or comment on this article: Ashes: Australia BOOED by Headingley crowd following Jonny Bairstow incident e-mail Add comment Comments 7 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Dominic Hogan Host commentator 11:33 Seven overs: Australia 31-1 (Labuschagne 11, Khawaja 6) Huge cheers greet Mark Wood at the Kirkstall Lane End, as he replaces Broad after just three overs. He extracts a good amount of away swing first ball up too as it flies past Labuschagne at a decent 90mph. And it's woken up the Barmy Army trumpeter who is giving us our first real song of the day in honour of the new bowler. Wood continues to taunt Labuschagne with his raw pace, and his third blasts past the batter at 95mph. He'd only bowled two balls before that one! The fourth takes a thunk as it hits the pad of Labuschagne well outside the line of the stumps, but such is the speed of the delivery that it flies to the boundary for four more byes behind Bairstow. A block for the fifth and the sixth really snorts up at Labuschagne who does well not to flick it up to the slips A brilliant, threatening first over from Wood which will give the visitors something to consider. 11:29 Six overs: Australia 27-1 (Labuschagne 12, Khawaja 6) Robinson is finding his length now to the left-handed Khawaja, who doesn't bite and just leaves it. He tries to get a run off the third delivery after a fairly high block, but quickly decides against with the fielder steaming in. The fourth finds an edge, though, but it doesn't quite carry to Stokes at fifth slip after Khawaja plays it with soft enough hands. Huge shout for LBW after the fifth delivery initially, but Stokes is having none of it - it did look a little high. Nothing coming from the final ball of the over as Robinson wraps up a very good maiden over. 11:25 Five overs: Australia 27-1 (Labuschagne 12, Khawaja 6) A single for Khawaja off Broad's first delivery of his third over before a typically flamboyant leave from his partner, who then flicks one through mid-wicket for a couple of runs. The fourth ball catches an outside edge off Labuschagne, but he plays it well into the ground with soft hands, but Brook does really well to stop it at third slip. Labuschagne then clips the fifth ball through mid-wicket once again, but this time he can find the boundary for the fourth boundary already, before blocking the final. It's a very quick out-field as the ball just flies away from anyone who comes close. England's Stuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of Australia's David Warner 11:20 Four overs: Australia 20-1 (Khawaja 5, Labuschagne 6) Robinson comes in again from the Football Stand End, and can't tempt Labuschagne into a shot early doors, as he leaves the first three. The fourth though comes back across the leg side a touch and Labuschagne punishes with a four through mid wicket. A brief shout for LBW off the fifth but there was a decent inside edge off it onto the Aussie's pads, before Robinson finishes with a better delivery that is blocked easily enough by Labuschagne. 11:16 Three overs: Australia 16-1 (Khawaja 5, Labuschagne 2) Broad is back in and a couple of dots start the over before a ball with a bit more behind it flies passed Jonny Bairstow on the leg side and runs away for four byes. Wood saves a single at mid-on from before Khawaja hits a good drive through long off for four. 11:11 Two overs: Australia 8-1 (Khawaja 1, Labuschagne 2) Robinson will bowl from the other end, and it's two dots to start his first over. Labuschagne gets off the mark before a no ball from Robinson. Khawaja also up and running now with a single before his recently-arrived team-mate blocks the penultimate ball, following up with a close shave as Robinson narrowly, narrowly avoids his outside edge with a real beauty. 11:07 One over: Australia 5-1 (Khawaja 0, Labuschagne 1) The roars go up a notch as Broad tries to get the crowd going as he prepares to bowl at the new man at the crease, Manus Labuschagne. The Aussie No 3 gets something on a ball that was coming in at his pads and sees out the last ball of a dramatic opening over. 11:03 WICKET - Warner 4 c Crawley, b Broad Warner's gone! The opener plays at a slightly wider delivery and it catches the edge and flies through to Zak Crawley in the slips who takes a really brilliant catch as that one absolutely flew at him. Warner is gone in the first over, and once again it's Stuart Broad who removes him. 11:01 First ball It'll be Stuart Broad with it as the Notts bowler marks out his run-up and prepares to come in at his old foe David Warner. The 37-year-old comes in and bowls from the Kirstall Lane End and the Aussie clips it off his toes for four! 10:58 They're out on the pitch And now the unofficial England cricket national anthem does the rounds at Headingley, as Jerusalem blares out with the England side out on the pitch led of course by the skipper Ben Stokes to huge cheers. A fair few boos for Warner and Khawaja as they also make their way out to the middle. We're all set for a tremendous Test match, so don't go anywhere! 10:56 Can England make it 3-2? So less than five minutes to go now. England are backing themselves to pull off a 3-2 win and take this one, but how do you rate their chances? Australia have looked to have answers for almost everything that the hosts can throw at them - will we get something different at Headingley? It's time for the national anthems, and the first ball is now just moments away. Australia captain Pat Cummins and England captain Ben Stokes wait for the coin toss ahead of Day One 10:52 Some home favourites A few very popular Yorkshiremen in this England side. Brook, Root and Bairstow will all be out in front of a home crowd. Harry Brook of England throws a ball up during a training session before the 3rd Test Jonny Bairstow congratulated by fellow Yorkshireman Joe Root as he reaches his half-century 10:47 Rapid Wood's back in the side By all reports, Mark Wood was bowling some absolutely rapid stuff in practice ahead of the third Test, and that could be the missing ingredient from England's bowling in the first two Tests. Josh Tongue looked the most dangerous of the pace attack at Lord's, and is quicker than the likes of Anderson, Broad and Robinson, but Wood takes that pace to a whole new level, and is well capable of blasting his way through much of this Aussie batting line-up. The concern will be his fitness, have gone without a lot of cricket as a result of both paternity leave and injuries, but if he can get going at Headingley this morning then he will surely bring England a real point of difference. Mark Wood of England warms up England v Australia, The Ashes, 3rd Test, Day One 10:43 First Test in four years for Marsh Mitch Marsh comes in after Cummins mentioned a slight injury to Green, having last played a Test match in four years. His last opponent? England in the fifth Ashes Test of the 2019 series. The all-rounder took seven wickets in the match, including a five-for in the first innings and added 41 runs with the bat.

Mitch Marsh returns to Ashes team for Australia's clash with England Cummins has made a trio of alterations to his side, with Todd Murphy replacing Lyon, Scott Boland returning for Hazlewood while Green is replaced by Mitch Marsh. Mail Online 10:35 Boos for Carey The announcer goes through the teams and, suffice to say, the Yorkshire crowd will waste no time making their thoughts heard on the visitors. The biggest boo of all is of course saved for a certain Alex Carey. 10:33 Australia team news Cummins comes to the mic and is immediately booed. The skipper admits he would have bowled too before giving us his team news. Murphy, Marsh and Boland in for the injured Lyon, Green and Hazlewood.

England win the toss! 10:29 Green on the wicket Mail Sport columnist Nasser Hussain has had a look at the wicket for Sky, and there's a fair amount of grass on the track, which means the ball will likely do a bit under the cloud. With sun forecast for tomorrow - which will favour the batting side - it looks a toss to win, putting the opponent in to bat with the hope of bowling them out for a good day under the sun tomorrow. Rainbow Laces colours on the stumps ahead of Day One of the Ashes 3rd Test match 10:26 Yorkshire has not forgotten Suffice it to say that the Yorkshire locals won't be forgetting Bairstow's dismissal in a hurry.

Headingley chiefs will ramp up security ahead of third Ashes Test EXCLUSIVE: Mail Sport understands that the dramatic scenes at Lord's have formed part of the planning for what promises to be an incredibly hostile atmosphere in Yorkshire for the Australians. Mail Online Credit: @TheBarmyArmy - New painting outside of Headingley… 10:19 Another Headingley miracle? Fact of the matter is that England need to win this Test if they are to have any hopes of winning the Ashes, 2-0 down after back-to-back defeats. But when you're an England player looking for a miracle, Headingley is probably the first place you'd want to be. Stokes' heroics in 2019, Bob and Beefy in 1981 - will we get a third Ashes hero at this iconic ground from the England camp this week, or will it be a comprehensive victory for the visitors to wrap up a first overseas Ashes win in 22 years? 10:14 Some reaction to THAT run out issue We've heard a lot about the spirit of cricket, and whether it was infringed upon by Carey, but the reality is that the umpires gave the decision out, and off Bairstow trudged. If you've missed any of the fall out from that seismic moment in Ashes history, then here's a select few reactions to the issue that should give you a little bit of context for just how everyone is feeling about this one. STUART BROAD: It amazes me NOT ONE Aussie thought the appeal was wrong STUART BROAD: We saw it with Mitchell Starc's catch on Saturday evening: all of Australia thought it was out, all of England, me included, thought it was not out. Mail Online Pat Cummins defends controversial Jonny Bairstow dismissal PAUL NEWMAN: Pat Cummins today insisted his Australian players were 'outstanding' at Lord's and insisted he would act in exactly the same way if faced with another Jonny Bairstow situation. Mail Online Brendon McCullum says Australia have to 'live with' stumping decision The third Test of an increasingly fractious series starts at Headingley on Thursday, with Australian coach Andrew McDonald saying he was 'disappointed' by McCullum's reaction. Mail Online Michael Vaughan on why England haven't aimed up in Ashes Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan has outlined his belief that Brendon McCullum's team are hiding behind the 'spirit of cricket' defence when it comes to their sub-par Ashes performances. Mail Online 10:08 Hosts XI Not too far from the toss now. We already know who will be playing for the hosts, of course, but for a little refresher, take a look at the story below. The headlines are Wood, Woakes and Alli in, Pope, Anderson and Tongue are out. England make THREE changes for must-win third Ashes Test at Headingley England vice-captain Ollie Pope was ruled out of the rest of the summer with the dislocation of his right shoulder suffered at Lord's and Lawrence could have been a direct replacement at three.

Bairstow's stumping that, depending on which side of the world you hail from, was or wasn't in the spirit of the game has dominated the headlines ever since that fateful Sunday at the Home of Cricket. With England deep into their chase of 371 to win the second Test and Bairstow recently arriving at the crease, the last real able-bodied helped for Stokes on his war path, the Yorkshire keeper-batter had his stumps removed after wandering out of his crease a little too sharpish for Carey's liking at the end of the over. He was given out, and England ultimately fell short in their run chase, and since that moment pundits, coaches, and players former and current have had their say on the dismissal, and yet still nobody can agree on it, and it doesn't look like they will any time soon. Mind you, Broad's theatrical calls of 'in' and checking with Australia players if he could leave his crease hardly helped. Whatever your opinion - unforgiveable carelessness from Bairstow or shamefaced opportunism from Carey - at least it's got everyone talking about the cricket!

Well, as Test matches go, there wasn't a lot missing from Lord's was there? It had everything - an eco-protest, breath-taking fast bowling, a series-ending injury, a sublime century for the ages, and just a smidge of controversial decisions going both ways. We'll be getting into that particular incident in a bit naturally, but it's worth remembering what a feast of action we had just a few days ago. For those of you who missed it... Seven things we learned from second Ashes Test After winning the toss, the England captain put the Australians in to bat, with the visitors putting on 416 in an innings that saw many point fingers at the hosts' poor bowling at an overcast Lord's. Mail Online 09:44 Weather check A quick look at the weather, and it looks to be a typical British summer's day up in sunny Yorkshire. That's right, cloud cover predicted for most of the day, with a suggestion of sunlight breaking through towards the early evening. A hint of rain on the cards at around 11am, and again at 5pm, but no deluge the likes of which we saw at Lord's forecast. Saturday and Monday look somewhat less positive on the weather front, but Friday looks a gorgeous day for batting with the sun shining all day. It looks a great toss to win, this. Not that there's ever really a bad toss to win, mind. There is cloud cover predicted for most of the day, with a suggestion of sunlight breaking through towards the early evening. 09:40 Quick look at the pitch Bumble has been out early this morning to give us all a sneak preview of the wicket.

It has hardly been four days since we were all roaring Ben Stokes on and gasping in shock at... well, we all know what... and watching Australia tighten their grip on the Ashes as the matches come thick and fast in this hectic series. We've got about an hour and half until first ball, which should give us plenty of time to go through the fall-out that is still falling out from Lord's, as well as build up to a Test that - needless to say - is bound to have a bit of bite to it.

Morgan and Hughes have been trading verbal volleys on social media in the aftermath of Jonny Bairstow's controversial dismissal on Day Five of the second Test at Lord's . The former fast bowler turned down the chance to appear on the 'Piers Morgan Uncensored’ show, and was incensed when Morgan shared his refusal on social media. 'Life’s pretty good when you jump on social media and you see some moron like Pies Morgan having a crack at you,' Hughes said on SENQ’s Breakfast with Pat and Heals on Thursday. 'A producer of his show asked me privately if I wanted to go on his show and I declined respectively and said ‘no I don’t want to’ and then he puts it to social media. Merv Hughes has branded Piers Morgan a 'moron' as their Twitter spat intensified Morgan bemoaned Australian cricketers and journalists had shunned his invitations to debate Jonny Bairstow's dismissal on his TV show Bairstow (middle) was controversially run out by Alex Carey after wandering down the wicket 'Like I said, he’s an attention-seeker and a flog.' Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Hughes and Morgan were involved in a social media spat after the Aussie great slammed England fans for branding the Aussies as 'cheats' as tempers flared at Lord's after Bairstow was controversially dismissed. The England batsman ducked a Cameron Green bouncer that was the last ball of the over, marked his ground and then walked forward to talk to batting partner Ben Stokes . Australia wicket-keeper Alex Carey seized the opportunity to throw the ball at the stumps and effectively ran Bairstow out - even though it was classified as a stumping. The incident has reignited the debate between the adhering to the laws of the game and playing in the right spirit. But Hughes, who played 53 Tests for Australia, said Carey and Aussie captain Pat Cummins had nothing to apologise for . 'Throw up spirit of cricket and bad sportsmanship, that’s what happens when rules and laws go against your argument,' he wrote on Twitter. 'So pull your head in, apologise, and get on with life.' Hughes branded Morgan a 'flog' and an 'attention-seeker' on social media His comments prompted Morgan to invite him on his show. 'Want to come on my show and debate this tonight, Merv?,' he tweeted. Hughes' response was typically succinct: 'I've been asked and answered privately Piers- why would you take it to social media?' In the same tweet, Hughes branded Morgan a 'flog' and an 'attention-seeker'. On Monday, the British broadcaster bemoaned Australian cricketers and journalists had shunned his invitations to debate Bairstow's dismissal on his show. 'We can’t get a single Australian cricketer or journalist to come on to defend yesterday’s outrage,' Morgan said. 'Any takers? Or should I assume you’ve all realised it’s beyond defending.' Australian cricket commentator and The Final Word podcast co-host Geoff Lemon explained why Aussie cricketers and journalists had declined Morgan's invitation Australian cricket commentator and The Final Word podcast co-host Geoff Lemon replied: 'This is why we declined, champion. 'We don’t need to help you make money by berating people on air. We all have actual work to do.' The third Ashes Test starts at Headingley on Thursday with Australia needing to avoid defeat to retain the urn for the fourth consecutive time. Victory in Leeds would secure Australia's first series win in England since 2001.

England captain Ben Stokes won the toss on a green Headingley wicket, and continued his preference for bowling first in home conditions in what is a must-win third Ashes Test for the hosts. Marsh comes in as one of three changes for Australia, with Scott Boland replacing fellow pace bowler Josh Hazlewood after selectors opted to put him on ice for the match. Todd Murphy makes his return to Test cricket as expected, with fellow spinner Nathan Lyon out for the rest of the series with a calf tear. Green was ruled out of the match on Thursday morning with a sore hamstring, an injury medical staff believe he picked up in the 43-run second Test win at Lord's last week as Australia took a 2-0 lead. Follow MailSport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport England have also made three changes, with Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood into the team for James Anderson, Josh Tongue and the injured Ollie Pope. Australia have asked for extra security around their families for this match, with a hostile reception expected following the dramas of the Lord's Test. A draw for Australia will mean they retain the Ashes, while a win would wrap up the series with two Tests still to play. ENGLAND: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Harry Brook, Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes (capt), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Ollie Robinson, Stuart Broad. AUSTRALIA: David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (capt), Scott Boland, Todd Murphy.

CHATTOGRAM (BANGLADESH): Bangladesh ODI captain and one of their most accomplished all-format cricketers Tamim Iqbal on Thursday announced his retirement with immediate effect, just three months ahead of the 50-over World Cup in India. The 34-year-old left-hander made the shock announcement a day after his team lost the opening ODI against Afghanistan here. \"This is the end for me. I have given my best. I have tried my best. I am retiring from international cricket from this moment,\" said Iqbal. \"I want to thank all my teammates, coaches, BCB officials, my family members, and those who have been with me through my long journey. They kept faith in me,\" he added. A hard hitter of the ball, Iqbal played 70 Tests amassing 5,134 runs including 10 centuries and a double ton in his 16-year career. It was in the ODIs that his true potential was realised as a top-order batter, where the stalwart amassed 8,313 runs in 241 games including 14 centuries -- the most for his country. He is also the third-highest run-scorer among current cricketers, behind Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. \"I also want to thank the fans. Your love and faith in me inspired me to give my very best for Bangladesh. I want to ask for your prayers for the next chapter of my life. Please keep me in your prayers,\" added Iqbal in his retirement speech. The cricketer made his international debut in 2007 amassing 15,000 runs in international cricket, including 25 centuries and 94 half-centuries. Iqbal had quit T20I cricket last year and played his last Test against Ireland in April. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) are yet to announce a successor for Iqbal in the 50-over format.","content":"CHATTOGRAM (BANGLADESH): Bangladesh ODI captain and one of their most accomplished all-format cricketers Tamim Iqbal on Thursday announced his retirement with immediate effect, just three months ahead of the 50-over World Cup in India.

FirstCricket Staff Last Updated:July 06, 2023 14:57:03 IST Zaka Ashraf has been appointed the chairman of a new 10-member PCB management committee. PCB image Zaka Ashraf, who was the favourite to become the next Pakistan Cricket Board head, on Thursday, took charge as the chairman of a new 10-member PCB management committee. The committee has been formed by the Pakistan government for a period of four months. The management committee will hold its first meeting in Lahore on Thursday. The decision to make Ashraf the committee head comes after PCB had to postpone the Board election after the formation of its board of governors — which elects the new chairman — was challenged in multiple courts around the country. Related Articles PCB’s likely chairman Zaka Ashraf rejects ‘hybrid model’ for Asia Cup, ACC gives stern reply PCB chairman election faces delay as two former committee members approach court The government has removed PCB election commissioner Ahmed Shehzad Farooq Rana and appointed advocate supreme court Mahmood Iqbal Khakwani in his place. The PCB election of its new chairman was postponed on June 26 after Baluchistan High Court accepted the petition of Gul Mohammad Kakar, a former member of the PCB management committee, and set a hearing for July 17. Before former chairman Najam Sethi dropped out of the election, he formed a 10-member board of governors that also included two direct nominees from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the PCB patron. Acting chairman Ahmed Shehzad Farooq Rana then changed several of the board of governors, prompting Kakar’s court challenge. Representatives of bigger cities such as Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi and Peshawar were replaced by men from smaller cities such as Dera Murad Jamali, Hyderabad, Larkana and Bahawalpur.
