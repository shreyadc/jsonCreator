He said to me about five times, ‘This might be brutally honest.’ I said, ‘Pat, there is nothing brutal about your feedback. What is brutal is I’m hearing it behind my back through the media or through sources.’ No one’s telling me. Tell me,” Langer said.“Everyone was being nice to my face but I was reading about this stuff and half of it … I could not believe that is what was making the papers.“A lot of journalists use the word ‘source’. I would say, change that word to ‘coward’. A coward says, not a source. Because what do you mean a source says? They’ve either got an axe to grind with someone and they won’t come and say it to your face, or they’re just leaking stuff for their own agenda.“I hate that.”Langer said his biggest regret was his lack of relationship with CA’s board who still sacked him after changing his ways and winning the T20 World Cup and Ashes.“The hardest thing for me of all of it was: I got the feedback (and) I did something about it. We won the T20 World Cup, we won the Ashes. We were No. 1 in the world. I’ve never enjoyed coaching more and I’ve still got sacked. That’s the hardest thing,” Langer said.“Because you can’t give someone feedback, do something about it, and then that to happen.“But I talked to the Cricket Australia board three times in four years. That’s craziness. And that’s the only thing I’d do differently. Because when you know people haven’t got your back, there is no lonelier place in the world. When you do know people have got your back, there’s no more powerful place in the world. And that’s what I would have done differently.”The former opening batsman, who will return to the cricket arena as a TV commentator this summer, said the “killer” for him as coach was the lack of feedback from his senior players.“People say that I’m very intense, but they’re mistaking intensity with honesty,” Langer said.“I’ve never said this publicly.“The hardest thing for me of all of it was: I got the feedback (and) I did something about it.“We won the T20 World Cup, we won the Ashes.“We were No. 1 in the world.“I’ve never enjoyed coaching more and I’ve still got sacked.“That’s the hardest thing.“Because you can’t give someone feedback, do something about it, and then that to happen.”READ THE FULL INTERVIEW ON CODE SPORTS","pubDate":"2022-11-22 23:23:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: Martin Guptill to be released from New Zealand Cricket contract","link":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/sport/cricket-martin-guptill-to-be-released-from-new-zealand-cricket-contract/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand Cricket has agreed to release Martin Guptill from his central contract so he can pursue playing opportunities elsewhere. The 36-year-old opening batsman has been a fixture in Black Caps white ball squads for the best part of 14 years but did not play in the recently completed T20 World Cup, and was not selected for the current T20 and ODI series against India. Following discussions with NZC, it was agreed Guptill’s request for a release should be accepted, effective immediately. New Zealand’s leading T20 run-scorer, the third-highest in the ODI format, and third on the world all-time T20 list, Guptill has emphasised he is not retiring from international cricket and still wishes to be considered for Black Caps selection when available. For its part, NZC has made it clear to him that, while he would remain eligible for selection, preference would continue to be given to those players with central or domestic contracts. “We understand Martin’s position,” said NZC chief executive David White. “He’s been a fantastic batsman for us for a long period of time, and we certainly don’t wish to stand in his way as he explores other opportunities. “Martin’s been a giant of the white ball game, a committed and well-respected member of the Black Caps, and has earned the right to play out his career on his own terms. “He leaves his contract with our best wishes.” Guptill is the third Black Caps player to request a release this year, after Trent Boult and Colin de Grandhomme, but White said he was comfortable with the existing contracting and selection system. “Players such as Martin, Trent and Colin, with long and successful international track-records, inevitably end up with alternative playing options at this stage of their careers, and we respect that. “It’s just part of the natural ebb and flow of individual careers within team sport.” Guptill said playing for the Black Caps remained his ultimate goal, as it had been for his entire cricketing career. However, he also wanted to continue playing cricket at the highest level possible – wherever, and for whoever, that might be. “Playing for my country has been a massive honour, and I’m grateful to everyone within the Black Caps and NZC for their support,” he said. “But, equally, I’m realistic enough to understand the need to consider my options in the current circumstances. “With this release, I’m still available for New Zealand, I have the chance to explore other opportunities, and I also get to spend more time with my family – which is important.” A replacement to fill Guptill’s central contract vacancy will be named in due course.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-22 21:24:01","image_url":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/urhd1bum/martin-guptill-from-photosport.jpg","source_id":"newstalkzb","country":["new zealand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Test contender under our nose the whole time; Aussie’s timely rise to ‘scare’ rivals: Talking points","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/australia-vs-england-cricket-scores-result-third-odi-talking-points-before-test-series-vs-west-indies-steve-smith-adam-zampa/news-story/97b721b244caf8ee4c56d17fca3c1614","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia’s attention will now turn to the red ball after a gruelling three months of limited-overs cricket finally came to an end on Tuesday night.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-22 20:12:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Justin Langer takes aim at ‘cowards’ in explosive interview over sacking as Australian cricket coach","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/justin-langer-takes-aim-at-cowards-in-explosive-interview-over-sacking-as-australian-cricket-coach/news-story/ab44495fcfd2382e20c196b338b68328","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former coach Justin Langer has called out Test captain Pat Cummins’ role in his demise, the anonymous “cowards” who leaked against him and the Cricket Australia board for his unceremonious sacking last summer.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-22 20:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: Rain sees Black Caps and India settle for tie","link":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/sport/cricket-rain-sees-black-caps-and-india-settle-for-tie/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India have edged a rain-interrupted T20 series against New Zealand after the third and final match ended in a rare DLS tie in Napier tonight. Chasing 161 and seeking to repeat their victory from the second match, the tourists had reached 75-4 after nine overs when the weather intervened and forced the players from the field. That number matched the DLS par score so, when the umpires called off the game half an hour later, India secured a 1-0 series triumph ahead of the first of three ODIs between the sides at Eden Park on Friday. An optimist would suggest the rain robbed the Black Caps a chance of squaring the series given the contest, as DLS indicated, was very much in the balance. A pessimist, on the other hand, would point out that avoiding defeat spared the home side some serious embarrassment given what transpired late in their innings. New Zealand had seemed set for a formidable total after an 86-run stand between Devon Conway (59 off 49) and Glenn Phillips (54 off 33) left them on 146-3 in the 17th over. But then, in 13 extremely unfortunate minutes, the hosts lost six wickets while adding three runs, a collapse that eventually saw them bowled out in the final over for 160. What made the carnage of the final four overs so surprising was all that had occurred in the previous 16, with the Black Caps opting to bat first and feeling good after sticking close to their established blueprint. They recovered from another early dismissal for Finn Allen, unable to cope with the swing of Arshdeep Singh and trapped in front for 3, and they didn’t look like missing absent captain Kane Williamson. Replacement Mark Chapman managed only 12 before skying a leading edge, but that cleared the way for Conway and Phillips. The opener had mis-timed a couple of early shots as he scuffled to 2 off 11 but found his timing in the fourth over, collecting 14 runs with three straight shots of variety and quality. Phillips, too, started slowly after New Zealand had ended the powerplay on 46-2, but his aggression began to emerge and complement Conway’s accumulation as the partnership progressed. The pair looked ready to launch after reaching a 50-run stand in the 13th over, an appearance exemplified by Phillips slogging Yuzvendra Chahal onto the McLean Park roof. Then it was Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s turn to disappear out of the ground, courtesy of a majestic Phillips pull. Both batsmen soon notched their eighth T20I half-centuries as the Black Caps reached 129-2 with five overs remaining, primed for a big score. But that’s when it all went wrong. Watch every match of the BlackCaps v India series live on Spark Sport. After Kumar earned some revenge by taking a fine running catch to remove Phillips, Conway followed in the next over to trigger the implosion. Led by Mohammed Siraj (4-17), India’s pace bowlers altered their length and the New Zealand batsmen responded by chasing the short ball and offering up catch after catch. Daryl Mitchell at least cracked a couple of fours; Jimmy Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Adam Milne and Ish Sodhi lasted a combined eight deliveries in the middle. The nadir came with Milne’s run out, the third wicket in as many balls, but thankfully for the Black Caps, offering up so many opportunities soon proved infectious. The hosts’ bowlers matched the strategy of extracting bounce from the pitch and Tim Southee snared two consecutive wickets to reduce India to 21-3 in a three-over period that also produced a couple additional half-chances. Once Sodhi removed Suryakumar Yadav for 13, with the world’s top-ranked batsman having already shown a couple of flashes of the form that saw him smash a century in the second match, the Black Caps had hope. India skipper Hardik Pandya (30no off 18) did his best to quash that feeling, before the rain came down and ended the series on a damp note.","content":"India have edged a rain-interrupted T20 series against New Zealand after the third and final match ended in a rare DLS tie in Napier tonight.

Australia’s opening pair scored 269 runs in front of just 10,406 spectators at the MCG. Warner and Head’s centuries helped Australia post 355-5 the highest ODI total at the MCG after England captain Jos Buttler won the toss and elected to field. Head hit 152 from 130 balls to bring up his third ODI century and highest score in the format. Warner scored 106. Two rain delays during Australia’s innings reduced the game to 48 overs per side, with England’s target lifted to 364. England was all out for 142 in the 32nd over as opener Jason Roy top-scored with 38. Fast bowler Olly Stone, who was playing in just his sixth ODI, led England’s bowlers with figures of 4-85. Australian legspinner Adam Zampa had 4-31 to finish the series with 11 wickets. “Good to finish them off here with just about the best ODI I’ve been part of,” Australia captain Pat Cummins said, Buttler said his side “fell a long way short . . .

The Black Caps were bowled out for 160 in their innings. India then labored to 75 for four wickets in their nine overs before the rain started. Under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method, the match was a rare draw in Twenty-20 cricket. India took the series having won the second tie on Sunday at Mount Maunganui, where morning rain threatened to delay the start before Suryakumar Yadav smashed 111 off 51 balls in a 65-run win. The first tie was washed out by heavy rain in Wellington on Friday. “We would have liked to have won by playing the full overs, but it’s how it is. We don’t mind getting the trophy and the win,” said India captain Harkik Pandya. Fast-bowler Mohammed Siraj was the man-of-the-match after restricting New Zealand to just 17 runs for four wickets, supported by Arshdeep Singh’s 4-37. “All three matches were affected by the weather, but we are happy to have won the series,” said Siraj. After setting India 161 to win, the Black Caps’ bowlers struck early with India’s openers Ishan Kishan and Rishabh Pant dismissed to leave the visitors on 21-2. With Kane Williamson sitting out due to a medical appointment, New Zealand’s stand-in skipper Tim Southee took the wickets of Pant and then Shreyas Iyer in successive balls. India were in trouble at 23 for three before Suryakumar Yadav went for just 13. Pandya steadied the ship with a solid 30 off 18 balls to steer his side to 75 for four from nine overs when rain stopped play. Having won the toss and elected to bat, New Zealand made a strong start with Glenn Phillips smashing 54 off 33 balls. Devon Conway hit 59, including five fours and two towering sixes. The Black Caps were cruising at 146 for three when Conway was caught by Kishan in the deep before New Zealand collapsed to lose their last seven wickets for just 14 runs. The teams meet again in Auckland on Friday, when Eden Park hosts the first of three one-day internationals. – AFP","pubDate":"2022-11-22 16:12:53","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","country":["Kuwait"],"category":["sports"],"language":"arabic"},{"title":"Kuwait Cricket Club, Friendi mobile seal partnership deal","link":"https://www.kuwaittimes.com/kuwait-cricket-club-friendi-mobile-seal-partnership-deal/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":["kuwaittimes"],"video_url":null,"description":"By Abdellatif Sharaa KUWAIT: Kuwait Cricket Club and Friendi mobile officially launched their partnership at an event held at the Olympic Council of Asia in the presence of senior officials from both sides. “It is a great day for us as we are starting our future events for the coming season with a new partner … The post Kuwait Cricket Club, Friendi mobile seal partnership deal appeared first on Kuwait Times.","content":"By Abdellatif Sharaa Kuwait Cricket Club and Friendi mobile officially launched their partnership at an event held at the Olympic Council of Asia in the presence of senior officials from both sides. “It is a great day for us as we are starting our future events for the coming season with a new partner Friendi, which will join us all the way for the next season. We will experience each other and will know exactly where we stand, as we both work for the interest of cricket,” Chairman of KCC Haidar Farman said. Farman announced there will be a meeting for building a new venue and new grounds for Kuwait cricket. “With Friendi being with us, I do not think Kuwait cricket will be the same from today onwards. All what we are doing is in the interest of our players, not only for the national team, but for the 140 teams who are members of KCC,” he said. Friendi CEO Benoit Janin congratulated the Kuwait national cricket team on their win over UAE. “We are here to celebrate to launch the partnership between Friendi and KCC. Friendi is a brand already in the region, in Oman and Saudi Arabia, and have over 2 million customers. We are all excited about this partnership and hope to go further on new levels,” he said. KCC Director General Shahid Ashraf said Kuwait Cricket Club is the sole official governing body for the game of cricket in Kuwait, affiliated with the Public Authority for Sport, Kuwait Olympic Committee, International Cricket Council and Asian Cricket Council. He said Kuwait men’s team is currently ranked 25th in the ICC T20 out of 104 countries, adding that ICC will have 20 teams participating in the world cup that will take place in the West Indies and US. Shahid Ashraf said Kuwait men’s team for the first time beat UAE, which is ranked 12th in the ICC T20 rankings, in the final leg of Asia qualifiers recently, and this will help improve their ranking. “With this partnership, all events will be named after Friendi mobile. The entire international calendar year all events will be branded as Friendi,” Ashraf said. Speaking exclusively to Kuwait Times, Farman said a Kuwaiti team played in two Asian Games in Guangzhou 2010 and Incheon 2014, but in 2018 the game was not included. In 2022, Kuwait Olympic Committee did not think that there is the possibility of positive participation in the games. “We think otherwise. This hurt the Kuwait team spirit that longed for participating in the Asian Games,” he said. Farman said this took place while the game is developing and reached an advanced stage. “We suddenly received an unfavorable answer from Kuwait Olympic Committee for not participating, and this is not in the interest of the game. We hope KOC reconsiders future participations, because it is a game that has proved itself,” he said. Farman said cricket began in Kuwait with a committee at KOC in 1998, then in 2009 the KCC was approved by the Public Authority for Sport as a specialized club. “This recognition gave us a strong push to take our role to new levels as far as work and development are concerned, and we are looking to establish an academy to care of young players. We are in the development stage, as Kuwait can reach at highly advanced levels, but the game requires much investment and work with a team spirit to fulfill the plan,” he added.","pubDate":"2022-11-22 16:02:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","country":["Kuwait"],"category":["sports"],"language":"arabic"},{"title":"Pollard, Pooran, Shakib, Russell headline star-studded Abu Dhabi T10 - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuY3JpY2luZm8uY29tL3N0b3J5L2FidS1kaGFiaS10MTAta2llcmFuLXBvbGxhcmQtbmljaG9sYXMtcG9vcmFuLXNoYWtpYi1hbC1oYXNhbi1pbi1hY3Rpb24tYXMtc3Rhci1zdHVkZGVkLWFidS1kaGFiaS10MTAta2lja3Mtb2ZmLTEzNDU5NjfSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pollard, Pooran, Shakib, Russell headline star-studded Abu Dhabi T10  ESPNcricinfoAbu Dhabi T10 League 2022: Squads, Fixtures and Live Streaming details  CricketTimes.comAbu Dhabi T10 League 2022 - Fantasy Cricket Predictions and Betting Tips: All matches, 23rd Nov  Cricket WorldKieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran, Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell Set To Feature In Abu Dhabi T10 League  Cricket AddictorDG vs TAD Dream11 Prediction, Abu Dhabi T10 2022 Fantasy Cricket Tips, Playing XI, Pitch Report & Injury Updates for Match 2  CricTrackerView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-22 15:01:42","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India win T20 series against New Zealand: 3rd match declared ‘tie’","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/india-win-t20-series-against-new-zealand-3rd-match-declared-tie/","keywords":["Sports","Cricket","India","India vs New Zealand","indvsnz","New Zealand","T20","Team India"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Napier: The third T20I between India and New Zealand was suspended due to rain.

The Duckworth-Lewis system was unable to decide the winner as both teams were tied. As a result, the Indian team has won the T20I series 1-0. The Indian cricket team led by Hardik Pandya is touring New Zealand and playing T20 cricket series. The first match of the series was canceled due to rain. The Indian team won the second match by 65 runs. Both teams played their third and final match today. New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat. New Zealand were all out for 160 in 19.4 overs. India chased down the target of 161 runs to win. At the end of 9 overs, the Indian team scored 75 runs for the loss of 4 wickets. Pandya scored 30 runs and Deepak Hooda scored 9 runs in the field. Then the rain stopped. A situation where no further competition can be held. At that time, the runs and loss of wickets of both the teams were equal in the Duckworth-Lewis method. Hence, the match was inconclusive. The umpires declared a ‘tie’. It is noteworthy that in this match, the Indian team lost successive wickets while chasing the target.

With this tie, the Hardik Pandya-led side clinched the series 1-0 after they had registered a win in the second T20I.Opting to bat first, New Zealand looked in cruise control at one stage after Devon Conway and Glenn Phillips chipped in with a stand of 86 runs for the third wicket.

Only 10,406 fans, the lowest ever attendance for an ODI at the MCG were on and Head said he and his teammates “weren’t surprised” given the dead-rubber nature of the contest, the scheduling, and the weather But Head’s need to make every post a winner after his re-inclusion in the side, given first opportunity to nail down the opening spot left vacant by Aaron Finch’s retirement, meant the size of the crowd was irrelevant. “Not for someone like me, someone who hasn’t been playing. Maybe it does for some guys who have been playing a lot of cricket,” Head said after Australia’s 221-run win in to close out a 3-0 series win.“But each guy has different motivations for getting up and playing. I’m in a position where I’m fortunate to be back in the team so I am buzzing for it not matter who rocks up.“You‘re playing for Australia, so I guess, I noticed it (the crowd) but again, when the ball is coming down, you are trying to hit it you don’t notice if it’s 10,000 or 100,000. “But yeah, I guess we weren‘t surprised. With where the series was at … it’s a Tuesday afternoon, the weather hasn’t been great, it’s been bloody freezing for three days”Head’s innings could and should be enough to secure him the opening spot vacated by retiring captain Aaron Finch 12 months out from the World Cup.But it was one which nearly didn’t happen. Not only was the South Australian ill pre-game, and unable to eat, he also hurt his back in the warm-up, and needed to pass a fitness test just to play. He was unable to field after his 130-ball innings, which included 16 fours and four sixes but was never going to miss the chance to further cement his partnership with David Warner at the top of the order. “I was touch and go,” he said “It wasn‘t ideal back spasm when I got here to the ground and reached to get something out of my bag and it wasn’t the best feeling in the world. “I got through the warm the rain didn‘t help because obviously I did warm up indoors and those couple minutes before the toss and a fair bit going on.“But I was lucky we got to two hours before the game so it sort of sorted itself out.”Head and Warner, who made 106, put on 269-runs, the highest ever ODI stand at the MCG and biggest opening partnership ever for Australia against England. “We work well together … we feed off each other,” he said. “He’s unbelievable, and it’s great to have someone with that confidence up the other end. “But I’ll take any position which puts me in the Australian cricket team. I know the various opportunities I have had at the top, I’ve had some success. “It’s a nice place to bat.”","pubDate":"2022-11-22 12:01:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Travis Head, David Warner plunder centuries as Australia crushes England in final ODI","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/travis-head-david-warner-plunder-centuries-as-australia-crushes-england-in-final-odi/articleshow/95688384.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia made a formidable 355-5 on the back of Head's 152 and Warner's 106 in a rain-hit game reduced to 48 overs, with the pair's 269-run stand the ninth-highest opening partnership in 50-over cricket and the biggest at the MCG.

Now, the iconic batter has been winning the internet after presenting his pair of batting gloves to a young fan. He was making his way to the dressing room after playing a commendable centurion innings during the third match of Australia’s ongoing ODI series against England.Warner stole the show at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by smashing 106 runs off 102 deliveries. His 269-run opening partnership with Travis Head helped the home side post a mammoth 355 runs in the first innings of the rain-reduced 48-over game. He was sent off by English pacer Olly Stone in the 38th over and left the field like a hero.Warner had been struggling for a century since 2020 when he recorded his 18th ODI hundred against India in Mumbai. Finally, he ended his international century drought exactly after 1043 days. Following his blistering comeback, the crowd continued to celebrate the exceptional knock and gave a standing ovation. View this post on Instagram A post shared by cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) Right before the entrance of the pavilion, there were a lot of Aussie supporters waiting to shake hands with him. However, it was one lucky guy who caught his attention. The cricketer did not even look at the kid but gave away his gloves. The unexpected gift unquestionably delighted the fan. He immediately approached his mother and brother present in the stands and went on to flaunt it.The clip of the heart-warming gesture was shared by Cricket Australia on their official Instagram. The caption of the post said, “These kids are going home with David Warner’s gloves.” The comment section saw a lot of users lauding Warner for making the day of that young supporter with his special gesture.Apart from Warner, Head also shone with the bat and registered a quickfire 152 runs in 130 deliveries including as many as 16 boundaries and 4 maximums.The England bowlers failed significantly in front of the fiery Australian batting unit. Only Stone managed to put a little bit of pressure and picked up 4 wickets.While chasing, the Jos Buttler-led side lost opener Dawid Malan early in their innings. The bowing attack of the hosts, led by Adam Zampa, rattled the English batting line-up. At the time of writing, England were 95/7 in 25.1 overs.Australia, after their failure in the latest T20 World Cup, are keen to record a 3-0 whitewash against champions England as they have already triumphed in the first two ODIs.","pubDate":"2022-11-22 11:27:11","image_url":"https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/380x285/fixed/jpg/2022/11/Warner.jpg","source_id":"firstpost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India win series against NZ after T20 tie","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/india-win-series-against-nz-after-t20-tie-c-8937801","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Writers"],"video_url":null,"description":"NZ and India have shared a rare tie when the third Twenty20 cricket international was stopped by rain with the teams level under the Duckworth Lewis system.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-22 11:18:01","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-8937801/bc512eb708098ee752e8221abc60aef15ad9bf62-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia hand England record ODI defeat with 221-run win on DLS in Melbourne clinching 3-0 series sweep - Sky Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5za3lzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvbmV3cy8xMjEyMy8xMjc1Mjk0NC9hdXN0cmFsaWEtdGh1bXAtZW5nbGFuZC1ieS0yMjEtcnVucy1vbi1kbHMtaW4tbWVsYm91cm5lLXRvLWNsaW5jaC0zLTAtb25lLWRheS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXNlcmllcy1zd2VlcNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia hand England record ODI defeat with 221-run win on DLS in Melbourne clinching 3-0 series sweep  Sky SportsAussies sweep series as Head, Warner set MCG record | Australia v England 2022-23  cricket.com.auAustralia v England: Travis Head and David Warner smash hosts to ODI series sweep  BBCAustralia cruise to ODI whitewash after England collapse at near-empty MCG  The GuardianEngland left to reflect on record ODI defeat against Australia  Glasgow TimesView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-22 11:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Boland told to stay ready!","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/boland-told-to-stay-ready/video/2cfdd5279fbdf169e3dfc0df5a52f401","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Australian Scott Boland has been told to stay ready incase he is needed for Australia in the upcoming test matches.","content":"Cricket: Australian Scott Boland has been told to stay ready incase he is needed for Australia in the upcoming test matches.","pubDate":"2022-11-22 11:09:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Warner scored a century in international cricket after 1043 days","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/warner-scored-a-century-in-international-cricket-after-1043-days/","keywords":["Sports","Australia","AUSvENG","Cricket","David Warner","India","ODI century"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Melbourne: Australian cricketer David Warner has scored a century after 1043 days in international cricket.

He scored this century in the third ODI against England. 36-year-old David Warner made his international debut for Australia in 2009. He is an indispensable player of the team in all formats of cricket like Test, ODI and T20. He has played 141 matches in ODI cricket alone. With that, he has accumulated a total of 6007 runs. This includes the 19th century. The last time he scored a century was in January 2020 against the Indian team at the Wankhede Cricket Ground. After that, he played a total of 71 innings across three Tests, ODIs and T20Is, but failed to register a century. Today he has quenched that thirst. This is 23 days more than the number of days taken by Indian cricketer Virat Kohli to score a century in international cricket. Warner put on a 269-run partnership with fellow opener Travis Head in the match against England. He scored 106 runs off 102 balls. It included 8 fours and 2 sixes.

FP Trending November 22nd, 2022 15:14:01 IST Glenn Maxwell broke his leg in a birthday party. AP Australian cricketer Glenn Maxwell has described in explicit detail how he broke his leg in a freak accident during a birthday party. He now feels it is highly improbable that he will recover in time for the India Test tour next year. However, he is not ready to give up hope. The bed-ridden all-rounder from Melbourne featured on Cricket Australia’s ‘Unplayable Podcast’ and revealed how a harmless prank at a 50th birthday party with one of his mates and former school teachers led to him fracturing his left fibula . He has now had surgery to heal the fracture. It was the birthday party of an official of Maxwell’s Premier Cricket team, Fitzroy-Doncaster, and was being hosted in a small garden area with synthetic turf that was slick from the prolonged rain. According to the cricketer, he and his buddy were laughing about something and Maxwell went on to chase him off somewhere. The duo had taken about three or four steps out on the grass, when the accident happened. Both of them slipped at the same time and collapsed onto the ground. Maxwell’s buddy, unfortunately, failed to control himself and fell at an awkward angle directly on the leg of the Aussie all-rounder. “It immediately snapped. Every detail was audible and felt by me. It hurt quite a bit. I was screaming a little bit,” Maxwell explained. However, Maxwell’s partner first thought it was a joke. But he realised the pain was real when Maxwell called his wife Vini for assistance. His other friends present at the party constructed a temporary tent to cover Maxwell from the rain, out of concern that moving him would worsen the injury. Later, he was rushed to the hospital. “I could not sleep for two days when I was in pain. I broke my fibula. It was snapped in half, but it also shattered through the bone. There was a bit of a chip off the tibia as well [and] I ruptured all the ligaments on top of my foot as well. This is all the annoying aspect of it,” he revealed. Maxwell has long-held aspirations to increase his appearances in red-ball cricket. Till now, he has featured in the white jersey seven times, the most recent of which was recorded more than five years ago. While he admits his goal of being called up for the India tour’s Test match next year is hanging by a thread, the Aussie all-rounder still harbours the belief that the setback would actually help him play cricket for longer. ”There’s a time limit on when they’re going to announce that squad to India and to be fair, there’s a high chance that I won’t make it. They’re obviously going have to see me playing cricket and they’re obviously going to have to take a big risk if they do take me,” Maxwell told.

The hosts lost eight wickets for just 30 runs after Devon Conway (59 off 49 balls) and Glenn Phillips (54 off 33) had propped up their innings.Innings Break!A superb show with the ball from #TeamIndia! 💪 💪4⃣ wickets each for Mohammed Siraj & Arshdeep Singh 1⃣ wicket for Harshal PatelOver to our batters now! 👍 👍Scorecard ▶️ https://t.co/UtR64C00Rs #TeamIndia | #NZvIND pic.twitter.com/g59Uz7h2eh— BCCI (@BCCI) November 22, 2022India got their first breakthrough when Arshdeep had Finn Allen trapped in front of the wicket with a full delivery that swung in from around middle. Allen thought about a review before deciding to walk back as the ball was clearly going to hit the stumps.Veteran Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowled a tight third over before Conway decided to take on left-arm seamer Arshdeep, carting him through mid-wicket for a four before lofting the bowler over extra cover for a six. He then chipped one over the pacer’s head for a lovely boundary.The fourth over yielded 19 runs and it seemed New Zealand were on their way.Bhuvneshwar Kumar conceded 14 runs in the next over as the Kiwis looked to end the powerplay, their weak area in recent times, on a strong note.However, a bowling change put paid to all such hopes as Siraj dismissed Mark Chapman for a run-a-ball 12. Against a length ball on middle and leg, Chapman got a leading edge while trying to flick and Arshdeep completed the catch without much fuss, ending a brief but brisk partnership.After conceding 33 runs in two overs, the Indian bowlers fought back strongly to concede only 17 runs in the next four. Conway broke the shackles with a boundary off Yuzvendra Chahal as New Zealand reached 74 for two at the halfway stage of their innings.In a subdued start, the big-hitting Phillips found a couple of boundaries before hitting Chahal for a four and a huge six off successive balls to help his team go past 100 in the 13th over.Phillips then launched himself into Bhuvenshwar, smashing a four and a monstrous six that landed on the roof at McLean Park. As many as 31 runs came from over number 12 and 13, before Phillips smoked Harshal Patel over deep square leg for another maximum.However, Phillips got a top edge against Siraj and Buvneshwar took the catch in the deep in what was a massive breakthrough for the tourists. Phillips’ dismissal triggered a collapse as the hosts lost their remaining wickets for very little.(With PTI inputs)Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
