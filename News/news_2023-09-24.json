Beanpole fast bowler Scrimshaw, the first Derbyshire player to feature for England since Dominic Cork 21 years ago, was picked for his ability to produce speeds close to 90 miles per hour but operated at around 82 during a torrid new-ball spell that included him sending down six no-balls and a wide inside his first two overs. The 25-year-old was mercilessly treated by Ireland’s Paul Stirling and Andrew Balbirnie during an opening stand of 46, but after gifting half a dozen free hits, things began to turn around for the over-awed new cap when he struck with his 12th legitimate ball: Balbirnie edging low to Ben Duckett at slip. Scrimshaw’s figures at that stage of 2-0-35-1 threatened to gain him notoriety via a place amongst the worst analyses in international history and the depth of on-field empathy for his plight was highlighted when pats on the back for Balbirnie’s dismissal came not only from a posse of team-mates but Australian umpire Rod Tucker. He then went for just a single in his next over and his nerves appeared to be easing when he returned from the pavilion end to have Lorcan Tucker brilliantly held by a tumbling Duckett at midwicket. He finished with three for 66 when last man Josh Little picked out long on. George Scrimshaw endured a nightmare start to his England debut as the hosts beat Ireland Zak Crawley said he was 'impressed' with the way Scrimshaw bounced back during the win ‘I was so impressed with how George Scrimshaw bounced back, he showed a lot of character,’ said Zak Crawley, England’s 36th ODI captain, leading the team with the 15 men bound for the World Cup next week resting. 'I wanted to give him another over after a tough start and give him a chance. You’ve got to keep backing people to do their jobs.’ When Matthew Potts made it two wickets in two balls by snaking the first delivery of the fifth over through the defence of Ireland captain Stirling, momentum was with England. It remained so throughout a 10-over spell from Leicestershire leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed that reaped figures of 10-0-54-4, his best for England outside of Test cricket. The catching was excellent too, typified by a running, overhead effort from Will Jacks, who had earlier struck 94 in a total of 334 for eight. Unable to cope with Ahmed’s googly, Ireland had slumped to 157 for seven but England’s worst period of the match followed as Barry McCarthy, Craig Young and Little - Ireland’s numbers nine, 10 and 11 - all hit career-best scores to delay the inevitable. In contrast to Scrimshaw, Sam Hain moved effortlessly onto the biggest stage, having waited until the age of 28 to show the qualities that place him second only to Indian batter Ruturaj Gaikwad in terms of one-day average (57.96) in the history of the game. The chance to become only England’s third centurion on debut behind Dennis Amiss and Michael Lumb eluded him, however, when he skied one in the final over of the innings and had to settle for a 84-ball 89.

Series leader and reigning champion, Ducati’s Francesco Bagnaia, came in second, while six-time champion, Honda’s Marc Marquez, took his first podium since the opening weekend of the season to come in third. Pramac rider Martin, who qualified second just 0.043s behind Bezzecchi, got the better start and took hold of the racing line going into the tricky first turn to overtake the VR46, before Bezzecchi was clipped by an overextended Marini, whose race, and weekend, ended at that first corner after the crash resulted in a broken collarbone for the Italian. Early drama for the @VR46RacingTeam after lights out as Marini collided with Bez at Turn 1! 💥 And right after that @polespargaro and @stefanbradl also hit the gravel! 🤯 #IndianGP 🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/gVkwiJ5MsX — MotoGP™🏁 (@MotoGP) September 23, 2023 While Bagnaia remained steady in second place, and Marquez was engaged in a podium fight with KTM’s Brad Binder who made up nine places during the first turn chaos, none were a match for Martin who dominated the sprint – which was reduced by a lap due to the hot conditions but then delayed by two hours after heavy rainfall – from start to finish, having a race of his own as he won by a margin of 1.389s in what was a faultless performance. Braking the difference The consensus among many of the riders in the paddock remained that with a tricky and new circuit, Martin and Bezzecchi were the top performers of the day thanks to their hard braking abilities. “Following him (Martin) was too much. He has an advantage in terms of braking,” Bagnaia told the media after the sprint, adding that he is losing grip because his rear tyre has been bouncing. “Jorge has started to brake really hard over the last few weekends, but even more so here. If I brake at the same time as him, I go wide.” Ducati Lenovo Team Italian rider Francesco Bagnaia (1), Repsol Honda Team Spanish rider Marc Marquez (93), Repsol Honda Team Spanish rider Joan Mir (36), Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP Team French rider Fabio Quartararo (20) during the sprint race at the Grand Prix of India, at the Buddha International Circuit, Greater Noida, Saturday, Sept. 22, 2023. (PTI) “I was very strong in braking, compared to the riders I had in front,” Bezzecchi, despite disappointment, confirmed. After falling to the back of the pack on the first turn, the Italian stormed through the rest of the grid to finish the sprint fifth. “I was good at the Sector 3, the flowing part of the track, but in hard braking (points), I was making a bit more of a difference than the others, maybe that is where I gained the time,” he added. Riders have pointed to the fact that throughout the entire track, there are challenging turns where the margin for error at braking points is very limited. Perhaps one of the reasons for the tricky cornering could be that despite heavy upgrade works, the track was built for Formula One racing, where, unlike MotoGP, four-wheeler cars boast of higher downforce that allows them to go through corners at speed. Turn 1 pileup Advertisement Bezzecchi and Marini’s incident was not the only tussle at turn 1, as behind them, Honda tester Stefan Bradl slammed into Tehc3’s Pol Espargaro to end both of their races as they joined Marini back in the paddock. Turn 1 at the BIC had been particularly challenging for the riders this weekend, with a slew of them going wide into the run-off area during the practice sessions on Friday. But many of the riders did not place the blame on the track, instead saying that frequent incidents at the opening turn of a race, on any circuit, is down to rider errors, and a tinge of greed with riders braking late in trying to find an advantage, knowing that the penalties for causing an incident are not too harsh. No matter how difficult the road is, the hard work will pay off 💪 A very happy @marcmarquez93 on his return to the podium! 🥉 #TissotSprint | #IndianGP 🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/fUndduAVSa — MotoGP™🏁 (@MotoGP) September 23, 2023 When asked what can be done to avoid such incidents, Aprilia rider Aleix Espargaro, Pol’s brother, who is among the more vocal riders on safety issues, said: “The solution to this is simple. Strong penalties. Very strong. You’ll see them brake earlier and we’ll avoid these (crashes).” Most Read 1 ‘Surviving on bread, fighting for refunds’: Indian students in Canada struggle to find housing, food, jobs 2 Chandrayaan-3 mission: Dawn breaks on Moon, all eyes on lander, rover to wake up 3 Jawan box office collection day 16: Shah Rukh Khan’s film is just Rs 10 crore short of breaking Pathaan’s record 4 No signal from Chandrayaan-3 mission after lunar sunrise, says ISRO 5 Canada NSA met Doval before, during Trudeau trip to Delhi; US says in touch with both govts See More After his first lap incident, Marini has been ruled out of the race on Sunday, and so has Gresini rider Alex Marquez, after his crash during the first qualifying session left him with two broken ribs.

Sodhi contributed a crucial 35 with the bat as well to go with his career-best 6-39 as New Zealand registered their first victory in Bangladesh since 2008 on Saturday. After the first match had been washed out, the Kiwis took the chance to get into winning ways with the World Cup looming. In the 46th over, pace bowler Hasan Mahmud ran Sodhi out as he was backing up at the non-striker's end when on 17, but Bangladesh captain Liton Das called him back. Sodhi, who went on to help the side post 254 in 49.2 overs, then ran through Bangladesh's top order in a superb display of legspinning. Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell made a team-high 68 off 66 balls, with six fours and one six, and Henry Nicholls scored 49. They put on a 95-run partnership for the fourth wicket to set the platform. Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman had reduced New Zealand to 2-26 after the visitors opted to bat first. He removed Will Young, who made 58 in the first match, for a duck and then claimed the wicket of Finn Allen for 12. Debutant Syed Khaled Ahmed (3-60), got into the act with the wicket of Chad Bowes for 14, as New Zealand slumped to 3-36 before Nicholls and Blundell got them back on track. Sodhi propelled the side past 250, hitting three sixes in his knock before being the last batter out. With Tanzid Hasan finding the boundaries with ease, Bangladesh appeared to be the clear favourites until Sodhi sparked the collapse, doing most to reduce them to 5-92 from 1-60 in just eight overs. He started with the wicket of Tanzid (16) and then got the key scalp of Tamim Iqbal, who was out for 44 when trying to sweep against a googly. Sodhi also removed Soumya Sarkar, who played his first match in two years, for a duck and Towhid Hridoy for four. Mahmudullah and Mahedi Hasan resisted, sharing a 42-run stand before Sodhi knocked out the latter for his maiden five-for. Offspinner Cole McConchie had Mahmudullah caught by Finn Allen at short fine leg after he made a team-best 49. Nasum Ahmed scored 21 but that only reduced the margin of the defeat as the teams head for the third and final ODI on Tuesday.","pubDate":"2023-09-23 16:44:05","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11996821/b1627b7dac9cd4777f0dd427bd4bb384cc9f588a-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bb6515fd9592f56512b039b1ac9eb20a","title":"Don't think anyone would have a seam position as good as Shami: Harbhajan","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/australia-in-india/dont-think-anyone-at-the-moment-would-have-a-seam-position-as-good-as-mohammed-shami-harbhajan-singh/articleshow/103893942.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mohammed Shami's exceptional performance saw him achieve a career-best by taking five wickets for a mere 51 runs against Australia in the first ODI, a feat that hasn't been matched by any Indian pacer at home since Zaheer Khan accomplished it in 2007.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-09-23 16:08:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","source_priority":391,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"21696d1ef6983a561a7b785b62f1ac3c","title":"Rahul Dravid’s son, Samit named in Karnataka’s squad for Vinoo Mankad Trophy","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rahul-dravids-son-samit-named-in-karnatakas-squad-for-vinoo-mankad-trophy-8953189/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"India head coach Rahul Dravid’s son, Samit has been added to Karnataka’s 15-player squad for the 2023 Vinoo Mankad Trophy.

The event marks a two-week celebration of sportsmanship and talent, featuring over 12,000 competitors from 45 nations and territories participating in a total of 61 disciplines. The captivating opening ceremony unfolded at the renowned Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium, popularly known as the Big Lotus, showcasing a seamless fusion of China’s rich cultural heritage and its contemporary dynamism. The event’s organizers incorporated cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and eco-friendly solutions, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. Notably, the stadium can accommodate an impressive audience of up to 80,000 spectators. India, a steadfast participant in the Asian Games since its inception in 1951, was proudly represented by Indian Hockey Team Captain Harmanpreet Singh and boxer Lovlina Borgohain as the flag bearers during the ceremony. The Indian contingent comprises a total of 921 individuals, including 655 athletes, 260 coaches, and support staff. Early events in the Asian Games featured India’s dominance in Table Tennis, with both the men’s and women’s teams advancing to the pre-quarterfinals. The Indian Men’s Table Tennis team secured a resounding victory against Tajikistan, while the Women’s team triumphed against Nepal. The Indian Men’s Table Tennis team is scheduled to face Kazakhstan in the Round of 16 at 9.30 hrs IST tomorrow. In T20 Cricket, the Indian women’s team has already secured a spot in the semifinals.

India’s passion and commitment to sports shines through as we send our largest ever contingent in the Asian Games. May our athletes play well and demonstrate in action what true sporting spirit is.” As the Asian Games commence, I convey my best wishes to the Indian contingent.

Beanpole fast bowler Scrimshaw, the first Derbyshire player to feature for England since Dominic Cork 21 years ago, was picked for his ability to produce speeds close to 90 miles per hour but operated at around 82 during a torrid new-ball spell that included him sending down six no-balls and a wide inside his first two overs. The 25-year-old was mercilessly treated by Ireland’s Paul Stirling and Andrew Balbirnie during an opening stand of 46, but after gifting half a dozen free hits, things began to turn around for the over-awed new cap when he struck with his 12th legitimate ball: Balbirnie edging low to Ben Duckett at slip. Scrimshaw’s figures at that stage of 2-0-35-1 threatened to gain him notoriety via a place amongst the worst analyses in international history and the depth of on-field empathy for his plight was highlighted when pats on the back for Balbirnie’s dismissal came not only from a posse of team-mates but Australian umpire Rod Tucker. He then went for just a single in his next over and his nerves appeared to be easing when he returned from the pavilion end to have Lorcan Tucker brilliantly held by a tumbling Duckett at midwicket. He finished with three for 66 when last man Josh Little picked out long on. George Scrimshaw endured a nightmare start to his England debut as the hosts beat Ireland Zak Crawley said he was 'impressed' with the way Scrimshaw bounced back during the win ‘I was so impressed with how George Scrimshaw bounced back, he showed a lot of character,’ said Zak Crawley, England’s 36th ODI captain, leading the team with the 15 men bound for the World Cup next week resting. 'I wanted to give him another over after a tough start and give him a chance. You’ve got to keep backing people to do their jobs.’ When Matthew Potts made it two wickets in two balls by snaking the first delivery of the fifth over through the defence of Ireland captain Stirling, momentum was with England. It remained so throughout a 10-over spell from Leicestershire leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed that reaped figures of 10-0-54-4, his best for England outside of Test cricket. The catching was excellent too, typified by a running, overhead effort from Will Jacks, who had earlier struck 94 in a total of 334 for eight. Unable to cope with Ahmed’s googly, Ireland had slumped to 157 for seven but England’s worst period of the match followed as Barry McCarthy, Craig Young and Little - Ireland’s numbers nine, 10 and 11 - all hit career-best scores to delay the inevitable. In contrast to Scrimshaw, Sam Hain moved effortlessly onto the biggest stage, having waited until the age of 28 to show the qualities that place him second only to Indian batter Ruturaj Gaikwad in terms of one-day average (57.96) in the history of the game. The chance to become only England’s third centurion on debut behind Dennis Amiss and Michael Lumb eluded him, however, when he skied one in the final over of the innings and had to settle for a 84-ball 89.

Series leader and reigning champion, Ducati’s Francesco Bagnaia, came in second, while six-time champion, Honda’s Marc Marquez, took his first podium since the opening weekend of the season to come in third. Pramac rider Martin, who qualified second just 0.043s behind Bezzecchi, got the better start and took hold of the racing line going into the tricky first turn to overtake the VR46, before Bezzecchi was clipped by an overextended Marini, whose race, and weekend, ended at that first corner after the crash resulted in a broken collarbone for the Italian. Early drama for the @VR46RacingTeam after lights out as Marini collided with Bez at Turn 1! 💥 And right after that @polespargaro and @stefanbradl also hit the gravel! 🤯 #IndianGP 🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/gVkwiJ5MsX — MotoGP™🏁 (@MotoGP) September 23, 2023 While Bagnaia remained steady in second place, and Marquez was engaged in a podium fight with KTM’s Brad Binder who made up nine places during the first turn chaos, none were a match for Martin who dominated the sprint – which was reduced by a lap due to the hot conditions but then delayed by two hours after heavy rainfall – from start to finish, having a race of his own as he won by a margin of 1.389s in what was a faultless performance. Braking the difference The consensus among many of the riders in the paddock remained that with a tricky and new circuit, Martin and Bezzecchi were the top performers of the day thanks to their hard braking abilities. “Following him (Martin) was too much. He has an advantage in terms of braking,” Bagnaia told the media after the sprint, adding that he is losing grip because his rear tyre has been bouncing. “Jorge has started to brake really hard over the last few weekends, but even more so here. If I brake at the same time as him, I go wide.” Ducati Lenovo Team Italian rider Francesco Bagnaia (1), Repsol Honda Team Spanish rider Marc Marquez (93), Repsol Honda Team Spanish rider Joan Mir (36), Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP Team French rider Fabio Quartararo (20) during the sprint race at the Grand Prix of India, at the Buddha International Circuit, Greater Noida, Saturday, Sept. 22, 2023. (PTI) “I was very strong in braking, compared to the riders I had in front,” Bezzecchi, despite disappointment, confirmed. After falling to the back of the pack on the first turn, the Italian stormed through the rest of the grid to finish the sprint fifth. “I was good at the Sector 3, the flowing part of the track, but in hard braking (points), I was making a bit more of a difference than the others, maybe that is where I gained the time,” he added. Riders have pointed to the fact that throughout the entire track, there are challenging turns where the margin for error at braking points is very limited. Perhaps one of the reasons for the tricky cornering could be that despite heavy upgrade works, the track was built for Formula One racing, where, unlike MotoGP, four-wheeler cars boast of higher downforce that allows them to go through corners at speed. Turn 1 pileup Advertisement Bezzecchi and Marini’s incident was not the only tussle at turn 1, as behind them, Honda tester Stefan Bradl slammed into Tehc3’s Pol Espargaro to end both of their races as they joined Marini back in the paddock. Turn 1 at the BIC had been particularly challenging for the riders this weekend, with a slew of them going wide into the run-off area during the practice sessions on Friday. But many of the riders did not place the blame on the track, instead saying that frequent incidents at the opening turn of a race, on any circuit, is down to rider errors, and a tinge of greed with riders braking late in trying to find an advantage, knowing that the penalties for causing an incident are not too harsh. No matter how difficult the road is, the hard work will pay off 💪 A very happy @marcmarquez93 on his return to the podium! 🥉 #TissotSprint | #IndianGP 🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/fUndduAVSa — MotoGP™🏁 (@MotoGP) September 23, 2023 When asked what can be done to avoid such incidents, Aprilia rider Aleix Espargaro, Pol’s brother, who is among the more vocal riders on safety issues, said: “The solution to this is simple. Strong penalties. Very strong. You’ll see them brake earlier and we’ll avoid these (crashes).” Most Read 1 ‘Surviving on bread, fighting for refunds’: Indian students in Canada struggle to find housing, food, jobs 2 Chandrayaan-3 mission: Dawn breaks on Moon, all eyes on lander, rover to wake up 3 Jawan box office collection day 16: Shah Rukh Khan’s film is just Rs 10 crore short of breaking Pathaan’s record 4 No signal from Chandrayaan-3 mission after lunar sunrise, says ISRO 5 Canada NSA met Doval before, during Trudeau trip to Delhi; US says in touch with both govts See More After his first lap incident, Marini has been ruled out of the race on Sunday, and so has Gresini rider Alex Marquez, after his crash during the first qualifying session left him with two broken ribs.

Sodhi contributed a crucial 35 with the bat as well to go with his career-best 6-39 as New Zealand registered their first victory in Bangladesh since 2008 on Saturday. After the first match had been washed out, the Kiwis took the chance to get into winning ways with the World Cup looming. In the 46th over, pace bowler Hasan Mahmud ran Sodhi out as he was backing up at the non-striker's end when on 17, but Bangladesh captain Liton Das called him back. Sodhi, who went on to help the side post 254 in 49.2 overs, then ran through Bangladesh's top order in a superb display of legspinning. Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell made a team-high 68 off 66 balls, with six fours and one six, and Henry Nicholls scored 49. They put on a 95-run partnership for the fourth wicket to set the platform. Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman had reduced New Zealand to 2-26 after the visitors opted to bat first. He removed Will Young, who made 58 in the first match, for a duck and then claimed the wicket of Finn Allen for 12. Debutant Syed Khaled Ahmed (3-60), got into the act with the wicket of Chad Bowes for 14, as New Zealand slumped to 3-36 before Nicholls and Blundell got them back on track. Sodhi propelled the side past 250, hitting three sixes in his knock before being the last batter out. With Tanzid Hasan finding the boundaries with ease, Bangladesh appeared to be the clear favourites until Sodhi sparked the collapse, doing most to reduce them to 5-92 from 1-60 in just eight overs. He started with the wicket of Tanzid (16) and then got the key scalp of Tamim Iqbal, who was out for 44 when trying to sweep against a googly. Sodhi also removed Soumya Sarkar, who played his first match in two years, for a duck and Towhid Hridoy for four. Mahmudullah and Mahedi Hasan resisted, sharing a 42-run stand before Sodhi knocked out the latter for his maiden five-for. Offspinner Cole McConchie had Mahmudullah caught by Finn Allen at short fine leg after he made a team-best 49. Nasum Ahmed scored 21 but that only reduced the margin of the defeat as the teams head for the third and final ODI on Tuesday.","pubDate":"2023-09-23 16:44:05","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11996821/b1627b7dac9cd4777f0dd427bd4bb384cc9f588a-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bb6515fd9592f56512b039b1ac9eb20a","title":"Don't think anyone would have a seam position as good as Shami: Harbhajan","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/australia-in-india/dont-think-anyone-at-the-moment-would-have-a-seam-position-as-good-as-mohammed-shami-harbhajan-singh/articleshow/103893942.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mohammed Shami's exceptional performance saw him achieve a career-best by taking five wickets for a mere 51 runs against Australia in the first ODI, a feat that hasn't been matched by any Indian pacer at home since Zaheer Khan accomplished it in 2007.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-09-23 16:08:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","source_priority":391,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"21696d1ef6983a561a7b785b62f1ac3c","title":"Rahul Dravid’s son, Samit named in Karnataka’s squad for Vinoo Mankad Trophy","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rahul-dravids-son-samit-named-in-karnatakas-squad-for-vinoo-mankad-trophy-8953189/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"India head coach Rahul Dravid’s son, Samit has been added to Karnataka’s 15-player squad for the 2023 Vinoo Mankad Trophy.

The event marks a two-week celebration of sportsmanship and talent, featuring over 12,000 competitors from 45 nations and territories participating in a total of 61 disciplines. The captivating opening ceremony unfolded at the renowned Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium, popularly known as the Big Lotus, showcasing a seamless fusion of China’s rich cultural heritage and its contemporary dynamism. The event’s organizers incorporated cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and eco-friendly solutions, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. Notably, the stadium can accommodate an impressive audience of up to 80,000 spectators. India, a steadfast participant in the Asian Games since its inception in 1951, was proudly represented by Indian Hockey Team Captain Harmanpreet Singh and boxer Lovlina Borgohain as the flag bearers during the ceremony. The Indian contingent comprises a total of 921 individuals, including 655 athletes, 260 coaches, and support staff. Early events in the Asian Games featured India’s dominance in Table Tennis, with both the men’s and women’s teams advancing to the pre-quarterfinals. The Indian Men’s Table Tennis team secured a resounding victory against Tajikistan, while the Women’s team triumphed against Nepal. The Indian Men’s Table Tennis team is scheduled to face Kazakhstan in the Round of 16 at 9.30 hrs IST tomorrow. In T20 Cricket, the Indian women’s team has already secured a spot in the semifinals. The upcoming matches will witness Indian Women facing Bangladesh in the 1st Semifinal, while Pakistan Women will compete against Sri Lanka Women in the 2nd Semifinal. The Indian men’s T20 Cricket event is slated to take place between September 28 and October 8.

India’s passion and commitment to sports shines through as we send our largest ever contingent in the Asian Games. May our athletes play well and demonstrate in action what true sporting spirit is.” As the Asian Games commence, I convey my best wishes to the Indian contingent.

Beanpole fast bowler Scrimshaw, the first Derbyshire player to feature for England since Dominic Cork 21 years ago, was picked for his ability to produce speeds close to 90 miles per hour but operated at around 82 during a torrid new-ball spell that included him sending down six no-balls and a wide inside his first two overs. The 25-year-old was mercilessly treated by Ireland’s Paul Stirling and Andrew Balbirnie during an opening stand of 46, but after gifting half a dozen free hits, things began to turn around for the over-awed new cap when he struck with his 12th legitimate ball: Balbirnie edging low to Ben Duckett at slip. Scrimshaw’s figures at that stage of 2-0-35-1 threatened to gain him notoriety via a place amongst the worst analyses in international history and the depth of on-field empathy for his plight was highlighted when pats on the back for Balbirnie’s dismissal came not only from a posse of team-mates but Australian umpire Rod Tucker. He then went for just a single in his next over and his nerves appeared to be easing when he returned from the pavilion end to have Lorcan Tucker brilliantly held by a tumbling Duckett at midwicket. He finished with three for 66 when last man Josh Little picked out long on. George Scrimshaw endured a nightmare start to his England debut as the hosts beat Ireland Zak Crawley said he was 'impressed' with the way Scrimshaw bounced back during the win ‘I was so impressed with how George Scrimshaw bounced back, he showed a lot of character,’ said Zak Crawley, England’s 36th ODI captain, leading the team with the 15 men bound for the World Cup next week resting. 'I wanted to give him another over after a tough start and give him a chance. You’ve got to keep backing people to do their jobs.’ When Matthew Potts made it two wickets in two balls by snaking the first delivery of the fifth over through the defence of Ireland captain Stirling, momentum was with England. It remained so throughout a 10-over spell from Leicestershire leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed that reaped figures of 10-0-54-4, his best for England outside of Test cricket. The catching was excellent too, typified by a running, overhead effort from Will Jacks, who had earlier struck 94 in a total of 334 for eight. Unable to cope with Ahmed’s googly, Ireland had slumped to 157 for seven but England’s worst period of the match followed as Barry McCarthy, Craig Young and Little - Ireland’s numbers nine, 10 and 11 - all hit career-best scores to delay the inevitable. In contrast to Scrimshaw, Sam Hain moved effortlessly onto the biggest stage, having waited until the age of 28 to show the qualities that place him second only to Indian batter Ruturaj Gaikwad in terms of one-day average (57.96) in the history of the game. The chance to become only England’s third centurion on debut behind Dennis Amiss and Michael Lumb eluded him, however, when he skied one in the final over of the innings and had to settle for a 84-ball 89.

Series leader and reigning champion, Ducati’s Francesco Bagnaia, came in second, while six-time champion, Honda’s Marc Marquez, took his first podium since the opening weekend of the season to come in third. Pramac rider Martin, who qualified second just 0.043s behind Bezzecchi, got the better start and took hold of the racing line going into the tricky first turn to overtake the VR46, before Bezzecchi was clipped by an overextended Marini, whose race, and weekend, ended at that first corner after the crash resulted in a broken collarbone for the Italian. Early drama for the @VR46RacingTeam after lights out as Marini collided with Bez at Turn 1! 💥 And right after that @polespargaro and @stefanbradl also hit the gravel! 🤯 #IndianGP 🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/gVkwiJ5MsX — MotoGP™🏁 (@MotoGP) September 23, 2023 While Bagnaia remained steady in second place, and Marquez was engaged in a podium fight with KTM’s Brad Binder who made up nine places during the first turn chaos, none were a match for Martin who dominated the sprint – which was reduced by a lap due to the hot conditions but then delayed by two hours after heavy rainfall – from start to finish, having a race of his own as he won by a margin of 1.389s in what was a faultless performance. Braking the difference The consensus among many of the riders in the paddock remained that with a tricky and new circuit, Martin and Bezzecchi were the top performers of the day thanks to their hard braking abilities. “Following him (Martin) was too much. He has an advantage in terms of braking,” Bagnaia told the media after the sprint, adding that he is losing grip because his rear tyre has been bouncing. “Jorge has started to brake really hard over the last few weekends, but even more so here. If I brake at the same time as him, I go wide.” Ducati Lenovo Team Italian rider Francesco Bagnaia (1), Repsol Honda Team Spanish rider Marc Marquez (93), Repsol Honda Team Spanish rider Joan Mir (36), Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP Team French rider Fabio Quartararo (20) during the sprint race at the Grand Prix of India, at the Buddha International Circuit, Greater Noida, Saturday, Sept. 22, 2023. (PTI) “I was very strong in braking, compared to the riders I had in front,” Bezzecchi, despite disappointment, confirmed. After falling to the back of the pack on the first turn, the Italian stormed through the rest of the grid to finish the sprint fifth. “I was good at the Sector 3, the flowing part of the track, but in hard braking (points), I was making a bit more of a difference than the others, maybe that is where I gained the time,” he added. Riders have pointed to the fact that throughout the entire track, there are challenging turns where the margin for error at braking points is very limited. Perhaps one of the reasons for the tricky cornering could be that despite heavy upgrade works, the track was built for Formula One racing, where, unlike MotoGP, four-wheeler cars boast of higher downforce that allows them to go through corners at speed. Turn 1 pileup Advertisement Bezzecchi and Marini’s incident was not the only tussle at turn 1, as behind them, Honda tester Stefan Bradl slammed into Tehc3’s Pol Espargaro to end both of their races as they joined Marini back in the paddock. Turn 1 at the BIC had been particularly challenging for the riders this weekend, with a slew of them going wide into the run-off area during the practice sessions on Friday. But many of the riders did not place the blame on the track, instead saying that frequent incidents at the opening turn of a race, on any circuit, is down to rider errors, and a tinge of greed with riders braking late in trying to find an advantage, knowing that the penalties for causing an incident are not too harsh. No matter how difficult the road is, the hard work will pay off 💪 A very happy @marcmarquez93 on his return to the podium! 🥉 #TissotSprint | #IndianGP 🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/fUndduAVSa — MotoGP™🏁 (@MotoGP) September 23, 2023 When asked what can be done to avoid such incidents, Aprilia rider Aleix Espargaro, Pol’s brother, who is among the more vocal riders on safety issues, said: “The solution to this is simple. Strong penalties. Very strong. You’ll see them brake earlier and we’ll avoid these (crashes).” Most Read 1 ‘Surviving on bread, fighting for refunds’: Indian students in Canada struggle to find housing, food, jobs 2 Chandrayaan-3 mission: Dawn breaks on Moon, all eyes on lander, rover to wake up 3 Jawan box office collection day 16: Shah Rukh Khan’s film is just Rs 10 crore short of breaking Pathaan’s record 4 No signal from Chandrayaan-3 mission after lunar sunrise, says ISRO 5 Canada NSA met Doval before, during Trudeau trip to Delhi; US says in touch with both govts See More After his first lap incident, Marini has been ruled out of the race on Sunday, and so has Gresini rider Alex Marquez, after his crash during the first qualifying session left him with two broken ribs.

Sodhi contributed a crucial 35 with the bat as well to go with his career-best 6-39 as New Zealand registered their first victory in Bangladesh since 2008 on Saturday. After the first match had been washed out, the Kiwis took the chance to get into winning ways with the World Cup looming. In the 46th over, pace bowler Hasan Mahmud ran Sodhi out as he was backing up at the non-striker's end when on 17, but Bangladesh captain Liton Das called him back. Sodhi, who went on to help the side post 254 in 49.2 overs, then ran through Bangladesh's top order in a superb display of legspinning. Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell made a team-high 68 off 66 balls, with six fours and one six, and Henry Nicholls scored 49. They put on a 95-run partnership for the fourth wicket to set the platform. Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman had reduced New Zealand to 2-26 after the visitors opted to bat first. He removed Will Young, who made 58 in the first match, for a duck and then claimed the wicket of Finn Allen for 12. Debutant Syed Khaled Ahmed (3-60), got into the act with the wicket of Chad Bowes for 14, as New Zealand slumped to 3-36 before Nicholls and Blundell got them back on track. Sodhi propelled the side past 250, hitting three sixes in his knock before being the last batter out. With Tanzid Hasan finding the boundaries with ease, Bangladesh appeared to be the clear favourites until Sodhi sparked the collapse, doing most to reduce them to 5-92 from 1-60 in just eight overs. He started with the wicket of Tanzid (16) and then got the key scalp of Tamim Iqbal, who was out for 44 when trying to sweep against a googly. Sodhi also removed Soumya Sarkar, who played his first match in two years, for a duck and Towhid Hridoy for four. Mahmudullah and Mahedi Hasan resisted, sharing a 42-run stand before Sodhi knocked out the latter for his maiden five-for. Offspinner Cole McConchie had Mahmudullah caught by Finn Allen at short fine leg after he made a team-best 49. Nasum Ahmed scored 21 but that only reduced the margin of the defeat as the teams head for the third and final ODI on Tuesday.","pubDate":"2023-09-23 16:44:05","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11996821/b1627b7dac9cd4777f0dd427bd4bb384cc9f588a-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bb6515fd9592f56512b039b1ac9eb20a","title":"Don't think anyone would have a seam position as good as Shami: Harbhajan","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/australia-in-india/dont-think-anyone-at-the-moment-would-have-a-seam-position-as-good-as-mohammed-shami-harbhajan-singh/articleshow/103893942.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mohammed Shami's exceptional performance saw him achieve a career-best by taking five wickets for a mere 51 runs against Australia in the first ODI, a feat that hasn't been matched by any Indian pacer at home since Zaheer Khan accomplished it in 2007.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-09-23 16:08:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","source_priority":391,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"21696d1ef6983a561a7b785b62f1ac3c","title":"Rahul Dravid’s son, Samit named in Karnataka’s squad for Vinoo Mankad Trophy","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rahul-dravids-son-samit-named-in-karnatakas-squad-for-vinoo-mankad-trophy-8953189/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"India head coach Rahul Dravid’s son, Samit has been added to Karnataka’s 15-player squad for the 2023 Vinoo Mankad Trophy.
