The pressure on the Swans to win their first game in Sydney was so great that a couple of times it seemed as if the occasion would get the better of them. Besides being a victory for South it was a massive win for the VFL’s venture into this Rugby city. A crowd of 15,764 paying customers at the SCG on a wet day and in the city which normally doesn’t attract big football attendances, was most pleasing to the League officials here in force. The highest Rugby League attendance was 14,186 at the Parramatta-Manly match. “We’ll have the same people back next time and they’ll bring their friends,” said South’s administrator Alan Schwab. “South could be a great club in this city if everything is done the right way from now on,” he said.

South won’t play in too many bigger games than it did today.” League president Dr Allen Aylett said: “I thought it was absolutely unbelievable. There is a power crisis in this State but New South Wales has just found a new power — the Sydney Swans. They’ll do wonders for this State.” South coach Ricky Quade said: “After what they have been through there was a tremendous amount of pressure on the players to do well. It would have to take three or four goals off any side.” Melbourne’s coach Ron Barassi was bitterly disappointed and threatened action against his players for losing. From a purely football viewpoint he said South’s success was good for the game. Maybe everyone got a little carried away by South’s dreamlike success, but it is clear VFL football is here to stay — so Rugby beware. Besides the four premiership points, South collected $10,000 in prize money, the first of six HSV-7 winner-take-all matches through the season. Yesterday’s cash will at least pay off something towards the $100,000 spent to promote yesterday’s game and to get South going in their new home. Soon after the win the South players were guests at Fairwater, the harborside mansion of their No. 1 Sydney woman ticket holder Lady Mary Fairfax. And what a garden party it was. Two chefs and a football team of helpers served such exotic food as brandied marshmallows, black forest cake and mountains of oysters. And you could drink what you liked. The Swans were knocked out by it all. Captain Barry Round said: “It sure beats pies and sauce in the South rooms”. The swimming pool — bigger than most backyards — was covered with red and white balloons overlooking the tennis court and the harbor at Double Bay. After being presented with the club’s No.1 membership ticket at the garden party, Bob Hawke said that compared to some of the disputes at South since last year his industrial problems were kindergarten stuff. Lady Fairfax after being given a No. 1 South guernsey said enthusiastically: “You played wonderfully well and I only wish I was bigger, taller and a male.” Next Saturday it will be back to reality for the Swans when they play North Melbourne at the Arden Street oval. The pre-game lunch was also on a grand scale. Sir James Hardy of wine fame and the new president of the Sydney Football League was there and accepted a place on the South board of management. It is planned to have five Sydney people on the board alongside the five Melbourne men already appointed to help run the club. The only words of anger all day were spoken by Barassi after the Demons defeat. “We had guys who may as well have not been there,” Barassi said. Barassi, who had only one win with his team last year and finished at the bottom of the ladder, added: “We are not going to put up with crappy performances like we did last year. We have depth now and blokes will be in the Reserves a lot more this year. “I’m sick of not getting the four points. We are not putting up with guys who will not learn from their mistakes. We have others to take their places.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"theage","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"From the Archives, 1982: Sydney victory a relief for the VFL","link":"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/afl/from-the-archives-1982-sydney-victory-a-relief-for-the-vfl-20220324-p5a7qx.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South Melbourne’s harbor city gamble had a fairytale ending in 1982 when it beat Melbourne in its first home game at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

There’s just about enough blue sky to make a sailor a pair of trousers, as my ol’ Ma would say. No idea either, she lives in landlocked Derbyshire.

Two changes to the XI as Dean & Davies come in for Lamb & Shrubsole! We win the toss and will bat first. #CWC22 They’ll have a bat Hello and welcome to the night of nights for England’s female cricketers. A win against Bangladesh, who incidentally they have never met before in 50 over cricket, will see them grab a spot in the semi-finals. It’s been a topsy-turvy campaign by England. They were gaping down the barrel of an early World Cup Exit after three defeats at the start of the tournament, ever since then it’s been pressure on - effectively playing elimination cricket in every match since. Heather Knight will be desperately hoping that her side’s 2022 World Cup journey in New Zealand continues to go the way of the tortoise and the hare. That their ugly duckling early performances of dropped catches and wayward bowling continue to transform into something swan-like as the competition reaches the sharp end. Lose against Bangladesh today though and it will be Goodnight, Moon . The signs are promising, some of those who had been having a ‘quieter’ time of it have stepped up. Danni Wyatt was in the runs and Katherine Brunt the wickets in the defeat of Pakistan. Kate Cross, Sophie Ecclestone, Nat Sciver and Sophia Dunkley have all performed consistently, so to the skipper herself. “Everyone is peaking at the right time going into this game and then hopefully the semi-finals… it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish,” declared opener Tammy Beaumont in the run up to today’s match at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. They won’t be taking Bangladesh lightly. Nigar Sultana’s side have beaten Pakistan and pushed both West Indies and India close. They nearly pulled off the shock of the tournament at a blustery Basin Reserve just a couple of days ago, reducing the unbeaten Aussies to 70-5 chasing a tricksy target of 135. If they’d been more proactive with the bat earlier on the piece then they could have pulled off a spectacular upset. They have a spin contingent that could damage England, especially with all the pressure on pale blue shoulders. I predict a bum-squeaker. Play starts at 10pm GMT/11 AM local time. Jim here with the call for the first half before Tanya takes over in the wee small hours. I’ll be back shortly with news of the toss and the teams.

On a stirring third day at the National Cricket Stadium in St George’s, it was the unlikely right-arm medium of Kyle Mayers that re-opened the wounds inflicted by the more celebrated Australian attack in the Ashes, claiming remarkable figures of five for nine to leave West Indies within touching distance of a 1-0 series win. England have talked up their progress on this tour but will resume their third innings on 103 for eight and a lead of just 10 runs. They need the tail to wag for a second time in the match, much like it did for West Indies when Joshua Da Silva’s unbeaten 100 turned the tide in the morning and posted 297 all out for a lead of 93 runs. But, quite frankly, they look a beaten team. Root has dutifully soldiered on with the captaincy due to a lack of alternatives but after 64 Tests he will do well to recover from this performance. Certainly when he was one of three England batters to succumb to Mayers in a collapse of four for 39 after lunch, his backfoot punch edged to slip, he looked spent. The atmosphere was electric all day, the locals signing off from the working week, outnumbering the English for the first time in this series and watching West Indies follow Da Silva’s vigil with a rousing bowling performance that began when Zak Crawley recklessly drove the fired-up Jayden Seales to slip. When Mayers followed his second removal of Root in the match by bowling Dan Lawrence for a duck – the No 4 shouldering arms to one that nipped back in – and had Ben Stokes caught behind on four the ball after Alex Lees had been dropped at slip, the steel band could easily have panned out the Last Post. Not for the first time in the match, the softening of the Dukes ball brought with it a period of calm either side of tea. Lees shrugged off his life on nine and combined with Jonny Bairstow for 25 overs of resistance. But just when parity was in sight, Da Silva had a little word from behind the stumps to tell Bairstow, on 22 from 82 balls: “You’re batting slow now Jonny, like me.” The very next over Bairstow perished attempting to address this with a pull shot off Alzarri Joseph that was under-edged to the devil on his shoulder. Ben Foakes, fresh to the crease at the end of a low-key return this tour, then compounded the breakthrough further five balls later, recklessly run out by the golden arm of Mayers from long leg attempting a needless second run. Not done there, Mayers was then handed the ball by his captain and completed his maiden Test five-wicket haul when he bowled Lees for 31 with a grubber and then had Craig Overton caught at third slip. Chris Woakes, Jack Leach and Saqib Mahmood, the No 11, will need to put their superhero pants on first thing. This carnage had followed a morning from Hades for Root’s guileless attack, West Indies resuming on 232 for eight and turning a slender lead of 28 into a potentially decisive number through the gimlet-eyed determination of Da Silva (54 not out overnight) and a 10th-wicket stand of 53 with Seales. This was a day that Da Silva will never forget, the 23-year-old having shrugged off the pain of a blow to his hand from Chris Woakes and realised a dream first spawned when he was growing up in Port of Spain; as he slapped Craig Overton for back-to-back fours to bring up his century, the noise inside the National Cricket Stadium was akin to a calypso tent during carnival season. Da Silva could barely contain his emotion, tears flooding to the eyes of this deeply religious wicketkeeper-batter as looked to the heavens and Seales, his old teammate from Queens Park Cricket Club, slapped him on the back. “Thanks to God, my parents and everybody supporting me,” Da Silva told the broadcasters at the change of innings. “It means the world to me.” This emotion clearly got to Da Silva, who appeared to feather a catch down leg the very next delivery and walked off while making a cursory review. He had already crossed the rope and was back in the dressing room by the time it transpired there was no edge, with the crowd going berserk once more. There was no impact on the final total but the reprieve allowed Da Silva to register red ink next to his name, Root bringing himself on for the next over and instantly removing Seales with a smart caught and bowled. Less clever was the England captain’s use of the review system, which saw all three burned on day two and then punished on the third morning when the newly arrived Seales survived an lbw shout from Mahmood. The latest in a string of incorrect decisions during this series, it would have seen West Indies bowled out for 245 with a lead of 41 and Da Silva left high and dry on 65. As it was, the last wicket pairing chiselled away for another 23 maddening overs and West Indies batted 116.3 in all – the sixth time since the start of the Ashes that England have racked up triple-figures in the field. After the early removal of Kemar Roach by Mahmood for a gutsy 25, England were largely bereft of ideas and met two cussed batters in Da Silva and Seales, with the latter – first-class average of 3.3 – defending gutsily but also enjoying one moment of fun when he launched the ineffective Leach back for six. It may have felt like a low moment for England in a winter boasting a good few of them, but the worst was still to come.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a3d7287c5819d1f956b1fb6dc6ecad2b2bbffa3/0_138_4571_2743/master/4571.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b8c804ff3808d897d9e34ea13e48c85d","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Smith to miss one-day test in Pakistan","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/smith-to-miss-oneday-test-in-pakistan/video/a4315b47ffc5c6464ed457466d84a8c6","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Steve Smith is set to sit out the white ball test in Pakistan after ongoing trouble with his elbow.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-26 22:00:18","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Sir' Jadeja has earned his spurs","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/sir-jadeja-has-earned-his-spurs-735268","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["The Hans India"],"video_url":null,"description":"There was a time in early 2010s when the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) management was wondering whether it was worth the investment they had made in Ravindra Jadeja.","content":"There was a time in early 2010s when the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) management was wondering whether it was worth the investment they had made in Ravindra Jadeja.

In the first match, Delhi will take on Mumbai and that match will begin at 3.30 pm IST (10 am GMT) but the build-up will begin much sooner. This clash will be followed by a match between Punjab and Bangalore, beginning at 7.30 pm IST (2 pm GMT). Do join us then. Goodbye and take care! Umesh Yadav is the Player of the Match for his exploits with the ball in the Powerplay. He says he is back after two years and he is happy. He thanks his captain and the staff for giving him the opportunity. Adds that he is working on his consistency and he gets the ball to swing as well early on. Tells that wickets early on are very important and he just follows his work ethic. Kolkata captain Shreyas Iyer says there's always tension when MS Dhoni is at the crease and the last 3 overs were a bit difficult to contain him as there was dew and it was hard to grip the ball. Adds that the wicket was spongier than they imagined and he himself knows the wicket inside-out and though it would be flat but it wasn't but the bowlers bowled really well. About Umesh Yadav, he says that he is very happy to see him perform really well again and they are pumped up for the next match. Time for the presentation ceremony... Sheldon Jackson is down for a quick chat. He says there were nerves at the start but the staff helped him. Adds that Dhoni is his inspiration and he always tries to imitate him. Chennai skipper, Ravindra Jadeja is up for a chat. Jadeja says dew will play its part in the second innings and while the toss, it will be very crucial further. Adds the ball was coming nicely in the second innings. Tells that Bravo bowled brilliantly but they need to do better with the bat and hopes to come back strong in the next match. Chennai had it all to do with the ball and given the score on the board was well below par, it would have required something special. With Deepak Chahar no more in the side, they didn't have an experienced pacer in the Powerplay and it showed as Deshpande and Milne were dealt with by the opposition openers pretty easily. It was then the veteran, Dwayne Bravo who provided the breakthrough. He went on to pick three wickets in total and in doing so, went level with Lasith Malinga for the most wickets in the tournament's history. His efforts were not enough though as only Mitchell Santner got on the wickets column alongside him and Chennai have a few things to ponder upon before their next match. It seemed a straightforward chase for Kolkata and with the platform their openers, Venkatesh Iyer and Ajinkya Rahane had laid, half the job was done then and there itself. Rahane played fairly well but missed out on a fifty. A couple of quick wickets fell in the middle overs but captain Shreyas Iyer along with Sam Billings just kept knocking the ball around. When the target was in sight, the big shots came out and even though Billings got out at the death, Kolkata got over the line without needing the muscle of Narine or Russell. A good win for the new captain who hit the winning runs and they will be very pleased with their performance tonight. Kolkata get over the blemishes of the previous final and get a bit of sweet revenge over Chennai. They have won the opening match of the 2022 Indian T20 League season pretty comfortably in the end with 9 balls remaining. They get the two points on the board and are off to a flying start in the tournament. Chennai have been handed a comprehensive defeat here and they will look to bounce back quickly in the next game. 18.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Iyer hits the winning runs. Milne follows Iyer on the leg side and serves a full ball. Iyer whips it to deep mid-wicket for a boundary. Kolkata win by 6 wickets. 18.2 overs (2 Runs) A length ball, outside off.

Sam Billings slog-sweeps it straight in the hands of Tushar Deshpande at deep mid-wicket.

In an extraordinary morning session on Saturday, West Indies added 65 to their overnight total after resuming play with a lead of 28 and with just two wickets in hand. It took more than two hours for a frustrated England to finally prise them out for a total of 297 as the match started to slip away from Joe Root's men. Da Silva, looking far more capable with the bat than your average No.8, added 46 to his overnight score, finishing unbeaten on 100. The 23-year-old from Trinidad displayed a confidence matched by his competence. Making nearly all his runs on the legside, he brought up his century with a Twenty20 style slash for four straight down the ground from Craig Overton. Da Silva was understandably ecstatic, and with the very next ball appeared to be out caught-behind. Seemingly convinced he had nicked the ball, Da Silva called for a review only because it was the final wicket and there was nothing to lose. He walked off the field and was as surprised as anyone when he had to return after the review showed the ball had missed the bat and struck his hip instead. Overton's temper boiled over in an exchange with No. 11 Jayden Seales, but things calmed down and captain Root, of all people, finally ended the innings when he had Seales caught-and-bowled for 13 in the next over. The England wickets were shared around by the pace attack, with Chris Woakes picking up 3-59, while Saqib Mahmood, Ben Stokes and Overton claimed two apiece. Mahmood was perhaps the pick of the England attack in only his second Test. He got the first breakthrough on Saturday, snaring Kemar Roach caught down the legside by wicketkeeper Ben Foakes for 25. Mahmood should then have had the final wicket of Seales lbw with West Indies on 245, but the umpire turned down the appeal and England did not have any reviews left after blowing them all previously. To add insult to injury, the ball flicked wide of the 'keeper for four leg-byes. Seales later hoisted Jack Leach for six over long-on.

In an extraordinary morning session on Saturday, West Indies added 65 to their overnight total after resuming play with a lead of 28 and with just two wickets in hand. It took more than two hours for a frustrated England to finally prise them out for a total of 297 as the match started to slip away from Joe Root's men. Da Silva, looking far more capable with the bat than your average No.8, added 46 to his overnight score, finishing unbeaten on 100. The 23-year-old from Trinidad displayed a confidence matched by his competence. Don't miss the latest sports news!

Thursday - Monday papers home delivered with all of the latest footy news! Making nearly all his runs on the legside, he brought up his century with a Twenty20 style slash for four straight down the ground from Craig Overton. Da Silva was understandably ecstatic, and with the very next ball appeared to be out caught-behind. Seemingly convinced he had nicked the ball, Da Silva called for a review only because it was the final wicket and there was nothing to lose. He walked off the field and was as surprised as anyone when he had to return after the review showed the ball had missed the bat and struck his hip instead. Overton's temper boiled over in an exchange with No. 11 Jayden Seales, but things calmed down and captain Root, of all people, finally ended the innings when he had Seales caught-and-bowled for 13 in the next over. The England wickets were shared around by the pace attack, with Chris Woakes picking up 3-59, while Saqib Mahmood, Ben Stokes and Overton claimed two apiece. Mahmood was perhaps the pick of the England attack in only his second Test. He got the first breakthrough on Saturday, snaring Kemar Roach caught down the legside by wicketkeeper Ben Foakes for 25. Mahmood should then have had the final wicket of Seales lbw with West Indies on 245, but the umpire turned down the appeal and England did not have any reviews left after blowing them all previously. To add insult to injury, the ball flicked wide of the 'keeper for four leg-byes. Seales later hoisted Jack Leach for six over long-on. In a strange match to date, the tailenders have compiled most of the runs for both teams in the first innings. England put on 137 runs for their final three wickets, while West Indies more than matched that effort, adding 169 runs with their last three partnerships.

Iyer goes for the big heave leg side but gets it off the inner half of the bat towards mid-wicket for a single. 14.3 overs (1 Run) It's like Sam Billings only knows to play the reverse sweep at the moment.

Well, it was a hopeful review from Chennai. Full and around off. Sam Billings looks for the reverse sweep and seems to get it off the glove towards cover-point for a run. There is a stifled appeal from Chennai and Mitchell Santner reckons it's outside off. Ravindra Jadeja does go for it and the replay shows that there's glove involved, the same is confirmed by UltraEdge. Review! Chennai take a review for LBW!

Sliding into leg, Billings gets an inside edge past backward square leg for a single. Sam Billings walks out to the middle. 11.4 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! Straight into the hands of Ravindra Jadeja at short mid-wicket and that's a really soft dismissal for Ajinkya Rahane. Mitchell Santner bowls it on a length, around middle and leg. Rahane gets pushed on the back foot and he is caught in two minds, whether to pull it or just work it away. He ends up doing neither and just pushes it towards short mid-wicket where the catch is taken. Is there still life left in this match? 11.3 overs (2 Runs) In the air but lands in no man's land. Slightly flighted, around off and turning away. Ajinkya Rahane dances down the track, looking to lift it over long off but gets a top edgen over short third man for a brace. 11.2 overs (1 Run) Flatter and outside off, this is tapped towards point for a single. 11.1 overs (1 Run) This is sliding down leg, Rahane tucks it behind square on the leg side for a single. 10.6 overs (0 Run) Around off, Iyer watchfully keeps it out on the off side. 10.5 overs (1 Run) Jadeja darts one into the pads, clipped away to fine leg for one. 10.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR!

Ajinkya Rahane has looked good at the crease and Nitish Rana has come out with a positive intent.

Rana slices it towards third man and Bravo catches it on a bounce. A single taken. 7.5 overs (4 Runs) Four byes! Through the keeper!

During the first match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede Stadium, former Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored his 28th T20 half-century to power the team to 131/5 after a poor start by the top-order. Into his 13th season for Super Kings, it is the first time that Dhoni is not leading CSK. With the team struggling at 61/5 in the 11th over, Dhoni put together a 70-run partnership for the sixth wicket alongside captain Ravindra Jadeja (26*). Albeit courtesy of a mis-field by Knight Riders spinner Varun Chakravarthy, Dhoni hit his first boundary of the night off Umesh Yadav in the 16th over. With his first boundary coming off his 19th delivery, Dhoni targeted KKR all-rounder Andre Russell to hit a total of three fours in the 18th over. Dhoni, who was wise enough to combat the spinners without taking any risk, did hit a couple of fortunate boundaries but he needed some luck on his side especially whilst playing a competitive match after more than five months. Dhoni, 40, then hit a well-controlled boundary over cover to put Shivam Mavi in pressure. With Mavi overstepping on the last delivery, Dhoni hit a six off a top-edge to up the ante. The right-hand batter hit two more boundaries off Russell’s final over to return to the pavilion after scoring 50* (38) with the help of seven fours and a six.

Into his 13th season for Super Kings, it is the first time that Dhoni is not leading CSK. With the team struggling at 61/5 in the 11th over, Dhoni put together a 70-run partnership for the sixth wicket alongside captain Ravindra Jadeja (26*). Albeit courtesy of a mis-field by Knight Riders spinner Varun Chakravarthy, Dhoni hit his first boundary of the night off Umesh Yadav in the 16th over. With his first boundary coming off his 19th delivery, Dhoni targeted KKR all-rounder Andre Russell to hit a total of three fours in the 18th over. Dhoni, who was wise enough to combat the spinners without taking any risk, did hit a couple of fortunate boundaries but he needed some luck on his side especially whilst playing a competitive match after more than five months. Dhoni, 40, then hit a well-controlled boundary over cover to put Shivam Mavi in pressure. With Mavi overstepping on the last delivery, Dhoni hit a six off a top-edge to up the ante. The right-hand batter hit two more boundaries off Russell’s final over to return to the pavilion after scoring 50* (38) with the help of seven fours and a six. Vintage MS Dhoni.

Dhoni came in to bat at number 7 when CSK were 67/5 in the 11th over and from there he started building the innings before launching an attack on the opposition. KKR got off to a great start with wickets of Ruturaj Gaikwad and Devon Conway. Soon the likes of Robin Uthappa, Ambati Rayudu and Shivam Dube. The came Dhoni to the middle amid a huge uproar from the crowd. Initially he struggled as he was playing after six months in a professional cricket match. However, once he got his eye in, Dhoni started playing his strokes and finding gaps as well. Thanks to his shots, CSK smashed 47 in the last 3 overs to take the total to 131/5.

The dew might kick in and would become even easier for Kolkata to chase this. However, Chennai have to produce something special to defend this par total. Stay tuned as the chase is just around the corner. Umesh Yadav is up for a quick chat. He says it is a fresh wicket and that's why the ball is gripping a bit. He adds that the wicket at Wankhede always has true bounce and there's help for the pacers as well as spinners. Mentions that he hasn't played in the competition much in the last two years but is happy to perform well. About his role, he says that he is happy to bowl at any point in the innings and has the capability to lead the attack. He ends by saying that the score is not big but the ball is gripping. Kolkata would have taken this score at the start. Started by Umesh Yadav with a superb bowling display and was controlled by Sunil Narine and Varun Chakaravarthy in the middle phase. Kolkata played with the tactics of the newly groomed skipper, Shreyas Iyer. Kolkata leaked a bit few runs at the backend but still, they'll fancy chasing it down. Nothing went through Chennai's plan. Both the openers fell without troubling much. Robin Uthappa played some beautiful shots but failed to continue. The two most-experienced players for Chennai, Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni were out for a long time and they took time to find their groove. Boyy, once they found it, they made full use of it. A partnership of 70 between them has helped Chennai to give a fighting chance. 47 runs from the last three overs and Chennai have done just enough to reach a respectable total. There is still the finisher alive inside that veteran guy who is carrying the hopes of Chennai at this age as well. Wankhede is always known to be the batting paradise but this was in no way a fairy tale innings for Chennai, apart from that good end. First game pressure? Might be. 19.6 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Finally, Ravindra Jadeja gets hold of one and ends things in style! Another low full toss from Andre Russell around off stump. Jadeja hangs deep and manages to carve it all the way, over the point fence for a maximum. Chennai finish with 131/5! 19.5 overs (1 Run) Fifty for MS Dhoni and he might have just given Chennai a fighting chance. A superb knock from the veteran! Russel comes 'round the wicket and pushes it full and wide. Dhoni drives it through covers for a run. Change of bat for Dhoni. A heavy bat for the last two deliveries think so. 19.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! This is vintage MSD! Russell misses the blockhole by an inch and Dhoni is all over it. He brings out the helicopter and drills it into the gap between deep mid-wicket and long on for another boundary. Dhoni moves on to 49 now. 19.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Andre Russell goes for the slower bouncer but the ball is at a comfortable height for the batter. MS Dhoni pulls it well behind square on the leg side and picks up a boundary. No chance for the deep backward square leg fielder. 19.2 overs (2 Runs) A low full toss, tailing into leg stump. Dhoni flicks it towards the deep square leg fence and races back for the second. He moves into the 40s now. 19.1 overs (1 Run) Full and on off, driven down to long on for a single. 18.6 overs (0 Run) Nicely bowled! A slower ball, on a length and pushed a bit wider. Dhoni swings hard but doesn't make a connection. 15 off the over. 18.6 overs (7 Runs) NO BALL AND SIX! Shivam Mavi has ruined a perfectly good over in the last two deliveries and this might come back to haunt Kolkata. Mavi loses grip of the ball and serves a beamer on the body. MS Dhoni is quick to react and just swing at it. The ball flies over the keeper's head and over the fence. Free-hit to follow... 18.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! No timing issue here for MS Dhoni though. Mavi misses the blockhole for the umpteenth time in the over and serves a low full toss on off. One hand comes off the handle but Dhoni manages to get it over mid off for a boundary. 18.4 overs (1 Run) Shorter in length, at 136.7 kph and on middle. Ravindra Jadeja goes hard at the pull shot but once again mistimes it towards deep mid-wicket for a single. 18.4 overs (1 Run) WIDE! This is way over. Mavi bangs it in halfway and the ball loops way over Jadeja's head. Wide called. 18.3 overs (1 Run) Misses the blockhole again does Mavi and bowls it right in the slot on leg stump. Dhoni makes a bit of room but mistimes it towards long on for a run. The 100 is up for Chennai. 18.2 overs (1 Run) Mavi looks for the blockhole but just misses. Jadeja goes a bit too hard at the low full toss and can only get it towards long on for a single. 18.1 overs (0 Run) Ravindra Jadeja threw the kitchen sink at that one but couldn't make a connection. Slower one, fuller in length and around off. Dot ball! Shivam Mavi will bowl the penultimate over. 17.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! A third boundary in the over and Chennai have 14 runs from this over. Russell goes full and wide. Dhoni looks to squeeze it out but gets a thick edge that goes well wide of the keeper and races away into the fence. 17.5 overs (0 Run) On off, Dhoni blocks it out this time. 17.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Cheeky from MSD and he's on the charge here. Around middle and leg, Dhoni stays in his crease and just flicks it past short fine leg for a boundary. 17.3 overs (1 Run) Russell hits the length hard and bowls it around off. Jadeja hangs back and taps it through cover-point for one more. 17.2 overs (1 Run) On middle, Dhoni with a half pull down to deep square leg for a single. 17.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Nice timing from MS Dhoni. Fullish delivery around off. Dhoni stands tall and uses his wrists to just steer it into the vacant fence just behind point. Andre Russell (2-0-6-1) is back on. 16.6 overs (0 Run) Half an appeal from Narine but probably sliding down leg. Narine comes 'round the wicket and slides it into the leg stump. Jadeja reaches out to defend but misses and gets hit on the pads. 16.5 overs (1 Run) Flatter, close to the off pole. Dhoni nudges it towards short third man for a quick single. 16.4 overs (0 Run) This is lovely bowling from Sunil Narine. Similar delivery to the one from a few balls ago. On a length and turning away. Dhoni goes on the back foot this time but gets beaten once again. 16.3 overs (1 Run) Once again there's a bit of mix-up in the middle. On off, Jadeja bunts it out towards cover-point and looks for the single. The two batters look at each other for a second but eventually scamper through. 16.2 overs (1 Run) Flatter, around off. This is cut away towards sweeper cover for a single. 16.1 overs (0 Run) Beaten! Sunil Narine bowls the flicker this time, on a nagging length around off stump. MS Dhoni reaches out looking to block but misjudges the flight of the ball. The ball just turns away a bit and Dhoni is beaten. 15.6 overs (1 Run) Looking for two but they won't get it. Length again, angling into leg stump. Dhoni pushes it towards wide long on for a run. 15.5 overs (1 Run) Length ball, around the hips. Jadeja tucks it away behind square on the leg side for one. 15.4 overs (1 Run) This is banged in short, on middle. MSD pulls it towards deep mid-wicket for a single. 15.3 overs (4 Runs) Misfield and four! A boundary after 48 deliveries and MS Dhoni certainly needed this confidence booster. Good-length, on off. Dhoni hangs back and punches it sweetly towards extra cover. Varun Chakaravarthy over there makes a mess off it and lets it through his hands. The ball trickles away into the fence. 15.2 overs (0 Run) Peach! Umesh Yadav bowls it on a length, around off. The ball just shoots up a bit off the pitch and moves away a bit. Dhoni looks to punch it off the back foot but gets beaten past the outside edge. 15.1 overs (1 Run) A length ball, sliding across off. Jadeja stands tall, opens the face of the ball and strokes it towards deep point for a single.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637839256664012951.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Sheldon Jackson’s speed reminded me of MS Dhoni”: Sachin Tendulkar amazed by Sheldon Jackson stumping to dismiss Robin Uthappa in IPL 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-sheldon-jacksons-speed-reminded-me-of-ms-dhoni-sachin-tendulkar-amazed-by-sheldon-jackson-stumping-to-dismiss-robin-uthappa-in-ipl-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","CSK","IPL 2022","KKR","Videos","chennai super kings","csk","Indian Premier League","Kolkata Knight riders","MS Dhoni","Robin Uthappa","Sachin Tendulkar","Sheldon Jackson","Varun Chakravarthy"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sheldon Jackson stumping: The veteran wicket-keeper batter kicked-off his Indian Premier League comeback in the best possible way.

With both Uthappa’s feet in the air, Jackson had some time to dislodge the bails. However, the 35-year old player’s lightening fast hands didn’t provide any chance whatsoever to the batter to return inside the crease.

Having hit a couple of fours and sixes each at a strike rate of 133.33, Uthappa was looking in good touch before getting out tonight.

This is flatter and outside off, it lands and spins away a bit. Dhoni takes a big step forward to push it to covers but gets beaten. Sheldon Jackson, the keeper takes it quickly and clips the bails off. It is taken upstairs and Dhoni had his back foot grounded. Is that stumped? The square leg umpire has gone upstairs. Sheldon Jackson shows nice glovework once again but doesn't seem too excited. The replays roll in and we can see that MS Dhoni has his back foot rooted inside the crease. NOT OUT! 14.3 overs (1 Run) Shorter and outside off, cut to deep point for a run. 14.2 overs (1 Run) Tossed up, full and on off. Dhoni is way too early as he tries to work it on the leg side and gets a leading edge, well wide of mid on for a single. 14.1 overs (0 Run) A flatter ball, outside off, this one spins away. Dhoni pushes it to point. Strategic Time-Out! Since the last time-out, things have gone from bad to worse for the defending champions but they have their most experienced players at the moment. Skipper Ravindra Jadeja and ex-skipper MS Dhoni hold the key here and they will look to take the innings as deep as possible to launch a few big ones at the death. Kolkata will look to stay aggressive and try to get one more wicket here that will all but ensure that they restrict their opponents for a low total. Talking about being aggressive, Sunil Narine (2-0-8-0) is brought back into the attack. 13.6 overs (0 Run) Almost dragged on! A length ball, coming with the angle around off. Jadeja looks to push but gets an inside edge and the ball bounces past the leg stump. Just three runs off the over. Kolkata in full control here. 13.5 overs (1 Run) Touch short and around off. Dhoni punches it to sweeper cover for a single. 13.4 overs (0 Run) Mavi goes wide of the crease and drifts it on middle. Dhoni hangs back and keeps it out. 13.3 overs (2 Runs) Full ball, outside off. Dhoni square drives it past point for a couple of runs. 13.2 overs (0 Run) Length and on middle. Defended back to Mavi. 13.1 overs (0 Run) A length ball, angling on off. Dhoni mistimes his drive to mid-wicket. Varun Chakaravarthy is done with his spell. His figures read, 4-0-23-1. Shivam Mavi (2-0-17-0) comes in to replace him. 12.6 overs (0 Run) Russell targets the stumps. Jadeja pushes it to mid-wicket. 12.5 overs (1 Run) On middle. Dhoni turns it behind square on the leg side for a single. 12.4 overs (0 Run) Bangs a short ball, slanting around middle. Dhoni looks to hook it away but misses. 12.3 overs (0 Run) A length ball, outside off. Left alone. 12.2 overs (1 Run) Chance! A length ball, on middle. Jadeja is early as he pushes it to the left of Russell who stretches his arm out but cannot reach to the ball. A single as this one drills to long on. 12.1 overs (0 Run) Short in length and tailing outside off. Jadeja slashes at it but misses. 11.6 overs (0 Run) Qucker at 95.5 clicks, angling around middle. Dhoni does not read the spin and gets hit on the pads as he looks to defend on the back foot. 11.5 overs (1 Run) A full toss, on middle, eased down to long on for a single. 11.4 overs (1 Run) On middle. Dhoni lunges and tucks it to square leg for a single. He is off the mark. 11.3 overs (0 Run) A googly, this one comes back in sharply but was around middle. Dhoni again prods to defend but gets beaten there. 11.2 overs (0 Run) Tossed up, full and outside off. Dhoni leans and pushes it to covers. 11.1 overs (1 Run) Short ball, outside off, cut away to deep point for a sngle. 10.6 overs (0 Run) A pacy short ball, on off. Dhoni sways away from the ball. MS Dhoni walks out to bat at number 7. 10.5 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! Another one bites the dust! Short in length, on middle. Dube mistimes his pull shot completely. The ball balloons and there is an easy catch for Sunil Narine at mid-wicket. The pitch is not doing that much but there is a feeling of been not ready, seen in Chennai players. All got out with some poor shots or some lazy work in the middle. 10.4 overs (1 Run) NOT OUT! Chennai sure look nervous out there and this is not good cricket from them. Ravindra Jadeja certainly feeling the pressure of captaincy which is understandable but he needs to keep a cool head out there. Fuller delivery, on off. Jadeja punches it firmly towards mid on and set off for a risky single. The fielder over there gets the direct hit in and the umpires do go upstairs. Thankfully for him, Jadeja is just too quick. The replay shows that he slides his bat in time and will carry on. 10.3 overs (1 Run) A good length ball, on the body. Dube hangs back and dabs it down to third man for a single. 10.2 overs (1 Run) A run out chance missed! Jadeja clearly feels under pressure. A length ball, on off. Jadeja pushes off the inner half of the bat to mid-wicket and there is slight mix-up for a quick single. Sunil Narine has a shy at the bowler's end and misses. The back up catches and has another go but Narine is still thinking how he missed the first time. In that process, they get a single. 10.1 overs (1 Run) Short of a length, on off. Dube opens the face of the bat and steers it to third man for a single.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637839237527590273.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, CSK vs KKR, Live Score: Kolkata Knight Riders On Top As Chennai Super Kings Lose 3 Wickets In Quick Succession - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvaXBsLTIwMjItY3NrLXZzLWtrci1tYXRjaC1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMjg0NDc5MNIBWmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvaXBsLTIwMjItY3NrLXZzLWtrci1tYXRjaC1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMjg0NDc5MC9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, CSK vs KKR, Live Score: Kolkata Knight Riders On Top As Chennai Super Kings Lose 3 Wickets In Quick Succession  NDTV SportsMatch 01 - CSK v KKR Preview | Insights and Emotions for the Season Pilot  Chennai Super KingsCSK vs KKR Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022  Cricket AddictorT20 Time out live | Chennai vs Kolkata  ESPNcricinfoIPL 2022: Ruturaj Gaikwad says, \"same responsibility for me in IPL 2022\"  InsideSportView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-26 14:58:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chennai Super Kings vs Kolkata Knight Riders: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/chennai-super-kings-vs-kolkata-knight-riders-live-score-over-match-1-t20-6-10-updates-2845051","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Chennai Super Kings vs Kolkata Knight Riders from Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai.

On off, Jadeja taps it on the off side. At the halfway mark, Chennai are reeling at 57/4! 9.5 overs (0 Run) Nicely bowled! On a nagging length, on off. Ravindra Jadeja is pushed onto the back foot as he watchfully keeps it out. 9.4 overs (1 Run) Short and wide, cutaway behind point for just a single. The batters looked for two but Sam Billings was lightning quick. 9.3 overs (0 Run) At 91.1 kph and pushed onto middle stump. Dube leans forward to defend. 9.2 overs (1 Run) Flatter delivery, around off. Jadeja taps it towards cover-point and sets off for a quick single. 9.1 overs (2 Runs) Chakaravarthy comes 'round the wicket now and slides it onto the pads. Jadeja tucks it 'round the corner and picks up a couple of runs. 8.6 overs (0 Run) Narine slides this one into middle stump from 'round the stumps. Dube nudges it on the leg side. Another over that produces a wicket for Kolkata. 8.5 overs (1 Run) This is pushed through fuller on off stump. Jadeja drives it down to long off for a single. Time-Out! A run out, stumping and in no time Chennai are 4 down inside the 10-over mark. They look under some kind of pressure as they are not playing freely. While Kolkata would not have asked for a better start than this. They will look to control things in the next passage as well. Shivam Dube joins Jadeja in the middle. 8.4 overs (0 Run) OUT! RUN OUT! Chennai in absolute shambles out there! Sunil Narine bowls a flatter deliver, around leg. Ravindra Jadeja is pushed onto the back foot and he pushes it out towards short mid-wicket. Ambati Rayudu starts setting off for the run but is sent back fairly late by the skipper. Shreyas Iyer moves to his right, picks up the ball and throws it to Narine who makes no mistake in taking off the bails. Chennai surely didn't need this run out but they have only themselves to blame. Kolkata in command here. 8.3 overs (1 Run) On the pads, this is flicked away leg side for a single. 8.2 overs (0 Run) On a length, on off. Rayudu goes back in his crease and watchfully keeps it out. 8.1 overs (1 Run) Around off, Jadeja with another gentle push, this time down to long off for one more. 7.6 overs (1 Run) Around leg stump, Jadeja reaches out and pushes it down to long on for a single. The 50 is up for Chennai. Ravindra Jadeja is the new man in. 7.6 overs (1 Run) OUT! STUMPED! Fast hands from Sheldon Jackson behind the stumps and Robin Uthappa who was looking so good has to depart. Varun Chakaravarthy knows the batters are looking to use their feet against him and he waits for Uthappa to do just that. Chakaravarthy outsmarts the batter as he fires it down leg. Uthappa is unable to reach it and the bails are whipped off in a flash. The umpires still go upstairs just to double check and the replays show that Uthappa wasn't even close to getting back. It will be a wide but it's a big wicket for Kolkata, so they won't mind. 7.5 overs (1 Run) Around middle and leg, Rayudu looks for the big heave leg side but gets it off the inner half of the bat towards deep square leg for one. 7.4 overs (0 Run) On middle, Rayudu comes forward and blocks it out. 7.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Easily done by Ambati Rayudu! In the slot outside off. Rayudu stays inside the crease and just swings freely through the line, smoking it over the extra cover fence for a maximum. 7.2 overs (0 Run) Quicker again, at 96 clicks and on a shorter length around off. Ambati Rayudu doesn't pick it up and looks to pull off the back foot but only manages to get an inside edge back onto the pads. 7.1 overs (1 Run) Nice use of the feet from Uthappa. Chakaravarthy goes quicker and Uthappa dances down the track to work it through wide mid on for a single. 6.6 overs (0 Run) Beaten! Shorter length again from Narine and around off. This is the flicker out of the front of the hand and goes away from the right-hander. Ambati Rayudu is comprehensively beaten. 6.5 overs (1 Run) On middle, Uthappa punches it down to long on for a single. 6.4 overs (0 Run) A bit wider again and this time Uthappa can't get it past the point fielder. 6.3 overs (2 Runs) Now, was that a dropped catch? The ball certainly carried but a very difficult chance. Short and wide, cut away off the back foot uppishly to the right of the point fielder for a couple of runs. 6.2 overs (1 Run) Short again, down leg. Rayudu pulls it behind square this time for one more. 6.1 overs (1 Run) Narine drags it down first ball, around leg stump. Robin Uthappa rocks back and pulls it down to deep square leg for a single. Spin from both the ends as Sunil Narine is into the attack. 5.6 overs (0 Run) On a length, around middle and leg. Rayudu looks to tuck it away leg side but misses and gets hit on the pads. 5.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Did that flick the leg stump? Chakaravarthy brings out the variation and bowls it a tad fuller on off stump. Rayudu gets low to slog sweep but gets an inside edge past leg stump and the ball runs away to the fence. Replays show that the ball did hit the leg stump and there was a slight wobble but the bails don't come off. 5.4 overs (0 Run) Flatter delivery from Chakaravarthy, on off. Ambati Rayudu defends it off the front foot. 5.3 overs (0 Run) On middle, this is flicked away towards mid-wicket. 5.2 overs (1 Run) On a shorter length again, around middle. Uthappa goes deep in his crease and pushes it down the ground for one more. 5.1 overs (1 Run) Chakaravarthy starts off with a shorter delivery on off.

This time Uthappa finds the gap! Another length ball, around middle and leg. Uthappa pulls it to the right of short fine leg fielder for a boundary. Good over for Chennai, they get 12 runs off the over. 3.5 overs (0 Run) Length and on the pads, flicked straight to short fine leg. 3.4 overs (6 Runs) SIX!

Yadav starts with a length ball, around middle, there is a bit of inward movement. Ruturaj Gaikwad misses his tuck and gets hit on the pads. Ohh, hello! Not a good start by Yadav as he has overstepped and a Free-hit will follow. Done with the pre-match formalities and now it's time to play! Before that, the first-ever winning captain of the Indian T20 League, Shane Warne is honored following his tragic demise a few weeks earlier. The Kolkata players are on the field and it's Devon Conway, the new face in the Chennai side who's set to open the innings with Ruturaj Gaikwad. Umesh Yadav has the new ball in hand and is raring to go... We are moments away from the opening fixture to start! But first, the two sets of players line up in the middle for the beautiful National Anthem of India. Andre Russell is up for a quick chat. Dre Russ says he is pumped up and he is happy the day is here when this tournament starts. Adds that he missed out on the final last time and he will try to make up for it and is looking for a good game tonight. Mentions that Mumbai has a brilliant ground and they will look to put a smile on the fans' faces. Also adds that they have a balanced squad this year with experience and youth and they also have a confident captain in Shreyas and that is what they need. Ravindra Jadeja, the skipper of Chennai, says there are big shoes to fill but he is excited about the new role. Shares that they have done their preparation and hopes it comes good. Informs they are going with four foreign players - Devon Conway, Dwayne Bravo, Adam Milne and Mitchell Santner. Shreyas Iyer, the skipper of Kolkata, says they will have a bowl first without any hesitation. Adds that he is honored to become a part of the Kolkata franchise and there will be dew on the ground that's why they will bowl first. Informs that they have gone with three overseas players tonight, Sam Billings, Andre Russell and Sunil Narine. Also adds that he, Billings and Rahane got their caps tonight playing for the first time for the franchise. Kolkata (Playing XI) - Venkatesh Iyer, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer (C), Nitish Rana, Sam Billings, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Sheldon Jackson (WK), Umesh Yadav, Shivam Mavi, Varun Chakaravarthy. Chennai (Playing XI) - Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devon Conway, Robin Uthappa, Ambati Rayudu, Ravindra Jadeja (C), MS Dhoni (WK), Shivam Dube, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, Adam Milne, Tushar Deshpande. TOSS - We are set for the all-important toss. Up goes the coin and it lands in the favour of Kolkata. They will BOWL first! PITCH REPORT - Graeme Swann says there's a slight breeze blowing down the short boundary at one end and it is not a place for bowlers as they will have a horror day on this pitch. Haydos joins him and says that the average score in the last 10 matches is around 200 and there is an even covering of grass. Teams like to chase on this ground as the dew factor comes into the picture as well. MS Dhoni - The name itself is enough for you to give flashbacks for the fans of India or Chennai. He has done an enormous job as a captain and a few days ago we didn't have a clue that this season, the team in Yellow will be not led by the man himself. The decision was always coming but MS Dhoni doesn't make a huge event about it. He takes his social media or a press release for the news to trend on top. Just seeing the 'number 7' walking out to take the field will bring smiles to millions of fans. Even Kolkata have added some key players as well and they too will look to take the next big step after being runners-up in the previous edition. It is just the aura of this league that attracts you with big names and the brand it has been since its inception and it has never failed to surprise us with a thrilling contest. Which captain will mark his statement from the first game? We will find out soon. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates. It's the repeat of the last season's final, Chennai will lock horns with Kolkata in the first match of the Indian T20 League. MS Dhoni will be leading the team in Yellow...Oops! Sorry, we are so used to writing this line from the past decade that it came unconsciously. Ravindra Jadeja will be leading Chennai from now on and just like him, Shreyas Iyer will make his debut for Kolkata as a skipper. Chennai have bolstered their squad with the inclusion of Chris Jordan, Shivam Dube, Devon Conway and they look well balanced on paper. Hello and a warm welcome wherever you are across the globe. It is that time of the year when Indian Cricket Team fans are divided. That time of the year when you sit back on your comfy couch and enjoy some epic clash. Yes, It is showtime, we welcome you to the coverage of the opening day of the 15th season of the Indian T20 League. ...
