The 34-year old Sharma achieved the landmark during Mumbai Indians' 5th match of IPL 2022 against Punjab Kings at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, here. Rohit was just 25 runs away when he started his innings on Wednesday he raced past that mark in just 16 balls with a big six off fast bowler Kagiso Rabada. However, the stylish batter ended up getting dismissed off the very next ball and finished his innings with 28 off 17. Former India and Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli had become the first Indian to reach 10,000 T20 runs during the 2021 IPL . He was the fifth player to reach that mark and Australia captain Aaron Finch was the next player to get there before Rohit. West Indies great Chris Gayle is at the top of the run-chart in T20 cricket, with a whopping 14,562 runs in 463 games. Pakistan's Shoaib Malik (11,698), West Indies captain Kieron Pollard (11,474), Finch (10,499), Kohli (10,379) and David Warner (10,373) make up the list of players above Rohit. Notably, Rohit is also the third highest run scorer of all time in the IPL with 5719 runs in 213 innings. Shikhar Dhawan, who scored 70 on Wednesday to take his career tally to 5891 runs in 196 innings, is at the second spot. Kohli is the all time highest run scorer in the IPL with 6390 runs in 204 runs.

Earlier in the game, Punjab's Skipper and veteran went on to make their first half-centuries of the season as Punjab Kings rode on a fine start from the openers to post a challenging 198 for five. Punjab Kings have deployed 'attack is the best form of defence' philosophy during this edition of the league and there was no shift in policy as they added 97 in less than 10 overs. Bumrah's toe-crusher which yorked the dangerous Liam Livingstone helped MI to keep things under check with 99 runs coming in the last 10 overs. Agarwal, who wasn't having a great run before this game, brought his customary square off the wicket shots on the off-side and straight lofts of spinners to score 52 off 32 balls. Dhawan took his own time while playing the second fiddle but still kept up the tempo letting Agarwal go for the whole hog during their stand. But he did accelerate after that before getting out for 70 off 50 balls. It was Mumbai's domestic bowlers like Basil Thampi (2/47 in 4 overs) and Murugan Ashwin (1/34 in 4 overs), who aren't measuring up match after match but skipper is helpless due to the lack of options. Despite knowing Agarwal's propensity to make room and smash through off-side, he was fed with length balls outside the off-stump by Thampi and Tymal Mills. When they bowled short, the pace was used to good effect. In case of Ashwin, the PBKS skipper would come down the track to loft him straight but he did get his man when Agarwal went for one shot too many. Dhawan went onto his 45th half-ton but the shot that showed his authority was a disdainful slog sweep off a 137 click delivery from Thampi. Thampi did get his revenge by getting Dhawan holed in the deep before rookie Jitesh Sharma (30 no off 15 balls) smashed 23 off (1/44 in 4 overs) in the 18th over to get the momentum back which had slipped after a few dismissals. Chasing 199, Rohit Sharma raced away to 28 of 17 deliveries before Rabada sent him packing. Ishan Kishan fell soon after as Punjab looked well on top. Then came, Dewald Brevis or Baby AB as many call him. Fair to say, he did live up to his nickname and smashed Rahul Chahar for 29 runs in the 9th over. Brevis got out at 49, but he changed the entire complexion of the game. The young Indian sensation, Tilak Varma flexed some muscles and raced away to 36 of 20 deliveries before a mix up with Suryakumar Yadav cost him his wicket. This wasn't the only run out though, Pollard too was caught in a yes, no situation with Suryakumar and paid the price with his wicket. This happened when MI required 47 runs from 23 deliveries. Suryakumar Yadav kept the runs flowing with his exquisite stroke play and it all came down to 28 runs from the last 2 overs. Rabada bowled the penultimate over and got rid of the dangerous Suryakumar Yadav. After Sky's dismissal, it was just about completing the formalities as Punjab beat Mumbai Indians by a comfortable margin of 12 runs.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mini AB de Villiers Dewald Brevis father name: AB de Villiers son name and age","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-mini-ab-de-villiers-dewald-brevis-father-name-ab-de-villiers-son-name-and-age/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Mumbai Indians","Dewald Brevis","Indian Premier League","IPL","MI"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mini AB de Villiers Dewald Brevis father name: The 18-year-old Proteas batter lived up to his potential with a fine knock versus PBKS.

Punjab pick their third win of the season and move to the third spot in the points table. The bowlers took a harsh beating in patches, especially Rahul Chahar who went for 29 runs in his first over when Dewald Brevis took the attack to him. Punjab were right on top by picking two wickets inside the Powerplay but might've gotten derailed in the middle-overs. The fourth-wicket stand of Mumbai took the advantage away from Punjab. Although, Punjab regained their advantage in the death overs. Odean Smith was the highest wicket-taker with a four-fer but Arshdeep Singh and Kagiso Rabada deserve a lot of praise for their economical spells. Uff! What a fight did the Mumbai lads put up. All the players gave it their all but could not get over the victory line. Mumbai came into this game with one less batter and they might regret making that decision. Rohit Sharma got his side off to a flyer but Mumbai could not continue on its merry way, as they lost the opening pair inside the Powerplay. The two youngsters stepped up for Mumbai. Dewald Brevis and Tilak Varma stitched a solid stand of 84 runs to get the chase back on track for Mumbai. The former was the aggressor but missed out on his maiden Indian T20 League half-ton. Suryakumar Yadav was a part of two run-outs at the crease, which ended up putting all the pressure on his shoulders. In the last over, Mumbai lost three wickets, as Odean Smith showed them the exit door. Oh dear! What a game this was, filled with full of twists. The five-time champions have recorded their fifth loss on the trot. Agony for the men in blue. The pendulum swung hard in both directions but in the end, Punjab came out victorious to add on to the misery of Mumbai. 19.6 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! There it is!

It was in the last over of the powerplay when the right-handed batter hit back-to-back boundaries off Punjab pacer Arshdeep Singh.

Highest run-scorer in the ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup in West Indies earlier this year after amassing 506 runs at an average and strike rate of 84.33 and 90.19 respectively, Brevis had scored most half-centuries (3), most hundreds (2), most fours (45) and most sixes (18) to win the Man of the Series award.

Nearly a decade and a half later, Southee, a year younger and 366 international wickets ahead of Umesh, is so impressed with his Kolkata Knight Riders teammate’s bowling in IPL-15, that the New Zealander is backing him to wear the India jersey again in the shortest format, having last played a T20I more than three years ago. “I’m a fan of Umesh, he is a tremendous bowler. I was fortunate enough to share the new ball with him a few times when we both played at RCB,” Southee said in an interview to PTI. “The way he’s been managed suits Umesh’s style of bowling. If he keeps performing the way he’s been doing I can’t see why he would not do well for India in T20 cricket.” Maintaining a great line and length, the 34-year-old Umesh has been very effective for KKR this season, giving crucial breakthroughs in the powerplays. He has taken 10 wickets from five matches so far, at an economy of 6.60 while bowling the highest number of dot balls (62). https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png His scalps include those of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma inside the powerplay, while against Punjab Kings, he delivered a magical double-wicket maiden in the middle overs to skittle them out for 137. In the auction, Umesh was bought by KKR at his base price or Rs 2 crore.

(Head coach) Brendon (McCullum) and (captain) Shreyas (Iyer) have used him obviously as an attacking weapon with the new ball, maximising his strengths with the new ball and coming back in the middle overs to try and pick up wickets make the phase a bit easier. “He’s had a strong start to the tournament. To open the bowling with some of the great bowlers, and someone who you don’t usually get to deal with, that’s the beauty of this tournament. you are able to open the bowling with the very fine Indian fast bowler.” With premier Australian fast bowler Pat Cummins leading the pace attack, and Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy handling the spin department, KKR have their bases covered in the bowling department, Southee said. “It’s really exciting. You look at the experience and the pace that the three have and then we throw in the exciting talents of the young Indian bowlers who we have in our side. “On top of that you have got two of the great mystery spinners of the game so I think as a bowling attack that covers all the bases. “It’s great to be a part of such a great lineup. You got the experience of Sunil Narine, Pat and Umesh and then throw in some exciting young Indian talents, it’s great to be around.” Impressed with young pace duo Southee also praised the young pace duo of Rasikh Salam and Ashok Sharma. The 22-year-old Kashmir pacer, Rasikh made his debut for the franchise against his former team Mumbai Indians and was tidy against the explosive duo of Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan, returning with figures of 0/18 from his three overs. “Rasikh Salam who played his first game the other day is just a very skilful bowler and can swing the ball both ways. Then there’s Ashok (Sharma). “It’s always an eye-opener when you come to India and see these young Indian talented guys. They are asking some tough questions which are great to see,” Southee concluded.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Treat to watch”: R Vinay Kumar delighted as Jasprit Bumrah bowls pinpoint yorker to dismiss Liam Livingstone cheaply","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/treat-to-watch-r-vinay-kumar-delighted-as-jasprit-bumrah-bowls-pinpoint-yorker-to-dismiss-liam-livingstone-cheaply/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Mumbai Indians","Punjab Kings","Indian Premier League","Jasprit Bumrah","Liam Livingstone","MI","PBKS"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jasprit Bumrah bowls pinpoint yorker: The spearhead of Mumbai Indians was instrumental in dismissing a key batter tonight.

Ashwin batted at No. 6 for Rajasthan Royals against Lucknow Super Giants on Sunday but left the field after two balls in the 19th over to make way for Riyan Parag. He had scored 28 off 23 before retiring himself out. “T20, as a sport, is heading towards where football has reached. Just like how they”re using substitutions, I did something similar (retiring out). Already we”re late, but I believe this will happen a lot in the coming days. “I don”t think it will be a stigma like running someone out at the non-striker”s end,” said Ashwin on his Youtube channel. However, he thinks the move might not work always. “It might work sometimes and it might not work sometimes. These things happen constantly in football, and we haven”t cracked T20 cricket fully yet. This is a millennial sport. This is the next generation”s sport. “In fact, if you see in football, Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo score goals frequently. But their team”s goalkeeper should also save goals and their defenders should defend well. Only then, a Messi or Ronaldo will be in the limelight.” Since he was not able to get the desired boundaries in the slog overs, Ashwin thought it was best to make way for Parag. “It was just a tactical move. In fact, Riyan Parag has been batting very well and when the (K) Gowtham over (16th over) ended, I gave myself some time – five to six balls – to see whether I can hit a six or two fours. “There were a few balls in the slot, I tried to hit, and mistimed a bit. I threw the kitchen sink at everything, but I couldn”t get the timing going. Someone like Riyan Parag was in the shed and there were only ten balls remaining. If he comes and hits even two sixes, we could get a good score. It was a tactical decision.” Ashwin was also the first in the IPL to effect a run out of a non-striker backing up when he controversially dislodged the bails to dismiss Jos Buttler in 2019.   Now you can get handpicked stories from Telangana Today on Telegram everyday.

I have huge respect for what he has achieved.’ New Australia coach Andrew McDonald is keen for an Ashes reunion with Justin Langer McDonald, 40, was the overwhelming favourite for the Australia job after acting as Langer’s assistant since 2019 and leading them to a famous 1-0 Test series victory in Pakistan as interim last month.

Strauss’s immediate priority is to find someone to replace him as England’s full-time managing director and he is believed to have been disappointed by the lack of suitable applicants willing to succeed him and Ashley Giles in running England cricket. Langer was forced out by Australia players in the end because of his disciplinary methods Rob Key, as Sportsmail revealed last month, is a credible candidate who responded positively to Strauss’s invitation to apply for the job and is believed to have interviewed well on his return from broadcasting duties in Pakistan last week. But Durham director of cricket Marcus North now appears out of the running and Strauss’s options are limited, with those who would be perfect for the job in Nasser Hussain and Mike Atherton too well ensconced in the media to be tempted and former England coach Andy Flower preferring to concentrate, for now, on franchise cricket. Once Strauss has his man, probably towards the end of this month, that person will then turn their attentions to finding either a new head coach for both white and red ball cricket or an overall supremo with assistants responsible for the respective formats.

Nearly a decade and a half later, Southee, a year younger and 366 international wickets ahead of Umesh, is so impressed with his Kolkata Knight Riders teammate's bowling in IPL-15, that the New Zealander is backing him to wear the India jersey again in the shortest format, having last played a T20I more than three years ago. \"I'm a fan of Umesh, he is a tremendous bowler. I was fortunate enough to share the new ball with him a few times when we both played at RCB,\" Southee said in an interview to PTI. \"The way he's been managed suits Umesh's style of bowling. If he keeps performing the way he's been doing I can't see why he would not do well for India in T20 cricket.\" Maintaining a great line and length, the 34-year-old Umesh has been very effective for KKR this season, giving crucial breakthroughs in the powerplays. He has taken 10 wickets from five matches so far, at an economy of 6.60 while bowling the highest number of dot balls (62). His scalps include those of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma inside the powerplay, while against Punjab Kings, he delivered a magical double-wicket maiden in the middle overs to skittle them out for 137. In the auction, Umesh was bought by KKR at his base price or Rs 2 crore. Credit goes to KKR think tank Giving credit to the team's think tank for bringing the best out of Umesh, the 33-year-old Kiwi said the side has benefitted from it. \"The way the KKR has used him has been outstanding. (Head coach) Brendon (McCullum) and (captain) Shreyas (Iyer) have used him obviously as an attacking weapon with the new ball, maximising his strengths with the new ball and coming back in the middle overs to try and pick up wickets make the phase a bit easier. \"He's had a strong start to the tournament. To open the bowling with some of the great bowlers, and someone who you don't usually get to deal with, that's the beauty of this tournament. you are able to open the bowling with the very fine Indian fast bowler.\" With premier Australian fast bowler Pat Cummins leading the pace attack, and Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy handling the spin department, KKR have their bases covered in the bowling department, Southee said. \"It's really exciting. You look at the experience and the pace that the three have and then we throw in the exciting talents of the young Indian bowlers who we have in our side. \"On top of that you have got two of the great mystery spinners of the game so I think as a bowling attack that covers all the bases. \"It's great to be a part of such a great lineup. You got the experience of Sunil Narine, Pat and Umesh and then throw in some exciting young Indian talents, it's great to be around.\" Impressed with young pace duo Southee also praised the young pace duo of Rasikh Salam and Ashok Sharma. The 22-year-old Kashmir pacer, Rasikh made his debut for the franchise against his former team Mumbai Indians and was tidy against the explosive duo of Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan , returning with figures of 0/18 from his three overs. \"Rasikh Salam who played his first game the other day is just a very skilful bowler and can swing the ball both ways.

In spite of losing their first four matches, Indians have made a solitary change to their Playing XI by bringing in fast bowler Tymal Mills for all-rounder Ramandeep Singh. Highest wicket-taker for Indians this season, Mills’ six wickets have come at an average of 16.50, an economy rate of 9.90 and a strike rate of 10. MI, who had the option of handing a debut to either of fast bowler Riley Meredith or all-rounder Fabian Allen, have opted to bring back Mills into the Playing XI. It is worth mentioning that Sharma wasn’t asked about the rationale behind making this change. England fast bowler Jofra Archer, who was bought by Mumbai for INR 8 crore in the mega auction earlier this year, isn’t playing this season because of an elbow injury. Archer, who has frequently missed international cricket for almost two years now due to a trouble in his right elbow, had to undergo a surgery in May last year. Having injured his elbow yet again in a Sussex vs Kent County Championship 2021 match, a surgery was the need of the hour for Archer.

Back of a length, outside off. Mayank Agarwal stays back and cuts it hard, past the diving fielder at point for a boundary. Punjab are up and running! There are a few interesting match-ups to watch out for. Get your snacks ready, as this game will be no less than a thriller. It is time for the action to begin, folks! The match officials make their way out to the middle. The players of Mumbai are in a huddle before they spread out on the field. Mayank Agarwal and Shikhar Dhawan walk out to open the batting for Punjab. Basil Thampi will start with the ball. Liam Livingstone is in for a quick chat. He says that he has been enjoying playing for Punjab so far and they have been playing well as a team. Adds that the squad that they have, can go out and smash sixes but they need to be a bit smarter. Tells that the coaches have been backing them and it has been a very good experience. Mayank Agarwal, the Punjab captain is in for a chat. He says, they are actually not thinking much about the toss, not that he has won many tosses. Mentions they are sticking with the same 11. Says, Jonty Rhodes is a bundle of joy, and it is really nice to have him around in the camp. Rohit Sharma, the skipper of Mumbai, says that they will bowl first. Adds that the pitch looks good and there will be some assistance for the pacers early on. Informs that they have one change, Mills comes in for Ramandeep. Mentions that they are in a tough situation and they will need to keep pushing hard. Punjab (Unchanged playing XI) - Mayank Agarwal (C), Shikhar Dhawan, Liam Livingstone, Jonny Bairstow, Odean Smith, Shahrukh Khan, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Arshdeep Singh, Vaibhav Arora, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar.

TOSS - Mumbai have won the toss and they have opted to BOWL first. PITCH REPORT - Deep Dasgupta is near the pitch. He says that it is a used pitch and this is the same wicket where over 200 runs were scored in the first innings of the first game. Tells that there is some grass covering and toss might not be a huge factor. Mentions that the bowlers will have pace and bounce on offer. Rohit Sharma and his men will have a lot to prove in this fixture, as the 5-time champions have lost four games on the trot this season. They haven't been quite upto the mark and have failed to win those crucial moments in the game. Punjab on the other hand, have fared reasonably well so far and have won their alternate games. In spite of losing their previous game, they will be confident heading into this game, as they dominated that match for a majority of the part. Their skipper, Mayank Agarwal would be keen to make amends against Mumbai and hand them yet another defeat. Will Mumbai be able to fight against all odds and register their first win of the tournament? We shall find that soon. Stay tuned for toss and further updates. Hello and a very warm welcome to the coverage of game number 23 between Mumbai and Punjab. We have witnessed some enthralling games so far in this competition, and this clash promises to be nothing short of a cracker, as Mumbai will be itching to get their first win of the tournament, while Punjab would be keen to get back to winning ways after losing a last-ball thriller against Gujarat. ...

Photo:@PunjabKingsIPL Mumbai Indians, who haven’t won a single game out of the four that they have played so far in the IPL, would look to seek inspiration from Chennai Super Kings who turned the tide around and won against Royal Challengers Bangalore quite comfortably. However, Punjab Kings, the team that the Mumbai Indians will face at the Mahrasthra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune on Wednesday, April 13th, 2022 will be looking to get back to winning ways themselves after a heartbreaking loss in which Rahul Tewatia hit back to back sixes to rob them off a certain victory. ALSO READ: MI vs PBKS: Pitch Report, Weather and Dew Update of MCA Stadium, Pune IPL 2022 Mumbai Indians vs Punjab Kings Toss Timing and Result Mumbai Indians vs Punjab Kings today's IPL 2022 match will begin at 07:30 pm IST and 1400 hrs GMT. Thus the toss between Mumbai skipper Rohit Sharma and Punjab captain Mayank Agarwal would take place 30 minutes before the match start time. Hence, the CSK vs RCB toss in today’s match would take place at 07:00 pm IST and 1330 hrs GMT. ALSO READ: MI vs PBKS: Predicted Playing 11 and Toss timing of IPL 2022 Match 23 MI vs PBKS: Expected Changes in the Playing 11 Mumbai Indians need to work on their tactics and bring in Tymal Mills and Fabian Allen in place of Basil Thampi and Ramandeep Singh straightway. With Allen and Ashwin, there would be eight overs of a different kind of spin and then in the middle, either Rohit Sharma himself or Dewald Brevis could roll their arm over. If not Dewald, Tim David could be played and he does more than a decent job with his off-spin, just to provide all varieties in the spin department. Punjab would also look to bring back Bhanuka Rajapaksa given how badly Odean Smith has performed both with the bat and with the ball ever since Punjab’s first outing in which he played an important role with the bat. In his place, Bhanuka Rajapaksa could be played with the extra responsibility of bowling at least two overs each given to Liam Livingstone and Sharukh Khan both. MI Predicted Playing 11 Rohit Sharma(c), Ishan Kishan(w), Dewald Brevis/Tim David, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Kieron Pollard, Fabian Allen, Jaydev Unadkat, Murugan Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Tymal Mills PBKS Predicted Playing 11 Mayank Agarwal(c), Shikhar Dhawan, Bhanuka Rajapaksa/Odean Smith, Jonny Bairstow(w), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma, Shahrukh Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Vaibhav Arora, Arshdeep Singh, MI vs PBKS Pitch Report In matches, leading up to this one, it has been seen that the pitch at the MCA Stadium in Pune is helpful for the bowlers if they bowl the required line and length and at the same time, batters can also utilise the wicket to the best of their abilities to try and score as many runs as possible. MI vs PBKS MCA Stadium, Pune Weather Report For today’s match between Mumbai and Punjab, the humidity during the match hours of 07:00 pm to 11:00 pm IST would remain between 21-32%. The temperature will hover between 29 and 27 Degrees Celcius between 07 to 11 pm. Chances of dew are very low as the humidity is very less in Pune compared to Mumbai. So losing the toss and batting first won’t be abad option either.
