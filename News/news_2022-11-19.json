The Indian cricket team was eliminated in the semi-finals of the recently concluded T20 World Cup series against the England team. This has led to criticism of the Indian team. Meanwhile, the BCCI has dissolved the selection committee to select the Indian team. The selection panel, headed by former Indian cricketer Chetan Sharma, included Sunil Joshi (South Zone), Harvinder Singh (Central Zone) and Debashish Mohanty (East Zone). BCCI has disbanded this group along with the cage. BCCI also announced that fresh applications will be accepted for the selection committee and the deadline for submission of applications is November 28 at 6 pm. BCCI secretary Jai Shah had mentioned that the new selection committee would be formed during the general body meeting in Mumbai last month. Accordingly, the Selection Committee has now been dissolved. However, the selection committee headed by Chetan Sharma will finally pick the squad for the upcoming Bangladesh tour. After that the selection committee will be completely dissolved and a new committee will be formed. The new selection committee will take over in December. Those who want to be included in the new selection panel have been stipulated to have played at least seven Test matches, 30 first-class matches or 10 ODIs and 20 first-class matches.","pubDate":"2022-11-18 22:21:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Who is Victorian bolter rocketing into Test contention?","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/four-spinners-set-to-battle-to-team-up-with-nathan-lyon-on-australias-tour-of-india/news-story/4d1ad73ebd9d1fc13e96cf242c06b3e0","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Secret discussions are underway over the possibility of Adam Zampa becoming a shock candidate for Australia’s bumper Test tour of India.","content":"Zampa has not bowled with a red ball since November 2019, but sources say the World Cup-winning leg-spinner is expected to play in NSW’s Sheffield Shield match against Victoria on December 1 in Melbourne.While taking Zampa to India as a bolter for the four-Test series starting in February is a long way from a formality – with one Shield game in three years hardly an ideal sample size – the white ball king’s name has been discussed by selectors who like his accuracy and big match gravitas. It puts enormous pressure on incumbent leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson, who had some promising moments in his four Tests in Pakistan and Sri Lanka this year, but didn’t quite slam dunk his opportunity, leaving the door ajar for a potential challenge from Zampa.Despite the potential battle of the leggies, the reality is Ashton Agar is perhaps the favourite to partner Nathan Lyon against India given all reports out of Sri Lanka earlier this year were the left-arm orthodox star would have played ahead of Swepson if not for injury.Selectors swear by statistics from all touring Test nations which suggest left-armers perform better in sub-continental conditions than leggies.However, forgetting India for a moment, News Corp understands if injury was to befell Lyon at any point during this summer, it’s 22-year-old Victorian off-spinner Todd Murphy who is standing out as the next cab off the rank to play a Test for Australia.Murphy has played just five first-class matches, but impressed selectors playing for Australia A in Sri Lanka and will take on the West Indies alongside Agar next week in the Prime Minister’s XI game in Canberra.Lyon hasn’t publicly anointed the bespectacled Murphy as his heir apparent, but behind the scenes the GOAT has given the young right-arm off-spinner from Echuca the thumbs up to selectors as the real deal.The difficulty for Murphy when it comes to selection for a Test debut in India will be whether it’s possible to pick him alongside Lyon as a second off-spinner in the same attack – with the temptation to go for the variation of a left-armer or a leggie.Who should be Australia’s second spinner on the tour of India? TODD MURPHYThe blossoming relationship between Lyon and Murphy could help guarantee a smooth transition for Australia when the time ultimately comes for The GOAT to hang up his boots (there is no sign of this happening any time soon but Lyon is 35 next week).Murphy was in Adelaide with the Victorian side during last summer’s Covid season when every team was in a bubble in South Australia.Victorian teammate Nic Maddinson asked Murphy if he’d like Lyon to pop into training and watch him bowl, and the youngster jumped at the opportunity, despite the unusual circumstances of a player from a rival team arriving at the nets.Lyon has been a fan ever since and his mentorship of Murphy – from off-spinner to off-spinner – could be vital.Experts say Murphy is still a work in progress with just a handful of first-class matches under his belt, but good judges believe he is the pick of Australia’s spinners not in the Test team and has a huge future.Players like his personable and humble nature.ADAM ZAMPAAs Glenn Maxwell has discovered, when you’re a fully-fledged international white ball star it’s almost impossible to play any consistent Sheffield Shield cricket.Zampa has been one of the first chosen in Australia’s white ball teams for some time now, and as a result has not played a single Shield game for NSW since he made the switch from South Australia. That is set to change for NSW’s final Shield game before the Big Bash break against Victoria at Junction Oval in Melbourne starting on December 1.Lyon will be on Test duty and young leggie Tanveer Sangha is injured, leaving Zampa as the only recognised spinner on NSW’s books.The timing is good because Zampa’s name has been mentioned quietly around the traps as a genuine consideration for the Test tour of India.Most appealing is Zampa’s ability to land five out of six balls in as shoebox.He is supremely accurate and on Indian pitches where it could go through the top from the first session, Zampa’s fast leg-spin could create problems for Indian batsmen on raging turners.Zampa might not be technically the best spinning option, and his first-class average of 48.26 is not flattering.But he is pragmatic and is a bowler who has proven more than any other spinner in Australia outside of Lyon that he can find a way under pressure.MITCHELL SWEPSONThere is a watch on Swepson and question marks over whether he has the penetration necessary to be a frontline weapon in India.This is a season of reckoning for the Queenslander. The Indian tour is the ultimate and in many ways Swepson deserves the chance to tour given the long apprenticeship he has done over the years and his solid performances in Asia this year.But Swepson’s accuracy wasn’t necessarily what Australia had hoped and the pressure is on.Like Zampa though, Swepson bowls fast leg-spin which could be difficult to handle on a raging turner.ASHTON AGARIncredibly, Agar has still only played four Test matches for Australia and his most recent was way back in 2017.That said, the versatile left-armer is likely to play a key role in India next year.Agar would have almost certainly played the two Tests in Sri Lanka earlier this year if not for a side strain and the fact he will play in next week’s Prime Minister’s XI four-day game against the West Indies in Canberra is an indication of his place in Australia’s plans.It’s a shame Australia has its third ODI against England next week, because what would be most ideal for selectors would be for Agar and Zampa to lock horns in the WA v NSW Shield match at the SCG.","pubDate":"2022-11-18 21:33:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Revealed: Dirty betting secret behind our most iconic award","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/why-the-people-least-surprised-by-the-brownlow-medal-betting-scandal-were-the-bookies/news-story/47d194a51eb171513e5d7f0b663d0f6c","keywords":["Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The people least surprised by the Brownlow Medal betting scandal were the bookies, particularly those who used to get routinely fleeced on the iconic Australian of the Year Award.","content":"“It seemed to happen every year,’’ one long-serving sports bookmaker said.“You would put up the betting on the Australian of the Year which was announced on January 26 and the week before it you just got smashed.“It’s not a horse race. You can’t do form on it and pick out the reasons why someone would win. To bet with confidence you had to know the result.“We did a little investigation and found out the winner was picked in early December. That’s a long time to keep a secret, particularly when there are official ceremonies involved.“Just like the Brownlow scandal the problem was the result had been decided so people obviously knew what they were betting on.’’Here lies the reason why it’s hard to feel sympathy for any bookmaker who lost money on the Brownlow scam where umpire Michael Pell allegedly leaked the votes on individual games.If you are silly enough to bet on something where the result has been decided - and at least three people know what it was - you really are boxing with an exposed chin.Not that it will stop bookies betting on evictions from reality series which were pre-recorded. It’s a dangerous practice but some don’t care.“Some bookies consider it a loss leader,’’ another bookmaker said. “You might burn some money but these things get a lot of publicity so it balances out.“The thing is now there are more than 100 bookmakers in Australia all chasing similar clients. They look for an edge. They take risks with novel bets. Some sail very close to the wind.’’The one thing to come out of the Brownlow Medal scandal is that betting on votes for individual matches, as opposed to the overall winner, should not be allowed.Sport has learned from painful experience that it’s often the micro issues that attract the big bets.When corrupt Indian bookies spread their tentacles into cricket in the 1990s they initially tried to make teams like South Africa throw entire games.Then they realised that was far too conspicuous so they turned their attention to spot fixing - getting bowlers to bowl no-balls of batsmen dismissed under a certain score.Sport has reacted to these dirty little sins by quietly plugging the leaks.In sports betting in Australia you can back a batsman to score above a total but not beneath it so he cannot be induced to fail.When Canterbury forward Ryan Tandy gave away a penalty to try and land an orchestrated plunge on the first score of a match being a penalty goal, the rules of sports betting on rugby league were changed to ban betting on the first score type.In the tennis world it was an open secret some players were losing games claiming they were physically injured and duly withdrawing mid-contest after their opponents had been the subject of major betting support.The rules were changed to demand that the match must be completed without an injury default for bets to stand.People saying that umpires should no longer do the Brownlow voting have missed the point. Someone has to vote on it. It might as well be them. Any panel is subject to leaks.The system seems to work generally well but it doesn’t change the fact that if you bet on an event where the outcome is decided, human nature will occasionally corrupt the system.","pubDate":"2022-11-18 21:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jon Lewis beats namesake Jon Lewis as he’s appointed England women head coach","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/cricket/cricket-england-women-new-coach-28530386","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Liam Llewellyn)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The England women's cricket team - four-time ODI world champions - now have a new coach in the form of Jon Lewis who beat another coach with the same name to the post","content":"Jon Lewis has beaten his namesake to become the new head coach of the England Women’s cricket team . The 47-year-old former Gloucestershire and England seamer has won the battle against the 52-year-old ex- Durham captain and coach, also named Jon Lewis, to coach the four-time ODI world champions. He replaced Lisa Keightley, who stepped down at the end of the summer after opting against seeking an extension to her contract. Before taking on this new role, Lewis was the pace bowling coach for the England men’s team, a position he adopted in 2021 and worked with Chris Silverwood and most recently Brendon McCullum. Following the announcement of his new job, Lewis, who played 16 times for England across all three formats, is relishing the new challenge. “It's very exciting to have been appointed as head coach of the England Women's team,\" he said. \"It's a new challenge, and one that I can't wait to get stuck into. I've watched from a distance over the last few years and it's clear that there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about this team's chances going forward. England star Tammy Beaumont says comparing women's cricket to men's \"can kill the game\" England star Alex Hales reprimanded by ECB over blackface photo from party \"The last couple of years have seen the introduction of some younger players and that, allied with the increased strength in depth coming from the regional game, is a really promising sign for the coming few years. Our immediate focus is the West Indies, and particularly getting some points on the board in the ICC Women's Championship, and then we'll look ahead to South Africa and the ICC Women's T20 World Cup.\" Lewis will take charge for the women's tour of the West Indies, which begins on December 4 and will hope the three one-day internationals and five T20Is will provide adequate preparation en route to next year’s T20 World Cup. England’s fortunes have been rather mixed as of late. They reached the final of this year’s 2022 ODI world cup, before missing out on a medal at the Commonwealth Games this summer. During the end-of-summer series with India, England won the T20 series, but produced a poor showing when they lost the ODI games 3-0, where the final match was overshadowed by a Mankad controversy. With seven of the team’s 17 centrally contracted players aged 29 or older, along with eight 24 and younger, Lewis inherits an England squad in transition. Former Durham captain Jon Lewis lost out on the coaching job to his namesake (Mark Runnacles/Getty Images) Jonathan Finch, the ECB's director of England women's cricket, is keen to embark on a partnership with the team’s new coach in this new phase for the cricket team. \"We're really pleased to be able to appoint Jon as the new head coach of England Women following a thorough and competitive recruitment process,” he said. “We set out to find a head coach with a range of experiences to help lead an exciting group of players across all formats and I am excited with what the future holds with Jon in the role. \"Jon comes with excellent pedigree in the men's game working across different levels of the international pathway, and we were really impressed by how he sees the role moving forward.

Some of them were appointed in 2020 and some in 2021. FirstCricket Staff November 19th, 2022 1:25:13 IST Team India selector Chetan Sharma. Image: ANI The BCCI on Friday sacked the entire four-member senior national selection committee led by Chetan Sharma after the Indian cricket team failed to reach the final of the T20 World Cup in Australia. On Friday, the BCCI invited applications for the position of national selectors (Senior Men). The last date of application is November 28. That Chetan will be sacked was first reported by PTI on October 18 after the BCCI AGM but it is learnt that his committee has not even been told about the sacking. The new chairman’s job mandate has an interesting description of “selecting captain in each format” which suggests that BCCI might be moving towards split captaincy in near future. Chetan (North zone), Harvinder Singh (Centra Zone), Sunil Joshi (South Zone) and Debasish Mohanty (East Zone) have had the shortest stint as senior national selectors in recent times. Joshi and Harvinder were appointed national selectors in February 2020. After the AGM in January 2021, Chetan took over as chairman of selectors with Mohanty and Kuruvilla joining him. A senior national selector normally gets a four-year term subject to extension. There was no selector from West Zone after Abbey Kuruvilla’s tenure ended. Once, India lost in the semifinal of the T20 World Cup, the writing was always on the wall that Chetan was on borrowed time. During Chetan’s tenure, India had also failed to reach knock-out stage in the 2021 edition of T20 World Cup and lost the World Test Championships final. “For Chetan to save his job, India needed to win the T20 World Cup. Nothing less could have saved him. But once, he was asked to select four squads at one go (New Zealand and Bangladesh away series) which was unprecedented, one could read between the lines,” a BCCI insider, who has been tracking the developments, told PTI on conditions of anonymity. There are multiple reasons that the BCCI mandarins were unhappy with Chetan and his committee’s shoddy performance. It is believed that Chetan was never assertive when it came to certain decisions. Some of the reasons believed to have led to his sacking are: not being able to have a settled squad, allowing eight international captains in just one year with some select seniors turning workload management into a joke, picking KL Rahul after a eight month hiatus from T20 cricket, going on almost each and every India tour but not being able to create a decisive set of players in co-ordination with team management. No tangible plan as to whether a 37-year-old senior like Shikhar Dhawan would be carried to 2023 World Cup when he would be above 38 is among the issues that has never been addressed. Chetan and his team could never reward the domestic or IPL performers and pick specialists across two T20 World Cups. Theirs is a committee under whom India have lost two T20 World Cup games by 10 wickets, something that has never happened earlier. That Chetan’s days were numbered was understood when he cut a lonely figure during the T20 World Cup in Australia. He never travelled with the team and would stand at a fair distance from head coach Rahul Dravid at the end of bowlers’ run-up at the nets. The media in Australia never witnessed any major conversation between the duo.

Hardik, who is leading the side in place of regular skipper Rohit Sharma in the three-match T20 series, said the Indian team doesn’t believe in dwelling on the past. “These guys are young by age, but not by experience. They have played plenty of IPL and got good amount of Internationals as well. I think the youngsters of today don’t get intimidated by not having played too much cricket. “If the situation demands, me and the more experienced players will play different roles, but this tour is for the new guys to get more clarity, opportunities and a chance to express themselves,” Hardik said after the first T20I was washed out here without a ball being bowled. “The World Cup is done, I’ve left it behind. The disappointment will be there, but we can’t go back and change things. We’re now looking forward to this series,” he added. The three-match T20 series will be followed as many ODIs. New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson said the ongoing series is a good platform to test players like Adam Milne, who didn’t get a shot in the T20 World Cup where both the Kiwis and India exited in the semifinal stage. While India lost to eventual champions England in the semifinals, New Zealand were shown the door by Pakistan. “It is about getting better, especially in the knockout matches. The likes of Adam Milne were in the T20 World Cup squad but didn’t get an opportunity, so this is a good time to get them some game time,” he said. “We’ll start fresh, this is a new series both sides are looking forward to. We both wanted to get to the final, but we’ve got a week to rest and get ourselves ready for this.” Asked about the second-string Indian squad here, Williamson said: “I’ve got no doubt they all will be big players for India, I’ve seen them all in the IPL. They’ve got great quality irrespective of the names they put out.” Williamson said the upcoming three-match ODI series against India will be great opportunity for young Kiwi players to impress upon the selectors and stake a claim in next year’s 50-over World Cup. “Most teams gear up towards major events that are not too far away, and the ODI format will now be a great opportunity for guys to come in. “I’m sure there will be plenty of opportunities for guys to shine. We’ll have to wait and see what surfaces present us, and we need to adjust,” he signed off. —PTI NZ tour is about role clarity and opportunities for new guys: Hardik added by Press Trust of India on 12:38 am November 19, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-11-18 19:08:14","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SA T20 league will help national team achieve required depth, feels Jacques Kallis","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/11/19/sa-t20-league-will-help-national-team-achieve-required-depth-feels-jacques-kallis/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"JOHANNESBURG: The legendary Jacques Kallis feels South Africa’s T20 side, in future, will have greater depth as upcoming talent will get a great platform to express themselves in the upcoming SA T20 league, where all teams are owned by IPL franchise owners.

Kallis will be an assistant coach to Graham Ford at the Pretoria Capitals, a team owned by Delhi Capitals co-owner JSW group. “I think South African cricket has been crying out for this for a long time. I think we’ve seen the wonderful job it’s (franchise league cricket) done around the world in terms of how the local competition has improved cricket,” Kallis said at the launch of SA T20 league. “I have no doubt it’s going to be the same here and everyone is looking forward to it. The standard will be very high,” Kallis said. For Kallis, a veteran of 166 Tests, 328 ODIs and 25 T20Is, the exposure for young local talent will be mind boggling. “Having international players and coaches is also certainly going to provide a good product. It is going to improve the young guys coming through.” “With everything being televised, it’s a great opportunity for the guys to put their name out there, whether it be for international cricket, or other leagues around the world. What better stage for these young guys to put their hand up in this competition?” Kallis added. The league will start with Reliance-owned MI Cape Town and neighbours Paarl Royals (a Rajasthan Royals unit) taking on each other at Newlands on January 10. The opening game will be followed by Durban’s Super Giants (Lucknow IPL owners) hosting the Joburg Super Kings (CSK’s sister franchise) at Kingsmead on January 11 before Kallis’ Capitals travel to Gqeberha on January 12, to face the Sunrisers Eastern Cape at St George’s Park. “The good thing about all these games is that they are like derbies.

As the first T20I of the series was canceled due to rain today, India captain Pandya said, “All the Indian players are very excited to play in this series. New Zealand is the perfect place to play cricket. But unfortunately couldn’t play today. The players in our team may be younger. But not in experience. All of them have experience of playing a lot of IPL cricket series. Some have also played in international competitions. I definitely think this series will be a good opportunity for newbies.

Wicket-keeper batter Dinesh Karthik who was also a part of the squad for the tournament has said that captain Rohit Sharma and coach Rahul Dravid had made it clear to Chahal and Harshal Patel at the start of the competition that they would be a part of the playing XI only if the conditions were in favour.“They didn’t sulk once or get upset once because they were very sure. At the start of the tournament they were said that under these conditions we would be playing you otherwise it might be hard. So they were very aware and were preparing in such a way that when get an opportunity they will try and do their best but there might be a chance that they end up not playing. So when that clarity is there from the coach and captain it makes the job easier for the player because you just start looking inward and think okay what do I do to start preparing better. That is what they were doing and had they been given a chance they would have given their best. This is a very high intensity tournament. As mentioned, he played a lot of matches for India and he knows the feeling of being dropped,” Karthik said during his conversation with Cricbuzz.Talking about India’s campaign, the Men in Blue made it to the last four but bowed out of the tournament after losing to England in the semis.Chasing 169, England thumped India by 10 wickets to make it to the final and then defeated Pakistan in the title clash to lift their second T20 World Cup trophy.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The Asian side had managed to put in a mere 137/8 in 20 overs but the bowling unit kept them in the hunt as they picked regular wickets.But the situation went out of control at the end of the 16th over. Left-arm pacer Shaheen Afridi had earlier hurt his knee while taking a catch and was taken out of the field. But the fast bowler came back on the field, only to return back to the dugout.Captain Babar Azam had initially handed the ball to Shaheen for the 16th over but he could only manage to bowl one delivery before he limped off the field. Babar then gave the ball to spinner Iftikhar Ahmed who ended up leaking 13 runs in five balls that certainly turned the course of the match.Former Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar criticised Shaheen and went on to say that he should have taken painkillers and continued bowling.“When your main bowler becomes unfit, then it creates problems for you. Shaheen (Afridi) was never fully fit, but we cannot put the entire blame on him as he bowled well in the past 2-3 matches. But this is the World Cup final. Even if the leg breaks. Whatever happens, happens. Just keep running and do something. But this was not in our fortune,” he told Zee News.“When you numb your feet, the pain is not felt. Yes, you are risking the career of the young man. It is a World Cup final, and whether you can risk or not that you have to think as a captain. It is a tough decision,” he added.Meanwhile, former Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi reacted to Akhtar’s comments and said that painkillers have a lot of side effects.“Nehin, nehin, nehin…main nehin samajhta ki yeh jayas baat hai. Painkillers sirf akhti taur pe hota hai. Humne bhi bohot dafa kiya hai. But uske bhi side effects bohot saare hote hai. Kyunki uss time toh sunn ho jati hai and pain khatam ho jati hai, but pain aur zyada bar jaati hai next day (No, no…not at all, it’s wrong. Painkillers should be taken in a disciplined manner. I too used to take it. But it has a lot of side effects. It does numb the pain for a while, but after the match day, it tends to pain even more),” Shahid Afridi said on Samaa TV.England eventually chased down the target by five wickets to lift their second T20 title.Shaheen Afridi is set to miss significant red-ball action as he will be unavailable for the home Test series against England and New Zealand.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

And for many observers of the game, the limited-overs tour of New Zealand could very well be a chance for Pandya to strengthen his credentials as the Rohit’s successor, given the latter is in the twilight of his career.And among those backing Pandya for long-term captaincy is former India head coach Ravi Shastri, who likened him to 1983 World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev not just for his all-round ability but also for his leadership skills.“He has got that flamboyance and that exuberance. So that will reflect on the players in the team. I remember when Kapil Dev was captain. When you have an impact player and when you have all-rounder, when you have a player who is on the thick of action right through those 20 overs it makes a massive difference.“It lifts the spirit of others and inspire others to emulate him. So I’m really looking forward to the way Hardik leads,” Shastri told the broadcasters ahead of the first T20I between New Zealand and India in Wellington, which got washed out due to rain.Pandya had earlier joined the Gujarat Titans as their captain after seven seasons with the Mumbai Indians, and led the franchise to title victory in their debut season, beating Rajasthan Royals in the final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad earlier this year.Pandya would later lead the Men in Blue during their tour of Ireland, where they played two T20Is and won both.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The Babar Azam-led side was eventually defeated by England in the final match. Many members of the cricketing community believe that captain Babar Azam should step down. Furthermore, Pakistan great Shahid Afridi believes that Babar should give up responsibilities in the T20 format and instead focus on batting and leading the side in ODIs and Tests. Babar scored 134 runs in the T20 World Cup this year, including one fifty, and crossed double digits twice in six games. Shahid Afridi has urged that Babar should step down as T20 skipper to focus on his batting. \"Babar was already dissatisfied with the management of Karachi Kings.

Throughout the tournament, the skipper was heavily criticised for his poor performances. Babar has not responded to the cricketing community's ideas, and it remains to be seen what happens.

Plus, you get these India A tours, you get a lot of these other tours, where at one given time you might have two Indian teams playing in the future, where the opportunity will come for the other lot to go somewhere else whilst India is in another country – to go play and see what you know they can do,” Shastri told reporters on Thursday.The commentator also emphasized that they need to play domestic cricket as well. “So there’s no need (to play in overseas leagues), they’re absolutely fine playing IPL cricket and focusing on domestic cricket. We need them to play domestic cricket in India as well,” he added.Interestingly, Anil Kumble had earlier said that Indian players should be allowed to play in foreign leagues as such exposure would help them.Zaheer Khan had similar views and said that the important aspect is for players to have overseas experience and learn things from that environment. He explained that the BCCI makes that sure through shadow tours.“I feel there are a lot of processes in place. It’s not about playing only franchise cricket, it’s about going to different countries to learn things. That is something which is important, and you’ve seen with BCCI, with their shadow tours, I think those processes are well in place,” the speedster said.Zaheer also echoed Shastri stating that India can field multiple line-ups to compete at the international level.“I don’t see any other reason right now for players to go and play in a particular tournament. What you have domestically right now is also a robust structure. So why depend on others? We have more than enough means for producing good players. And you look at our bench strength as well, you can virtually play three line-ups, and they will be able to compete at any level.”Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The last ODI here was a high-scoring Australia-India match played almost a couple of years ago.

England, on the other hand, have won 16 and lost 16 out of their 33 Sydney T20Is. As far as Australia-England Sydney ODIs are concerned, both the teams have won 11 matches out of their 23 encounters here over the years.

I’ve been watching them and been in envy of what the club has been able to achieve for a long time,” Selwood said.“When the opportunity come up, I saw it as a great chance to get involved in something a bit different in an environment that is so well run.“I was impressed with the presentation Frank and Craig made and have already been welcomed at the club when I visited AAMI Park earlier this week. I can’t wait to meet the rest of the playing group and getting into the season.”Storm football manager Frank Ponissi was pleased to get the deal across the line.“Joel is an impressive person and has shown he has outstanding leadership qualities as Captain of the Cats over a long period of time,” Ponissi said via a statement.“We were particularly impressed with his humility and eagerness to learn, which was no surprise given what we knew about him and from the feedback we got from those we spoke to through the process, including Simon Lloyd at the Cats.“We knew our two clubs had a lot of similarities, not just in sustained success but the values we each hold, and Joel has been a constant driver of those values for a long time.“His leadership qualities and values off the field are just as impressive and have been very well documented over the years which was also very important to us in speaking to Joel about this role.”The Herald Sun's Jay Clark tweeted of the move: “What a get.
