There have only been six other instances of a batter being timed out in top-level cricket since the law was introduced. So what happened, what do the Laws say and what has the reaction been? Scroll to the end to vote and have your say. Follow Bangladesh v Sri Lanka live Bangladesh play Sri Lanka in 'very unhealthy' air What happened? Mathews walks to the crease after Sadeera Samarawickrama is dismissed by the second ball of the 25th over. The 36-year-old is standing in his crease and about to take guard when he readjusts his helmet. The chinstrap, which goes around the jaw, breaks as he tries to tighten it. Mathews notices immediately as it snaps in his hand and calls for a new helmet. He speaks to Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan, showing him the damage to his helmet and asking for time to be allowed for a replacement to be brought out. Mathews is then seen speaking to umpires Richard Illingworth and Marais Erasmus. Erasmus then speaks to Shakib, potentially to ask if he is appealing for a dismissal. Mathews then speaks to Shakib and the Bangladesh team huddle again before Erasmus tells the Sri Lankan to leave the field. Mathews eventually accepts his fate, after another exchange with Shakib, and trudges off, throwing his broken helmet into the drink boxes on the sidelines as he walks off. He throws more equipment as he walks up the stairs towards the dressing room, from where Sri Lanka captain Kusal Mendis comes down and is seen having an animated conversation with fourth umpire Adrian Holdstock and Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha. Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood is seen speaking to Holdstock later on. During the change of innings, Holdstock said \"the batter wasn't ready within those two minutes even before the strap became an issue for him\", suggesting the helmet delay was not the reason for his unusual dismissal. What is the Law? To make matters even more confusing, the International Cricket Council (ICC) applies a different timeframe than the Laws of the game, which are determined by MCC. The Laws apply to all cricket, except where specific playing conditions are implemented for particular tournaments, leagues or matches. Law 40.1.1 refers to a batter timed out, and reads: \"After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, be ready to receive the ball, or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within three minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out.\" However, the ICC's playing conditions for this World Cup read: \"After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, be ready to receive the ball or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within two minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out.\" In essence, Mathews only had two minutes, rather than three, to be ready to face his first ball. BBC Sport has re-watched the incident, frame by frame, and from the moment of the ball landing in the fielder's hands for the previous wicket to the time Mathews touches the strap on his helmet, it took one minute and 54 seconds, with Mathews unlikely to have been in any position to receive the ball in time before two minutes were up. Others batters before him were ready to face inside 100 seconds. Samarawickrama was dismissed at 10:19:05 GMT and Mathews started to make his way off the field at 10:25:30, more than five minutes after the previous dismissal. Mathews could have batted without a helmet - they are not required in matches overseen by the ICC, unlike in England and Wales - but opted not to. What did Mathews say? Mathews opted to do the post-match press conference for Sri Lanka and called it \"disgraceful from Shakib and Bangladesh if they want to play cricket like that\". \"I hadn't done anything wrong. I have two minutes to get to the crease and get myself ready, which I did, and then it was an equipment malfunction,\" said Mathews. \"I don't know where the common sense went. To scoop down to that level there is something drastically wrong. \"The umpires have said to our coaches that they didn't see my helmet breaking. I was just asking for my helmet there. It was just pure common sense - I'm not talking about 'Mankading' [running out a batter at the non-striker's end] or obstructing the field. \"They have to respect the game itself. We are all ambassadors of this beautiful game, including the umpires. If you don't respect or use common sense, what more can you ask for?\" Speaking via a translator, Sri Lanka captain Mendis called the incident \"disappointing\" in his post-match interview. What did Shakib say? Bangladesh captain Shakib said there \"will be debates\" about the dismissal. \"One of our fielders came to me and said if you appeal now he will be out,\" explained Shakib. \"I appealed and the umpire asked me if I was serious, whether I would take it back or not. I said no. If it is in the rules then it is out and that is exactly what happened. \"It is in the Laws. I don't know if it it is right or wrong. But I feel like I was at a war so I had to take a decision to make sure my team wins so whatever I needed to do I had to do it. \"Right or wrong there will be debates. But if it is within the rules I don't mind taking those chances. \"I thought it [the dismissal] helped in a way. It gave me more fight. I won't deny that.\" Speaking in his press conference, he added: \"I've known him [Mathews] since 2006 and we've played a lot of cricket against each other so we know each other well. \"He came and asked me if I would withdraw the appeal. I said I understand your situation, it was unfortunate but I don't want to. \"I'll be careful that it doesn't happen to me.\" How did the pundits react? The reaction from pundits has been mixed. Former Ireland wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien, from the BBC Test Match Special team, said: \"I think he was ready to face the ball. He was on the pitch and his equipment failed him. I think there was a mistake there.\" Ex-Bangladesh batter Athar Ali Khan, who was part of the TV coverage, said: \"I don't like what I'm seeing, it is not good for the game. It's against the spirit of the game, that's how I feel about it. \"If something goes wrong with the helmet you should be allowed an extra couple of minutes to fix it. \"It is the first time we're seeing this in cricket, it is not good scenes, I must say that. I would have definitely called him back.\" Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja was also commentating on TV and felt the umpires dealt with the situation well. \"To a certain degree it is an onus on cricketers to learn the rules and understand the spirit of the rules,\" said Raja. \"Most of us don't, but the umpires were on top of the situation. It was a tough call to make. \"You've got back the Law here and be more understanding of what you're trying to do and what the Law is.\" Speaking between innings, fourth umpire Holdstock said: \"The TV umpire monitors the two minutes and he will then relay the message to the standing umpire. In this instance the batter wasn't ready within those two minutes even before the strap became an issue for him. The two minutes had already elapsed. \"According to the playing conditions, the fielding captain requested/initiated to the standing umpire that he wanted to appeal for timed out. \"As a batsman you need to make sure all your equipment is in place. You have to be ready to receive the ball in two minutes, not just take your guard.\" When were the other instances? This is the seventh instance of the Law being used, but the first in international and limited-overs cricket, as all previous occasions came in domestic first-class cricket.

Najmul Hossain and Shakib Al Hasan stitched together a 169-run partnership for the third wicket as Bangladesh scored 282/7 in 41.1 overs after bundling out Sri Lanka for 279 in 49.3 overs at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. With this win, Bangladesh moved to seventh position with four points from two wins while Sri Lanka remained on four wickets from eight matches and in eighth position. Chasing 280 for a win, Bangladesh lost openers Tanzid Hasan and Litton Das early in the Powerplay to Madushanka, who continued his impressive new-ball spells. But having raced off the blocks early, Bangladesh only needed to consolidate and Shakib Al Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto did just that forging a strong partnership to keep the run rate on par with the required rate. With the pitch easing under lights and dew in abundance, the ball came onto the bat and the two left-handers made merry, scoring at a brisk rate and piling the pressure on Sri Lanka. But Angelo Mathews exacted revenge for a first-innings mishap that saw him timed out by sending back Shakib with a cutter that found the leading edge and promptly gave him a send-off. He went on to find seam movement with the scrambled ball and forced an inside edge off Shanto to clean him up next over. With Bangladesh less than fifty runs away from a win, it didn‚Äôt seem like a huge blow until Madushanka and Maheesh Theekshana sent back Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah in quick succession. Mehidy Hasan Miraz was out with Bangladesh 11 runs away but Bangladesh got home with more than enough balls to spare to register their first-ever win over Sri Lanka in the men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup. Earlier, opting to bowl first Bangladesh made an early breakthrough when Mushfiqur Rahim pulled off a sensational catch behind the wicket to dismiss Kusal Perera in the first over. Kusal Mendis, who got off to a rather sedate start in uncharacteristic fashion, was dismissed by Shakib in his first over with the batter playing a mistimed stroke straight to mid-on. The veteran Sri Lankan all-rounder took his time to walk in and then found that his helmet strap had broken, further delaying his entry. An appeal from Bangladesh followed and it was upheld with the Cricket World Cup playing conditions stating that a batter can be ‚Äútimed out‚Äù if he is not ‚Äúready to receive the next ball within 2 minutes of the dismissal or retirement.‚Äù Asalanka carried the side forward amidst the chaos with Dhananjaya de Silva offering good support and the half-century stand lifted Sri Lanka out of trouble. De Silva fell for 34 in another odd sequence of play. The Sri Lankan was stumped out despite Rahim removing the bails with his gloves first as the Bangladesh wicketkeeper could take his time and recover to remove the stumps a second time with De Silva still not attempting to get back. Asalanka went on to make a fine hundred with Maheesh Theekshana aiding him but the final flourish never arrived as Bangladesh kept chipping away with wickets. They finished on 279, making just 56 runs in the last 57 balls of the innings. Brief scores: Sri Lanka 279 all out in 49.3 overs (Charith Asalanka 108, Sadeera Samarawickrama 41, Pathum Nissanka 41, Dhananjaya de Silva 34; Tanzim Hasan Sakib 3-80, Shoriful Islam 2-51, Shakib Al Hasan 2-57) lost to Bangladesh 282/7 in 41.1 overs (Najmul Hossain Shanto 90, Shakib Al Hasan 82; Dilshan Madushanka 3-69, Maheesh Theekshana 2-44, Angelo Mathews 2-35) by three wickets.","pubDate":"2023-11-06 17:36:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"kalingatv","source_priority":474757,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e02ccd144cfef47b85379f2a64e18044","title":"Who needs what to reach World Cup semi-finals?","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/67254799","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A breakdown of what each of the teams at the Cricket World need to reach the semi-finals.","content":"The race for a place in the World Cup semi-finals is hotting up, with eight sides still in contention for a top-four finish. Pakistan's victory over New Zealand on Saturday has made things even more intriguing. India and South Africa are safely into the last four, while Australia and New Zealand currently occupy the remaining qualification positions. But the chasing pack know a late run of results could see them make it through instead. The top seven will also qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy alongside hosts Pakistan, though eighth place will be enough if Pakistan seal a top-seven finish. This what each team needs from their remaining games. World Cup 2023: Results, scores and fixtures World Cup 2023: Table, run-scorers and wicket-takers 2023 Cricket World Cup table Team Played Won Lost Net run-rate Points Maximum points India (Q) 8 8 0 2.456 16 18 South Africa (Q) 8 6 2 1.376 12 14 Australia 7 5 2 0.924 10 14 New Zealand 8 4 4 0.398 8 10 Pakistan 8 4 4 0.036 8 10 Afghanistan 7 4 3 -0.33 8 12 Bangladesh (E) 8 2 6 -1.142 4 6 Sri Lanka (E) 8 2 6 -1.160 4 6 Netherlands 7 2 5 -1.398 4 8 England (E) 7 1 6 -1.504 2 6 Teams are split on points, then by number of wins and then net run-rate. Top four qualify for semi-finals. Chances of qualifying for semi-finals (according to CricViz and up to date as of 5 November): South Africa 100%, India 100%, Australia 97%, New Zealand 59%, Afghanistan 23%, Pakistan 20%. India Current points: 16 Maximum points possible: 18 India are guaranteed both top position in the group and a place in the semi-finals. South Africa Current points: 12 Maximum points possible: 14 South Africa are also through to the semi-finals, and only Australia can deny them second place. Australia Current points: 10 Maximum points possible: 14 Australia need one win from their remaining two group games to be guaranteed of a place in the final four. Even two defeats may see them through. Verdict: The momentum is with them to reach the last four after overcoming a sticky start. Should progress. New Zealand Current points: 8 Maximum points possible: 10 New Zealand are still in a good position. Even though Pakistan are equal on points and Afghanistan can still catch them, their net run-rate is superior. Their defeat to Pakistan made things tricky, but a win against Sri Lanka should be enough to qualify. Verdict: Should make it, but need to beat Sri Lanka by a big margin to avoid any last-gasp nerves. Pakistan Current points: 8 Maximum points possible: 10 Pakistan's win against New Zealand has kept them right in the mix. They need to beat England in their final match and hope that New Zealand slip up against Sri Lanka - or beat England by such a big margin that it overhauls the Black Caps' net run-rate. Verdict: Massively boosted by New Zealand victory, it could come down to the wire! Afghanistan Current points: 8 Maximum points possible: 12 Victory against the Netherlands has kept their semi-final hopes alive, but they have tough games to come against Australia and South Africa. Pakistan's win over New Zealand helps them, but they still need to win both remaining games to stay in contention. Verdict: Have given themselves a chance with four big wins, but still a very tough ask from here. Bangladesh Current points: 4 Maximum points possible: 6 Bangladesh have been eliminated after their defeat by Pakistan in their seventh match. Sri Lanka Current points: 4 Maximum points possible: 6 Sri Lanka cannot make the semi-finals following their defeat by Bangladesh in their eighth match. Netherlands Current points: 4 Maximum points possible: 8 They need to win their next two games, and need Australia and New Zealand to lose their remaining matches and to improve their net run-rate. Verdict: A very big ask. Would need to pull off a few shock wins and a specific set of results elsewhere go in their favour. Highly unlikely. England Current points: 2 Maximum points possible: 6 England are out of the World Cup after losing to Australia in the seventh match of the tournament. How is net run-rate calculated? Run-rate is the average number of runs scored per over by a team in their entire innings - so, for example, a score of 300 off 50 overs equals six runs per over. Net run-rate is calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate. The winning side will therefore have a positive net run-rate, and the losers a negative net run-rate. In a tournament, net run-rate is worked out by taking the average runs per over scored by that team in each game and subtracting the average runs per over scored against them in each game. If a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing the runs by the maximum overs they could have batted - 50 overs in the case of this tournament.","pubDate":"2023-11-06 17:31:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"bbc","source_priority":103,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"78d7de75ecda66562049a6dbdefece06","title":"Papers: Chelsea target Todibo as Thiago Silva replacement","link":"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/20876/13002339/chelsea-want-jean-clair-todibo-to-replace-thiago-silva-who-is-set-to-leave-at-end-of-season-paper-talk","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Tuesday's newspapers...","content":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Tuesday's newspapers...

There have only been six other instances of a batter being timed out in top-level cricket since the law was introduced. So what happened, what do the Laws say and what has the reaction been? Scroll to the end to vote and have your say. Follow Bangladesh v Sri Lanka live Bangladesh play Sri Lanka in 'very unhealthy' air What happened? Mathews walks to the crease after Sadeera Samarawickrama is dismissed by the second ball of the 25th over. The 36-year-old is standing in his crease and about to take guard when he readjusts his helmet. The chinstrap, which goes around the jaw, breaks as he tries to tighten it. Mathews notices immediately as it snaps in his hand and calls for a new helmet. He speaks to Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan, showing him the damage to his helmet and asking for time to be allowed for a replacement to be brought out. Mathews is then seen speaking to umpires Richard Illingworth and Marais Erasmus. Erasmus then speaks to Shakib, potentially to ask if he is appealing for a dismissal. Mathews then speaks to Shakib and the Bangladesh team huddle again before Erasmus tells the Sri Lankan to leave the field. Mathews eventually accepts his fate, after another exchange with Shakib, and trudges off, throwing his broken helmet into the drink boxes on the sidelines as he walks off. He throws more equipment as he walks up the stairs towards the dressing room, from where Sri Lanka captain Kusal Mendis comes down and is seen having an animated conversation with fourth umpire Adrian Holdstock and Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha. Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood is seen speaking to Holdstock later on. During the change of innings, Holdstock said \"the batter wasn't ready within those two minutes even before the strap became an issue for him\", suggesting the helmet delay was not the reason for his unusual dismissal. What is the Law? To make matters even more confusing, the International Cricket Council (ICC) applies a different timeframe than the Laws of the game, which are determined by MCC. The Laws apply to all cricket, except where specific playing conditions are implemented for particular tournaments, leagues or matches. Law 40.1.1 refers to a batter timed out, and reads: \"After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, be ready to receive the ball, or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within three minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out.\" However, the ICC's playing conditions for this World Cup read: \"After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, be ready to receive the ball or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within two minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out.\" In essence, Mathews only had two minutes, rather than three, to be ready to face his first ball. BBC Sport has re-watched the incident, frame by frame, and from the moment of the ball landing in the fielder's hands for the previous wicket to the time Mathews touches the strap on his helmet, it took one minute and 54 seconds, with Mathews unlikely to have been in any position to receive the ball in time before two minutes were up. Others batters before him were ready to face inside 100 seconds. Samarawickrama was dismissed at 10:19:05 GMT and Mathews started to make his way off the field at 10:25:30, more than five minutes after the previous dismissal. Mathews could have batted without a helmet - they are not required in matches overseen by the ICC, unlike in England and Wales - but opted not to. What did Mathews say? Mathews opted to do the post-match press conference for Sri Lanka and called it \"disgraceful from Shakib and Bangladesh if they want to play cricket like that\". \"I hadn't done anything wrong. I have two minutes to get to the crease and get myself ready, which I did, and then it was an equipment malfunction,\" said Mathews. \"I don't know where the common sense went. To scoop down to that level there is something drastically wrong. \"The umpires have said to our coaches that they didn't see my helmet breaking. I was just asking for my helmet there. It was just pure common sense - I'm not talking about 'Mankading' [running out a batter at the non-striker's end] or obstructing the field. \"They have to respect the game itself. We are all ambassadors of this beautiful game, including the umpires. If you don't respect or use common sense, what more can you ask for?\" Speaking via a translator, Sri Lanka captain Mendis called the incident \"disappointing\" in his post-match interview. What did Shakib say? Bangladesh captain Shakib said there \"will be debates\" about the dismissal. \"One of our fielders came to me and said if you appeal now he will be out,\" explained Shakib. \"I appealed and the umpire asked me if I was serious, whether I would take it back or not. I said no. If it is in the rules then it is out and that is exactly what happened. \"It is in the Laws. I don't know if it it is right or wrong. But I feel like I was at a war so I had to take a decision to make sure my team wins so whatever I needed to do I had to do it. \"Right or wrong there will be debates. But if it is within the rules I don't mind taking those chances. \"I thought it [the dismissal] helped in a way. It gave me more fight. I won't deny that.\" Speaking in his press conference, he added: \"I've known him [Mathews] since 2006 and we've played a lot of cricket against each other so we know each other well. \"He came and asked me if I would withdraw the appeal. I said I understand your situation, it was unfortunate but I don't want to. \"I'll be careful that it doesn't happen to me.\" How did the pundits react? The reaction from pundits has been mixed. Former Ireland wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien, from the BBC Test Match Special team, said: \"I think he was ready to face the ball. He was on the pitch and his equipment failed him. I think there was a mistake there.\" Ex-Bangladesh batter Athar Ali Khan, who was part of the TV coverage, said: \"I don't like what I'm seeing, it is not good for the game. It's against the spirit of the game, that's how I feel about it. \"If something goes wrong with the helmet you should be allowed an extra couple of minutes to fix it. \"It is the first time we're seeing this in cricket, it is not good scenes, I must say that. I would have definitely called him back.\" Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja was also commentating on TV and felt the umpires dealt with the situation well. \"To a certain degree it is an onus on cricketers to learn the rules and understand the spirit of the rules,\" said Raja. \"Most of us don't, but the umpires were on top of the situation. It was a tough call to make. \"You've got back the Law here and be more understanding of what you're trying to do and what the Law is.\" Speaking between innings, fourth umpire Holdstock said: \"The TV umpire monitors the two minutes and he will then relay the message to the standing umpire. In this instance the batter wasn't ready within those two minutes even before the strap became an issue for him. The two minutes had already elapsed. \"According to the playing conditions, the fielding captain requested/initiated to the standing umpire that he wanted to appeal for timed out. \"As a batsman you need to make sure all your equipment is in place. You have to be ready to receive the ball in two minutes, not just take your guard.\" When were the other instances? This is the seventh instance of the Law being used, but the first in international and limited-overs cricket, as all previous occasions came in domestic first-class cricket.

Najmul Hossain and Shakib Al Hasan stitched together a 169-run partnership for the third wicket as Bangladesh scored 282/7 in 41.1 overs after bundling out Sri Lanka for 279 in 49.3 overs at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. With this win, Bangladesh moved to seventh position with four points from two wins while Sri Lanka remained on four wickets from eight matches and in eighth position. Chasing 280 for a win, Bangladesh lost openers Tanzid Hasan and Litton Das early in the Powerplay to Madushanka, who continued his impressive new-ball spells. But having raced off the blocks early, Bangladesh only needed to consolidate and Shakib Al Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto did just that forging a strong partnership to keep the run rate on par with the required rate. With the pitch easing under lights and dew in abundance, the ball came onto the bat and the two left-handers made merry, scoring at a brisk rate and piling the pressure on Sri Lanka. But Angelo Mathews exacted revenge for a first-innings mishap that saw him timed out by sending back Shakib with a cutter that found the leading edge and promptly gave him a send-off. He went on to find seam movement with the scrambled ball and forced an inside edge off Shanto to clean him up next over. With Bangladesh less than fifty runs away from a win, it didn‚Äôt seem like a huge blow until Madushanka and Maheesh Theekshana sent back Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah in quick succession. Mehidy Hasan Miraz was out with Bangladesh 11 runs away but Bangladesh got home with more than enough balls to spare to register their first-ever win over Sri Lanka in the men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup. Earlier, opting to bowl first Bangladesh made an early breakthrough when Mushfiqur Rahim pulled off a sensational catch behind the wicket to dismiss Kusal Perera in the first over. Kusal Mendis, who got off to a rather sedate start in uncharacteristic fashion, was dismissed by Shakib in his first over with the batter playing a mistimed stroke straight to mid-on. The veteran Sri Lankan all-rounder took his time to walk in and then found that his helmet strap had broken, further delaying his entry. An appeal from Bangladesh followed and it was upheld with the Cricket World Cup playing conditions stating that a batter can be ‚Äútimed out‚Äù if he is not ‚Äúready to receive the next ball within 2 minutes of the dismissal or retirement.‚Äù Asalanka carried the side forward amidst the chaos with Dhananjaya de Silva offering good support and the half-century stand lifted Sri Lanka out of trouble. De Silva fell for 34 in another odd sequence of play. The Sri Lankan was stumped out despite Rahim removing the bails with his gloves first as the Bangladesh wicketkeeper could take his time and recover to remove the stumps a second time with De Silva still not attempting to get back. Asalanka went on to make a fine hundred with Maheesh Theekshana aiding him but the final flourish never arrived as Bangladesh kept chipping away with wickets. They finished on 279, making just 56 runs in the last 57 balls of the innings. Brief scores: Sri Lanka 279 all out in 49.3 overs (Charith Asalanka 108, Sadeera Samarawickrama 41, Pathum Nissanka 41, Dhananjaya de Silva 34; Tanzim Hasan Sakib 3-80, Shoriful Islam 2-51, Shakib Al Hasan 2-57) lost to Bangladesh 282/7 in 41.1 overs (Najmul Hossain Shanto 90, Shakib Al Hasan 82; Dilshan Madushanka 3-69, Maheesh Theekshana 2-44, Angelo Mathews 2-35) by three wickets.","pubDate":"2023-11-06 17:36:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"kalingatv","source_priority":474757,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e02ccd144cfef47b85379f2a64e18044","title":"Who needs what to reach World Cup semi-finals?","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/67254799","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A breakdown of what each of the teams at the Cricket World need to reach the semi-finals.","content":"The race for a place in the World Cup semi-finals is hotting up, with eight sides still in contention for a top-four finish.

But the chasing pack know a late run of results could see them make it through instead. The top seven will also qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy alongside hosts Pakistan, though eighth place will be enough if Pakistan seal a top-seven finish. This what each team needs from their remaining games.

Top four qualify for semi-finals. Chances of qualifying for semi-finals (according to CricViz and up to date as of 5 November): South Africa 100%, India 100%, Australia 97%, New Zealand 59%, Afghanistan 23%, Pakistan 20%. India Current points: 16 Maximum points possible: 18 India are guaranteed both top position in the group and a place in the semi-finals. South Africa Current points: 12 Maximum points possible: 14 South Africa are also through to the semi-finals, and only Australia can deny them second place. Australia Current points: 10 Maximum points possible: 14 Australia need one win from their remaining two group games to be guaranteed of a place in the final four. Even two defeats may see them through. Verdict: The momentum is with them to reach the last four after overcoming a sticky start. Should progress. New Zealand Current points: 8 Maximum points possible: 10 New Zealand are still in a good position. Even though Pakistan are equal on points and Afghanistan can still catch them, their net run-rate is superior. Their defeat to Pakistan made things tricky, but a win against Sri Lanka should be enough to qualify. Verdict: Should make it, but need to beat Sri Lanka by a big margin to avoid any last-gasp nerves. Pakistan Current points: 8 Maximum points possible: 10 Pakistan's win against New Zealand has kept them right in the mix. They need to beat England in their final match and hope that New Zealand slip up against Sri Lanka - or beat England by such a big margin that it overhauls the Black Caps' net run-rate. Verdict: Massively boosted by New Zealand victory, it could come down to the wire! Afghanistan Current points: 8 Maximum points possible: 12 Victory against the Netherlands has kept their semi-final hopes alive, but they have tough games to come against Australia and South Africa. Pakistan's win over New Zealand helps them, but they still need to win both remaining games to stay in contention. Verdict: Have given themselves a chance with four big wins, but still a very tough ask from here. Bangladesh Current points: 4 Maximum points possible: 6 Bangladesh have been eliminated after their defeat by Pakistan in their seventh match. Sri Lanka Current points: 4 Maximum points possible: 6 Sri Lanka cannot make the semi-finals following their defeat by Bangladesh in their eighth match. Netherlands Current points: 4 Maximum points possible: 8 They need to win their next two games, and need Australia and New Zealand to lose their remaining matches and to improve their net run-rate. Verdict: A very big ask. Would need to pull off a few shock wins and a specific set of results elsewhere go in their favour. Highly unlikely. England Current points: 2 Maximum points possible: 6 England are out of the World Cup after losing to Australia in the seventh match of the tournament. How is net run-rate calculated? Run-rate is the average number of runs scored per over by a team in their entire innings - so, for example, a score of 300 off 50 overs equals six runs per over. Net run-rate is calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate. The winning side will therefore have a positive net run-rate, and the losers a negative net run-rate. In a tournament, net run-rate is worked out by taking the average runs per over scored by that team in each game and subtracting the average runs per over scored against them in each game. If a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing the runs by the maximum overs they could have batted - 50 overs in the case of this tournament.","pubDate":"2023-11-06 17:31:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"bbc","source_priority":103,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"78d7de75ecda66562049a6dbdefece06","title":"Papers: Chelsea target Todibo as Thiago Silva replacement","link":"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/20876/13002339/chelsea-want-jean-clair-todibo-to-replace-thiago-silva-who-is-set-to-leave-at-end-of-season-paper-talk","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Tuesday's newspapers...","content":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Tuesday's newspapers...

Up to today I had the utmost respect for him and the Bangladesh team.‚Äù Shakib stood by his decision, insisting that it was within the rules of the game. He said in a post-match interview: ‚ÄúOne of our fielders came to me and said that if I appealed, he would be out. ‚ÄúThe umpire asked me if I was serious. It‚Äôs in the laws, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs right or wrong.‚Äù Smiling, Shakib continued: ‚ÄúI felt like I was at war. Whatever I had to do, I did it. There will be debates.

There have only been six other instances of a batter being timed out in top-level cricket since the law was introduced. So what happened, what do the Laws say and what has the reaction been? Scroll to the end to vote and have your say. Follow Bangladesh v Sri Lanka live Bangladesh play Sri Lanka in 'very unhealthy' air What happened? Mathews walks to the crease after Sadeera Samarawickrama is dismissed by the second ball of the 25th over. The 36-year-old is standing in his crease and about to take guard when he readjusts his helmet. The chinstrap, which goes around the jaw, breaks as he tries to tighten it. Mathews notices immediately as it snaps in his hand and calls for a new helmet. He speaks to Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan, showing him the damage to his helmet and asking for time to be allowed for a replacement to be brought out. Mathews is then seen speaking to umpires Richard Illingworth and Marais Erasmus. Erasmus then speaks to Shakib, potentially to ask if he is appealing for a dismissal. Mathews then speaks to Shakib and the Bangladesh team huddle again before Erasmus tells the Sri Lankan to leave the field. Mathews eventually accepts his fate, after another exchange with Shakib, and trudges off, throwing his broken helmet into the drink boxes on the sidelines as he walks off. He throws more equipment as he walks up the stairs towards the dressing room, from where Sri Lanka captain Kusal Mendis comes down and is seen having an animated conversation with fourth umpire Adrian Holdstock and Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha. Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood is seen speaking to Holdstock later on. During the change of innings, Holdstock said \"the batter wasn't ready within those two minutes even before the strap became an issue for him\", suggesting the helmet delay was not the reason for his unusual dismissal. What is the Law? To make matters even more confusing, the International Cricket Council (ICC) applies a different timeframe than the Laws of the game, which are determined by MCC. The Laws apply to all cricket, except where specific playing conditions are implemented for particular tournaments, leagues or matches. Law 40.1.1 refers to a batter timed out, and reads: \"After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, be ready to receive the ball, or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within three minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out.\" However, the ICC's playing conditions for this World Cup read: \"After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, be ready to receive the ball or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within two minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out.\" In essence, Mathews only had two minutes, rather than three, to be ready to face his first ball. BBC Sport has re-watched the incident, frame by frame, and from the moment of the ball landing in the fielder's hands for the previous wicket to the time Mathews touches the strap on his helmet, it took one minute and 54 seconds, with Mathews unlikely to have been in any position to receive the ball in time before two minutes were up. Others batters before him were ready to face inside 100 seconds. Samarawickrama was dismissed at 10:19:05 GMT and Mathews started to make his way off the field at 10:25:30, more than five minutes after the previous dismissal. Mathews could have batted without a helmet - they are not required in matches overseen by the ICC, unlike in England and Wales - but opted not to. What did Mathews say? Mathews opted to do the post-match press conference for Sri Lanka and called it \"disgraceful from Shakib and Bangladesh if they want to play cricket like that\". \"I hadn't done anything wrong. I have two minutes to get to the crease and get myself ready, which I did, and then it was an equipment malfunction,\" said Mathews. \"I don't know where the common sense went. To scoop down to that level there is something drastically wrong. \"The umpires have said to our coaches that they didn't see my helmet breaking. I was just asking for my helmet there. It was just pure common sense - I'm not talking about 'Mankading' [running out a batter at the non-striker's end] or obstructing the field. \"They have to respect the game itself. We are all ambassadors of this beautiful game, including the umpires. If you don't respect or use common sense, what more can you ask for?\" Speaking via a translator, Sri Lanka captain Mendis called the incident \"disappointing\" in his post-match interview. What did Shakib say? Bangladesh captain Shakib said there \"will be debates\" about the dismissal. \"One of our fielders came to me and said if you appeal now he will be out,\" explained Shakib. \"I appealed and the umpire asked me if I was serious, whether I would take it back or not. I said no. If it is in the rules then it is out and that is exactly what happened. \"It is in the Laws. I don't know if it it is right or wrong. But I feel like I was at a war so I had to take a decision to make sure my team wins so whatever I needed to do I had to do it. \"Right or wrong there will be debates. But if it is within the rules I don't mind taking those chances. \"I thought it [the dismissal] helped in a way. It gave me more fight. I won't deny that.\" Speaking in his press conference, he added: \"I've known him [Mathews] since 2006 and we've played a lot of cricket against each other so we know each other well. \"He came and asked me if I would withdraw the appeal. I said I understand your situation, it was unfortunate but I don't want to. \"I'll be careful that it doesn't happen to me.\" How did the pundits react? The reaction from pundits has been mixed. Former Ireland wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien, from the BBC Test Match Special team, said: \"I think he was ready to face the ball. He was on the pitch and his equipment failed him. I think there was a mistake there.\" Ex-Bangladesh batter Athar Ali Khan, who was part of the TV coverage, said: \"I don't like what I'm seeing, it is not good for the game. It's against the spirit of the game, that's how I feel about it. \"If something goes wrong with the helmet you should be allowed an extra couple of minutes to fix it. \"It is the first time we're seeing this in cricket, it is not good scenes, I must say that. I would have definitely called him back.\" Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja was also commentating on TV and felt the umpires dealt with the situation well. \"To a certain degree it is an onus on cricketers to learn the rules and understand the spirit of the rules,\" said Raja. \"Most of us don't, but the umpires were on top of the situation. It was a tough call to make. \"You've got back the Law here and be more understanding of what you're trying to do and what the Law is.\" Speaking between innings, fourth umpire Holdstock said: \"The TV umpire monitors the two minutes and he will then relay the message to the standing umpire. In this instance the batter wasn't ready within those two minutes even before the strap became an issue for him. The two minutes had already elapsed. \"According to the playing conditions, the fielding captain requested/initiated to the standing umpire that he wanted to appeal for timed out. \"As a batsman you need to make sure all your equipment is in place. You have to be ready to receive the ball in two minutes, not just take your guard.\" When were the other instances? This is the seventh instance of the Law being used, but the first in international and limited-overs cricket, as all previous occasions came in domestic first-class cricket.

Najmul Hossain and Shakib Al Hasan stitched together a 169-run partnership for the third wicket as Bangladesh scored 282/7 in 41.1 overs after bundling out Sri Lanka for 279 in 49.3 overs at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. With this win, Bangladesh moved to seventh position with four points from two wins while Sri Lanka remained on four wickets from eight matches and in eighth position. Chasing 280 for a win, Bangladesh lost openers Tanzid Hasan and Litton Das early in the Powerplay to Madushanka, who continued his impressive new-ball spells. But having raced off the blocks early, Bangladesh only needed to consolidate and Shakib Al Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto did just that forging a strong partnership to keep the run rate on par with the required rate. With the pitch easing under lights and dew in abundance, the ball came onto the bat and the two left-handers made merry, scoring at a brisk rate and piling the pressure on Sri Lanka. But Angelo Mathews exacted revenge for a first-innings mishap that saw him timed out by sending back Shakib with a cutter that found the leading edge and promptly gave him a send-off. He went on to find seam movement with the scrambled ball and forced an inside edge off Shanto to clean him up next over. With Bangladesh less than fifty runs away from a win, it didn‚Äôt seem like a huge blow until Madushanka and Maheesh Theekshana sent back Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah in quick succession. Mehidy Hasan Miraz was out with Bangladesh 11 runs away but Bangladesh got home with more than enough balls to spare to register their first-ever win over Sri Lanka in the men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup. Earlier, opting to bowl first Bangladesh made an early breakthrough when Mushfiqur Rahim pulled off a sensational catch behind the wicket to dismiss Kusal Perera in the first over. Kusal Mendis, who got off to a rather sedate start in uncharacteristic fashion, was dismissed by Shakib in his first over with the batter playing a mistimed stroke straight to mid-on. The veteran Sri Lankan all-rounder took his time to walk in and then found that his helmet strap had broken, further delaying his entry. An appeal from Bangladesh followed and it was upheld with the Cricket World Cup playing conditions stating that a batter can be ‚Äútimed out‚Äù if he is not ‚Äúready to receive the next ball within 2 minutes of the dismissal or retirement.‚Äù Asalanka carried the side forward amidst the chaos with Dhananjaya de Silva offering good support and the half-century stand lifted Sri Lanka out of trouble. De Silva fell for 34 in another odd sequence of play. The Sri Lankan was stumped out despite Rahim removing the bails with his gloves first as the Bangladesh wicketkeeper could take his time and recover to remove the stumps a second time with De Silva still not attempting to get back. Asalanka went on to make a fine hundred with Maheesh Theekshana aiding him but the final flourish never arrived as Bangladesh kept chipping away with wickets. They finished on 279, making just 56 runs in the last 57 balls of the innings. Brief scores: Sri Lanka 279 all out in 49.3 overs (Charith Asalanka 108, Sadeera Samarawickrama 41, Pathum Nissanka 41, Dhananjaya de Silva 34; Tanzim Hasan Sakib 3-80, Shoriful Islam 2-51, Shakib Al Hasan 2-57) lost to Bangladesh 282/7 in 41.1 overs (Najmul Hossain Shanto 90, Shakib Al Hasan 82; Dilshan Madushanka 3-69, Maheesh Theekshana 2-44, Angelo Mathews 2-35) by three wickets.","pubDate":"2023-11-06 17:36:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"kalingatv","source_priority":474757,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e02ccd144cfef47b85379f2a64e18044","title":"Who needs what to reach World Cup semi-finals?","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/67254799","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A breakdown of what each of the teams at the Cricket World need to reach the semi-finals.","content":"The race for a place in the World Cup semi-finals is hotting up, with eight sides still in contention for a top-four finish.

But the chasing pack know a late run of results could see them make it through instead. The top seven will also qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy alongside hosts Pakistan, though eighth place will be enough if Pakistan seal a top-seven finish. This what each team needs from their remaining games.

Top four qualify for semi-finals. Chances of qualifying for semi-finals (according to CricViz and up to date as of 5 November): South Africa 100%, India 100%, Australia 97%, New Zealand 59%, Afghanistan 23%, Pakistan 20%. India Current points: 16 Maximum points possible: 18 India are guaranteed both top position in the group and a place in the semi-finals. South Africa Current points: 12 Maximum points possible: 14 South Africa are also through to the semi-finals, and only Australia can deny them second place. Australia Current points: 10 Maximum points possible: 14 Australia need one win from their remaining two group games to be guaranteed of a place in the final four. Even two defeats may see them through. Verdict: The momentum is with them to reach the last four after overcoming a sticky start. Should progress. New Zealand Current points: 8 Maximum points possible: 10 New Zealand are still in a good position. Even though Pakistan are equal on points and Afghanistan can still catch them, their net run-rate is superior. Their defeat to Pakistan made things tricky, but a win against Sri Lanka should be enough to qualify. Verdict: Should make it, but need to beat Sri Lanka by a big margin to avoid any last-gasp nerves. Pakistan Current points: 8 Maximum points possible: 10 Pakistan's win against New Zealand has kept them right in the mix. They need to beat England in their final match and hope that New Zealand slip up against Sri Lanka - or beat England by such a big margin that it overhauls the Black Caps' net run-rate. Verdict: Massively boosted by New Zealand victory, it could come down to the wire! Afghanistan Current points: 8 Maximum points possible: 12 Victory against the Netherlands has kept their semi-final hopes alive, but they have tough games to come against Australia and South Africa. Pakistan's win over New Zealand helps them, but they still need to win both remaining games to stay in contention. Verdict: Have given themselves a chance with four big wins, but still a very tough ask from here. Bangladesh Current points: 4 Maximum points possible: 6 Bangladesh have been eliminated after their defeat by Pakistan in their seventh match. Sri Lanka Current points: 4 Maximum points possible: 6 Sri Lanka cannot make the semi-finals following their defeat by Bangladesh in their eighth match. Netherlands Current points: 4 Maximum points possible: 8 They need to win their next two games, and need Australia and New Zealand to lose their remaining matches and to improve their net run-rate. Verdict: A very big ask. Would need to pull off a few shock wins and a specific set of results elsewhere go in their favour. Highly unlikely. England Current points: 2 Maximum points possible: 6 England are out of the World Cup after losing to Australia in the seventh match of the tournament. How is net run-rate calculated? Run-rate is the average number of runs scored per over by a team in their entire innings - so, for example, a score of 300 off 50 overs equals six runs per over. Net run-rate is calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate. The winning side will therefore have a positive net run-rate, and the losers a negative net run-rate. In a tournament, net run-rate is worked out by taking the average runs per over scored by that team in each game and subtracting the average runs per over scored against them in each game. If a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing the runs by the maximum overs they could have batted - 50 overs in the case of this tournament.","pubDate":"2023-11-06 17:31:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"bbc","source_priority":103,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
