The new changes won’t come into force until October, 2022. In the intervening time, the relevant materials will be updated by the MCC to assist with umpire and official training on a global basis. A new law on replacement players has been introduced. It states that replacements in a match are to be treated as if they were the player they replaced, inheriting any sanctions or dismissals pertaining to that player in that match. For a caught-out dismissal, the player who comes in to bat will take strike, regardless of whether the batter had run to the other end when the catch was taken, unless it is the end of the over. Several changes to the dead-ball law have been made. The umpire will signal dead ball if either team is disadvantaged by a person, animal or other object within the field of play. ALSO READ - ICC rankings: Mithali, Smriti slip two places If a bowler attempts to run the striker out before entering his delivery stride, the ball will be a dead ball, and not a no-ball as previously stated. In keeping up with the times, Law 22.1 pertaining to wide has been amended. It states a wide will not be called if it passes where the batter had stood as the bowler entered his/her delivery stride. If the batter stood far to the leg-side, for example, and shifted his position at the last minute, and the ball passes through the leg-side where the batter had been standing, the ball won’t be a wide. Other changes include: strikers’ right to play the ball (Law 25.8), unfair movement by the fielding side (Laws 27.4 and 28.6), moving the running out of the non-striker (Law 38.3), and no saliva (Law 41.3), a law which bans the use of saliva on the ball. Commenting on the new law and amendments of previous laws of cricket, Fraser Stewart, MCC Laws Manager, said: “Since the publication of the 2017 Code of the Laws of Cricket, the game has changed in numerous ways. The second edition of that Code, published in 2019, was mostly clarification and minor amendments, but the 2022 Code makes some rather bigger changes, from the way we talk about cricket to the way it’s played. “It is important that we announce these changes now as part of the Club’s global commitment to the game, giving officials from all over the world the chance to learn under the new Code ahead of the Laws coming into force in October.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rule changes mean Mankads no longer ‘unfair’","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/mankads-no-longer-deemed-unfair-as-cricket-announces-rule-changes/news-story/32899b416aa5d3c596c7047851ae6ba2","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Marylebone Cricket Club, the sport’s custodians and lawmakers, have introduced several rule changes designed to “shape the game of cricket as it should be played”.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-09 02:18:00","full_description":"Marylebone Cricket Club, the sport’s custodians and lawmakers, have introduced several rule changes designed to “shape the game of cricket as it should be played”. The MCC Laws sub-committee recommended several changes to the Laws, which were approved at the Main Committee meeting last week. However, the rule changes will not come into force until October. “Since the publication of the 2017 Code of the Laws of Cricket, the game has changed in numerous ways,” Fraser Stewart, MCC Laws Manager, said in a statement. “The 2nd edition of that Code, published in 2019, was mostly clarification and minor amendments, but the 2022 Code makes some rather bigger changes, from the way we talk about cricket to the way it’s played.” Watch Australia’s Tour of Pakistan on Kayo.

Try 14-Days Free Now > One of the smallest but most meaningful changes was to Law 41.16 – running out the non-striker, colloquially known as the “Mankad”. The Law has been moved from the “Unfair Play” section to Law 38 (Run out), but the wording remains the same. This intentionally destigmatises non-striker run-outs, which have become a source of controversy among the cricket community. “The bowler is always painted as the villain but it is a legitimate way to dismiss someone and it is the non-striker who is stealing the ground,” Stewart told the Times . “It is legitimate, it is a run-out and therefore it should live in the run-out section of the laws.” Law 18.11 has also been changed so that when a batter is out caught, the new batter shall come in at the striker’s end, irrespective of whether the players crossed. Previously, the new batter would start their innings at the non-striker’s end if the batters crossed before the catch was complete, but this is no longer the case. The new batter will always be on strike unless it is the end of the over. The rule was first trialled by the ECB in The Hundred competition last year. Sports reporter Mark Gottlieb tweeted: “Can anyone explain WHY they’ve changed this? What was wrong with the old rule?” cricket is such a nuanced sport. Iâve spent hundreds of hours of my life, usually in pubs, discussing and debating its vagaries. And yet I donât think Iâve ever heard anyone, ever, complain about the batters crossing rule. Meanwhile, one of the cricket’s fabled acts looks destined to become a thing of the past, with the updated Laws banning the application of saliva onto the match ball. Using saliva on the ball was understandably banned after the Covid-19 pandemic, but research conducted by the MCC found this had little to no impact on the amount of swing bowlers were getting — using sweat to polish the ball was equally effective. South African captain Faf du Plessis was found guilty of ball-tampering in 2016 for using mints to alter the ball’s condition in a Test series against Australia, sparking heated debate about the application of saliva. This change eradicates any grey areas. Other updates to the Laws include changes to replacement players, dead balls and adjudicating wides. Law 22.1 has been reworded so that wide calls “apply to where the batter is standing, where the striker has stood at any point since the bowler began their run-up, and which would also have passed wide of the striker in a normal batting position”. Australia already had the best ODI batter in the world, and World Cup blitzes have shown just how deep the talent goes. Subtle changes to cricket’s laws could make a big difference for bowlers, especially as this once normal practice is now banned.

And the Mankad, one of the most controversial modes of dismissal in cricket, has been moved from the “unfair play” section of the official laws of the game to “run out” to avoid any negative connotations over what is a legal play. Referred to in the laws of the game as “running out the nonstriker”, the act of a bowler stopping to run out a batsman creeping out of his crease has long been contentious as to whether it’s in the spirit of the game.

But research by the sport‘s lawmakers found the practice “had little or no impact on the amount of swing the bowlers were getting”, with sweat deemed just was effective. The new law, which will come into force from October, also removes any grey areas over fielders eating sweets or mints to alter their saliva to apply to the ball.

Pakistan captain Bismah Maroof scored 78 as her team made 190-6 after losing the toss and being put into bat. Despite a much-improved performance on their first-round loss to India, Pakistan paid the price for a sluggish run rate. Allrounder Aliya Riaz made a creditable 53 but it came off 109 balls, while Australia’s top order scored at almost a run a ball.Healy and opening partner Rachael Haynes rode their luck during an aggressive start to their chase; the former dropped on eight and the latter on 25 and 26 as Australia reached 0-59 at the end of the powerplay.Haynes came unstuck the following over on 34, holing out to left-arm spinner Nashra Sandhu, but skipper Meg Lanning continued the momentum with a 37-ball 35 before chopping on a sharp-turning off-break from Omaima Sohail.Healy's half-century came from 55 balls and while she could not see it through to the finish – holing out to Sohail with Australia 38 runs short of victory – Ellyse Perry (26no) and Beth Mooney (23no) steered Australia home in 34.4 overs.Earlier, Pakistan had quickly found themselves in trouble after being sent into bat by Lanning, before a 99-run partnership – the country's best at any women's World Cup – between Maroof and Riaz stemmed the fall of wickets.The result puts Australia top of the tournament’s eight-team leaderboard but leaves Pakistan bottom with a struggle to make the final four after two losses. “Everyone’s in really good form, we all got starts and I guess we’re all feeling in good nick,” Lanning said. “Pakistan did extremely well and made it hard for us to take wickets so we were disciplined and kept that run rate in check.” Pakistan’s total never looked enough against Australia’s formidable big hitters, who overhauled the target with 15.2 overs to spare, finishing on 193-3. Maroof said Pakistan were unable to exert pressure in the field. “We could have stopped them, they gave us chances but we didn’t capitalise,” she said. “In fielding we could have done much better.” Defeat left Pakistan without a win against Australia in 13 ODI matches.Pakistan face South Africa on Friday while Australia’s next challenge is against hosts New Zealand on Sunday.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan Blind Team whitewash SA","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/939870-pakistan-blind-team-whitewash-sa","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: The Pakistan Blind Cricket Team whitewashed South Africa Blind Cricket team after an easy victory in the third and last T-20 International by 163 runs at Iqbal Stadium Faisalabad on Tuesday.

The 31-year-old is passionate about working within the game as a coach or within the media but believes his decision to blow the whistle on what happened to him makes that impossible. Rafiq's allegations led to radical changes in the county's leadership, the stripping of international hosting rights for Headingley which have still not been fully restored, and prompted the England and Wales Cricket Board to enact a 12-point plan to tackle racism in the game. The former Yorkshire spinner now believes he is paying the price for being so candid. \"I feel like people are scared to be connected to me, because I will continue to fight for the truth,\" he told the PA news agency at the Include Summit in Birmingham. \"I sit here as a 31-year-old, potentially unemployable, potentially (without) any hope of being around the game in the future, a game that I've loved for the majority of my life. \"Something that I thought, after letting off the burden that I've been carrying for a long time, that I'd be able to love again and start going back towards and follow my passion within it. \"If an opportunity of work came, they would have to have me like this. I won't be prepared to look the other way any longer. \"My passion away from playing is coaching. I've completed my Level Four course but didn't do the assessment because it was around the time of the DCMS hearing. \"So that was one thing that I always wanted to do and the other thing was within a media, broadcasting. I just don't know how I can come back when the game is still not accepting the reality. Of course I'd love to (come back).\" Rafiq's harrowing testimony to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee last November ignited the debate around discrimination in cricket, and led to threats to his physical safety. \"I'm incredibly worried about something potentially happening to (my family) and just always having to look over your shoulder and be told by the authorities, 'just be careful not to be here, not to be there',\" he added. \"I never expected things to be easy. But I don't think I quite expected to come to a point where I went away from the country for a bit because of the safety threat to me.\" He says support from outside the game has been incredible, but the response from within cricket has been disappointing. \"It hurts,\" he said. \"Cricket as a whole still feels like there isn't a problem, which is incredibly worrying. It wants to put this across as Azeem Rafiq's experience. It's not, it's the experience of thousands of others. \"When I hear that there's sympathy for the perpetrators, people who did wrong, and I'm seen as a problem - that is difficult for me to take.\" Rafiq said he has still not received a proper apology from Gary Ballance after his Yorkshire team-mate admitted directing a racial slur towards him. \"The only thing that Gary's done throughout this is that statement (admitting using racist language towards Rafiq) that he put out when he got named, and even that was not an apology,\" Rafiq said. \"It was very quick to, in my opinion, gaslight and talk about things that weren't relevant. I haven't had an apology to this day.\" Asked whether Yorkshire should allow Ballance to continue playing without a full apology, Rafiq said: \"This is for Yorkshire to decide and how that reflects (on them). \"From the outside point of view, it does look a bit wrong that you've had a lot of people lose their jobs yet someone who did these things and was proven to have done these things is carrying on as normal. But it's not my decision.\" Rafiq remains concerned that the ECB's plans to tackle discrimination in the game will have any meaningful effect. \"The whole action plan is really difficult for me to have any faith in it because we've seen it before,\" he said. \"A lot of these things that look great at the top, they look great on a PDF, it's the delivery, and the delivery goes through a pipeline and by the time it reaches the bottom it breaks. \"There's a massive disconnect, from the ECB to counties, from counties to club cricket. Until the pipe gets connected properly you'll never know what's actually being delivered at the bottom. \"I personally don't feel like there's still enough of an energy (to succeed). (Equality, diversity and inclusion) should be the only agenda. I honestly don't care about how (England) went in Australia or anything, that should not be the first thing, this should be the first thing. \"If you sort this out and make the game more inclusive for everyone, over a period of time you'll sort the cricket performance out anyway because you'll have a larger and a better pool of talent to pick from. \"From a county point of view, they don't actually think that there is a problem, which is incredibly worrying.\"","image_url":"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/resources/images/13259072/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"thetelegraphandargus","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Body of Warne in Bangkok as Australia arranges return home","link":"https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/2276295/body-of-warne-in-bangkok-as-australia-arranges-return-home","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The body of Australian cricket icon Shane Warne remained in Thailand for another day on Tuesday, police said, as consular officials worked on logistics to bring home the man widely regarded as one of the finest spin bowlers of all time.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-09 00:36:00","full_description":"The body of Australian cricket icon Shane Warne remained in Thailand for another day on Tuesday, police said, as consular officials worked on logistics to bring home the man widely regarded as one of the finest spin bowlers of all time.

Police had indicated his body could be repatriated on Tuesday. However, deputy police spokesman Pol Col Kissana Phathanacharoen said Warne's body was at Police General Hospital late Tuesday where it would remain until a flight was arranged. \"It is now a matter of waiting for the Australians to organise a flight... there are no reasons for Thai side to conduct any further examination,\" he said. Tributes from across the world have been pouring in for Warne, with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison calling him \"one of our nation's greatest characters\". Australia's embassy in Thailand on Tuesday said arrangements were still being made to fly the cricketer's body home and directed media enquiries to its foreign ministry in Canberra, which said it was assisting the family and would not comment further owing to its request for privacy.

It feels like I‘m dreaming, waiting for someone to wake me up and tell me that you’re okay,” she wrote. “This can’t be real life. There’s no way that life is this cruel to the most beautiful people on this earth. “I’d do anything to hear that laugh again, anything to hear your voice, anything to have one of your cuddles, anything to be with you again just one last time. “I took our time for granted dad and I would do anything to have more time with you on this earth. Our time was robbed and I wish you would come back to me. “You may not be alive dad, but you will forever live inside my heart, I will cherish the memories till my time is up on this earth and I am reunited with you again. I love you dad.” Hurley commented on the post: “I love you, Summer. Your daddy worshipped you.” Brother Jackson replied: “I love you Summer, I’m always going to be here for you.” Summer replied to Hurley, writing: “@elizabethhurley1love u so much.” Hurley also responded to Jackson’s emotional Instagram post about his dad, writing “I love you, Jackson” with a heart emoji. Hurley took to Instagram late on Saturday evening to remember her ex-fiancee, sharing multiple photos of the pair together. “I feel like the sun has gone behind a cloud forever. RIP my beloved Lionheart,” the 56-year-old wrote. Hurley’s son Damian also posted on Instagram about Warne, uploading a series of happy snaps with the former leg-spinner. “I’m still trying to wrap my head around this … SW was a father figure to me for most of my formative years and was truly one the best men I’ve ever known,” Damian wrote. “My heart is broken. Thinking of and sending love to all SW’s family.” Warne and Hurley started dating in 2010, with the Aussie cricketer proposing to the British actress in September the following year but despite buying a home together, they split in 2013 before making it down the aisle.

Shane’s parents, Keith and Brigitte, his brother Jason, his children, Jackson, Summer and Brooke and his ex-wife, Simone, each released statements on Monday evening. Keith and Brigitte described the past three days as a “never-ending nightmare” for the Warne family, while Jason called it a “truly heartbreaking” ordeal. Jackson vowed to “try and be happy” after his father’s sudden passing, while Summer described Shane as “the best dad someone could ever ask for”. An autopsy at the Surat Thani Hospital found that Warne died of natural causes, Thai police confirmed on Monday. Warne’s family and Australia’s ambassador to Thailand Allan McKinnon were informed of the result and accepted the finding, deputy national police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen said in a statement. “Today investigators received the autopsy result, in which the medical opinion is that the cause of death is natural,” Phathanacharoen said. “Investigators will summarise the autopsy result for prosecutors within the timeframe of the law.” Warne’s body is set to be sent back to Australia on Tuesday.

Sitting at the poker table, walking around the golf course, watching the Saints and eating pizza is never going to be the same. But I know all you ever wanted for me is to be happy, no matter what. You just wanted me to be happy, that’s it. So that’s what I’m going to do, try and be happy. I am going to miss you so much Dad and you were truly the best father and mate anyone could’ve asked for. I love you so much Dad, see you soon.” Summer Warne statement “Dad, I miss you so much already. I wish I could’ve hugged you tighter in what I didn’t know were my final moments with you. And your final breaths were only moments away. I wish I could’ve told you that everything was going to be okay and hold your hand. You are the best Dad someone could ever ask for. “Our time was robbed. I want more holidays with you, more laughs where your smile lights up the whole room, more ‘goodnight I love you SJ, I’ll see you in the morning’, more talks about how our days were and just to feel safe when you would hug me and you would let me know how proud you are of me and how much you love me. You haven’t died Dad, you’ve just moved to a different place, and that is in our heart. “️I love you forever, until we meet again.” ️ Brooke Warne statement “Dad, this doesn’t feel real and doesn’t make sense that you are not here with us anymore. It doesn’t feel right, you were taken away too soon and life is so cruel. I will forever cherish our final memories together laughing and joking around with each other. We were happy. We were so similar in so many ways and I always used to joke that I got your genes and about how much that annoyed me! Well now I couldn’t be happier and prouder that I have your genes.

There are several changes to the dead ball law, the most significant of which if either side is disadvantaged by a person, such as a pitch invader, an animal or other object within the field of play which has a material impact on the game.","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5985361/597d98535c41df91ce0ec514420300af1ca3f01b-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Worst pitch this century’: Historic Test ‘objectively worst game seen’ as Pakistan finish 4-728","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/australia-vs-pakistan-2022-first-cricket-test-worst-game-seen-rawalpindi-reaction-highlights-video-report-pat-cummins/news-story/85822fe4258b9b247b40fdac380c4d58","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"As the cricket world remembered the Ball of the Century over the past week, the Worst Pitch of the Century added its strongest contender to date.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-08 21:44:00","full_description":"As the cricket world remembered the Ball of the Century over the past week, the Worst Pitch of the Century added its strongest contender to date. At 0-252, Pakistan’s highest opening partnership against Australia, the captains shook hands. Their openers content to bat at nothing faster than a Sunday afternoon drive with the roof up pace, as they crawled along at 3.27 runs per over despite their advantageous position in the match. To be fair, it was an increase on the 2.93 runs per over that the side scored at in the first-innings, where Pakistan declared their innings at 4-476. But the feeling from everyone across the globe with the exception of Abdullah Shafique and Imam-Ul-Haq, who got down on their knees and kissed the Rawalpindi pitch after hitting centuries, and perhaps their teammates, who were denied a bat in the second innings, was one of missed opportunity and disappointment.

Photo: AFP Source: AFP A historic Test, the first between Australian and Pakistan in the subcontinent for 24 years, petered out as one of cricket’s most boring draws in memory. Australia, who made England’s line-up look like a collection of schoolboy cricketers brought together without once leaving the classroom, took four wickets across the Test while conceding 728 runs. Each wicket coming at 182 runs per wicket. It finished with Usman Khawaja, a man who dreamt of one day playing at the ground, rolling his arm over and social media quickly describing the occasion as “grim”. Almost since the first ball, there have been calls for the International Cricket Council to come down hard on the Rawalpindi pitch.

If it does, the venue will be handed three demerit points if categorised in that way. A venue is suspended from hosting international cricket for 12 months if it receives five demerit points in a five-year period. Nonetheless, there was widespread disappointment felt across the globe at the underwhelming match, which was as lifeless as the pitch showed.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Absolute joke': Cricket world rages over 'embarrassing' scenes","link":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/australia-pakistan-2022-cricket-world-rages-embarrassing-214313428.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-08 21:43:13","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/53bf58c0-9f28-11ec-b85f-ea91adfa5ef6","source_id":"yahoo","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Warne’s $1500 purchase hours before death","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/unlike-him-tailor-opens-up-on-shane-warnes-final-1500-purchase/news-story/d777704139b677912aecc2d047b7ea8e","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The tailor who sold Shane Warne new clothes just hours before his death says it was “unlike” the cricket legend to visit his shop during his stays in Thailand.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-08 21:41:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Unlike him’: Warne’s final $1500 detour","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/unlike-him-tailor-opens-up-on-shane-warnes-final-1500-purchase/news-story/d777704139b677912aecc2d047b7ea8e","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The tailor who sold Shane Warne new clothes just hours before his death says it was “unlike” the cricket to visit his shop during his stays in Thailand.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-08 21:19:00","full_description":"The tailor who sold Shane Warne new clothes just hours before his death says it was “unlike” the cricket legend to visit his shop during his stays in Thailand. But the Aussie champion, who died of “natural causes” on the island of Koh Samui, surprised Parsuram Panday of Brioni Tailors by paying him a visit on Friday. “It is unlike him to come out of the villa and travel to us. He likes to keep a low profile when he visits,” Mr Panday told Daily Mail Australia . Mr Panday told the publication Warne spent about an hour at the shop and bought five blazers, five pairs of shorts, five shirts and 10 pairs of trousers — an order worth approximately $1500. Warne reportedly last bought suits off Mr Panday back in 2019. “He did an even bigger order in 2019. So a great, great customer for me. Plus I am a big fan, of course,” he said. “Nice guy, he would fist bump me and dance around. “I love cricket and Shane Warne was a hero of mine. It was a privilege to make his suits.” Mr Panday had earlier said Warne was “buzzing with excitement” when he came to visit. “He said he was ready for a break because it had been a busy summer in Australia. He was looking forward to going out to the bars,” Mr Panday told The Sun . “When he came into the shop he was so happy, strong and full of life and energy. “He said, ‘Long time no see, Parsuram’ and laughed. He said, ‘It’s great to see you’ and he patted me on the back.” Warne died of a suspected heart attack on Friday night. He was found unresponsive in his room by a friend, who performed CPR, but he was unable to be saved. An autopsy at the Surat Thani Hospital found Warne died of natural causes, Thai police confirmed on Monday. Warne’s family and Australia’s ambassador to Thailand Allan McKinnon were informed of the result and accepted the finding, deputy national police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen said in a statement. “Today investigators received the autopsy result, in which the medical opinion is that the cause of death is natural,” Phathanacharoen said. “Investigators will summarise the autopsy result for prosecutors within the time frame of the law.” A private family funeral for the cricket legend is reportedly slated for the end of next week while a public memorial at the MCG is likely to be held on March 30, the Herald Sun reports. There is no confirmation yet on the exact date Warne’s body will be returned to Australia, though Thai officials are helping to speed up the process. “The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is assisting the family of Shane Warne with the return of his body to Australia,” DFAT said in a statement. “Owing to the family’s request for privacy, we will not be providing further comment.” The details of spin king Shane Warne’s public MCG memorial have been revealed, a chance to pay tribute to one of Australia’s sporting icons. The woman who entered a van in Thailand carrying Shane Warne’s body in a potential security breach has been identified. Shane Warne’s ex-fiancee Elizabeth Hurley has reached out to the cricket icon’s youngest daughter after his tragic death.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Warne state funeral penned for March 30","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/warne-state-funeral-penned-for-march-30/video/18e63a2cd65457686be05fab6e5995d3","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Shane Warne's state funeral has been scheduled for March 30th at the MCG, with his remains being flown from Thailand on a private jet.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-08 21:00:20","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Warne state funeral penned for March 30","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/warne-state-funeral-penned-for-march-30/video/18e63a2cd65457686be05fab6e5995d3","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Shane Warne's state funeral has been scheduled for March 30th at the MCG, with his remains being flown from Thailand on a private jet.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-08 21:00:20","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australian bowlers toil as first test against Pakistan ends in a draw","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/australian-bowlers-toil-as-first-test-against-pakistan-ends-in-a-draw/video/eab6affeee7d011b5c64735af33675d2","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: The First Test between Pakistan and Australia has petered out to a draw after the Aussie bowlers were forced to toil again on Day 5, with both Imam-ul-Haq and Abdullah Shafique going on to score centuries.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-08 21:00:20","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australian bowlers toil as first test against Pakistan ends in a draw","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/australian-bowlers-toil-as-first-test-against-pakistan-ends-in-a-draw/video/eab6affeee7d011b5c64735af33675d2","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: The First Test between Pakistan and Australia has petered out to a draw after the Aussie bowlers were forced to toil again on Day 5, with both Imam-ul-Haq and Abdullah Shafique going on to score centuries.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-08 21:00:20","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
