Cricket West Indies President Ricky Skerritt said they had lost a true giant of the region in the former right-arm off-break bowler, who had made an \"outstanding contribution\" to the sport. \"Sonny Ramadhin was one of the great pioneers of West Indies cricket,\" Skerritt said in a media release from Cricket West Indies on Sunday. \"Many stories are told of his tremendous feats on the 1950 tour when he combined with Alf Valentine to form cricket‚Äôs 'spin twins' as West Indies conquered England away from home for the first time. \"This iconic tour is part of our rich cricket legacy, which was pioneered by Mr. Ramadhin and others of his generation.\" (Reporting by Nick Said, editing by Pritha Sarkar)","image_url":null,"source_id":"channelnewsasia","country":["singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia too good for West Indies in World Cup warm-up","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-too-good-for-west-indies-in-world-cup-warmup/video/711e0acd0f77ea2ff154b1b82abf4184","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Australia proved far too strong for the West Indies, cruising to a 90-run win as the two sides prepare for the World Cup.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-27 21:09:21","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia too good for West Indies in World Cup warm-up","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-too-good-for-west-indies-in-world-cup-warmup/video/711e0acd0f77ea2ff154b1b82abf4184","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Australia proved far too strong for the West Indies, cruising to a 90-run win as the two sides prepare for the World Cup.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-27 21:09:21","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PSL 2022 Awards List: Full List of Best Batsman, Best Bowler, Player of the Tournament and other winners of PSL 7","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-psl-2022-awards-list-full-list-of-best-batsman-best-bowler-player-of-the-tournament-and-other-winners-of-psl-7/","keywords":["Cricket","Lahore Qalandars","Multan Sultans","Pakistan Super League","PSL 2022","PSL 7"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"PSL 2022 Awards List: The SportsRush brings for you a detailed list of award winners at the end of Pakistan Super League 7.

The first Test will be played at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua. The Test series will be a part of the ICC World Test Championship 2021-2023. Before the series, the visitors will face West Indies Cricket Board President XI in a four-day practice game at the Coolidge Cricket Ground in Antigua on March 1. England‚Äôs last Test assignment was the Ashes series against Australia, where they were beaten 4-0. After a hammering Down Under, it will be a big test for them to turn the tables around. Joe Root will continue to lead the side. James Anderson and Stuart Broad are major exclusions from the squad, so it will be interesting to see how they cope without the experienced duo. They will hope to start their preparations on a positive note, though. Meanwhile, Shane Dowrich will lead the West Indies Cricket Board President's XI. They have a relatively young squad, and will be eager to showcase their prowess against a Test playing nation. Jeremy Solozano, Raymon Reifer and Devon Thomas are ones to look forward to during the game. Match : West Indies Cricket Board President XI vs England, Four-day Practice Match, England tour of West Indies, 2022. Date and Time : March 01-04, 2022, Tuesday; 07:30 PM IST. Venue : Coolidge Cricket Ground, Antigua. The pitch at Coolidge Cricket Ground is conducive to new-ball bowlers, so batters will have to be patient early on. Expect the surface to stay throughout the course of the match. The temperature on matchday is expected to hover between 23 to 28 degrees Celsius. There is no chance of rain predicted in the next four days. Alick Athanaze, Jeremy Solozano, Keacy Carty, Sheyne Moseley, Raymon Reifer, Bryan Charles, Shane Dowrich (c & wk), Devon Thomas, Colin Archibald, Shermon Lewis, Preston McSween, Shamar Springer.

After making 129 in the first innings two days ago, Kunnummal made an unbeaten 106 off 87 balls to lead the way in acing a daunting chase of 214. After Gujarat's second innings ended at 264, Kunnummal got support from captain Sachin Baby (62 off 76 balls) to achieve six points for the win with a whirlwind chase. In the other match, Madhya Pradesh won by an innings and 301 runs against Meghalaya. Meghalaya were just out for 61 in the first innings, with Gourav Kumar taking 5/11. In response, Madhya Pradesh declared at a mammoth 499/6, thanks to centuries from Shubham Sharma (111), Akshat Raghuvanshi (100 not out) and 86 from Rajat Patidar. The side then bowled out Meghalaya for 137, with Anubhav Agarwal taking 5/38, ensuring a big win with a bonus point. Kerala and Madhya Pradesh have 13 points each in the group, with the latter ahead due to superior net run rate. The match between these two teams from March 3 will determine the topper of the Group.

Chasing 239, Hyderabad's overnight batter Tilak Varma made 90 to keep his side in the hunt.

In the other match at the Vikash Cricket Ground, Baroda took the first innings lead as their match against Chandigarh ended in a draw. The destiny of the match was sealed when Chandigarh were 168 all out in reply to a mammoth 517 from Baroda. Though Chandigarh made 473/7, it wasn't enough to deny Baroda three points.

The cornerstone of Rohit's captaincy has been security for the players and it's paying dividends with three back-to-back T20I series wins since he took over post T20 World Cup. \"We do understand at times that we've held back but it's important to tell the guys that you don't have to worry about your positions in the team. We want to fill whatever gaps we do have. We just want to move forward,\" Rohit said at the presentation ceremony after India beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the third T20I to sweep the series 3-0. Rohit understands that picking an XI based on so many good performances is a different challenge altogether. \"It's going to be a big challenge but it's nice to have guys in form rather than not in form. It's a factor of everything that comes together. We played together and we played very well. A lot of positives from this series.\" He was happy to give playing time to almost all the players during the last nine white ball matches -- six T20Is and three ODIs. \"That is something we've kept in mind - good to give opportunities to few of those guys. If the guys take the opportunity the way some of these guys have taken, you can move from strength to strength.\" Shreyas Iyer, who has scored 200-plus runs in the series, termed all his fifties special but the second one in big chase as extra special. \"Obviously, all three fifties were special for me. Yesterday, winning the series...so yeah the last one (2nd T20I),\" Shreyas said. For him, it just takes one ball to get into form. \"To be honest, you require just one ball to get in form. I'm really happy with whatever opportunities I got this series. Promoted \"To be honest, the wicket was a bit two-paced today and I was playing on merit and trying to punish the loose balls. You just have to back your instincts and be positive.\" Shreyas, who had a surgery last year, is now back at his best, having already made his Test debut. \"It has been a roller-coaster journey for me from injury. To come out of injury and perform at this level is really heartening for me.\"","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-02/ojtr4lno_rohit-sharma-bcci_625x300_27_February_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket - Red-hot Iyer secures India's T20 series sweep v Sri Lanka","link":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/cricket-red-hot-iyer-secures-indias-t20-series-sweep-v-sri-lanka-2523971","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-27 18:03:45","full_description":"NEW DELHI : India completed a 3-0 series sweep against Sri Lanka after Shreyas Iyer's third successive half-century secured a six-wicket victory in the final Twenty20 International in Dharamsala on Sunday. Opting to bat, Sri Lanka posted 146-5 with skipper Dasun Shanaka scoring more than half the runs with his unbeaten 74 off 38 balls. Iyer, who finished the series without being dismissed even once, smashed 73 not out as India returned to reach the victory target with 19 balls to spare. With the series already in the bag, the hosts rested four frontline players, including wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan who was struck on the head while batting in the second match on Saturday. Thanks to the depth in their squad, India joined Afghanistan and Romania as the countries to have won a record 12 consecutive Twenty20 Internationals. India's victory follows their 6-0 limited-overs romp against West Indies in the previous home series earlier this month. Sri Lanka captain Shanaka was left to rue his decision to bat after winning the toss as they lost both their openers in the first two overs and slumped to 60-5 in the 13th over. Shanaka counter-attacked in a spectacular fashion scoring nearly two-runs-a-ball taking to take the tourists near the 150-mark. India lost skipper Rohit Sharma early in their chase but Iyer once again anchored their chase as he and Ravindra Jadeja, who made 22 not out, guided India home. The neighbours will now clash in a two-test series beginning in Mohali on Mar. 4.

After being outplayed for two days, New Zealand held a glimmer of hope that they could salvage the second Test as they reduced South Africa to 140 for five at stumps on day three. It gave the Proteas a lead of 211 with five wickets remaining after posting 364 in their first innings and then bowling New Zealand out for 293. South Africa dominated the first two days but Sunday belonged to New Zealand after they were rescued from 91 for five by a 133-run stand between Colin de Grandhomme and Daryl Mitchell on the docile wicket. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) Right then, that is all we have from Day 3 of this Test match! The match is evenly poised with South Africa slightly ahead and Day 4 promises to be as thrilling and fascinating as Day 3 if not more. The first ball of Day 4 will be bowled at 3.30 am IST (10 pm GMT, previous day). But as you all know, our buildup will begin in advance so make sure you tune in early. Until then, take care and goodbye! New Zealand were looking down and out yesterday when five wickets fell in quick succession. However, the partnership that started on Day 2, blossomed further on Day 3 and in the end, they managed to bring down the deficit to 71. Then, they came out with more discipline and fire in the second innings with the ball and have taken five wickets now to keep themselves in the game. If they manage to put in a strong performance in the first session of Day 4, then this game might go right down to the wire. The South African batters have shown some discipline that is required against a quality bowling lineup but they will be disappointed that no batter has been able to kick on after getting a start. The partnership between Bavuma and Rassie van der Dussen was especially a productive one and South Africa need one more big partnership to take this game to a position where they can control things more prominently. Earlier in the day, their bowlers did well to restrict New Zealand to 293 with Rabada notching up a five-wicket haul and it will be interesting to see how much more their batters can score as we move towards Day 4 of this Test match. Another fascinating session and credit should be given to both the teams for their resolve and discipline throughout this Test match. The visitors though would go into the fourth day with their noses ahead but New Zealand have done well in this session and throughout this day to get back into this game. They have taken two wickets in this session but the good thing is that they have kept the scoring rate in check. The lead is now 211 and if they are able to get 100 more on Day 4, it will get quite tough for the Kiwis in the final innings to chase it down. Shorter in length, outside off. Kyle Verreynne rocks back and cuts it towards point but not in the gap. A maiden over from Colin de Grandhomme! That will be STUMPS on Day 3! Pitches it up, around off. Kyle Verreynne prods and blocks it out. Short of a length, outside off. Kyle Verreynne hops in his crease and punches it towards the extra cover fielder. Back of a length, around off. Kyle Verreynne stays back and taps it to the off side. A full ball, outside off. Kyle Verreynne lunges forward and drives it to the man at extra cover. Good-length ball, on off. Kyle Verreynne prods and pushes it towards cover. A rare full toss, outside off. Kyle Verreynne drives it without much timing wide of mid off and takes a run. On a length and outside off. Kyle Verreynne lets it through to the keeper. A short ball, outside off. Wiaan Mulder looks to pull but is way too early in his shot. It goes off the bottom half of the blade towards deep square leg for a single. Good-length delivery, around off. Wiaan Mulder gets forward and defends it solidly. A full ball, outside off. Wiaan Mulder drives but straight to the mid off fielder. On a length, around middle. Wiaan Mulder gets behind the line of the ball and blocks it. FOUR! Nicely done! A welcome boundary for South Africa! Slightly shorter in length and outside off. Kyle Verreynne stays back, opens the bat face and caresses it through the backward point region for a boundary. Short of a length, angling in from middle. Kyle Verreynne turns it towards mid-wicket. Good-length delivery, around middle. Kyle Verreynne defends it on the leg side. A length ball, angling down leg. Kyle Verreynne misses his flick yet again.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-02/khhqt82g_nz-afp_625x300_27_February_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Sri Lanka 3rd T20I: Shreyas Iyer's third fifty in a row hands India 3-0 series sweep against Sri - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMizAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9zcmktbGFua2EtaW4taW5kaWEvaW5kaWEtdnMtc3JpLWxhbmthLTNyZC10MjBpLXNocmV5YXMtaXllcnMtdGhpcmQtZmlmdHktaW4tYS1yb3ctaGFuZHMtaW5kaWEtMy0wLXNlcmllcy1zd2VlcC1hZ2FpbnN0LXNyaS1sYW5rYS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84OTg3NzM3NC5jbXPSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Sri Lanka 3rd T20I: Shreyas Iyer's third fifty in a row hands India 3-0 series sweep against Sri¬†¬†Times of IndiaRecent Match Report - Sri Lanka vs India 3rd T20I 2021/22¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoIndia vs Sri Lanka Prediction- Sri Lanka Tour of India 2022, 3rd T20I¬†¬†Cricket AddictorIndia v Sri Lanka | 2nd T20I | Review¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreRout map to a world record¬†¬†The Indian ExpressView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-27 17:34:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India's 'Super Subs' ensure clean sweep against Sri Lanka","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/indias-super-subs-ensure-clean-sweep-against-sri-lanka-373637","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Dharamsala, February 27Making full use of the opportunities, Shreyas Iyer was breathing down Suryakumar Yadav's neck as India completed a clean sweep with consummate ease, beating Sri Lanka by six wickets in the third and final T20 International here on Sunday.

India have registered their seventh T20I series victory against Sri Lanka by winning the third T20I by 6 wickets in Dharamsala tonight. In what is their fourth T20I series victory against Sri Lanka at home, it is the second time when they have whitewashed this opposition in a three-match T20I series. In spite of playing with a batter short, India convincingly sealed a 147-run target with 19 balls to spare. Batter Shreyas Iyer (73*) and all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja (22*) joined hands for the second consecutive time to put together a match-winning 45-run partnership for the fifth wicket. In what was Iyer‚Äôs third consecutive T20I half-century, his sixth in this format played a pivotal role behind pushing India to a victory on Sunday. Iyer, who hit nine fours and a six in total on Sunday, reached the 50-run mark by hitting a maximum off Sri Lanka spinner Jeffrey Vandersay. One batter less still chasing the score easily.

Live action will begin at 9.30 am IST (4 am GMT) but our coverage will begin much sooner. Do join us then. Take care and goodbye! Done and dusted with the presentation ceremony and it's now time for the series-winning skipper, Rohit Sharma to lift the trophy. The Indian team is seen rejoicing and posing for a team photo. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma says that they played collectively as a team and played well and he is happy about that. He adds that they always look to test the bench strength whenever there's an opportunity. Mentions that he knows that at times they have held themselves back when it comes to T20I cricket but they just need to back their players and don't worry about their position in the team and they are just looking to fill the gaps that they have. Also mentions that it's always nice to have more and more players in form and they want to move from strength to strength. Ends by saying that they will start thinking about the Test matches once they reach Mohali. Shreyas Iyer wins the Man of the Match award for this game. He is also adjudged as the Man of the Series for his exceptional effort with the blade in all three matches. He is in for a chat. He says, all the three innings were special for him but he would say the knock of the second game holds a special place in his heart. Mentions, when you hit the balls really well, it just comes down to enjoying the time in the middle. Adds, he wanted to dominate from the start but he backed his instincts and stayed positive throughout. Says, the comeback is pretty hard to be honest and the real test comes during the rehabilitation stage. Ends by saying he is glad to perform so well for the country. Dasun Shanaka, the skipper of Sri Lanka, is in for a chat. He starts by congratulating the Indian side for an incredible performance. Hopes his injury is nothing serious. Mentions, without some senior players we struggled to adapt to the conditions. Adds the pace attack was brilliant throughout but says it is more about the control of the game. Says, the side needs to adapt to the conditions quickly in the future series. The Presentation Ceremony... Ravindra Jadeja is down for a chat. He says it is not new to not bowl during the innings, he has done the same in the Indian T20 League. Mentions, Sharma wanted to give the young spinners some opportunity and hence he did not bowl. Avesh Khan joins the chat and says all he aimed was to keep good lines and lengths. He hopes he can deliver at the same level consistently. The visitors finished with a flourish with the bat but never had enough runs on the board. Dushmantha Chameera did give them a good start but the pacers didn't really make great use of the new ball, unlike their counterparts. Once Iyer and Samson got going, the game slipped away from Sri Lanka. A couple of injuries dented their chances further and the skipper didn't even take the field once he went off. Lahiru Kumara did come back and picked up a couple of quick wickets but by that time the game had already been lost. In the end, the visitors were outmuscled and they have a lot to ponder upon after another series loss. With over 180 being chased last night without breaking a sweat, chasing a score of under 150 seemed way too easy for India given the form their batters have been in of late. The skipper though perished early tonight and looked just a bit fidgety. Shreyas Iyer though was just sublime yet again. He was well supported early on by Sanju Samson but a few wickets did fall at regular intervals. Iyer held the fort and together with Jadeja saw the team home over the line yet again. Iyer ended up with 73 not out and also remained unbeaten throughout the series. What a special series for him! Done and dusted! India have made it 12 wins in a row in T20I matches and have equalled Afghanistan's record. The hosts also whitewash Sri Lanka to make it three whitewashes in a row and will remain as the number 1 ranked T20I side in the world. The visitors, on the other hand, will be very disappointed with their effort tonight. 16.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Beautiful shot. Shreyas Iyer scores the finishing runs. Full length, on the pads.

India need 149 runs to make it 3-0. India were off to a flying start with the ball. Their opening bowling pair of Avesh Khan and Mohammed Siraj kept them on top of the proceedings. This Sri Lankan innings was no where near the last game, barring Dasun Shanaka. The skipper truly played a captain's knock and did really well to steady the ship. Sri Lanka were off to a catastrophic start as they were reeling at 29/4. It looked like Sri Lanka would get budled out under the 100-run mark. But Dasun Shanaka clearly had other ideas. The skipper was the back bone of the innings with his 74 off 38 balls. He has given his bowlers something to fight for. India had Sri Lanka by the scruff off the neck, but it was Dasun Shanaka's late revival that helped Sri Lanka to avoid an embarrassing total. India would be extremely gutted to see Sri Lanka end with 146 runs on the board.

Slower delivery, full and close to the off pole. Dasun Shanaka looks to smoke it over the long on fence but gets undone by the lack of pace.

The most expensive over by an Indian bowler in this innings. 15.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR BYES! Out of everybody's reach! Back of a length, on off, it flies off the deck. Chamika Karunaratne leaves it alone. Sanju Samson leaps behind the sticks but is unable to collect the ball. It races away to the fine leg fence. 15.4 overs (1 Run) Length ball, on leg.

Ravindra Jadeja is in for a quick chat. Jadeja says that he is very happy to be back after two months and is also happy to bat wherever the team requires him to. He adds that he practiced at the NCA in Bangalore and got enough time to recover. When he was recovering, mentally he was always trying to stay focused on his return. Mentions that even when he was injured, he kept running in order to stay in shape and then slowly and steadily got better. India captain, Rohit Sharma says that they wanted to bowl first as well and want to keep challenging themselves as a team. He adds that Ishan has been ruled out and they do not want to take any chances. Alongside him, Bhuvi, Bumrah and Chahal all go out. Bishnoi, Kuldeep, Avesh and Siraj come in tonight. On being India's most capped T20I player he says that it's always a beautiful feeling representing your country and will look to do his best. Dasun Shanaka, the Sri Lankan skipper, is for a chat. He says, they will bat first. It looks like the conditions are good to bat on. Mentions, there are a couple of changes to their side and will look to end the series with a win. Sri Lanka (Playing XI) - Pathum Nissanka, Danushka Gunathilaka, Charith Asalanka, Dinesh Chandimal (WK), Janith Liyanage (In for Praveen Jayawickrama), Dasun Shanaka (C), Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Jeffrey Vandersay (In for Kamil Mishara), Binura Fernando and Lahiru Kumara. India (Playing XI) - Rohit Sharma (C), Venkatesh Iyer, Shreyas Iyer, Sanju Samson (WK), Deepak Hooda, Ravindra Jadeja, Harshal Patel, Kuldeep Yadav (In for Ishan Kishan), Mohammed Siraj (In for Bhuvneshwar Kumar), Avesh Khan (In for Jasprit Bumrah) and Ravi Bishnoi (In for Yuzvendra Chahal). TOSS - Up goes the flip of the coin and it lands in favour of Sri Lanka and they will have a BAT first. PITCH REPORT - Deepdas Gupta is alongside Rusell Arnold. DDS says that the pitch is a different one and hence the dimensions change as well. Arnold says there's less grass on this pitch but it is still hard and there are a few areas on which if the ball pitches, the batters might be troubled. It is a bit dry so the spinners will have a better day than yesterday. DDS adds that the pacers will still get a lot of bounce and 180 is what the side batting first will be looking for. Sri Lankan batters did showcase their aggressive hitting with the blade once they got their eye in. It wasn't a lone-fought battle, unlike the first game and Sri Lanka will expect the batters to keep up the good work. We might see some changes in the bowling department though, as the visitors still hunt for their deadly mix. An exciting contest awaits. Stay tuned for the toss. In the recent games, the Indian middle-order has been going bonkers and racking up runs at a brisk rate. The camp would hope the batters continue on their merry way and provide a helping hand in completing the whitewash. The bowling though needs an improvement from the last match as the Indian bowlers leaked a lot of runs at the death. Hello and a warm welcome to the third T20I game between India and Sri Lanka. This is the final game of the series with India having sealed it with 2-0. Will the hosts continue their dominance? Or will the visitors be able to take away a consolation win? We shall find out soon. ...

During the third T20I of the ongoing Sri Lanka‚Äôs tour of India in Dharamsala, Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka has won the toss and chose to bat in a dead-rubber. Having lost the first two T20Is, Shanaka laid emphasis on playing for pride tonight. ‚ÄúWe will bat first, a very good wicket, the conditions are really good. We want to win at least one game for pride, a good opportunity for our boys,‚Äù Shanaka told Star Sports at the toss. Talking about a couple of changes made to their Playing XI, Shanaka confirmed leaving out batter Kamil Mishara and spinner Praveen Jayawickrama for this match. ‚ÄúTwo changes for us ‚Äì Praveen Jayawickrama and Kamil Mishara are out. Janith Liyanage and Jeffrey Vandersay are in,‚Äù Shanaka said. Why is Jasprit Bumrah not playing 3rd T20I vs Sri Lanka? India captain Rohit Sharma, who wanted to field first again tonight, was contended with Shanaka‚Äôs decision at the toss. Playing his 125th T20I, readers must note that Sharma has become the most capped T20I player. As far as the changes for the hosts are concerned, India have left out wicket-keeper batter Ishan Kishan, fast bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah and spinner Yuzvendra Chahal. While Kishan is out due to an injury, the bowling trio has been rested to provide more opportunities to reserve players.

Want to keep challenging to get better as a team, every opportunity counts. Ishan [Kishan] is ruled out and wasn‚Äôt feeling great last night. [Jasprit] Bumrah, Bhuvi [Bhuvneshwar Kumar] and [Yuzvendra] Chahal are all rested. ‚Äú[Ravi] Bishnoi, Kuldeep [Yadav], Avesh [Khan] and [Mohammed] Siraj are in. It‚Äôs a great feeling representing your country in 125 T20Is, feels good, look to continue playing for many more years,‚Äù Sharma mentioned. Having included multiple bowling options including an extra spinner as Kishan‚Äôs replacement, Sharma has enough resources to manage in the first innings at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium tonight. With the team management not having a debut to Mayank Agarwal, one out of Sanju Samson or Venkatesh Iyer will open the batting with Sharma in this match.
