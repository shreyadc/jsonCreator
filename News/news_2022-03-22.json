While a franchise T20 league’s popularity rests almost entirely on a few selected big superstars of the game, very few like a Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) has its fan base, courtesy of a certain Bollywood star actor Shah Rukh Khan. Khan, who happens to be the co-owner of KKR, is one of the most respected name in the Bollywood industry, both as an actor and a person, with a fan base surpassing the country’s geographical boundary. However, on a certain night of May 16, 2012, post the culmination of 65th match of the IPL that season, Khan got himself tangled in a rather ugly scuffle at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium, which led to him facing a ban from entering the iconic venue. Wankhede Stadium Shahrukh incident Post KKR’s 32-run victory against Mumbai Indians (MI) in the match, Shah Rukh Khan got engaged in an aggressive scuffle, involving an alleged use of expletives directed at the security guards. As per Khan, who was present at the stadium to pick up a large group of his children and their friends, he saw security guards physically manhandling them ‘in the name of security’. A visibly angry Shah Rukh, then got himself involved in a brawl with the security officials, with the latter claiming that the Bollywood star was in fact drunk and even abused a woman present there. Both the claims were, however, later vehemently denied by Khan. “I said a few things in anger. I was one and they were 20-25 officials and they were extremely rude. When I tried to answer them, they hid behind others,” the actor said. “There was nothing illegal, I was not on the pitch. I know the rules, exclaimed Khan after the incident. Post the incident, the MCA (Mumbai Cricket Association) officials lodged a complaint against him at the Marine Drive police station. Shah Rukh Khan gets banned from entering Wankhede Stadium for 5 years As a result of the scuffle, the MCA banned the KKR co-owner from entering the stadium for a period of five years. “The MCA managing committee is forced to ban Shah Rukh Khan from entering Wankhede Stadium for a period of five years,” Vilasrao Deshmukh, the MCA president, had said in Mumbai. Khan served the ban faithfully until the MCA lifted it almost three years later in the year 2015. The entire matter was officially closed only in 2019, after Mumbai police had also booked SRK under the Juvenile Justice Act for using expletives before children in the vicinity during the scuffle. But, thanks to the metropolitan magistrate’s demand for want of further evidence, Khan’s case was finally closed.

However, they were not able to upstage the Aussies and lost the match in the last over.

Bangladesh Women are playing only their maiden ODI World Cup and in that, they have surprised all by the kind of performances they have given. They lost to West Indies by only 4 runs in their last encounter while they have already betw3an Pakistan, the two teams against which India have won comprehensively. Even against South Africa and New Zealand Bangladesh have done well and their bowling has been superb. Thus India by no means can take their easter neighbours easily and if they dare to do so, then they must remember what their male counterparts suffered when they played against Bangladesh, then the minnows in the 2007 Men's ODI World Cup.

Ashwin practising in the Royals colours in Mumbai ahead of IPL 2022. | Photo Credit: RAJASTHAN ROYALS After helping India win yet another Test series, and becoming the country’s second highest wicket-taker in the format, R. Ashwin is ready for the IPL, in which he will turn out for a new team this season. After his two-year stint with Delhi Capitals, the off-spinner has joined Rajasthan Royals. He believes he has something in common with the Jaipur-based franchise. “The Royals, for me, are a team that just resonates immediately,” Ashwin said. “For me, they’ve been a different team — always ahead of their time with regard to their planning and approach. They’re very bold and experimental in the way they approach their cricket, which is also the way in which I see my game, so it should be a good synchronisation and I’m looking forward to it.” Ashwin said the IPL had contributed to his development as a cricketer. “The IPL gives a window of experimentation, something which has enabled me to come out a richer cricketer, irrespective of the results, every time I’ve been a part of it,” he said. He said the IPL was a tough tournament. “There are a lot of variables leading into every season which can have an impact,” he said. “Dew, pitches, the opposition, you name it and there’s a variable that can impact a game in different ways, which makes it a challenge to prepare for things in advance and you’ve got to be ready at all times.” He regards Royals captain Sanju Samson highly. “I think Sanju has got an amazing attitude and a good head on his shoulders,” Ashwin said. “He’s always open for discussion, open to opinions around the game, so that’s a great quality to have.” About his recent feat in Test cricket, he said it was humbling to look at what he did in terms of numbers. “The more I’ve played, the more it’s felt like the numbers are a part of the journey rather than the destination,” he said. “In the past two-three years especially, the feeling has been great, with series wins in Australia, the comeback into the T20 team, it almost feels like how I felt when I first broke into the team, wherein a lot has been going on for me.” Our code of editorial values Printable version | Mar 21, 2022 8:18:20 pm | https://www.thehindu.com/sport/royals-a-team-that-resonates-immediately-ashwin/article65245931.ece © THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, PNG vs Nepal: Probable XIs, Match Prediction, Pitch Report, Weather Forecast and Live Streaming Details","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/icc-cricket-world-cup-league-2-png-vs-nepal-probable-xis-match-prediction-pitch-report-weather-forecast-live-streaming-details?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Sports4All Cricket"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-21 13:22:42","full_description":"PNG will square off against Nepal in the 72nd match of the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 2019-23. The Dubai International Cricket Stadium will host this potentially exciting contest on Tuesday. PNG, led by Assad Vala , lost 14 games in a row to start their campaign. But on Saturday, March 19, they snapped their losing streak with a six-wicket win over the United Arab Emirates (UAE). After electing to bat first, UAE could only manage to score 147 despite Rohan Mustafa ’s 88-run knock. While Alei Nao picked up four wickets, Chad Soper accounted for three scalps. Riley Hekure also got two important wickets. Thereafter, PNG tracked down the target in 36.2 overs. Skipper Vala’s unbeaten 97-ball knock off 68 balls helped his team win the game comfortably. Nepal, led by Sandeep Lamichhane, meanwhile, are placed sixth in the table with 10 points from 11 matches. They will go into the game after a 99-run loss at the hands of the UAE on Monday, March 21. After being asked to bat, the UAE put up a respectable score of 202 for nine on the board. Mustafa top-scored for them with a 73-ball 60 before being dismissed by Sompal Kami . Nepal found themselves in all sorts of trouble in their run-chase after losing wickets at regular intervals. Lamichhane and Co. were eventually bowled out for 103 in 35.1 overs. Match : UAE vs PNG, Match 72, ICC Cricket World Cup League 2019-23 Date and Time : March 22, 2022, Tuesday, 11:00 AM IST Venue : Dubai International Cricket Stadium, Dubai The pitch in Dubai has been a decent one for batting, but bowlers have also had their say. The pacers will get the advantage off the surface. Winning the toss and fielding first should be the way forward for teams. Playing conditions will be hot with temperatures around the 29-degree Celsius mark. Players need to stay hydrated to survive the heat of Dubai. The humidity will be in the 30s.

At the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Jharkhand’s young wicket-keeper batter punished Nagaland's bowlers in their Ranji Trophy pre-quarterfinal clash (March 12-March 16). At 17 years and 141 days, Kushagra hit 266 in the first innings and his effort took him past Pakistani legend Javed Miandad in the first-class record books. Miandad had notched up his 250-plus score when he was 17 years and 311 days old in 1975. Incidentally, Miandad went on to score 311 in the match and remains on top as the youngest batter to hit a first-class triple century. Asked about his feat, Kushagra told Sportstar over a video interaction, \"I was unaware of the record until my teammates informed me. I felt extremely pleased with myself.\" READ: Ranji Trophy offers brief respite for run-hungry Ankit Kalsi Like many, he too devours cricket videos, including Miandad's. “I do watch and observe his (Miandad's) batting through YouTube videos. I try picking up good aspects and incorporate them.\" Coming from the state that has given India MS Dhoni and Ishan Kishan, Kushagra is eager to grab his chances. Journey “In 2016, I played for Jharkhand in the Vijay Merchant Trophy, which was my first taste of state-level cricket. My father, Shashikant, has been my coach since I was a child. Even though we did not have a large house, he would help me practise in our flat's hall. He hung photographs of cricketers in my room and urged me to continue playing the sport,” said Kushagra. He was a part of the Indian team in the 2020 U-19 World Cup in South Africa, where he featured in only one game in which he returned unbeaten on 13 against Japan. It took him another year to break into Jharkhand's senior teams. READ: Ranji Trophy: Kanwaljit Singh, the man behind Nagaland's success The start to his red-ball senior career for Jharkhand did not go as he would have liked. “I twisted my ankle in a practice session before the first group match against Chhattisgarh and missed the game. I was disappointed because I had been looking forward to this opportunity for a long time. I had that inner voice nagging me to perform and scored a few runs against Tamil Nadu, which gave me the confidence. Against Nagaland, I went out and scored freely without any self-doubt since I was in a good frame of mind,\" he said. The Jamshedpur youngster believes his passion and honesty have contributed to his game evolving. \"My father used to drive me to a cricket academy when I was six years old. I was too young to be enrolled in the academy. I would watch others play as no one was willing to allow me to play. My father's encouragement has helped me.” Jharkhand's staggering 1000 Kushagra's temperament was full on display during Jharkhand's thumping success over Nagaland. His knock lifted Jharkhand to become the first team ever to aggregate a 1000-plus lead over its opposition across two innings in the pre-quarters. ALSO READ: Ranji Trophy 2022: Jharkhand records third-highest match aggregate by a team in first-class history When asked about Jharkhand's approach to continue batting despite a massive lead, Kushagra said, “There was no predefined strategy when we went to bat first to set a target of 1000 or more runs. The Eden Gardens pitch was good for batting, and we did not want to declare our innings as our batters did not have much opportunity to bat in the previous matches.” Continuing the wicketkeeping trade Kushagra focuses on reading the pitch and conveying his insights to the captain. His role model is no surprise. \"A leader who has won World Cups and numerous matches for India. MS Dhoni is a source of inspiration for everyone, even those who don't play cricket. Dhoni has been my hero since I was a child. My father has many stories about him. As I grew older, I began to idolise him.” Kushagra loves the longer format and will be back to the grind for the quarterfinal. \"The team and management opted to celebrate Holi first. After a 10-day break, we regroup with the same energy and intensity,\" he said.","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Taskin Ahmed IPL 2022: Will Taskin Ahmed replace Mark Wood at Lucknow Super Giants?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-taskin-ahmed-ipl-2022-will-taskin-ahmed-replace-mark-wood-at-lucknow-super-giants/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","LSG","Lucknow Super Giants"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Taskin Ahmed IPL 2022: Lucknow Super Giants are aiming to replace Mark Wood, and Gautam Gambhir wants Taskin Ahmed for the job.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board have confirmed that they will not give the NOC to Taskin Ahmed to take part in the IPL. BCB cricket operation chairman Jalal Yunus has confirmed the update and said that Taskin Ahmed has also agreed with the decision. “Since we have two important series like the ongoing home tour of South Africa and the home series against India, we feel it won’t be right for him to take part in the IPL,” reported Cricbuzz.

Mithali Raj, at 38, continues to be one of India's batting linchpins. The seasoned batter slammed three consecutive half-centuries against England in the one-day series in 2021. Though India lost the three-match series 2-1, Mithali stood out, reeling off 72 and 59 in the initial matches, before leading India's chase of 220 in the last game with an unbeaten 75. She was captain of the Indian team in the Tests against both England and Australia, which ended in a draw. In 2021, Mithali became the leading run-getter in women's international cricket, going past Charlotte Edwards's 10,273 runs, making Raj one of only two players to scale the 10,000-run mark in women's international cricket. Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar, former India hockey captain M. M. Somaya, chess great Viswanathan Anand, former India football skipper Bhaichung Bhutia and Olympians Anjali Bhagwat and Aparna Popat are the members of the Sportstar Aces 2022 jury.","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL tickets available date: IPL 2022 tickets Mumbai online booking start date","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ipl-tickets-available-date-ipl-2022-tickets-mumbai-online-booking-start-date/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Indian Premier League"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"2022 IPL tickets available date: The ticket window for Indian Premier League 2022 is yet to open for the general public.
