But then if the quality is not good in your fast-bowling attack. If you think the guys are older, they are not as quick as they used to be, and the form is a little doubtful, then you play that second spinner because Ashwin is quality, as is Jadeja,\" Shastri said. According to Shastri, the option is there for India to select Ashwin as the only specialist spinner and use Jadeja to bat at No 6 should the pitch at The Oval look like it will offer some turn during the later stages. \"If the track is hard and dry, you would want two spinners to play for sure,\" Shastri said. \"I think it goes a lot with the weather in England. I believe it's sunny now at the moment, but you know, English weather, how it can change in June. \"So there's a very good chance India will go with two spinners, two fast bowlers, and an all-rounder. That will be the combination. And then there'll be five batsmen and the wicket-keeper, so six batsmen. “So if all conditions stay normal at The Oval, then this would be my combination, but you've got to have the quality to be able to put those guys out in the park.” When it comes to batting, will become an automatic choice to partner skipper at the top in the absence of the injured . and will play at No 3 and No 4 respectively. On the other hand, is to make a return to a No 5 spot. Excited about the return of Rahane, Shastri said he has earned a place in the squad. \"The way he's (Rahane) timed the ball, the way he's looking at T20 from a different perspective. He's not looking at the number of runs, he's looking at the number of balls he's playing against that. What is the strike rate with those number of balls he's played, which is good and which augurs well,” Shastri said about Rahane. \"It just goes to show (what happens) when you go through the grind, you go back to domestic cricket. He's earned his place in that World Test Championship side. Now you'll have to see closer to the event what the final XI will be.\" In his choice of playing XI, Shastri has picked keeper-batter Kona Bharat ahead of Ishan Kishan. Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, , KS Bharat (wk), Shardul Thakur, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammad Shami and Mohammed Siraj.","pubDate":"2023-05-24 18:14:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cut the B.S: Every WA sports team needs a star to draw a crowd - and the Force just got theirs in Nic White","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/opinion/cut-the-bs-every-wa-sports-team-needs-a-star-to-draw-a-crowd-and-the-force-just-got-theirs-in-nic-white-c-10647656","keywords":null,"creator":["Ben Smith"],"video_url":null,"description":"In the super-saturated sports market that is Perth, you need a consistent winning record or a big-name player (or ideally both) to achieve cut-through - the Force may have just got theirs in Nic White.","content":"When the Western Force announced the capture of prized Wallabies scrum-half Nic White, the club’s chief executive Tony Lewis fronted the media the same day to spruik one of their biggest signings in history. It may not be Matt Giteau arriving in town in 2007, but the arrival of White is a huge coup for the Force. When it comes to recognisable Wallabies, White — with his trademark moustache — is most likely the one the average fan would find it easiest to pick out of a line-up. He is competitive, he is provocative (Lewis descried him as “chatty”), he gets the people going, but he is also a trusted leader in the Wallabies’ locker room. When Lewis and director of rugby Matt Hodgson took to the podium to espouse the virtues of signing White, his leadership credentials were brought up, but Lewis also spoke about what White brought from an off-the-field point of view. “We’re looking forward to him being chatty, being the face of rugby in WA. We really want to grow the game here and he’ll offer us that opportunity to use him and his profile to get more boys and girls playing,” he said. “If you’re an AFL player, you have multiple people in the State that you can look up to who are All-Australians, if you’re a cricketer, you have the Marsh brothers, there’s multiple players who have played for Australia.” Both Lewis and Force coach Simon Cron have spoken about the need to grow the game within WA and in the super-saturated sports market that is Perth, you need a consistent winning record or a big-name player (or ideally both) to achieve cut-through. In a sports-mad city where there are as many professional teams as sunny days, people only have so much time and money, and clubs need to have not just their curiosity, but their attention too. Years of winning will build you an army of followers (see West Coast Eagles and Perth Wildcats) but celebrity status has tangible pulling power. West Coast have always had big names — Ben Cousins, Chris Judd, Nic Naitanui, Josh Kennedy et al. — and Fremantle have had megastars such as Matthew Pavlich and Nat Fyfe over the past two decades. The Perth Wildcats have Bryce Cotton currently, and before him had Shawn Redhage, Ricky Grace and a host of other stars; WA Cricket can point to Cam Green and Mitch Marsh and previously had Shaun Marsh, Adam Gilchrist and Justin Langer, while the West Coast fever currently have Courtney Bruce and Jhaniele Fowler. Perth Glory had Diego Castro, and further afield, the round ball game has greatly benefited from local product Sam Kerr, who is about to captain her country at a home World Cup and one of the most recognisable stars in world football. The Force have had a lot of good players, but the last one to have any sort of serious mainstream cut-through was human headline and walking quote machine Nick Cummins. Tom Robertson was their only player to be named in Eddie Jones’ inaugural Wallaby squad, while star lock Izack Rodda has spent all season on the sidelines with a foot injury. The Force’s attendances have consistently cracked 6000 this season, but are yet to threaten 10,000 but they’ve proved in years past they can draw a crowd. There is appetite for the code at both grassroots and the top level, best evidenced by the three Wallabies Tests at Optus Stadium drawing crowds of 61,241 — a venue record, 52,724 and 47,668. While the marquee matches may speak more to the average Perth punter’s love of big-ticket game, clearly there is support for rugby union. The trick is how to convert them into regular Force fans. The signing of White will undoubtedly help the Force on-field, but it gives them a chance to win over the off-field neutrals too.","pubDate":"2023-05-24 18:00:00","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-10647656/01cec4d66d27fe7718e83468b2350b82a103fabb-16x9-x0y1411w2000h1125.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shanaka’s selection a ’strange one’, Manjrekar says after Gujarat’s loss to Super Kings","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Shanaka’s-selection-a-’strange-one’--Manjrekar-says-after-Gujarat’s-loss-to-Super-Kings/108-259791","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar questioned the Gujarat Titan’s decision to select Dasun Shanaka over Matthew Wade for Qualifier 1 against the Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday, which the Titans lost by 15 runs.","content":"Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar questioned the Gujarat Titan's decision to select Dasun Shanaka over Matthew Wade for Qualifier 1 against the Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday, which the Titans lost by 15 runs.

But then if the quality is not good in your fast-bowling attack. If you think the guys are older, they are not as quick as they used to be, and the form is a little doubtful, then you play that second spinner because Ashwin is quality, as is Jadeja,\" Shastri said. According to Shastri, the option is there for India to select Ashwin as the only specialist spinner and use Jadeja to bat at No 6 should the pitch at The Oval look like it will offer some turn during the later stages. \"If the track is hard and dry, you would want two spinners to play for sure,\" Shastri said. \"I think it goes a lot with the weather in England. I believe it's sunny now at the moment, but you know, English weather, how it can change in June. \"So there's a very good chance India will go with two spinners, two fast bowlers, and an all-rounder. That will be the combination. And then there'll be five batsmen and the wicket-keeper, so six batsmen. “So if all conditions stay normal at The Oval, then this would be my combination, but you've got to have the quality to be able to put those guys out in the park.” When it comes to batting, will become an automatic choice to partner skipper at the top in the absence of the injured . and will play at No 3 and No 4 respectively. On the other hand, is to make a return to a No 5 spot. Excited about the return of Rahane, Shastri said he has earned a place in the squad. \"The way he's (Rahane) timed the ball, the way he's looking at T20 from a different perspective. He's not looking at the number of runs, he's looking at the number of balls he's playing against that. What is the strike rate with those number of balls he's played, which is good and which augurs well,” Shastri said about Rahane. \"It just goes to show (what happens) when you go through the grind, you go back to domestic cricket. He's earned his place in that World Test Championship side. Now you'll have to see closer to the event what the final XI will be.\" In his choice of playing XI, Shastri has picked keeper-batter Kona Bharat ahead of Ishan Kishan. Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, , KS Bharat (wk), Shardul Thakur, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammad Shami and Mohammed Siraj.","pubDate":"2023-05-24 18:14:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cut the B.S: Every WA sports team needs a star to draw a crowd - and the Force just got theirs in Nic White","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/opinion/cut-the-bs-every-wa-sports-team-needs-a-star-to-draw-a-crowd-and-the-force-just-got-theirs-in-nic-white-c-10647656","keywords":null,"creator":["Ben Smith"],"video_url":null,"description":"In the super-saturated sports market that is Perth, you need a consistent winning record or a big-name player (or ideally both) to achieve cut-through - the Force may have just got theirs in Nic White.","content":"When the Western Force announced the capture of prized Wallabies scrum-half Nic White, the club’s chief executive Tony Lewis fronted the media the same day to spruik one of their biggest signings in history. It may not be Matt Giteau arriving in town in 2007, but the arrival of White is a huge coup for the Force. When it comes to recognisable Wallabies, White — with his trademark moustache — is most likely the one the average fan would find it easiest to pick out of a line-up. He is competitive, he is provocative (Lewis descried him as “chatty”), he gets the people going, but he is also a trusted leader in the Wallabies’ locker room. When Lewis and director of rugby Matt Hodgson took to the podium to espouse the virtues of signing White, his leadership credentials were brought up, but Lewis also spoke about what White brought from an off-the-field point of view. “We’re looking forward to him being chatty, being the face of rugby in WA. We really want to grow the game here and he’ll offer us that opportunity to use him and his profile to get more boys and girls playing,” he said. “If you’re an AFL player, you have multiple people in the State that you can look up to who are All-Australians, if you’re a cricketer, you have the Marsh brothers, there’s multiple players who have played for Australia.” Both Lewis and Force coach Simon Cron have spoken about the need to grow the game within WA and in the super-saturated sports market that is Perth, you need a consistent winning record or a big-name player (or ideally both) to achieve cut-through. In a sports-mad city where there are as many professional teams as sunny days, people only have so much time and money, and clubs need to have not just their curiosity, but their attention too. Years of winning will build you an army of followers (see West Coast Eagles and Perth Wildcats) but celebrity status has tangible pulling power. West Coast have always had big names — Ben Cousins, Chris Judd, Nic Naitanui, Josh Kennedy et al. — and Fremantle have had megastars such as Matthew Pavlich and Nat Fyfe over the past two decades. The Perth Wildcats have Bryce Cotton currently, and before him had Shawn Redhage, Ricky Grace and a host of other stars; WA Cricket can point to Cam Green and Mitch Marsh and previously had Shaun Marsh, Adam Gilchrist and Justin Langer, while the West Coast fever currently have Courtney Bruce and Jhaniele Fowler. Perth Glory had Diego Castro, and further afield, the round ball game has greatly benefited from local product Sam Kerr, who is about to captain her country at a home World Cup and one of the most recognisable stars in world football. The Force have had a lot of good players, but the last one to have any sort of serious mainstream cut-through was human headline and walking quote machine Nick Cummins. Tom Robertson was their only player to be named in Eddie Jones’ inaugural Wallaby squad, while star lock Izack Rodda has spent all season on the sidelines with a foot injury. The Force’s attendances have consistently cracked 6000 this season, but are yet to threaten 10,000 but they’ve proved in years past they can draw a crowd. There is appetite for the code at both grassroots and the top level, best evidenced by the three Wallabies Tests at Optus Stadium drawing crowds of 61,241 — a venue record, 52,724 and 47,668. While the marquee matches may speak more to the average Perth punter’s love of big-ticket game, clearly there is support for rugby union. The trick is how to convert them into regular Force fans. The signing of White will undoubtedly help the Force on-field, but it gives them a chance to win over the off-field neutrals too.","pubDate":"2023-05-24 18:00:00","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-10647656/01cec4d66d27fe7718e83468b2350b82a103fabb-16x9-x0y1411w2000h1125.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shanaka’s selection a ’strange one’, Manjrekar says after Gujarat’s loss to Super Kings","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Shanaka’s-selection-a-’strange-one’--Manjrekar-says-after-Gujarat’s-loss-to-Super-Kings/108-259791","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar questioned the Gujarat Titan’s decision to select Dasun Shanaka over Matthew Wade for Qualifier 1 against the Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday, which the Titans lost by 15 runs.","content":"Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar questioned the Gujarat Titan's decision to select Dasun Shanaka over Matthew Wade for Qualifier 1 against the Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday, which the Titans lost by 15 runs.
