Brollies down, covers coming off. We might have a toss soon. ‚ÄúFestive greetings, Jonathan,‚Äù and to you Andrew Benton. ‚ÄúAs Elton John once sang, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a sad, sad situation, and it‚Äôs getting more and more absurd‚Äô. It would be a fair miracle if England were to regain the urn, the change in attitude and aptitude needed to win three in a row is surely beyond them. If miracles are going to happen, there are many far more worthy causes to which they should be applied. Fielding mistakes and giving away wickets should have been ironed out in the summer, and it will be interesting to see if the pressure applied by management over the past few days has any result. At least some learning could then be legitimately be said to be happening.‚Äù All relevant points. However, I think the most salient is simple one: that this cohort of Australians are better at cricket than their English rivals. This is magnified in Australian conditions. Exacerbated further by injuries and lack of preparation to the tourists. I feel like much of the ‚ÄúRoot must to do this‚Äù analysis, and heated discussions about application or concentration are mostly performative and largely empty. What really needs resolving is the problem of why this England side is so poorly equipped for this challenge; repeatedly. Until then, the incidental gripes around fielding and captaincy will be little more than piddling into the wind. Pass the time while the drizzle hangs around with Simon Burton‚Äôs look at Boxing Day Tests of yore. The Boxing Day Test has become, in the words of Mark Butcher, ‚Äúa major part of cricketing folklore‚Äù, but it was a surprisingly recent addition to the calendar. England and Australia first met on that date in 1950, when the second Test resumed on 26 December after two days off. The following year, West Indies played Test cricket on Christmas Day itself, which one tourist declared ‚Äúsacrilegious‚Äù and was not much more popular with the home side. ‚ÄúI have never played on Christmas Day before in my life and don‚Äôt like having to do so now,‚Äù an unnamed Australian said. Here is the cut strip that won‚Äôt be used for a while yet. . @bowlologist says he'd love to have a bowl on this MCG pitch üëÄ #Ashes pic.twitter.com/iz5cUM7jXG Confirmation the toss has been delayed. Here we go then @JPHowcroft . 4 changes, part in hope, perhaps in desperation. My twin brother Dave is in the ground for 2 days, copping it from the locals. With drizzle in the air, if you won the toss, you'd bowl, SURELY? I think Wood may have a lot to say here. I hope so. Good luck to Dave. By midway through the afternoon session, being in the outer at the G is not always the most relaxing place for an Englishman. (I speak from personal experience.) As for the toss. Yes, you‚Äôd reckon it‚Äôs a bowl-first, but a wet outfield may force some second-guessing. I‚Äôm not sure it matters much for Cummins, but Root really has to attack, and with such a weak batting order around him, making early inroads with the new ball may be his only route to victory. There‚Äôs been plenty of talk about the pitch here at the MCG, but - Melbourne being Melbourne - the start of play is under threat from drizzle. Just ten minutes out from the toss, the pitch is under cover as some rain drifts across the arena. It‚Äôs been midsummer beautiful in Victoria for a week or so, but conditions today are cool, there‚Äôs a blanket of cloud swaddling the CBD, and some of it is heavy enough to reach ground level. Some sad news to begin with following the announcement of the death of former England allrounder, captain, coach, selector, and self-appointed supremo, Ray Illingworth. Hello everybody and welcome to live over-by-over coverage of the Boxing Day Ashes Test. We‚Äôre underway at the Melbourne Cricket Ground at 10.30am local time (11.30pm UK). I hope you‚Äôre all well-fed, well-rested, and ready for one of the landmark days on the sporting calendar. As Cliff Richard sang, it‚Äôs a time for giving (your wicket away reverse-sweeping to point during a blockathon) a time for getting (dropped), a time for forgiving (Jos Buttler) and a time for forgetting (Joe Root winning the toss in Brisbane). Now let‚Äôs rejoice in the good that we see. That good includes the selection of Scott Boland, only the second Indigenous Australian man to be awarded a baggy green, as well as the prospect of 70,000 or so fans inside the MCG, providing one of sport‚Äôs most incredible audiences. There‚Äôs England‚Äôs final chance to right some wrongs in the battle to regain the Ashes. Pat Cummins is back. So is Jonny Bairstow. And Zak Crawley. So put the wrapping paper in the recycling, lay out your selection box on the table, and settle in for one of the best days (or nights) of sport of the year.

Illingworth, who led England to a 2-0 Ashes series victory in Australia in 1970-71, had been undergoing radiotherapy for oesophageal cancer. Illingworth, who enjoyed a hugely successful domestic career with Yorkshire and Leicestershire, played 61 Tests for England between 1958 and 1973, scoring 1,836 runs at an average of 23.24 and claiming 122 wickets at 31.20. He captained England 31 times, winning 12 of those matches. Illingworth served as chairman of selectors for England between 1993 and 1996 and coached the national team in 1995-96. England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive Tom Harrison said in a statement: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always incredibly sad to lose a person who has given so much to the English game, and to the sport of cricket in general. ‚ÄúRay was a superb cricketer, and his deep love, passion and knowledge for the game meant he continued to contribute long after his playing days had finished. We send our sympathy and warmest wishes to Ray‚Äôs friends and family at this difficult time.‚Äù Illingworth‚Äôs first-class career spanned a remarkable 32 years from his debut in 1951 to his final appearance in 1983. He finished with a final total of 24,134 first-class runs and 2,072 wickets and was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1960. He played for Yorkshire from 1951 to 1968, leading them to three successive County Championship victories in those final three years, before joining Leicestershire in 1969, remaining at Grace Road until 1978. He returned to Yorkshire initially as team manager but made his playing comeback at the age of 50 in 1982. Yorkshire paid tribute to ‚Äúthe club‚Äôs most successful modern day captain‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe are deeply saddened to learn that Ray Illingworth has passed away,‚Äù the county said in a statement. ‚ÄúHis success at county level was matched on the international scene, enjoying a long career with England as captain. ‚ÄúOur thoughts are with Ray‚Äôs family and the wider Yorkshire family who held Ray so dear to their hearts.‚Äù The club‚Äôs chairman Lord Patel described Illingworth as ‚Äúone of Yorkshire‚Äôs, and England‚Äôs, greatest players‚Äù. He said: ‚ÄúHe had a significant, and lasting, impact, and will be fondly remembered by fans of cricket across the county and the nation. My heart goes out to his family and all who knew him.‚Äù Leicestershire said on Twitter: ‚ÄúEverybody at Leicestershire County Cricket Club are deeply, deeply saddened to hear of the passing of former Captain, Ray Illingworth. ‚ÄúOur thoughts are with Illy‚Äôs family and friends at this difficult time.‚Äù Marylebone Cricket Club, of which Illingworth was an honorary life member, also said it was ‚Äúdeeply saddened‚Äù to learn of his death. Farsley Cricket Club, Illingworth‚Äôs local club where he would prepare wickets well into his 70s, said cricket had ‚Äúlost a great‚Äù. They added on Twitter: ‚ÄúAbsolute LEGEND of a man you will be sorely missed by many!‚Äù Illingworth‚Äôs wife Shirley died earlier this year after battling cancer and Illingworth had offered his support for law changes over assisted dying. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have the last 12 months that my wife had,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe had a terrible time going from hospital to hospital and in pain. ‚ÄúI believe in assisted dying.

I'm sure it will be a hostile environment here but that's to be embraced and enjoyed, everyone is excited to be here. This is why you play the game because you want to be part of big occasions.\" (AP) Lineups Australia: David Warner, Marcus Harris, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins (captain), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland.

The first Test match of the series is the most important for us to start well.

On paper, India have got the arsenal to match South Africa in terms of pace line-up. Since the tour of 2018, Jasprit Bumrah's stocks have risen in Test cricket, followed by Mohammed Shami and Ishant Sharma with Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj and Shardul Thakur completing the hexagon of India's world-class pace attack. The tourists' pace bowling contingent is something which South Africa captain Dean Elgar had singled out as the biggest challenge for the hosts. \"Their strength at the moment lies in their bowling. We are extremely aware of that as well. They have had a lot of successes as a bowling unit. They have got a lot of older spearhead bowlers that lead the attack and have got a good back-up set of bowlers as well. Being in South Africa, I am pretty sure their bowling attack will exploit the conditions reasonably well.\" Though India is missing the services of left-arm spin all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, trust off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin to be the sole spin lead with Thakur filling in for the all-rounder's slot. But the main concerns of the Indian team have been in batting, with captain Virat Kohli and senior pros Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane in the middle of a lean patch. In the recent home series against New Zealand, India were majorly bailed out of trouble by newbie Shreyas Iyer in Kanpur and opener Mayank Agarwal in Mumbai. With Rohit Sharma out of the series due to a left hamstring injury, the batters have to put their best foot forward. South Africa, on the other hand, will be playing a Test match for the first time since playing two matches against West Indies in June. Though the hosts' batting might has been depleted by the retirements of AB de Villiers, Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis, captain Dean Elgar is still there with Aiden Markram and Rassie van der Dussen for company. But they will have more batting concerns in terms of experience with wicketkeeper-batter Quinton de Kock only available for the first Test before going on paternity leave. But their bowling unit, led by Kagiso Rabada, is still capable of troubling the Indian batters despite the absence of Anrich Nortje. Lungi Ngidi, who shone with 6/39 on Test debut against India at this venue in 2018, has been plagued by injuries and recently, COVID-19. South Africa will be hoping that he and the returning Duanne Olivier can maintain the strength of their fast-bowling stocks. In the Proteas' favour, Centurion has been a fortress, just like the Gabba has been for Australia. In 26 Tests at the venue, South Africa have won 21 times and faced defeat only twice, against England in 2000 and Australia in 2014.

The Sydney Thunder have had a rollercoaster journey in the BBL 2021-22 and are currently fourth in the points table with two wins and as many losses. After two consecutive defeats, they got back to winning ways with a 53-run victory over the Brisbane Heat in their previous outing. The Thunder will hope to keep the momentum going in their next game. Meanwhile, the Sydney Sixers have kickstarted their BBL 2021-22 campaign in fine fashion, winning four out of five games so far. They presently hold the second spot on the points table with 14 points to their name. Led by Moises Henriques, the Sixers have been excellent and will be eager to sustain their top form.

The batters enjoy batting on this track as the ball comes nicely onto the bat. The bowlers need to be precise with their lengths while bowling on this surface. Wicketkeeper Josh Philippe: Josh Philippe has hit the ground running this season, with three fifties in five games. He has been consistent with his shot selection, mixing caution with aggression in equal measure. Philippe has smashed a total of 282 runs so far and is currently the highest scorer in the BBL. Batters Alex Ross: Alex is another in-form player this season who can hit the ball all over the ground and assist his team to put up a massive total. He couldn‚Äôt live up to expectations in the last game but has performed pretty well in the first three games, scoring 155 runs. James Vince: Vince hasn't been at his best so far with the bat but he is a versatile T20 batter. He has 113 runs to his name this season and will be looking forward to scoring in this game. All-rounders Moises Henriques: Henriques is the best pick from the Sixers side given his knack for scoring vital runs down the order. He also adds value with his bowling in the middle overs, making him one to watch out for in this game. Daniel Sams: Daniel Sams has scored handy runs with the bat as well as picked up four wickets. He is expected to play in this game and make vital contributions for his side. Bowlers Sean Abbott: Abbott has shown glimpses of his fantastic death-bowling skills in the BBL 2021-22, chipping in with six wickets in three matches. He has proven to be an economical bowler for the Sydney Sixers. Tanveer Sangha: Tanveer Sangha will be crucial with his bowling variations. He has consistently picked up key wickets in the last four games for the Thunder.

The recording, sent anonymously to The Sunday Age , is of a call by former Cricket Australia head of integrity Sean Carroll to a woman who describes herself as a high-class escort and provides information that a well-known cricketer should ‚Äúback it up‚Äù or he will end up destroying his career. Former Cricket Australia head of integrity Sean Carroll. In the phone call, the woman makes allegations about the player dancing naked on a balcony, openly using cocaine and cavorting with numerous women. It is believed the phone call took place several years ago, and the allegations against the unnamed player could not be substantiated. But the existence of the recording years later and the ease at which such recordings can be accessed has led to sports corruption experts warning that there is a risk of players being blackmailed and whistleblowers being deterred from coming forward. It is unclear how or when the recording was obtained from Cricket Australia. It was sent to The Sunday Age through an encrypted email service from an anonymous address. The player was not identified and The Sunday Age has established that the recording is genuine. The source of the leak said they wanted to bring attention to what they described as the integrity unit‚Äôs ‚Äúabuse of power‚Äù and the lack of security around the handling of information from whistleblowers. The person said they were a former Cricket Australia staffer who wanted to expose flaws in the integrity unit and asked for the matter to be made public. ‚ÄúThere are no rules regarding storage of these recordings, who can listen to them, or how long they should be archived,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúThere are no policies or procedures in place regarding access, integrity and confidentiality of this material. ‚ÄúI want to protect members of the public, players and staff from an abuse of power and ensure accountability ‚Äì I think this behaviour has gone unchecked for far too long.‚Äù In the recording, the woman who contacted Cricket Australia tells Mr Carroll she is surprised at the player‚Äôs behaviour given his public profile. ‚ÄúHe needs to back it up a bit, back it up, like deadset seriously back it up because I‚Äôm probably doing him a favour if anything,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to be publicly letting everyone seeing me party and snorting lines.‚Äù The woman tells Mr Carroll there is ‚Äúprobably‚Äù video or photos of the player engaging in the reported activities but declines to provide any vision to Cricket Australia. She says the last time she saw it happen was in the lead-up to Christmas but does not say which year. ‚ÄúThey party a lot these boys,‚Äù the woman says. Cricket Australia was unaware of the leak until an inquiry by The Sunday Age . A spokesman said it had been reported to the Victoria Police Sporting Integrity Intelligence Unit, which was providing assistance. ‚ÄúCricket Australia takes this matter extremely seriously, which is why we contacted Victoria Police,‚Äù the spokesman said. ‚ÄúWe constantly review our systems, and our controls around sensitive information are continually being improved and aligned with best practice. ‚ÄúWe take integrity matters extremely seriously and ensure appropriate action is taken.‚Äù A Victoria Police spokeswoman said police had met with Cricket Australia but was not investigating the matter. It is the second major leak in two months involving players investigated by Cricket Australia‚Äôs integrity unit. In November, former Test captain Tim Paine resigned when his explicit texts sent to a co-worker in 2017 became public on the eve of the Ashes. Mr Carroll, who investigated the Paine complaint when it was first reported to Cricket Australia, left the organisation in December last year to take up a role as Victorian Racing Integrity Commissioner. Cricket Australia‚Äôs investigation of the complaint found Paine had not breached its code of conduct. Sport corruption researcher Adam Masters, a senior lecturer in criminology at Australian National University, said the recording of sensitive information made players vulnerable to blackmail and possible match-fixing. ‚ÄúThe big risk with that sort of information, if it went to organised crime, is you‚Äôre looking at problems in places like the sub-continent where organised crime has historically been involved with sport gambling,‚Äù Dr Masters said. ‚ÄúPlayers are much more aware of approaches by gambling interests and organised crime [than they used to be].

The recording, sent anonymously to The Sunday Age , is of a call by former Cricket Australia head of integrity Sean Carroll to a woman who describes herself as a high-class escort and provides information that a well-known cricketer should ‚Äúback it up‚Äù or he will end up destroying his career. Former Cricket Australia head of integrity Sean Carroll. In the phone call, the woman makes allegations about the player dancing naked on a balcony, openly using cocaine and cavorting with numerous women. It is believed the phone call took place several years ago, and the allegations against the unnamed player could not be substantiated. But the existence of the recording years later and the ease at which such recordings can be accessed has led to sports corruption experts warning that there is a risk of players being blackmailed and whistleblowers being deterred from coming forward. It is unclear how or when the recording was obtained from Cricket Australia. It was sent to The Sunday Age through an encrypted email service from an anonymous address. The player was not identified and The Sunday Age has established that the recording is genuine. The source of the leak said they wanted to bring attention to what they described as the integrity unit‚Äôs ‚Äúabuse of power‚Äù and the lack of security around the handling of information from whistleblowers. The person said they were a former Cricket Australia staffer who wanted to expose flaws in the integrity unit and asked for the matter to be made public. ‚ÄúThere are no rules regarding storage of these recordings, who can listen to them, or how long they should be archived,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúThere are no policies or procedures in place regarding access, integrity and confidentiality of this material. ‚ÄúI want to protect members of the public, players and staff from an abuse of power and ensure accountability ‚Äì I think this behaviour has gone unchecked for far too long.‚Äù In the recording, the woman who contacted Cricket Australia tells Mr Carroll she is surprised at the player‚Äôs behaviour given his public profile. ‚ÄúHe needs to back it up a bit, back it up, like deadset seriously back it up because I‚Äôm probably doing him a favour if anything,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to be publicly letting everyone seeing me party and snorting lines.‚Äù The woman tells Mr Carroll there is ‚Äúprobably‚Äù video or photos of the player engaging in the reported activities but declines to provide any vision to Cricket Australia. She says the last time she saw it happen was in the lead-up to Christmas but does not say which year. ‚ÄúThey party a lot these boys,‚Äù the woman says. Cricket Australia was unaware of the leak until an inquiry by The Sunday Age . A spokesman said it had been reported to the Victoria Police Sporting Integrity Intelligence Unit, which was providing assistance. ‚ÄúCricket Australia takes this matter extremely seriously, which is why we contacted Victoria Police,‚Äù the spokesman said. ‚ÄúWe constantly review our systems, and our controls around sensitive information are continually being improved and aligned with best practice. ‚ÄúWe take integrity matters extremely seriously and ensure appropriate action is taken.‚Äù A Victoria Police spokeswoman said police had met with Cricket Australia but was not investigating the matter. It is the second major leak in two months involving players investigated by Cricket Australia‚Äôs integrity unit. In November, former Test captain Tim Paine resigned when his explicit texts sent to a co-worker in 2017 became public on the eve of the Ashes. Mr Carroll, who investigated the Paine complaint when it was first reported to Cricket Australia, left the organisation in December last year to take up a role as Victorian Racing Integrity Commissioner. Cricket Australia‚Äôs investigation of the complaint found Paine had not breached its code of conduct. Sport corruption researcher Adam Masters, a senior lecturer in criminology at Australian National University, said the recording of sensitive information made players vulnerable to blackmail and possible match-fixing. ‚ÄúThe big risk with that sort of information, if it went to organised crime, is you‚Äôre looking at problems in places like the sub-continent where organised crime has historically been involved with sport gambling,‚Äù Dr Masters said. ‚ÄúPlayers are much more aware of approaches by gambling interests and organised crime [than they used to be]. However, something like drug taking and prostitution really opens that blackmail element up in a very broad kind of way.‚Äù University of Canberra integrity expert Catherine Ordway.

Decisions around the middle-order batting and how many seamers to pick will be the main conundrum for the selectors. Ajinkya Rahane's selection or omission will be another big talking point on Boxing Day when Virat Kohli walks out for the toss along with Dean Elgar. Rahane has been struggling for form with the bat for a couple of years now but has been given a long rope by the team management due to his experience and past record. Time however, is running for the former vice-captain with young Shreyas Iyer and Hanuma Vihari waiting in the wings. Rahane was stripped of vice-captaincy going into the series before which he sat out Inda's second Test against New Zealand due to what captain Virat Kohli said was an injury. Calls for his axing from the squad have grown louder over this year but the 34-year-old might just get one more Test to try and hold on to his place in the XI due to his past record and experience of the South African conditions. Rahane averages over 53 in South Africa, where he has amassed 266 runs from 3 Tests with 2 fifties on his last two tours. India head coach Rahul Dravid said on Saturday that he has had positive conversations with Rahane and he is in a good mental space ahead of the series-opener. Reuters Photo \"I have ad positive conversations with him, he has trained very well. It has been no different to conversations with others. He seems to be in good space,\" Dravid told reporters on the eve of the first Test of the series. SHARDUL OVER ISHANT? Another selection dilemma that India face is that of chasing all-rounder Shardul Thakur over the experienced Ishant Sharma, who has also been struggling for form with the ball in Test cricket this year. Shardul Thakur has been in excellent form with the ball this year in Tests, having taken 14 wickets from 3 games at an average of 22.07 and scored 232 runs with the bat at 37.20. The 30-year-old played crucial roles with ball and bat in India's Test wins at the Gabba (vs Australia) and The Oval (vs England) which is why the all-rounder might be preferred over the 105-Test old Ishant, who has struggled with the ball in 2021 with just 14 scalps from 8 games. SA TOUR THE FINAL FRONTIER? View this post on Instagram A post shared by Team India (@indiancricketteam) India will be gunning for their maiden Test series win in South Africa when the Virat Kohli-led side locks horns with the hosts in the opening game at the SuperSport Park on Boxing Day. India have never won a Test series in South Africa out of 7 attempts so far, but after recent successes in Australia and England are buoyed by their ability to compete on the road. The prospect of making history as the first Indian touring side to win a series in South Africa is a tantalising one for the visiting players, who will be looking to move on from the off-field controversies surrounding the Kohli and the BCCI to put their best foot forward in the rainbow nation. Expectations will be high to say the least from Virat Kohli's squad of champions, which has already conquered Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka and England in red-ball cricket and South Africa remains one of the final frontiers. TEAM INDIA DREAM11 PREDICTION Courtesy of BCCI India predicted playing XI: 1. KL Rahul, 2. Mayank Agarwal, 3. Cheteshwar Pujara, 4. Virat Kohli (Captain), 5. Ajinkya Rahane, 6. Rishabh Pant (WK), 7. R Ashwin, 8. Shardul Thakur, 9.Jasprit Bumrah 10. Mohammed Shami 11. Mohammed Siraj. CENTURION TEST WEATHER FORECAST While chances of rain causing a stoppage of play is minimal on Day 1 of the Test on Sunday, it might not be the case in the subsequent days. Rain could cause trouble on the second day. Showers were forecasted for Monday morning, which could coincide with the timings for the first session of Day 2. According to the website of the South African Weather Service, which is the government's meteorological service, there could be rain after nightfall in Centurion on Sunday. It is set to be cloudy throughout the day, however, which alongwith the pacer-friendly conditions can turn out to be a difficult prospect for the batters to negotiate.

Illingworth, who led England to an away Test series victory over Australia in 1970-71, had been undergoing radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. Illingworth played 61 Tests for England between 1958 and 1973, scoring 1,836 Test runs at an average of 23.24 and claimed 122 wickets at 31.20. He captained England 31 times, winning 12 of those matches, and played in the first-ever one-day international in 1971. Illingworth went on to become the chairman of selectors for England between 1994 and 1996, and coached the team in 1995-96. Yorkshire paid tribute to Illingworth and posted on Twitter: ‚ÄúWe are deeply saddened to learn that Ray Illingworth has passed away. Our thoughts are with Ray‚Äôs family and the wider Yorkshire family who held Ray so dear to their hearts.‚Äù Illingworth the player was shy of true elite status, but as a solid lower middle-order batsman, infuriatingly miserly off-spinner and specialist gully fielder, he was never far from the action. But his wider impact on cricket in England was marked. At his best he will be remembered as one of the nation‚Äôs finest captains ‚Äì a single-minded leader with an appetite for authority and broad enough shoulders to bear it. At his worst, in his second act as selector, coach and over-arching ‚Äòsupremo‚Äô of the national side, the same qualities engulfed him and those who served at his pleasure. By a lesser number, primarily those involved at his beloved Farsley Cricket Club, he will be cherished as the life-long club man who prepared wickets well into his 70s and could not resist arriving to paint the crease even after a heart attack slowed him in 2011. In his home life he was a doting husband to his childhood sweetheart Shirley, father to Diane and Vicky and later both grandfather and great-grandfather. After starting his professional career in a Yorkshire dressing room dominated by big characters, Illingworth grew in stature as a fixture of the dominant White Rose side which swept seven county championships in nine years between 1959 and 1968. England also came calling but it was not until his move to Leicestershire in 1969 that he truly found his calling. Installed immediately as captain at Grace Road, he was then summoned to lead his country when injury struck Colin Cowdrey. Initially a stand-in, he held the position for over four years, winning 12 and losing five of his 31 Tests. Illingworth leveraged power on and off the pitch, demanding more concessions than ever before from the board and more input in selection than the job typically entailed. For those who made his cut, he called for outright obedience and a clear commitment to his game plan. If that caused a couple of bumps in the road, notably with Geoffrey Boycott and John Snow, it was frequently a productive arrangement for all concerned. The era peaked with an away Ashes success against Bill Lawry‚Äôs Australia in 1970-71, Illingworth‚Äôs overriding legacy even after his remarkable return to Yorkshire colours at the age of 50. Originally appointed team manager, he eased himself back into the playing roster and ended up with a John Player League winners‚Äô medal. That would have proved a fitting finale had he not been tempted back into the spotlight as England‚Äôs chairman of selectors. He joined what was essentially a sinking ship and hopes were high that his astute reading of the game and simplicity of approach would put things right. Instead his tenure was a debacle. Most obviously, he clashed on every conceivable level with the captain Michael Atherton, declining to award the young Lancastrian the same powers he had claimed when holding the role. The pair were generationally and temperamentally incompatible and Illingworth‚Äôs eye for a player appeared more than once to be offering only blurred vision. In his three years in post he accrued enough responsibilities to warrant the ‚Äòsupremo‚Äô moniker, but as results and relationships teetered off a cliff ‚Äì most notably an ill-tempered and ill-advised public rebuke of the bowler Devon Malcolm in South Africa ‚Äì there was nobody with whom he could share the blame.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05109559526156fb0388349e9e4004c8bc885f91/1_3_1009_606/master/1009.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29fe36925299639e3817ca115b66ffa2","source_id":"theguardian"}]}
