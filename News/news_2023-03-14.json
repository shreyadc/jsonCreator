Turner last pulled on the baggy black cap back in October, 2020, but was recalled after a strong run of form in second XI and WA Premier Cricket, scoring massive centuries in both competitions recently. He will provide good all-round depth in the absence of Australian One-Day International squad members Mitch Marsh, Marcus Stoinis and Ashton Agar. Victorian captain Will Sutherland won the toss and sent WA in on a green deck, with the visitors needing a win to boost their hopes of making next week’s shield decider at the same venue. Test seamer Scott Boland is a massive inclusion after being released from Australian duties early. But the news wasn’t so good for WA tearaway Lance Morris who won’t be available until next week’s home final. WA have already secured hosting rights for the decider, starting at the WACA Ground on March 23. Uncontracted Claremont-Nedlands quick Liam Haskett missed out on his shield debut with Cameron Gannon, Charlie Stobo, David Moody and spinner Corey Rocchiccioli the four-man bowling attack.

New Zealanders, it seems, want to coach everywhere else other than in New Zealand. There are New Zealanders in charge of Wales, Italy and Japan, and until a few months ago, there were Kiwis at the helm of Australia and Fiji. There are also New Zealanders coaching the biggest clubs in England, France and Japan and yet the best intelligence to date suggests that Jamie Joseph and Scott Robertson are going to be the only two candidates to apply to coach the All Blacks in 2024. This would be shocking but for the fact it is pretty much the norm when it comes to appointing All Blacks coaches. In 2011, there were two candidates Steve Hansen and Vern Cotter. In 2019, when the job was next contestable, there were only two candidates – Foster and Robertson - and now, despite New Zealand Rugby breaking with precedent and opting to complete the process before the World Cup to maximise the number of applicants, once again, just two names are in the frame. In 2011 and 2019, the timing of the process was blamed for the low level of interest – the argument being that many, if not most candidates, had already secured their next job long before NZR opened the process to start looking for the next All Blacks coach. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. But having reacted to that by opting to hold the appointment process now, rather than waiting until after this year’s World Cup, and still only having two contenders, suggests the time has come to start wondering whether the problem is not timing but something else entirely. The list of who isn’t involved is beginning to feel like it may be the bigger story as there is a weight of evidence building that NZR might be labouring under Related articles Sport | Cricket 'Quite gutted hearing that': Black Caps hero responds after questions about future 14 Mar 12:53 AM Sport Ranked: The greatest All Blacks coaches of all time 13 Mar 10:00 PM Sport | Cricket Andrew Alderson: Black Caps' stunning victories too late after narrow failures 13 Mar 11:10 PM Scott Robertson (left) and Jamie Joseph are the leading contenders for the vacant All Blacks coaching role. Photos / Photosport a misapprehension about the allure of the All Blacks. Once the process has run its course and the new man is appointed, NZR needs to find out why so many world-class New Zealanders haven’t thrown their respective hats into the ring. And the first person that needs to be asked is former Ireland coach and current All Blacks assistant, Joe Schmidt. He has publicly ruled himself out, releasing a statement over the weekend after speculation mounted that he may be considering applying. He has the experience, the knowledge and says he has loved being back in the coaching fold after taking a break when he finished with Ireland in 2019. But he doesn’t want to be the next All Blacks coach. Nor, does it appear, that Dave Rennie has any interest in being the next All Blacks coach. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. He’s available, he’s got almost four years test experience with the Wallabies and won two Super Rugby titles with the Chiefs. Despite the fact the Wallabies sacked him in January, there is a consensus view he was building something, having inherited a team that was low on confidence. He reconnected the players with the jersey, acknowledged the diverse cultural backgrounds of the players and in doing so, screamed out as a potential All Blacks coach. But the job obviously doesn’t appeal to him, in the same way it has not grabbed the imagination of Cotter, who was suddenly dumped by Fiji last month. Cotter has had huge success as a club coach in France and with Scotland, whom he took to the quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup. Pat Lam is another who has stayed well clear of the process. The former Blues coach has established himself as one of the most successful in Europe having won silverware with Connacht and Bristol, but seemingly has no interest in coming home. Robbie Deans has been the most successful club coach in Japan in the last decade and has a wealth of international experience. He’s clearly not been tempted to see if all that knowledge could be put to use with the All Blacks, and of course, Foster himself has said he won’t be re-applying for his job – which may not be a huge surprise, but again, is just one more coach with international experience shying away from the role. Whether the All Blacks end up with Robertson or Joseph, they will have a good coach at the helm. That’s not in doubt. But the lack of interest the role has generated still needs to be investigated, because while the All Blacks are going to end up with a good coach regardless, there’s still no certainty given how few have applied, that they will have appointed the best.

Delhi Capitals chased down the target of 151 runs. Meg Lanning and Shabali Verma didn’t get off to a great start. However, Alice Capsey, Jemima Rodrigues, Marissan Gabe and Jess Jonassen played responsibly. The team needed 9 runs in the last over to win. 12 runs off the first four balls of that over to win.

Kohli endured a painful wait of more than three years to notch his Test century number 28, the knock helping India finish with 571 in reply to Australia's 480 in the drawn fourth and final game.\"The expectations that I have for myself as a player are more important to me,\" Kohli told the official broadcasters after being adjudged Player of the Match. \"I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong.

Kohli faced 364 balls in his knock of 186 and scored only 60 runs in boundaries.

So, we decided to play time. We focused on batting long. \"We focussed more on batting as long as possible for the team.

Will be disappointed to have missed out on a century on day five. He'll presumably return to No.5 for the Ashes but certainly made the case to open in spin-friendly conditions on the subcontinent in future.﻿USMAN KHAWAJA - 9.5/10A brilliant end to the tour for Australia's most solid batter. Khawaja has been criticised for not putting a high enough price on his wicket in the past, but showed maturity in spades to bat Australia to a strong position on the first two days. His numbers since being restored to Australia's Test side are outstanding and there's a tinge of regret that some of his prime years were wasted as Australia continually tried less-prolific batters over him.﻿MARNUS LABUSCHAGNE - 6/10This Test reflected the series for Marnus Labuschagne. He looked really solid at some stages of the series, as he did on day five to end unbeaten on 63, but also looked well below his best at other stages. Would have been disappointed to have managed just three in the first innings in perfect batting conditions. Another big test lies ahead in the Ashes.﻿STEVE SMITH - 5.5/10Like Labuschagne, Steve Smith will have felt he left a huge score on the table when he was dismissed for 38 on day one. Smith grafted hard alongside Khawaja to get in position for his first half-century of the series and then missed a straight one from Ravindra Jadeja. His innings was symbolic of his tour as a whole as it lacked the fluency you would typically see from an in-form Smith. Would've liked to get a big score like Virat Kohli did to find some form before the Ashes, but didn't. After a series with no half-centuries, there are major question marks over his future after he again dropped hints that retirement isn't too far away.PETER HANDSCOMB - 5/10Another one who would've been disappointed not to kick on for a bigger score in the first innings. Handscomb looked really solid in his short innings before﻿ playing down the wrong line and having his stumps ruined. The innings was Handscomb's Test career in a microcosm - looking solid without kicking on and getting a big score often enough.CAMERON GREEN - 8.5/10A few years from now we're all going to sit back and remember when Cameron Green scored his first Test century. Came in with Australia in a precarious position and completely flipped the momentum of the game. You get the sense that he's going to do that countless times over the next decade. Struggled a bit with the ball, but certainly wasn't alone in that regard.﻿ALEX CAREY - 4/10Oh to have been a fly on the wall in the dressing room when Carey strode back in after a reckless shot on day two. Carey has shown that he is an extremely talented batter, but will need to be more responsible in big overseas Tests moving forward. The No.7 position is important in shielding what has looked to be a fragile tail this series and Carey's quick dismissal was probably the difference between Australia scoring more than 550 as opposed to the 480 it eventually ended up with in the first innings.﻿ Another fine display behind the stumps.MITCHELL STARC - 5/10It's tough to judge the performance of frontline quicks on a pitch like this one, but Australia would've liked a little more from Mitchell Starc. Hasn't found the ﻿movement with the new ball yet, perhaps a sign that he's still not fully recovered from that injury to his middle finger on his left hand. Will be better off for the run in the last two Test outings.NATHAN LYON - 6/10Finished with unflattering figures of 3-151 but toiled manfully on an unforgiving pitch, sending down a remarkable 65 overs. Despite receiving no help from the surface, India still struggled to get on top of Lyon, a sign of his brilliant control. Still appears to have loads left in the tank despite his advanced age. ﻿His 34 in Australia's first innings also can't be forgotten.TODD MURPHY - 7/10Another impressive outing from the young spinner, who picked up Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja. While he never matched the heights of that stunning seven-wicket haul from the first Test, Murphy remained difficult to get away in almost 46 overs. Also saved Australia from what might've been a loss with a first-class best score of 41 in the first innings. Looks to have the technique to be able to bat higher up the order in the future.﻿MATTHEW KUHNEMANN - ﻿5/10Struggled to have the same impact he did in Indore where he was excellent on a rank turner in the first innings. ﻿With India unable to get on top of Lyon and Murphy, a concerted effort was made to attack Kuhnemann, who was by far the most expensive of the three spinners. Played a surprisingly vital role with the bat in the second innings with Khawaja unable to open up.For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports,

New Zealanders, it seems, want to coach everywhere else other than in New Zealand. There are New Zealanders in charge of Wales, Italy and Japan, and until a few months ago, there were Kiwis at the helm of Australia and Fiji. There are also New Zealanders coaching the biggest clubs in England, France and Japan and yet the best intelligence to date suggests that Jamie Joseph and Scott Robertson are going to be the only two candidates to apply to coach the All Blacks in 2024. This would be shocking but for the fact it is pretty much the norm when it comes to appointing All Blacks coaches. In 2011, there were two candidates Steve Hansen and Vern Cotter. In 2019, when the job was next contestable, there were only two candidates – Foster and Robertson - and now, despite New Zealand Rugby breaking with precedent and opting to complete the process before the World Cup to maximise the number of applicants, once again, just two names are in the frame. In 2011 and 2019, the timing of the process was blamed for the low level of interest – the argument being that many, if not most candidates, had already secured their next job long before NZR opened the process to start looking for the next All Blacks coach. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. But having reacted to that by opting to hold the appointment process now, rather than waiting until after this year’s World Cup, and still only having two contenders, suggests the time has come to start wondering whether the problem is not timing but something else entirely. The list of who isn’t involved is beginning to feel like it may be the bigger story as there is a weight of evidence building that NZR might be labouring under Related articles Sport | Cricket 'Quite gutted hearing that': Black Caps hero responds after questions about future 14 Mar 12:53 AM Sport Ranked: The greatest All Blacks coaches of all time 13 Mar 10:00 PM Sport | Cricket Andrew Alderson: Black Caps' stunning victories too late after narrow failures 13 Mar 11:10 PM Scott Robertson (left) and Jamie Joseph are the leading contenders for the vacant All Blacks coaching role. Photos / Photosport a misapprehension about the allure of the All Blacks. Once the process has run its course and the new man is appointed, NZR needs to find out why so many world-class New Zealanders haven’t thrown their respective hats into the ring. And the first person that needs to be asked is former Ireland coach and current All Blacks assistant, Joe Schmidt. He has publicly ruled himself out, releasing a statement over the weekend after speculation mounted that he may be considering applying. He has the experience, the knowledge and says he has loved being back in the coaching fold after taking a break when he finished with Ireland in 2019. But he doesn’t want to be the next All Blacks coach. Nor, does it appear, that Dave Rennie has any interest in being the next All Blacks coach. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. He’s available, he’s got almost four years test experience with the Wallabies and won two Super Rugby titles with the Chiefs. Despite the fact the Wallabies sacked him in January, there is a consensus view he was building something, having inherited a team that was low on confidence. He reconnected the players with the jersey, acknowledged the diverse cultural backgrounds of the players and in doing so, screamed out as a potential All Blacks coach. But the job obviously doesn’t appeal to him, in the same way it has not grabbed the imagination of Cotter, who was suddenly dumped by Fiji last month. Cotter has had huge success as a club coach in France and with Scotland, whom he took to the quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup. Pat Lam is another who has stayed well clear of the process. The former Blues coach has established himself as one of the most successful in Europe having won silverware with Connacht and Bristol, but seemingly has no interest in coming home. Robbie Deans has been the most successful club coach in Japan in the last decade and has a wealth of international experience. He’s clearly not been tempted to see if all that knowledge could be put to use with the All Blacks, and of course, Foster himself has said he won’t be re-applying for his job – which may not be a huge surprise, but again, is just one more coach with international experience shying away from the role. Whether the All Blacks end up with Robertson or Joseph, they will have a good coach at the helm. That’s not in doubt. But the lack of interest the role has generated still needs to be investigated, because while the All Blacks are going to end up with a good coach regardless, there’s still no certainty given how few have applied, that they will have appointed the best.

Kohli endured a painful wait of more than three years to notch his Test century number 28, the knock helping India finish with 571 in reply to Australia's 480 in the drawn fourth and final game.\"The expectations that I have for myself as a player are more important to me,\" Kohli told the official broadcasters after being adjudged Player of the Match. \"I am not in a space now where I will go out and prove someone wrong.

Will be disappointed to have missed out on a century on day five. He'll presumably return to No.5 for the Ashes but certainly made the case to open in spin-friendly conditions on the subcontinent in future.﻿USMAN KHAWAJA - 9.5/10A brilliant end to the tour for Australia's most solid batter. Khawaja has been criticised for not putting a high enough price on his wicket in the past, but showed maturity in spades to bat Australia to a strong position on the first two days. His numbers since being restored to Australia's Test side are outstanding and there's a tinge of regret that some of his prime years were wasted as Australia continually tried less-prolific batters over him.﻿MARNUS LABUSCHAGNE - 6/10This Test reflected the series for Marnus Labuschagne. He looked really solid at some stages of the series, as he did on day five to end unbeaten on 63, but also looked well below his best at other stages. Would have been disappointed to have managed just three in the first innings in perfect batting conditions. Another big test lies ahead in the Ashes.﻿STEVE SMITH - 5.5/10Like Labuschagne, Steve Smith will have felt he left a huge score on the table when he was dismissed for 38 on day one. Smith grafted hard alongside Khawaja to get in position for his first half-century of the series and then missed a straight one from Ravindra Jadeja. His innings was symbolic of his tour as a whole as it lacked the fluency you would typically see from an in-form Smith. Would've liked to get a big score like Virat Kohli did to find some form before the Ashes, but didn't. After a series with no half-centuries, there are major question marks over his future after he again dropped hints that retirement isn't too far away.PETER HANDSCOMB - 5/10Another one who would've been disappointed not to kick on for a bigger score in the first innings. Handscomb looked really solid in his short innings before﻿ playing down the wrong line and having his stumps ruined. The innings was Handscomb's Test career in a microcosm - looking solid without kicking on and getting a big score often enough.CAMERON GREEN - 8.5/10A few years from now we're all going to sit back and remember when Cameron Green scored his first Test century. Came in with Australia in a precarious position and completely flipped the momentum of the game. You get the sense that he's going to do that countless times over the next decade. Struggled a bit with the ball, but certainly wasn't alone in that regard.﻿ALEX CAREY - 4/10Oh to have been a fly on the wall in the dressing room when Carey strode back in after a reckless shot on day two. Carey has shown that he is an extremely talented batter, but will need to be more responsible in big overseas Tests moving forward. The No.7 position is important in shielding what has looked to be a fragile tail this series and Carey's quick dismissal was probably the difference between Australia scoring more than 550 as opposed to the 480 it eventually ended up with in the first innings.﻿ Another fine display behind the stumps.MITCHELL STARC - 5/10It's tough to judge the performance of frontline quicks on a pitch like this one, but Australia would've liked a little more from Mitchell Starc. Hasn't found the ﻿movement with the new ball yet, perhaps a sign that he's still not fully recovered from that injury to his middle finger on his left hand. Will be better off for the run in the last two Test outings.NATHAN LYON - 6/10Finished with unflattering figures of 3-151 but toiled manfully on an unforgiving pitch, sending down a remarkable 65 overs. Despite receiving no help from the surface, India still struggled to get on top of Lyon, a sign of his brilliant control. Still appears to have loads left in the tank despite his advanced age. ﻿His 34 in Australia's first innings also can't be forgotten.TODD MURPHY - 7/10Another impressive outing from the young spinner, who picked up Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja. While he never matched the heights of that stunning seven-wicket haul from the first Test, Murphy remained difficult to get away in almost 46 overs. Also saved Australia from what might've been a loss with a first-class best score of 41 in the first innings. Looks to have the technique to be able to bat higher up the order in the future.﻿MATTHEW KUHNEMANN - ﻿5/10Struggled to have the same impact he did in Indore where he was excellent on a rank turner in the first innings. ﻿With India unable to get on top of Lyon and Murphy, a concerted effort was made to attack Kuhnemann, who was by far the most expensive of the three spinners. Played a surprisingly vital role with the bat in the second innings with Khawaja unable to open up.For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports,

है। इस जीत से दिल्ली की टीम के मुंबई इंडियंस के समान 8 अंक हो गए हैं लेकिन मुंबई की टीम बेहतर रन रेट के कारण शीर्ष पर है। बैंगलोर के 151 रन के लक्ष्य का पीछा करते हुए दिल्ली की टीम ने मारिजान केप (32 गेंद में नाबाद 32, तीन चौके, एक छक्का) और जेस जोनासेन (15 गेंद में नाबाद 29, चार चौके, एक छक्का) के बीच पांचवें विकेट की 45 रन की अटूट साझेदारी से 19.4 ओवर में चार विकेट पर 154 रन बनाकर जीत दर्ज की। दिल्ली के लिए एलिस कैप्से (38) और जेमिमा रोड्रिग्स (30) ने भी उपयोगी पारियां खेली। आरसीबी ने एलिस पैरी (52 गेंद में नाबाद 67, पांच छक्के, चार छक्के) के अर्धशतक और रिचा घोष (16 गेंद में 37 रन, तीन छक्के, तीन चौके) के साथ चौथे विकेट की उनकी 74 रन की तेजतर्रार साझेदारी से चार विकेट पर 150 रन बनाए थे। इन दोनों की पारियों से आरसीबी की टीम अंतिम छह ओवर में 82 रन जोड़ने में सफल रही। लक्ष्य का पीछा करने उतरे दिल्ली ने दूसरी ही गेंद पर शेफाली वर्मा (00) का विकेट गंवा दिया जिन्हें मेगन शुट (24 रन पर एक विकेट) ने बोल्ड किया। एलिस कैप्से (38) ने शुट पर चौके से खाता खोला और फिर रेणुका सिंह के दो ओवर में चार चौके मारे। कैप्से ने प्रीति बोस (12 रन पर एक विकेट) का स्वागत तीन चौकों के साथ किया लेकिन इसी ओवर में बाउंड्री पर पैरी को कैच बैठी। उन्होंने 24 गेंद का सामना करते हुए 8 चौके मारे। दिल्ली की टीम ने पावरप्ले में दो विकेट पर 52 रन बनाए। कप्तान मेग लेनिंग (15) ने इसके बाद जेमिमा के साथ पारी को आगे बढ़ाया। पारी का आगाज करने उतरी लेनिंग ने 8वें ओवर में 14वीं गेंद पर श्रेयंका पर अपनी पहली बाउंड्री लगाई। वह हालांकि लेग स्पिनर शोभना आशा (27 रन पर दो विकेट) की गेंद पर बड़ा शॉट खेलने की कोशिश में लांग ऑफ पर हीथर नाइट को आसान कैच दे बैठी।","pubDate":"2023-03-13

New Zealanders, it seems, want to coach everywhere else other than in New Zealand. There are New Zealanders in charge of Wales, Italy and Japan, and until a few months ago, there were Kiwis at the helm of Australia and Fiji. There are also New Zealanders coaching the biggest clubs in England, France and Japan and yet the best intelligence to date suggests that Jamie Joseph and Scott Robertson are going to be the only two candidates to apply to coach the All Blacks in 2024. This would be shocking but for the fact it is pretty much the norm when it comes to appointing All Blacks coaches. In 2011, there were two candidates Steve Hansen and Vern Cotter. In 2019, when the job was next contestable, there were only two candidates – Foster and Robertson - and now, despite New Zealand Rugby breaking with precedent and opting to complete the process before the World Cup to maximise the number of applicants, once again, just two names are in the frame. In 2011 and 2019, the timing of the process was blamed for the low level of interest – the argument being that many, if not most candidates, had already secured their next job long before NZR opened the process to start looking for the next All Blacks coach. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. But having reacted to that by opting to hold the appointment process now, rather than waiting until after this year’s World Cup, and still only having two contenders, suggests the time has come to start wondering whether the problem is not timing but something else entirely. The list of who isn’t involved is beginning to feel like it may be the bigger story as there is a weight of evidence building that NZR might be labouring under Related articles Sport | Cricket 'Quite gutted hearing that': Black Caps hero responds after questions about future 14 Mar 12:53 AM Sport Ranked: The greatest All Blacks coaches of all time 13 Mar 10:00 PM Sport | Cricket Andrew Alderson: Black Caps' stunning victories too late after narrow failures 13 Mar 11:10 PM Scott Robertson (left) and Jamie Joseph are the leading contenders for the vacant All Blacks coaching role. Photos / Photosport a misapprehension about the allure of the All Blacks. Once the process has run its course and the new man is appointed, NZR needs to find out why so many world-class New Zealanders haven’t thrown their respective hats into the ring. And the first person that needs to be asked is former Ireland coach and current All Blacks assistant, Joe Schmidt. He has publicly ruled himself out, releasing a statement over the weekend after speculation mounted that he may be considering applying. He has the experience, the knowledge and says he has loved being back in the coaching fold after taking a break when he finished with Ireland in 2019. But he doesn’t want to be the next All Blacks coach. Nor, does it appear, that Dave Rennie has any interest in being the next All Blacks coach. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. He’s available, he’s got almost four years test experience with the Wallabies and won two Super Rugby titles with the Chiefs. Despite the fact the Wallabies sacked him in January, there is a consensus view he was building something, having inherited a team that was low on confidence. He reconnected the players with the jersey, acknowledged the diverse cultural backgrounds of the players and in doing so, screamed out as a potential All Blacks coach. But the job obviously doesn’t appeal to him, in the same way it has not grabbed the imagination of Cotter, who was suddenly dumped by Fiji last month. Cotter has had huge success as a club coach in France and with Scotland, whom he took to the quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup. Pat Lam is another who has stayed well clear of the process. The former Blues coach has established himself as one of the most successful in Europe having won silverware with Connacht and Bristol, but seemingly has no interest in coming home. Robbie Deans has been the most successful club coach in Japan in the last decade and has a wealth of international experience. He’s clearly not been tempted to see if all that knowledge could be put to use with the All Blacks, and of course, Foster himself has said he won’t be re-applying for his job – which may not be a huge surprise, but again, is just one more coach with international experience shying away from the role. Whether the All Blacks end up with Robertson or Joseph, they will have a good coach at the helm. That’s not in doubt. But the lack of interest the role has generated still needs to be investigated, because while the All Blacks are going to end up with a good coach regardless, there’s still no certainty given how few have applied, that they will have appointed the best.

Will be disappointed to have missed out on a century on day five. He'll presumably return to No.5 for the Ashes but certainly made the case to open in spin-friendly conditions on the subcontinent in future.﻿USMAN KHAWAJA - 9.5/10A brilliant end to the tour for Australia's most solid batter. Khawaja has been criticised for not putting a high enough price on his wicket in the past, but showed maturity in spades to bat Australia to a strong position on the first two days. His numbers since being restored to Australia's Test side are outstanding and there's a tinge of regret that some of his prime years were wasted as Australia continually tried less-prolific batters over him.﻿MARNUS LABUSCHAGNE - 6/10This Test reflected the series for Marnus Labuschagne. He looked really solid at some stages of the series, as he did on day five to end unbeaten on 63, but also looked well below his best at other stages. Would have been disappointed to have managed just three in the first innings in perfect batting conditions. Another big test lies ahead in the Ashes.﻿STEVE SMITH - 5.5/10Like Labuschagne, Steve Smith will have felt he left a huge score on the table when he was dismissed for 38 on day one. Smith grafted hard alongside Khawaja to get in position for his first half-century of the series and then missed a straight one from Ravindra Jadeja. His innings was symbolic of his tour as a whole as it lacked the fluency you would typically see from an in-form Smith. Would've liked to get a big score like Virat Kohli did to find some form before the Ashes, but didn't. After a series with no half-centuries, there are major question marks over his future after he again dropped hints that retirement isn't too far away.PETER HANDSCOMB - 5/10Another one who would've been disappointed not to kick on for a bigger score in the first innings. Handscomb looked really solid in his short innings before﻿ playing down the wrong line and having his stumps ruined. The innings was Handscomb's Test career in a microcosm - looking solid without kicking on and getting a big score often enough.CAMERON GREEN - 8.5/10A few years from now we're all going to sit back and remember when Cameron Green scored his first Test century. Came in with Australia in a precarious position and completely flipped the momentum of the game. You get the sense that he's going to do that countless times over the next decade. Struggled a bit with the ball, but certainly wasn't alone in that regard.﻿ALEX CAREY - 4/10Oh to have been a fly on the wall in the dressing room when Carey strode back in after a reckless shot on day two. Carey has shown that he is an extremely talented batter, but will need to be more responsible in big overseas Tests moving forward. The No.7 position is important in shielding what has looked to be a fragile tail this series and Carey's quick dismissal was probably the difference between Australia scoring more than 550 as opposed to the 480 it eventually ended up with in the first innings.﻿ Another fine display behind the stumps.MITCHELL STARC - 5/10It's tough to judge the performance of frontline quicks on a pitch like this one, but Australia would've liked a little more from Mitchell Starc. Hasn't found the ﻿movement with the new ball yet, perhaps a sign that he's still not fully recovered from that injury to his middle finger on his left hand. Will be better off for the run in the last two Test outings.NATHAN LYON - 6/10Finished with unflattering figures of 3-151 but toiled manfully on an unforgiving pitch, sending down a remarkable 65 overs. Despite receiving no help from the surface, India still struggled to get on top of Lyon, a sign of his brilliant control. Still appears to have loads left in the tank despite his advanced age. ﻿His 34 in Australia's first innings also can't be forgotten.TODD MURPHY - 7/10Another impressive outing from the young spinner, who picked up Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja. While he never matched the heights of that stunning seven-wicket haul from the first Test, Murphy remained difficult to get away in almost 46 overs. Also saved Australia from what might've been a loss with a first-class best score of 41 in the first innings. Looks to have the technique to be able to bat higher up the order in the future.﻿MATTHEW KUHNEMANN - ﻿5/10Struggled to have the same impact he did in Indore where he was excellent on a rank turner in the first innings. ﻿With India unable to get on top of Lyon and Murphy, a concerted effort was made to attack Kuhnemann, who was by far the most expensive of the three spinners. Played a surprisingly vital role with the bat in the second innings with Khawaja unable to open up.For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports,

में पहुंचने की आस भी एकदम खत्म हो चुकी है। शिखा पांडे की धारदार गेंदबाजी के बाद बल्लेबाजों के उम्दा प्रदर्शन से दिल्ली कैपिटल्स ने सोमवार को आरसीबी हरा दिया। आरसीबी की यह पांच मैचों में पांचवीं हार

छक्के, तीन चौके) के साथ चौथे विकेट की उनकी 74 रन की तेजतर्रार साझेदारी से चार विकेट पर 150 रन बनाए थे। इन दोनों की पारियों से आरसीबी की टीम अंतिम छह ओवर में 82 रन जोड़ने में सफल रही। लक्ष्य का पीछा करने उतरे दिल्ली ने दूसरी ही गेंद पर शेफाली वर्मा (00) का विकेट गंवा दिया जिन्हें मेगन शुट (24 रन पर एक विकेट) ने बोल्ड किया। एलिस कैप्से (38) ने शुट पर चौके से खाता खोला और फिर रेणुका सिंह के दो ओवर में चार चौके मारे। कैप्से ने प्रीति बोस (12 रन पर एक विकेट) का स्वागत तीन चौकों के साथ किया लेकिन इसी ओवर में बाउंड्री पर पैरी को कैच बैठी। उन्होंने 24 गेंद का सामना करते हुए 8 चौके मारे। दिल्ली की टीम ने पावरप्ले में दो विकेट पर 52 रन बनाए। कप्तान मेग लेनिंग (15) ने इसके बाद जेमिमा के साथ पारी को आगे बढ़ाया। पारी का आगाज करने उतरी लेनिंग ने 8वें ओवर में 14वीं गेंद पर श्रेयंका पर अपनी पहली
