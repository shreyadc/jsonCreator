It was good banter,” said Smith, who charged to his 23 in nine balls.“I thought the boys played exceptionally well.“The adrenaline was pumping at the end there ... It was a huge win, obviously great to go 2-0 up.”With Adelaide to come among three matches left in the series, England captain Ben Stokes refused to concede the urn was lost after battling hard in a 152-ball 50.“I absolutely believe in that dressing room,” he said.“We know we have to win these next three games.“We won’t shy away from the battle, but we need to sort things out pretty quick if we want to bring the Ashes back to England.”It would nonetheless take something extraordinary for England to win it from here.Only one team has ever come back from 2-0 down to win the series in nearly 150 years of test cricket – Don Bradman’s Australia in the home Ashes of 1936/37.Third-string attackIn Brisbane, Stokes’s England showed their fans little to suggest a Bradman-esque effort is within them.Australia, meanwhile, may only get stronger.Their Brisbane attack was third-string at best, with the dogged but unexceptional trio of Scott Boland, Neser and Brendan Doggett supporting the outstanding Starc.Left-arm quick Starc was named player-of-the-match for his eight-wicket haul and first innings 77 with the bat.“We bowled well across both innings,” said 35-year-old Starc, who now has 18 wickets for the series.“I’m pleased for Neser on his home ground.”Champion quick Pat Cummins and elite spinner Nathan Lyon will likely return at the Adelaide Oval from injury and non-selection, respectively.As it was, the duo were hardly needed.Australia’s pacers did their best work late on day three, leaving England needing another 44 runs to make the hosts bat again when they resumed on 134 for six.Stokes and all-rounder Will Jacks deserved credit for batting through the entire first session and pushing England past 200.But as the overs wore on, the Gabba wicket showed more uneven bounce, and Stokes was doubled over in agony when a Neser delivery caught an edge and cannoned into his groin.He got up to cut a single off Doggett and raise his fifty, bringing cheering England fans to their feet.It took Smith to swing the match back in Australia’s favour with a stunning slips catch to dismiss Jacks for 41 and trigger another England batting collapse.Smith leapt to his left to take a one-handed screamer above the grass when the England number eight nicked Neser behind, ending a 96-run stand with Stokes.After Neser had Stokes caught behind, Smith chipped in another two catches to help the seamers wrap up the tail, as England lost 4-17 to be all out for 241.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["none@none.com (Reuters)"],"language":"english","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-07 12:53:08","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://i.aaj.tv/large/2025/12/071746362c7ef1f.webp","video_url":null,"source_id":"aaj_tv","source_name":"Aaj English Tv","source_priority":179387,"source_url":"https://english.aaj.tv","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/aaj_tv.jpg","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"4ce0e9127f179e6d54a5e7dcb5a67755","link":"https://odishatv.in/sports/ind-vs-sa-hardik-pandya-reaches-barabati-stadium-for-net-practice-ahead-of-t20i-encounter-10889937","title":"IND vs SA: Hardik Pandya reaches Barabati Stadium for net practice ahead of T20I encounter","description":"Star Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya reached the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on Sunday evening for an intensive practice session ahead of the much awaited upcoming T20I encounter between India vs South Africa.As per reports, the utility all-rounder arrived specifically for net training and is set to practice without spectators inside the venue. Pandya will undergo a dedicated training routine, engaging in batting and bowling drills along with the net bowlers to sharpen his form before the game.The session is expected to help him fine-tune his rhythm and prepare thoroughly for the high-profile clash scheduled at the Barabati.Notably, Hardik touched down early in Bhubaneswar before the arrival of other Indian cricketers, further heightening excitement among cricket enthusiasts.Also Read: Barabati set for IND-SA T20: Hardik Pandya touches down, full Indian team to join todayFollowing a long lay-off due to injury, Hardik is expected to lend the much needed balance to the Indian line-up in the T20 format. Fans are expecting him to play a crucial role in the five-match T20I series with his medium pace bowling and power hitting in the lower middle order. While India is currently struggling to find a finisher, Hardik is expected to play that role into perfection.Notably, South Africa won the Test series emphatically. However, India bounced back to win the ODI series. Under the circumstance, both the teams will try their best to win the upcoming high-octane T20I series.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["news","sports"],"creator":["Rajendra Mohapatra"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-07 12:50:48","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1280x960/odishatv/media/media_files/2025/12/07/pandya-pix-2-2025-12-07-18-18-45.jpeg","video_url":null,"source_id":"odishatv","source_name":"Odisha Tv","source_priority":62016,"source_url":"https://odishatv.in","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/odishatv.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"949876c91f7a9331610fbd5c4e301f44","link":"https://news.google.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?oc=5","title":"Brendon McCullum responds to England's 'lack of preparation' criticism following Brisbane hammering: 'Trained too much' | Cricket - Hindustan Times","description":"Brendon McCullum responds to England's 'lack of preparation' criticism following Brisbane hammering: 'Trained too much' | Cricket Hindustan TimesBen Stokes says England have been ‘letting the pressure get to us’ in Ashes The Guardian'McCullum, you are off our coaching': Cricket board drops bombshell; sends message to England coach after Ashes defeat The Times of IndiaAshes 2025-26 - England at breaking point as Ashes dreams dismantled ESPNcricinfoStokes questions England's mentality after Brisbane loss Cricbuzz.com","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":null,"creator":null,"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-07 12:43:40","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":null,"video_url":null,"source_id":"google","source_name":"Google News","source_priority":14,"source_url":"https://news.google.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/google.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"bbadb2c68309f1add823171734c897bc","link":"https://www.news18.com/cricket/ipl-is-our-pride-dks-shuts-down-exit-rumours-bengaluru-secures-2026-season-for-rcb-supporters-ksh-ws-l-9755679.html","title":"“IPL Is Our Pride.” DKS Shuts Down Exit Rumours; Bengaluru Secures 2026 Season For RCB Supporters","description":"DK Shivakumar ends all speculation, confirming that IPL 2026 will remain in Bengaluru.

It was good banter,” said Smith, who charged to his 23 in nine balls.“I thought the boys played exceptionally well.“The adrenaline was pumping at the end there ... It was a huge win, obviously great to go 2-0 up.”With Adelaide to come among three matches left in the series, England captain Ben Stokes refused to concede the urn was lost after battling hard in a 152-ball 50.“I absolutely believe in that dressing room,” he said.“We know we have to win these next three games.“We won’t shy away from the battle, but we need to sort things out pretty quick if we want to bring the Ashes back to England.”It would nonetheless take something extraordinary for England to win it from here.Only one team has ever come back from 2-0 down to win the series in nearly 150 years of test cricket – Don Bradman’s Australia in the home Ashes of 1936/37.Third-string attackIn Brisbane, Stokes’s England showed their fans little to suggest a Bradman-esque effort is within them.Australia, meanwhile, may only get stronger.Their Brisbane attack was third-string at best, with the dogged but unexceptional trio of Scott Boland, Neser and Brendan Doggett supporting the outstanding Starc.Left-arm quick Starc was named player-of-the-match for his eight-wicket haul and first innings 77 with the bat.“We bowled well across both innings,” said 35-year-old Starc, who now has 18 wickets for the series.“I’m pleased for Neser on his home ground.”Champion quick Pat Cummins and elite spinner Nathan Lyon will likely return at the Adelaide Oval from injury and non-selection, respectively.As it was, the duo were hardly needed.Australia’s pacers did their best work late on day three, leaving England needing another 44 runs to make the hosts bat again when they resumed on 134 for six.Stokes and all-rounder Will Jacks deserved credit for batting through the entire first session and pushing England past 200.But as the overs wore on, the Gabba wicket showed more uneven bounce, and Stokes was doubled over in agony when a Neser delivery caught an edge and cannoned into his groin.He got up to cut a single off Doggett and raise his fifty, bringing cheering England fans to their feet.It took Smith to swing the match back in Australia’s favour with a stunning slips catch to dismiss Jacks for 41 and trigger another England batting collapse.Smith leapt to his left to take a one-handed screamer above the grass when the England number eight nicked Neser behind, ending a 96-run stand with Stokes.After Neser had Stokes caught behind, Smith chipped in another two catches to help the seamers wrap up the tail, as England lost 4-17 to be all out for 241.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["none@none.com (Reuters)"],"language":"english","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-07 12:53:08","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://i.aaj.tv/large/2025/12/071746362c7ef1f.webp","video_url":null,"source_id":"aaj_tv","source_name":"Aaj English Tv","source_priority":179387,"source_url":"https://english.aaj.tv","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/aaj_tv.jpg","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"4ce0e9127f179e6d54a5e7dcb5a67755","link":"https://odishatv.in/sports/ind-vs-sa-hardik-pandya-reaches-barabati-stadium-for-net-practice-ahead-of-t20i-encounter-10889937","title":"IND vs SA: Hardik Pandya reaches Barabati Stadium for net practice ahead of T20I encounter","description":"Star Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya reached the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on Sunday evening for an intensive practice session ahead of the much awaited upcoming T20I encounter between India vs South Africa.As per reports, the utility all-rounder arrived specifically for net training and is set to practice without spectators inside the venue. Pandya will undergo a dedicated training routine, engaging in batting and bowling drills along with the net bowlers to sharpen his form before the game.The session is expected to help him fine-tune his rhythm and prepare thoroughly for the high-profile clash scheduled at the Barabati.Notably, Hardik touched down early in Bhubaneswar before the arrival of other Indian cricketers, further heightening excitement among cricket enthusiasts.Also Read: Barabati set for IND-SA T20: Hardik Pandya touches down, full Indian team to join todayFollowing a long lay-off due to injury, Hardik is expected to lend the much needed balance to the Indian line-up in the T20 format. Fans are expecting him to play a crucial role in the five-match T20I series with his medium pace bowling and power hitting in the lower middle order. While India is currently struggling to find a finisher, Hardik is expected to play that role into perfection.Notably, South Africa won the Test series emphatically. However, India bounced back to win the ODI series. Under the circumstance, both the teams will try their best to win the upcoming high-octane T20I series.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["news","sports"],"creator":["Rajendra Mohapatra"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-07 12:50:48","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1280x960/odishatv/media/media_files/2025/12/07/pandya-pix-2-2025-12-07-18-18-45.jpeg","video_url":null,"source_id":"odishatv","source_name":"Odisha Tv","source_priority":62016,"source_url":"https://odishatv.in","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/odishatv.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"949876c91f7a9331610fbd5c4e301f44","link":"https://news.google.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?oc=5","title":"Brendon McCullum responds to England's 'lack of preparation' criticism following Brisbane hammering: 'Trained too much' | Cricket - Hindustan Times","description":"Brendon McCullum responds to England's 'lack of preparation' criticism following Brisbane hammering: 'Trained too much' | Cricket Hindustan TimesBen Stokes says England have been ‘letting the pressure get to us’ in Ashes The Guardian'McCullum, you are off our coaching': Cricket board drops bombshell; sends message to England coach after Ashes defeat The Times of IndiaAshes 2025-26 - England at breaking point as Ashes dreams dismantled ESPNcricinfoStokes questions England's mentality after Brisbane loss Cricbuzz.com","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":null,"creator":null,"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-07 12:43:40","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":null,"video_url":null,"source_id":"google","source_name":"Google News","source_priority":14,"source_url":"https://news.google.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/google.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"bbadb2c68309f1add823171734c897bc","link":"https://www.news18.com/cricket/ipl-is-our-pride-dks-shuts-down-exit-rumours-bengaluru-secures-2026-season-for-rcb-supporters-ksh-ws-l-9755679.html","title":"“IPL Is Our Pride.” DKS Shuts Down Exit Rumours; Bengaluru Secures 2026 Season For RCB Supporters","description":"DK Shivakumar ends all speculation, confirming that IPL 2026 will remain in Bengaluru.

It was good banter,” said Smith, who charged to his 23 in nine balls.“I thought the boys played exceptionally well.“The adrenaline was pumping at the end there ... It was a huge win, obviously great to go 2-0 up.”With Adelaide to come among three matches left in the series, England captain Ben Stokes refused to concede the urn was lost after battling hard in a 152-ball 50.“I absolutely believe in that dressing room,” he said.“We know we have to win these next three games.“We won’t shy away from the battle, but we need to sort things out pretty quick if we want to bring the Ashes back to England.”It would nonetheless take something extraordinary for England to win it from here.Only one team has ever come back from 2-0 down to win the series in nearly 150 years of test cricket – Don Bradman’s Australia in the home Ashes of 1936/37.Third-string attackIn Brisbane, Stokes’s England showed their fans little to suggest a Bradman-esque effort is within them.Australia, meanwhile, may only get stronger.Their Brisbane attack was third-string at best, with the dogged but unexceptional trio of Scott Boland, Neser and Brendan Doggett supporting the outstanding Starc.Left-arm quick Starc was named player-of-the-match for his eight-wicket haul and first innings 77 with the bat.“We bowled well across both innings,” said 35-year-old Starc, who now has 18 wickets for the series.“I’m pleased for Neser on his home ground.”Champion quick Pat Cummins and elite spinner Nathan Lyon will likely return at the Adelaide Oval from injury and non-selection, respectively.As it was, the duo were hardly needed.Australia’s pacers did their best work late on day three, leaving England needing another 44 runs to make the hosts bat again when they resumed on 134 for six.Stokes and all-rounder Will Jacks deserved credit for batting through the entire first session and pushing England past 200.But as the overs wore on, the Gabba wicket showed more uneven bounce, and Stokes was doubled over in agony when a Neser delivery caught an edge and cannoned into his groin.He got up to cut a single off Doggett and raise his fifty, bringing cheering England fans to their feet.It took Smith to swing the match back in Australia’s favour with a stunning slips catch to dismiss Jacks for 41 and trigger another England batting collapse.Smith leapt to his left to take a one-handed screamer above the grass when the England number eight nicked Neser behind, ending a 96-run stand with Stokes.After Neser had Stokes caught behind, Smith chipped in another two catches to help the seamers wrap up the tail, as England lost 4-17 to be all out for 241.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["none@none.com (Reuters)"],"language":"english","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-07 12:53:08","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://i.aaj.tv/large/2025/12/071746362c7ef1f.webp","video_url":null,"source_id":"aaj_tv","source_name":"Aaj English Tv","source_priority":179387,"source_url":"https://english.aaj.tv","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/aaj_tv.jpg","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"4ce0e9127f179e6d54a5e7dcb5a67755","link":"https://odishatv.in/sports/ind-vs-sa-hardik-pandya-reaches-barabati-stadium-for-net-practice-ahead-of-t20i-encounter-10889937","title":"IND vs SA: Hardik Pandya reaches Barabati Stadium for net practice ahead of T20I encounter","description":"Star Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya reached the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on Sunday evening for an intensive practice session ahead of the much awaited upcoming T20I encounter between India vs South Africa.As per reports, the utility all-rounder arrived specifically for net training and is set to practice without spectators inside the venue. Pandya will undergo a dedicated training routine, engaging in batting and bowling drills along with the net bowlers to sharpen his form before the game.The session is expected to help him fine-tune his rhythm and prepare thoroughly for the high-profile clash scheduled at the Barabati.Notably, Hardik touched down early in Bhubaneswar before the arrival of other Indian cricketers, further heightening excitement among cricket enthusiasts.Also Read: Barabati set for IND-SA T20: Hardik Pandya touches down, full Indian team to join todayFollowing a long lay-off due to injury, Hardik is expected to lend the much needed balance to the Indian line-up in the T20 format. Fans are expecting him to play a crucial role in the five-match T20I series with his medium pace bowling and power hitting in the lower middle order. While India is currently struggling to find a finisher, Hardik is expected to play that role into perfection.Notably, South Africa won the Test series emphatically. However, India bounced back to win the ODI series. Under the circumstance, both the teams will try their best to win the upcoming high-octane T20I series.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["news","sports"],"creator":["Rajendra Mohapatra"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-07 12:50:48","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1280x960/odishatv/media/media_files/2025/12/07/pandya-pix-2-2025-12-07-18-18-45.jpeg","video_url":null,"source_id":"odishatv","source_name":"Odisha Tv","source_priority":62016,"source_url":"https://odishatv.in","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/odishatv.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"949876c91f7a9331610fbd5c4e301f44","link":"https://news.google.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?oc=5","title":"Brendon McCullum responds to England's 'lack of preparation' criticism following Brisbane hammering: 'Trained too much' | Cricket - Hindustan Times","description":"Brendon McCullum responds to England's 'lack of preparation' criticism following Brisbane hammering: 'Trained too much' | Cricket Hindustan TimesBen Stokes says England have been ‘letting the pressure get to us’ in Ashes The Guardian'McCullum, you are off our coaching': Cricket board drops bombshell; sends message to England coach after Ashes defeat The Times of IndiaAshes 2025-26 - England at breaking point as Ashes dreams dismantled ESPNcricinfoStokes questions England's mentality after Brisbane loss Cricbuzz.com","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":null,"creator":null,"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-07 12:43:40","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":null,"video_url":null,"source_id":"google","source_name":"Google News","source_priority":14,"source_url":"https://news.google.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/google.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"bbadb2c68309f1add823171734c897bc","link":"https://www.news18.com/cricket/ipl-is-our-pride-dks-shuts-down-exit-rumours-bengaluru-secures-2026-season-for-rcb-supporters-ksh-ws-l-9755679.html","title":"“IPL Is Our Pride.” DKS Shuts Down Exit Rumours; Bengaluru Secures 2026 Season For RCB Supporters","description":"DK Shivakumar ends all speculation, confirming that IPL 2026 will remain in Bengaluru.
