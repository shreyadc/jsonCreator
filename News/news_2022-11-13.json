The passage of 2009 champions into the final could even beat a Hollywood thriller script as they were down and out after the first week of the tournament with morale shattering defeats to arch-rivals India and Zimbabwe. Pakistan raised hopes of a dramatic comeback in the second week of a tournament with a win over South Africa and a prayer on their lips for some divine intervention. Just like in 1992, miracle happened when the Netherlands produced a performance for the ages to shock South Africa and out of nowhere, Pakistan were back in contention for a semifinal berth. Critics say that in cricket, you never know which Pakistan turns on a particular day and the semifinal performance against a well rounded New Zealand side showed that when it comes to playing edge of the seat ‘Russian Roulette’, the ‘Green Machines’ are second to none. But just like everyone wants a slice of ’92 from Babar’s team, the core of this current English team also has a date with history on this very Australian soil. Seven years ago in 2015, this was the country where England’s white ball cricket lay in tatters after they were dumped out of the competition at the group league stage by Bangladesh. The white ball cricket transformation started with horses for courses approach by the ECB, leading to a sea change in the mindset and intent of the English players. That fearless approach was on full display against India on Thursday. The Shaheen Shah Afridis, Mohammed Wasim Jr.and the Harris Raufs will need way more than just inspiration to get past the likes of Jos Buttler, Alex Hales, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali. These are all sought after practitioners of T20 cricket and all of them have abilities to silence the 80,000 odd Pakistan fans, just like they did with the bulk of the 42,000 Indian fans in Adelaide. Can Afridi do a Wasim Akram when Buttler is batting or Babar and Rizwan take the game deep in their own style like Imran Khan and Javed Miandad did in that 1992 final. Big matches always brings big performer to the centre stage and Stokes for one wouldn’t mind a repeat of his 2019 Lord’s performance to win the silverware. The weather forecast predicts that the final could be marred by rain on both Sunday and the reserve day, which is Monday. Unlike a normal T20 game which could be a minimum five-over contest, the event technical committee has kept provisions for minimum 10-overs a side contest with an early (3 pm Melbourne time) start on reserve day if needed. On a spicy deck like the MCG, the presence of Mark Wood would have been an advantage but the tearaway quick’s back isn’t holding up well. Despite the pasting he got from Hardik Pandya, Chris Jordan is a fine T20 bowler in his own rights and would like to use his extensive BBL experience to get the better of the Pakistani batters. If both batting units are taken into account, England with Hales, Buttler, Stokes, Phil Salt (in place of Dawid Malan), Harry Brook, Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone look stronger on paper against Pakistan with Rizwan, Babar, Shan Masood, Mohammed Haris and Iftikhar Ahmed. —PTI But on big days, it is not always the names that matter but also the mindset and temperament to last the distance.

England romped to a 10-wicket victory on Thursday at the Adelaide Oval, chasing down the 169-run target with four overs to spare to set up a final on Sunday against India’s arch-rivals Pakistan. Openers Alex Hales (86 not out) and Jos Buttler (80 not out) did the damage against a muted Indian bowling attack lacking both fire and fury. Cricket is by far the most popular sport in the world’s second most populous country, but India have not won a global title since the 2013 Champions Trophy and the painful wait goes on. The thrashing was met with disappointment, anger and demands for heads to roll. Reports on Friday said the T20 squad will start undergoing a major transition in the coming days, with prominent senior players including Rohit, Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin being gradually eased out. Kohli hit four half-centuries at this World Cup, including heroics to beat Pakistan in India’s tournament opener, but at age 34 the superstar batsman is not seen as the future. “You will not see most of the seniors playing T20 next year,” the Press Trust of India quoted a source in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as saying. The India team could look very different the next time the T20 World Cup comes along, in the US and West Indies in 2024. “Absolutely not the right time to talk about this stuff or think about this stuff right now,” coach Rahul Dravid said in the aftermath of his team’s beating when asked about the future of his senior players. Former cricketer Sunil Valson told AFP that India were outplayed in every aspect against a ruthless England. “The selectors must sit down and see and work out a new combination,” the former fast bowler said. Former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh suggested India install a new head coach who has retired from playing more recently than Dravid, 49, and name Hardik Pandya as captain in place of Rohit. Batting great Sunil Gavaskar said that the Indian selectors had already “sent the signal” to senior players by picking the 29-year-old Pandya as skipper for an upcoming T20 series in New Zealand. “There could be retirements, there are a lot of players in their mid-30s who might consider their future in international T20s,” he said on air after the semi-final. POWERLESS POWER PLAY India are ranked the world’s top T20 team but they were criticised for slow scoring in the powerplay, huffing and puffing their way to 38-1 off their first six overs, while England raced to 63 without loss. Veteran journalist Rajdeep Sardesai said India needed new blood who were less conservative. “We lost [the] game in the first 10 overs when we played timidly. Need a Gen next that bats at strike rate of 150-plus, and wicket-taking bowlers,” he tweeted. —Agencies Dravid acknowledged that the Indian cricket board’s ban on players entering overseas T20 tournaments, such as Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL), had hurt them. “A lot of our boys maybe do miss out on the opportunities of playing in a lot of these leagues,” he said. But allowing them to do so would eviscerate longer forms of the Indian game, he added. “It’s right in the middle of our season, and with the kind of demand there would be for Indian players, if you allowed all the Indian players to play in these leagues, we would not have a domestic cricket.” He added: “Our domestic trophy, our Ranji trophy, would be finished, and that would mean Test cricket would be finished.” Even Kohli not safe as India plot change after England drubbing added by Press Trust of India on 11:55 pm November 12, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-11-12 18:25:58","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Enjoyed opening batting more with Tendulkar than irender Sehwag: Ganguly","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/11/12/enjoyed-opening-batting-more-with-tendulkar-than-irender-sehwag-ganguly/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"ABU DHABI: Former Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly on Friday said he enjoyed opening the batting with Sachin Tendulkar more than he did with Virender Sehwag, as Sachin made him a better player.

In a rapid fire round, Ganguly was asked, between Sachin and Sehwag, who he enjoyed opening the innings more with. “Sachin was the most sane one and Sehwag was insane. So it’s Sachin. He actually also made me a better player,” he said. “Sachin actually got me lift my game.” To another question, which living person he admired the most, Ganguly against chose to name the little master. “Sachin. He was special and I have seen him up close. I have seen him hit in rib cage. Did not make a noise. Got runs. The next morning he had a double fracture in ribs. “I heard a sound and I went and asked him you are okay. He said he was fine. The next morning he had fractures. He was special,” he said. On what was more challenging — test in Australia or test in England, he said Australia. Asked to choose between what role he prefer to be in, captain of India and BCCI President, Ganguly chose to go with the cricket team. When asked to choose between India’s win in Kolkata test in 2001 at home or India’s win at Lords in Natwest Cup final in 2002, he said: “2001 win at home as it changed the team. It changed the belief in team.” Ganguly named Sri Lankan spinner Muralidharan, especially as he was getting on in age, as someone who gave him nightmares. “Older he became, the better he became. I found Murali the hardest when he was older,” Ganguly said. Before the rapid fire, Ganguly spoke at length about leadership and said it is important to listen to others. “It’s not my way or highway,” he said and cited several examples. Having been in several leadership positions, he also talked about importance of having an eye to find the right talent and giving it adequate opportunity. “You create an atmosphere to express themselves.” As a piece of advice, he suggested that one should retire from the game on a high. On how to handle pressure, Ganguly said it was all about training the mind. —PTI Enjoyed opening batting more with Tendulkar than irender Sehwag: Ganguly added by Press Trust of India on 11:54 pm November 12, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-11-12 18:24:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs New Zealand: Munish Bali to be India’s fielding coach in New Zealand","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/11/12/india-vs-new-zealand-munish-bali-to-be-indias-fielding-coach-in-new-zealand/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI: Munish Bali has been named fielding coach for India’s limited overs tour of New Zealand and will be part of the support staff headed by VVS Laxman.

FirstCricket Staff November 12th, 2022 22:21:58 IST Shoaib Akhtar said India need to reconsider their leadership after T20 World Cup debacle. AP Following India’s disappointing performance in the T20 World Cup semifinal against England, former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar said Indian cricket is at its lowest with confusion in team selection, especially in the bowling department. Indian bowlers felt the ire of English openers, who took just 16 overs to chase down 169 without losing a wicket on an Adelaide surface that provided no swing during the match while Indian spinners Axar Patel and R Ashwin couldn’t make much out of the pitch that was gripping the ball. “Indian fast bowling ke paas express fast bowlers nahi hai. Cut-throat spinners nahi hain. Confusing selection ke saath India andar gaya, aur badi maar khaayi. Conditions ke fast bowlers hain India ke, jahan conditions mil gayi toh khelte rahenge. Lekin very disappointing performance from India. India doesn’t deserve to meet us in MCG, or allowed to take a flight to come to Melbourne, because unki cricket aaj expose hui hai. (India don’t have express fast bowlers or impactful spinners. They had a confusing selection. Their pacers can perform if conditions suit them),” said Akhtar on his Youtube channel. The 47-year-old retired bowler, who holds the record for fastest delivery, said India can’t really celebrate the fact that they reached the semifinal in a World Cup that had four good teams contending for the title while little solace could be taken from their run where they defeated the team “Semifinal tak pohochna kaunsi badi baat hai? 4 achhi teams hain total, unme se bhi Netherlands ko haraana ya Zimbabwe ko haraake pohoch jaana… koi badi baat nahi hai. Indian cricket is at the lowest right now because when it comes to ICC events, India ko apni kaptaani dekhni hogi, management ko blame lena hoga, bowling department me confusing selection ke saath Shami ko uthaake le aaye. Achhe fast bowler hain lekin banta nahi tha. (What’s so big in reaching semis? There were 4 good teams in total. You beat Netherlands and Zimbabwe, nothing big. India need to look at their leadership, management needs to take accountability. It was a confusing selection),” he added.

Besides Barclay’s re-election, BCCI secretary Jay Shah was elected as the head of ICC’s all-powerful Finance and Commercial Affairs (F&CA) committee at the board meeting. Barclay was unopposed following the withdrawal of Zimabwe’s Tavengwa Mukuhlani from the process, and the ICC Board reaffirmed its full support to the New Zealander to continue at the helm. “It is an honour to be re-elected as the Chair of the International Cricket Council and I would like to thank my fellow ICC Directors for their support,” said Barclay on his re-appointment. “Over the last two years we have made significant strides forward with the launch of our global growth strategy that provides clear direction to build a successful and sustainable future for our sport. “It is an exciting time to be involved in cricket and I look forward to continuing to work closely with our Members to strengthen the game in our core markets as well as grow it beyond that, ensuring more of the world can enjoy cricket.” Barclay, an Auckland-based commercial lawyer, was originally appointed as the ICC Chair in November 2020. He was previously the Chair of New Zealand Cricket (NZC) and was a director of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2015. He being elected unopposed also means that he had the backing of the mighty BCCI in the 17-member board. “I would like to congratulate Greg on his re-appointment as ICC Chair, as the continuity his leadership will provide is in the best interests of the sport. I therefore decided to withdraw my candidacy,” said Mukuhlani. Jay Shah to head F&CA committee ===================== Shah will have the responsibility of heading ICC’s most important committee. Al the major financial policy decisions are taken by the F&CA committee before it is ratified by the ICC board. “Each and every member accepted Jay as the head of F&CA committee. This is an equally powerful sub committee apart from the ICC chair (Greg Barclay),” an ICC source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. It includes the revenue sharing among the member nations and also the various major sponsorship deals that the global body inks through the year. The F&CA committee is always headed by an ICC Board member and Shah’s election makes it clear that he will represent the BCCI on the ICC Board. The F&CA head’s position used to be India’s during the N Srinivasan era but during Shashank Manohar’s tenure as ICC chairman, the BCCI’s power and might had significantly reduced. In fact during the Committee of Administrators’ tenure, there was a point when BCCI didn’t even have any representation in the F&CA committee. Former BCCI president Sourav Ganguly was a member of the F&CA committee till last year. “India is a commercial hub of global cricket with more than 70 percent sponsorship coming from the region. It is imperative that an ICC F&CA should always be headed by BCCI,” the ICC source said. Ganguly to remain ICC Cricket Committee head ============================= Former India captain Ganguly, who completed his tenure as BCCI president last month, will remain the head of ICC’s Cricket Committee.

FirstCricket Staff November 12th, 2022 20:46:36 IST Paksitan defeated England in 50-over World Cup final in 1992 to lift their maiden world title. Twitter Pakistan vs England T20 World Cup final builds up as a rematch of 1992’s 50-over World Cup final that saw the Asian side triumph over the makers of the game at Melbourne Cricket Ground, which is also the venue for Sunday’s final. Remembering the painful memories of the defeat, former English all-rounder Chris Lewis urged Jos Buttler-led side to show up in the mega final unlike them 30 years ago. T20 World Cup Home | Schedule | Results | Points Table | T20 World Cup News | Photos “At some point in that tournament, each of our players came to the fore and we had a great run. Every country played everyone else in the group stage and we were the best team,” Lewis told Daily Mail. “So to get to the final and not show up was the disappointment. It’s the one thing I would be telling this England team to guard against. When you get to a final, a lot of the hard work has been done, but it’s the last part that everyone has come for — the opportunity to be champions. You’ve got to get over the line.” England head into the game high on confidence as they thrashed India by 10 wickets in the semifinals with Jos Buttler and Alex Hales dominating the experienced bowling line-up in Adelaide. However, Lewis feels presence of a left-arm pacer among Pakistan’s bowling ranks in Shaheen Afridi will be a crucial point in the marquee clash. “Bowling left-arm is a wonderful weapon to have, when you do it at close to 90mph (145kmph approx.) and go full. If it swings, it means you are bringing lbw, bowled, everything into the equation in the powerplay, and against Pakistan that is a critical time of the game,” said Lewis, who played 32 Tests and 58 ODIs for England between 1990 and 1998. “What we saw against India in the semi-final was a lack of swing, which allowed our two guys at the top to charge away. So that makes the start of England’s innings a very interesting battle. If they can get over Afridi’s initial burst, it will set them up for the kind of score they’ll need to win.” Lewis, however, added that England have serious pace in Mark Wood too and that will be a scare for Pakistan’s openers, irrespective of their forms. “That bit of extra pace — no, a lot of extra pace — is always useful, especially against the Pakistan openers Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan. They have had their struggles at this World Cup but seem to have found their feet now and it’s important when England are bowling that they don’t settle. “It is perhaps easier to knock the other England bowlers around because they do not possess the same threat as Wood, someone who’s been bowling at 95mph plus. If you look to take him on, it’s a real risk,” he said. Read all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.

FirstCricket Staff November 12th, 2022 19:46:49 IST England defeated India by 10 wickets in semifinals to setup T20 World Cup final against Pakistan. AP As England and Pakistan are all set to square off in T20 World Cup final in Melbourne, in what is deemed as the rematch of 1992 World Cup final, Kevin Pietersen said only England can stop themselves from winning the title as he predicts it to be a ‘sixathon’ given the top form of English batters. T20 World Cup Home | Schedule | Results | Points Table | T20 World Cup News | Photos “Pakistan needs to hope that England self-destructs by being reckless and overconfident.

I am predicting a comfortable win for England,” wrote Pietersen in his column for Betway . The former England captain confidence oozes from the fact that the English side thrash prime title contenders India by 10 wickets in the T20 World Cup semifinal in Adelaide on Thursday. Jos Buttler and Alex Hales scored 80-odd runs as England chased down 169 in just 16 overs. “The England performance ranks right up there. It was convincing as anything because that Indian team is star-studded. To beat them as convincingly as they did was spectacular. I had little doubt about the result as India posted 169 on board.

FP Trending November 12th, 2022 18:21:53 IST Irfan Pathan gives befitting reply to Pakistan's PM. Image: Irfan Pathan/Twitter Former India cricketer Irfan Pathan came up with a stern response to Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s sarcastic tweet after India’s disappointing exit from the ICC T20 World Cup. Team India’s dream of lifting their second T20 World Cup title came to an end after the side slumped to a thumping 10-wicket defeat against England in the second semi-final. With India’s exit, cricket enthusiasts who were waiting for an India-Pakistan battle in the final, were left disheartened. However, some Pakistan fans also slammed the Rohit Sharma-led unit for failing on the occasion despite being one of the tournament favourites. In this context, Prime Minister Sharif also joined them in rubbing salts into the wound with a tricky tweet. So, this Sunday, it’s: 152/0 vs 170/0 🇵🇰 🇬🇧 #T20WorldCup — Shehbaz Sharif (@CMShehbaz) November 10, 2022 Referring to Pakistan’s 10-wicket triumph over India in the 2021 T20 World Cup Group stage, Sharif wrote, “So, this Sunday, it’s 152/0 vs 170/0.” The remark unquestionably did not go down well with Indian fans. They brutally criticised the Pakistan PM for making this kind of statement despite being such a respectable figure. Now, Pathan has taken a step forward and replied to Sharif’s post. Aap mein or hum mein fark yehi hai. Hum apni khushi se khush or aap dusre ke taklif se. Is liye khud ke mulk ko behtar karne pe dhyan nahi hai. — Irfan Pathan (@IrfanPathan) November 12, 2022 The ex-India player stated, “Aap mein or hum mein fark yehi hai. Hum apni khushi se khush or aap dusre ke taklif se. Is liye khud ke mulk ko behtar karne pe dhyan nahi hai. (This is the difference between you and us. We are happy with our happiness and you, with others’ pain. That is why you can’t focus on the development of your own country).” In the comment section, a lot of Indian supporters took a stand by Pathan and appreciated his words. Pakistan and England will square off for the T20 World Cup Final on Saturday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. However, according to weather experts, the title bout can be affected by rain. The highly anticipated game is now potentially in danger due to the La Nina weather phenomenon. The top clash can be shifted to the reserve day on Monday since the Bureau of Meteorology forecasts a 95% chance of rain in the Victorian Capital on Sunday evening.

In this case, the England-Pakistan final has been repeated on Australian soil after 1992. Opinions about it are crawling. At that time Pakistan team led by Imran Khan defeated England and won the World Cup. Also, even now, Pakistan fans have longed to win the World Cup by defeating England. They are expressing this desire in many ways. A few quarters of Indian sentiments are comforted by the trend of ‘good thing India-Pakistan would rather lose to England than lose to Pakistan in the final’. But, Indian fans are different… everyone is different. This is about the final Let’s rank the various moods of Indian fans: India didn’t make it to the final either, so you can watch the England-Pakistan final without any tension. Pakistan is our enemy, so in the end that team should not win the trophy. England must win. England beat us very badly, so Pakistan should win, but England should never win. England should win, at least for Buttler. Babar Azam has just become the captain and Pakistan should not win the ICC trophy under the captaincy of Babar Azam till then. India lost to Zimbabwe and Pakistan was not a qualified team to win the trophy. After losing to Ireland and losing to Sri Lanka, England came to the last over and set a target of 140 runs to win the trophy. Who will win the final without ‘En Thalaivan Kohli’ playing? As soon as Dhoni left, cricket went away sir! Who won and what? What if you lose? Watch cricket cricket pro! American poet Wallace Stevens wrote the poem Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird. If you look at the England-Pakistan final as an object like that black bird, you can say that Indian fans see it in 10 ways, from 10 angles. (You can share the missing angles in the comment section) These are all different mindsets. It can be said that it is a plurality of moods. But all these are somewhat one-sided views. Even among those with a ‘cricket as cricket pro’ mentality, there will be people who hold such a grudge against India not qualifying for the finals. All these may somehow be centered on India-Pakistan political tension views. An alternative to these mindsets can be emphasized aesthetic vision. That is, enjoying the beauty of those cover drives, on drives, midwicket drives, cutshots by Babar Assam. Admiring Rizwan’s bullshot beauty. Or enjoying Ibtikhar’s middle-over prowess and his ability to hit sixes at intervals along with his unique cricketing skills. Or Buttler relishing Hales’ brilliant shot selection, appreciating the subtleties of how Adil Rashid drops key players from Pakistan like Suryakumar Yadav when he schemed that day. Beyond wins and losses, a neutral view is to appreciate the techniques of cricket and the aesthetics of the game. It is good for physical/mental health to enjoy the match to improve the taste of cricket rather than cricket fanaticism fueled by hate politics. Maintaining a distance between the real world of the viewer’s self-awareness and the fictional world of a televised cricket match is called aesthetic distance. Because nowadays before a match, especially India-Pakistan match advertisements, media including digital and social media do not allow this aesthetic distance and force the fans to watch the match emotionally. The theory of aesthetic distancing can be of great help in getting rid of the emotional boiling point of attitudes caused by this crowded media. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant in his book Critique of Judgment describes a state of happiness that is selfless and devoid of self. There should be no desire or attachment to a particular object, let’s assume that in our environment cricket matches are especially India-Pakistan matches. Broadcast media has transformed it into an object or commodity. Therefore, what Immanuel Kant says is to relinquish the desire for a commodified object and enjoy the intrinsic beauty of that particular object or game or creation. That is, to temporarily put aside our self-created demands, our attitudes about the game, and our imposed thoughts and focus on the intrinsic beauty of the game and enjoy it is an example of a healthy, aesthetic mindset. Psychologists say that such aesthetic vision is a means of freeing us from narrow thoughts and elevating us.

Prasad Gloom of the Graveyard’ engulfed 1.35 billion Indians and fans across the world as our boys failed to hold the nerves in an important/ crucial encounter and threw away the match in abject surrender. In lighter vein, we can only surmise that our boys pleased the Police Officers in Birmingham and Leicester. In an exhibition of masterclass, openers Jos Buttler (80 at 163 strike rate) and Alex Hales (86 at 182) went ‘Hammer and Tongs’ from the 1st over to script an unbroken partnership of 170 to humiliate India. Hearty congratulations to England on their massive victory. They proceed to Melbourne Cricket Grounds to play the finals against Pakistan on Sunday. Best to both the teams. Good contest is what we look forward to. T20 is a format where a combination of skill and risk taking works wonders. Strike rates of the top order determines the course of a match. As skipper Jos Buttler put it in the post match interview, he and Alex Hales could belt it out because he relied on team’s depth in batting. A ten-wicket victory in 16 overs chasing 168 is a great psychological advantage they carry into the finals. Best to the Engishmen on Sunday. On a hard and dry surface, Jos Buttler called it right and chose to bowl. Gloom set in as K.L. Rahul yet again got out with an awkward fishing attempt; a nothing shot; a sign of his diffidence in big games. The adverse impact of KLR’s dismissal was evident in skipper Rohit Sharma as he got out trying to accelerate. Thanks to some brilliant batting by Virat Kohli (50 at 125 strike rate) and Hardik Pandya (63 at 191), we could set a decent target of 168 at 8.45 strike rate. READ ALSO Remembering the legendary Martin David Crowe Though not a daunting target, it was defendable provided our bowlers had stuck to line and length in the first few overs to restrict the Englishmen through early wickets. But Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Shami and Hardik Pandya were all wayward and leaked runs heavily. Surprisingly, well-flighted deliveries (sporadic though) caused anxiety in both Buttler and Hales. But both Axar Patel and Ashwin failed to watch and exploit their psyche as they too leaked runs heavily, bowling more of flat trajectory. Across tournaments, fact is that our seamers have been very inconsistent. Whereas they bowled superbly against Pakistan and South Africa, mediocrity was writ large against the English. While analysing the journey in this ICC T20 World Cup, we need to admit that it was never rosy. In the preliminaries, victories against Pakistan and Bangladesh were ‘Touch and Go’. Defeat to South Africa was ridiculous. All meaning that the management and the selectors have a lot to work on. They should be brave to ask a few to step aside and restructure the team. Novelty is the key and it needs guts.

FirstCricket Staff November 12th, 2022 16:43:31 IST Pakistan pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi celebrates a dismissal during their Super 12 clash against Netherlands. AP The 2022 T20 World Cup has nearly reached its conclusion, with just one match left in the itinerary — the big final at the equally big ‘G’. Pakistan and England square off in the grand finale at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday in what will be a repeat of the 1992 ODI World Cup final, although this time it will be contested in the 20-over format. T20 World Cup: Full coverage | Schedule | Results | Points Table | News | Photos Both teams are coming off convincing victories in the semi-finals; Pakistan continued their fairy-tale run in the World Cup by comfortably chasing down the 153-run target set by New Zealand in the first semi-final in Sydney on Wednesday. The team that was staring at the prospect of an early flight back home instead finds itself on the cusp of a miracle. The India-England semi-final in Adelaide the following day was even more one-sided, with the opening pair of Jos Buttler and Alex Hales responding to the 169-run target set by the Men in Blue with an unbroken 170-run stand in just 16 overs, guiding the side to its third ICC World Cup final (both ODI and T20I) in four editions with the 10-wicket thrashing. Both teams have won one World Cup each — Pakistan had followed their 2007 heartbreak with a victory over Sri Lanka in the 2009 final at Lord’s. England would then ended their wait for a maiden World Cup title by defeating arch-rivals Australia in the 2010 final in Bridgetown. The winner of the final on Sunday will join West Indies as one of the only two nations with multiple T20 World Cup wins. Ahead of the final, we take a look at some of the key battles and match-ups between the two sides: Shaheen Afridi vs Jos Buttler and Alex Hales Buttler and Hales are without a doubt the biggest talking point ahead of the final, given the manner in which they tore the hapless Indian bowling unit apart on Thursday. The pair has clicked brilliantly in this tournament and might just become England’s go-to opening combo in future games. Despite their 170-run unbroken stand, Buttler and Hales will be wary of the Pakistani bowling attack, especially Shaheen Shah Afridi. The left-arm pacer struggled initially in the tournament, but is peaking at the right time. Afridi had starred in the crucial win against Bangladesh with a four-wicket haul and got rid of dangerous opener Finn Allen early in the powerplay in the semi-final clash. And come Sunday, he’ll hope his lethal yorkers are able to contain the firepower at the top of the English batting order. Mark Wood vs Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan English pacer Mark Wood could have an impact on the Pakistani top-order similar to what Afridi would against Buttler and Hales, provided he’s declared fit for the final and is brought back into the XI in place of Chris Jordan. Wood had complained of “stiffness” after their final Super 12 clash against Sri Lanka and had subsequently missed the semi-final clash against India. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ICC (@icc) Wood has been lethal throughout this tournament, going past the 150 kmph-mark far more often than any other bowler and the destruction that his sheer pace unleashes could help England get rid of Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, the Pakistani opening pair that had looked patchy for the most part in the tournament but dominated the New Zealand attack on Wednesday with a 105-run stand. Iftikhar Ahmed vs left-arm seam Iftikhar Ahmed has been among the most consistent performers for Pakistan this year, dishing out match-winning performances in the Asia Cup earlier this year as well as in the ongoing T20 World Cup. The right-hand batter has collected two half-centuries so far in this tournament, against India and South Africa respectively, striking better than some of his superstar teammates who bat above him, and remains a vital cog in the middle-order. There is an area of concern for him though — he had been dismissed five times by left-arm seamers in the seven-match T20I series against England before the T20 World Cup — twice each by Sam Curran and David Willey and once by Luke Wood — and once in the ongoing tournament (Mustafizur Rahman). Expect Buttler to deploy Curran, who is among the leading wicket-takers this tournament, to prise out this wicket. Moeen Ali vs Shadab Khan Moeen Ali’s form with the bat nosedived in the T20 World Cup after a stellar run in the Pakistan tour, where he also led the team in Buttler’s absence, and is due a big knock in this tournament. And given his ability to handle spin fairly well, he might just well be looked at as the man to tackle the Shadab Khan threat in the middle overs. Shadab himself has delivered with the ball consistently in this tournament besides also starring with the bat in the crunch game against South Africa, and the Englishmen will be wary of the threat that he poses besides the fiery pacers. It’s worth noting that Moeen has a strike rate of 177 in his head-to-head battle with Shadab in the shortest format. Ben Stokes vs Haris Rauf Should this contest turn into another nail-biter, if the weather gods permit the game to go ahead without a hitch that is, we could witness a contest for the ages in the death overs. England all-rounder and Test captain Ben Stokes has won many a match for his side across formats, including the 2019 ODI World Cup final, and his finishing abilities were once again on display in the Super 12 clash against Sri Lanka, where he steered his side to safety from a shaky position. Standing up when your country needs you. Shock horror, Ben Stokes gets it done. #T20WorldCup pic.twitter.com/meMHHgCofx — England’s Barmy Army (@TheBarmyArmy) November 5, 2022 Haris Rauf, another Pakistani who has achieved worldwide fame with his lethal pace, is one of Pakistan’s favoured options for the death overs and a battle between Stokes and Rauf in the final four overs already sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. Rauf for once, would be hoping to bury the disappointment of getting hit for back-to-back sixes by Virat Kohli earlier in the tournament with a performance for the ages in the summit clash.

Manage Preference Injuries to Mark Wood’s right hip and Dawid Malan’s left groin saw the pair sidelined against India and, while a big blow for both, they were hardly missed as England seized a 10-wicket win. Head coach Matthew Mott said on Friday “everything would have to go right for them to be available at the moment” but Wood bowled what looked close to full tilt in the nets on Saturday while Malan had an extended batting session. Whether their outings at practice are enough to convince England of their fitness remains to be seen but they are no longer the major doubts they were at the start of the weekend. If they do come back in then it will probably be Chris Jordan and Phil Salt who drop out again.

Pakistan will have their fingers crossed history repeats itself as they defeated Graham Gooch’s England 30 years ago. Ramiz Raja, the Pakistan Cricket Board chair, opened the batting on that day and regaled the contemporary side about that famous 22-run win earlier this week in an effort to inspire them.

Expand Close Rain has been an unwelcome feature during the T20 World Cup visits to Melbourne (Scott Barbour/PA) PA / Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Rain has been an unwelcome feature during the T20 World Cup visits to Melbourne (Scott Barbour/PA) Several forecasts paint a bleak picture. The tournament’s previous visits to Melbourne have been soggy affairs, with three washouts and a rain-affected England-Ireland finale in six group stages matches. There is a reserve day on Monday but that could also be impacted by the weather, with the ICC changing its tournament rules as two hours have been added to allow play to continue into the evening in a bid to get at least 10 overs per side completed. If that cannot happen on either day then the underwhelming result would be the teams would share the trophy, bringing an ill-fitting end to the tournament. England’s last dance? Expand Close Jos Buttler insisted this England team can compete in future tournaments (PA) PA / Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Jos Buttler insisted this England team can compete in future tournaments (PA) In England’s 15-strong squad, only Phil Salt, Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran and Harry Brook are aged under 30. Moeen Ali and Malan are 35, Jordan and Adil Rashid are a year younger although Jos Buttler was adamant there remains plenty of life in the older dogs yet. The 32-year-old England captain said: “In the professional age you can generally play a little bit longer if you look after yourself and of course there’s always plenty to play for.” With the 50-over World Cup in India next year, England will probably not look at regeneration until after then given how they have performed here. Beware Pakistan’s pace attack Expand Close Shaheen Shah Afridi has been terrific at the T20 World Cup (Rick Rycroft/AP) AP/PA Images / Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Shaheen Shah Afridi has been terrific at the T20 World Cup (Rick Rycroft/AP) Buttler and Alex Hales lit up the Adelaide Oval with their belligerent batting in England’s thrashing of India on Thursday. The MCG pitch, used in India’s win over Zimbabwe, has shorter straight and longer square boundaries in contrast to the ground they were presented with in the semi-final. Pakistan’s bowling attack has been the most formidable at this tournament with a fantastic economy rate – quicks Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and Mohammad Wasim and leg-spinner Shadab Khan have been going at less than 6.7 an over. If England are to win then disrupting this quartet likely offers their best hope.","pubDate":"2022-11-12 10:40:26","image_url":"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/df814/42138801.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/bpanews_355f6d0b-7e7f-4cca-bdbc-d92afde26a49_1","source_id":"belfasttelegraph","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Dhoni joining BJP?: Cricket fans can't keep calm as CSK captain meets Home Minister Amit Shah","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ms-dhoni-meets-home-minister-amit-shah-fans-ask-if-csk-captain-is-joining-bjp-2534353.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"With a record of winning the most ICC trophies as a captain for India, Dhoni is India's most successful captain.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-12 10:26:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BCCI secretary Jay Shah to head Finance and Commercial Affairs Committee of ICC","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/bcci-secretary-jay-shah-to-head-finance-and-commercial-affairs-committee-of-icc-11616431.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"BCCI secretary Jay Shah to head Finance and Commercial Affairs Committee of ICC","content":"BCCI Secretary Jay Shah will add another feather to his cap as he is slated to head the influential Finance and Commercial Affairs committee of the International Cricket Council (ICC).The international cricket governing body’s Finance & Commercial Affairs committee decides budget allocations for ICC events and looks after the distribution of money to member countries from the overall revenue pool.More than a week prior to this weekend’s ICC Board meetings in Melbourne, the BCCI team, led by Jay Shah and IPL chairman Arun Dhumal, arrived in Australia.
