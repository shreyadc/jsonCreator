After Mark Wood dragged the tourists back into a competitive position with a career-best six-wicket haul, England once again fell in a heap with the bat to hand Australia a 4-0 Ashes win on a platter.

Join Kayo Now > Rory Burns and Zak Crawley put on 68 for the first wicket before England proceeded to lose all 10 wickets for a mere 56 runs in a horror evening session in Hobart on Sunday. As has been the story all summer, England’s brittle batting line-up offered no resistance as Cameron Green tore through the top order and Pat Cummins and Scott Boland finished the job with ease. Ollie Robinson was the last man to go and his shocking dismissal was symbolic of England’s woes with the bat. Facing his first ball, Robinson gave himself room and exposed all three stumps, only for Cummins to bowl him with a full toss. Wood’s ugly chop-on was just as bad but arguably the worst culprit was Ollie Pope. England’s No. 6 is seen a potential star of the future but he did his team no favours when he walked across his stumps only to be clean bowled by Cummins for five. It was an underwhelming but fitting way to end the Ashes and highlighted England’s biggest problem — it can’t score enough runs to be competitive. England’s highest score of the series was 297 at the Gabba — the last time England failed to pass 300 in an Ashes series was 1958/59. Former Victorian wicketkeeper Darren Berry tweeted: “You gotta fight harder than that - weak. Pride & respect lost. Not the tail’s fault but white flag should never be thrown in like that.” The reaction from the UK was brutal, with calls for serious overhaul at the top of English cricket. “Australia just too good for England, but I have to say this has been embarrassing,” former England captain Michael Vaughansaid on Fox Cricket. “They’ve just thrown the towel in. “That’s not the way to finish a Test match, the way they’ve played in that last hour or so. “It’s just not good enough. As much as bubble life, a lack of preparation, when you see a team throw the towel in like that, that’s when you know there’s real problems in English cricket that need to be ironed out. “I think there’s real hard questions this team have to answer after this.” The Evening Standard’s cricket writer Will Macpherson said: “England lose all 10 wickets for 56. Bowled out for 124. Lose by 147. That’s ‘no words’ bad.” I donât think enough has been made of Englandâs last few wickets last night. Woakes just completely slogged, edging to Carey, Wood literally played a pull shot onto his stumps and Robinson backed away from a full toss on middle and off. It was a complete surrender. Didnât end 5-0 but that was worse than 06/07 and 13/14. Those tours had some uplifting moments. This was a disaster from first to last ball. #Ashes In his column for The Telegraph , England great Geoffrey Boycott said Joe Root’s team was “embarrassingly exposed”. “This whole series has been about the poor standard of batting technique, lack of footwork, judgment around off stump about what to play and what to leave,” he wrote. “They have lacked patience and sheer bloody-minded determination to make the opposition bowlers bowl you out with good balls. “Rory Burns is ugly to watch. If that is the best of what English cricket has to offer then God help England, his technique you would not give to a friend.” Ex-England captain Mike Atherton said the positions of coach and chief selector Chris Silverwood as well as team director Ashley Giles should be under scrutiny. “Any notion that there should be no overhaul to the make-up and management of the England cricket team — as you are, Ashley Giles, Chris Silverwood and Joe Root according to some — has been demolished by the nature of this latest defeat in the Ashes,” he wrote in The Times. “Another utterly abject, humiliating collapse, devoid of any technical competence or fighting spirit, saw the series surrendered by a frightening margin in Hobart.” The Telegraph’s Nick Hoult believes “heads will roll” as a result of England’s humiliating defeat. “The brutal truth is they were one wicket away from a whitewash thanks to collapses in the series of 8 for 86 (Adelaide), 8 for 74 (Brisbane), 10 for 61 (MCG) and 10 for 56 here,” he wrote. “Heads will no doubt roll with Chris Silverwood, the coach, and team director, Ashley Giles, the two likely victims of another Ashes mauling in Australia. “Silverwood was out of his depth and floundered over strategy and selection. Giles gave him the power and created the system that has not worked. Both knew they would be judged on this series and were in Hobart to see its horrible end.” Ravaged by Covid and injury the superstar line-up at the Melbourne Stars are coming together just in time for a finals push Australia wrapped up a dominant Ashes win but Tim Paine’s brother was angry the former skipper didn’t get a proper send-off. He started the Ashes with a duck in Brisbane but Cameron Green is now a Test hero and earning massive compliments.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Shane Chatto fights through injury to hit crucial 45 runs in grand final","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/shane-chatto-fights-through-injury-to-hit-crucial-45-runs-in-grand-final/video/52d44785b9efdad48ca79af263925e57","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Port Adelaide's Shane Chatto hit 45 runs from 20 balls while injured to help the Magpies win the SACA Premier Cricket Twenty20 Cup grand final against East Torrens.

Australia wrapped up a dominant 4-0 Ashes series victory on Sunday night with a 146-run win after England’s batting collapsed yet again in dire fashion. Watch every game of the KFC Big Bash League Live & On-Demand on Kayo or catch up for FREE with minis on Kayo Freebies. Join Kayo Now > Entering the twilight of his professional career, most cricket pundits assumed the 2021/22 summer would be Paine’s last in the national set-up. A day-night Ashes Test at his home ground would have been the perfect send-off for the 37-year-old, who was the poster boy of Australian cricket following the infamous ball-tampering saga of 2018. But in Paine’s absence, it was new skipper Pat Cummins raised the trophy on the podium and celebrated at Hobart’s Blundstone Arena. Paine resigned as Australian captain just days before the start of the Ashes after revelations of a sexting scandal with a Cricket Tasmania employee in 2017. Ahead of the final Test in his home city of Hobart, Paine and his family fled Tasmania to go on holiday in an attempt to escape the spotlight during his home Test. Taking to social media on Sunday night, Nick Paine slammed Cricket Australia’s handling of his brother’s exit from the top job, while also lamenting the fact the ex-captain wasn’t given the chance to have a fairytale finish to his Test career on his home ground. “Pretty hard to watch this knowing full well that one of the key people in resurrecting the reputation of Cricket Australia and this team was shafted by that very same organisation because of a personal mistake he made nearly 4 years ago,” Nick said. “He deserved this send off on his home ground in front of his family, friends and his long time supporters. “It’s just a real shame that one mistake in life (that person was cleared and exonerated by an inquiry) can end a kids dream but then for others who make them, they come back and it’s all OK and in a way forgotten. “Double standards from an organisation that clearly doesn’t have the back of its people. “A local boy on his local ground in front of his people. Gut wrenching stuff.” Paine played 35 Tests in his career but never got to play one in his home state. Cricket Tasmania chief executive David Baker said last week Paine had some “bitterness” about not being involved in what would have been a momentous occasion in Hobart. “I didn’t know whether or not it was a good idea him being in Tasmania for the Test match, but I think probably in hindsight it was the best thing,” Baker told SEN. “Tim didn’t want this to be about Tim Paine not playing. He wanted this to be about Tasmania celebrating an Ashes Test match, and Australia hopefully getting a convincing victory. “I did have a chat to him this morning, and there was that little bit of bitterness in the voice from him around, ‘I’d love to be there’, but at the same time wishing us all the best, as we wish him all the best.” Baker also said Cricket Tasmania was keen for Paine to make his return as Tasmania’s wicketkeeper for the remainder of the Sheffield Shield season. He started the Ashes with a duck in Brisbane but Cameron Green is now a Test hero and earning massive compliments. Pat Cummins cemented his status as the golden boy of Australian cricket with a classy post-match gesture after thrashing England. England’s cricketers will return home a laughing stock, having once again failed to register a victory on an Ashes tour down under.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Stars’ shine to extinguish Heat","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/stars-shine-to-extinguish-heat/video/501bddca418d7ad91ca7bfdaed186987","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: The Melbourne Stars have kept their finals hopes alive after a thumping 8-wicket win over the Brisbane Heat at Melbourne Cricket Ground.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-16 20:56:08","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost"},{"title":"Boland reflects on surreal Ashes series","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/boland-reflects-on-surreal-ashes-series/video/f96c311e70e17be3b501f0d8843628a0","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: After receiving the call up to play test cricket for his country, Scott Boland had a sensational series and has become a cult-hero in Australia.

Ahead of the opening Ashes T20 game at Adelaide Oval, Lanning has revealed she sidelined herself in mid-December and opted not to represent Victoria in two WNCL games against New South Wales as a much-needed refresh. After a big series win against India in October, followed by captaining the Melbourne Stars in the Women’s Big Bash in November, Lanning said the break was necessary with Australia now turning its attention to one of the biggest cricket schedules it has faced: the Ashes, followed by the 50-over World Cup in New Zealand in March and then the Aussies' first appearance in the Commonwealth Games in July. Catch every moment of The Ashes live and ad-break free during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Try 14-days free now > The 29-year-old said she was happy with how the break had panned out. “I felt like the best thing for me to prepare for the upcoming couple of months was to take a bit of a break and I enjoyed my time off, but I guess the thing that says it was a good move is that I’ve come back and I’ve really enjoyed my training,” the world’s No.4 ranked T20 batter said. “It’s a long period of time where we need to be in good condition and able to play at a high standard at international level, so I guess another bonus of having that little break over Christmas was to focus on getting myself ready for what’s to come. “I certainly feel like I’m in that spot now. “I’m really excited about the Ashes and what’s to come, it was certainly worthwhile, taking a bit of a break and putting a pause on things and then getting back into it.” Lanning kept up her fitness during her break with her favourite type of exercise – running – in either 10km jogs or in short, sharp bursts. “I tend to find from a mental point of view (running) is quite a good thing, it allows me to clear my mind a bit and take my mind away from cricket, while at the same time preparing me for the game,” she said.

A timeline of the Djokovic-Australian Open saga With Novak Djokovic now officially deported after an 11-day saga in Australia, here’s a look at everything that led us to this point. Click here for a date-by-date breakdown Djokovic by rights should have enjoyed the same level of insulation. He is the best male tennis player in the world right now and may well be the best of all time. By winning the Australian Open, he would become the leader in Grand Slam victories, passing the other pillars of the sport’s golden era, Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal. He has been the darling of the Australian Open, dominating the tournament in recent years, and basking in the acclaim and affection and recognition that he so desires (to be fair, that we all so desire). Melbourne is a glorious place, especially in summer, a diverse, laid-back seaside city of outdoor cafes and trolley cars and sports — the Open, the Grand Prix, the massive Melbourne Cricket Ground, home to test matches and Australian Rules Football. It is also the city in which the citizenry endured 262 days of draconian restrictions over six separate lockouts between March 2020 and October 2021. No one on earth has had it worse. Imagine how even the most tennis-loving local must have felt when Djokovic gleefully announced his exemption through social media, forcing the Australian government — with an election on the near horizon, with a public unsatisfied by its pandemic response — to jump into the fray. Politically, this was easy pickings, especially after the basis under which Djokovic was allowed into the country, a suspicious positive PCR test in December around which he clearly flaunted mandatory isolation, only amplified the belief that he had contempt for the rules others dutifully followed, that he was playing everyone for suckers. In other circumstances, that kind of arrogance would probably have slipped right by. But not now, not after almost two years of this, not after all the suffering and sacrifice in the name of the common good. It seems that there is indeed a breaking point. Djokovic exits Australia a hero and martyr and home in Serbia, a status amplified by the history and culture of that country, and for the anti-vaxx crowd elsewhere. But the truth is that for all the chatter, this isn’t really a particularly divisive issue. If 80 per cent of your population is vaccinated, that’s what you call a consensus. And the other truth is that Djokovic will be back. Before self-satisfaction settles in, understand that you’ll be able to see him at Roland Garros in June, and perhaps in Montreal in August (that will be an interesting discussion in this country, even if by then — please, please — a degree of normality has returned). The three-year ban from Australia? Here’s betting he’s back in the Open draw in 2023, because — well, see all of the above. Yes, it is reassuring that there is a line that cannot be crossed, even for the rich and famous possessors of a magnificent backhand. But don’t kid yourself about what comes next.","pubDate":"2022-01-16 17:37:21","full_description":"Of course he thought he’d get away with it, because they almost always get away with it.

Melbourne is a glorious place, especially in summer, a diverse, laid-back seaside city of outdoor cafes and trolley cars and sports — the Open, the Grand Prix, the massive Melbourne Cricket Ground, home to test matches and Australian Rules Football. It is also the city in which the citizenry endured 262 days of draconian restrictions over six separate lockouts between March 2020 and October 2021. No one on earth has had it worse. Imagine how even the most tennis-loving local must have felt when Djokovic gleefully announced his exemption through social media, forcing the Australian government — with an election on the near horizon, with a public unsatisfied by its pandemic response — to jump into the fray. Politically, this was easy pickings, especially after the basis under which Djokovic was allowed into the country, a suspicious positive PCR test in December around which he clearly flaunted mandatory isolation, only amplified the belief that he had contempt for the rules others dutifully followed, that he was playing everyone for suckers. In other circumstances, that kind of arrogance would probably have slipped right by. But not now, not after almost two years of this, not after all the suffering and sacrifice in the name of the common good. It seems that there is indeed a breaking point. Djokovic exits Australia a hero and martyr and home in Serbia, a status amplified by the history and culture of that country, and for the anti-vaxx crowd elsewhere. But the truth is that for all the chatter, this isn’t really a particularly divisive issue. If 80 per cent of your population is vaccinated, that’s what you call a consensus. And the other truth is that Djokovic will be back. Before self-satisfaction settles in, understand that you’ll be able to see him at Roland Garros in June, and perhaps in Montreal in August (that will be an interesting discussion in this country, even if by then — please, please — a degree of normality has returned). The three-year ban from Australia? Here’s betting he’s back in the Open draw in 2023, because — well, see all of the above. Yes, it is reassuring that there is a line that cannot be crossed, even for the rich and famous possessors of a magnificent backhand. But don’t kid yourself about what comes next.","image_url":"\n","source_id":"sportsnet"},{"title":"Aussie quicks rout England under lights to win Ashes 4-0 | Men's Ashes 2021-22 - cricket.com.au","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9anVXdWNjNk1XdGvSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Aussie quicks rout England under lights to win Ashes 4-0 | Men's Ashes 2021-22  cricket.com.auAustralia beats England by 146 runs, completes 4-0 Ashes win  Associated PressCameron Green the 'complete package' at Test level - Pat Cummins  ESPNcricinfoAustralia seal 4-0 Ashes win!

The 146-run loss at Bellerive Oval concluded a calamitous series where Root's side were competitive in only a few sessions over the five tests. Root's five-year reign as skipper was called into question as the tour lurched from one heavy defeat to another one but the 31-year-old batsman made it clear he wanted to stay in the job. \"I'd love the opportunity to take this team forward and to turn things round,\" he told reporters. \"At the moment, we're going through a real tough stage as a group of players. \"The performances haven't been good enough but I'd love the opportunity to turn things round and for us to start putting in performances you'd expect from an English test team.\" Asked whether he was merely hoping for an opportunity to quit the captaincy on a high after a successful series, Root was adamant. \"I believe I am the right man to take this team forward, in my own eyes, and if that decision is taken out of my hands, so be it,\" he added. \"But I'd love the opportunity to carry that forward.\" Root has been publicly outspoken about the deficiencies of both his bowlers and batsmen over the series and said the squad had to accept they were clearly second best on this tour. \"We've let ourselves down because we've not given a fair account of what we're capable of,\" he said. \"But, at the same time, it's quite evident that Australia are, at this moment in time, a better team than we are, in all areas. \"It hurts me to say that, but it's the reality of things and we've got to accept that and find a way of doing better. Find a way of very quickly turning things around.\" (Reporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Ed Osmond)","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/01/16/1446536.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my"},{"title":"Thank you for supporting Test cricket so passionately: Warne to Kohli","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/thank-you-for-supporting-test-cricket-so-passionately-warne-to-kohli-2022-01-16-754726","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Spin legend Shane Warne has thanked star batter Virat Kohli for \"passionately supporting\" Test cricket, a day after he stepped down as skipper of the Indian Test team.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-16 12:30:34","full_description":"Spin legend Shane Warne has thanked star batter for \"passionately supporting\" Test cricket, a day after he stepped down as skipper of the Indian Test team. Kohli on Saturday ended his seven-year reign as India's most successful Test captain, the move coming a day after an unexpected 1-2 series loss to South Africa. Under Kohli, India won 40 out of 68 Tests, a record which made him one of the most successful Test captains in world cricket. \"Congrats @imVkohli on what you and your team has achieved under your leadership and thankyou for supporting test cricket so passionately and insuring that it stays the number 1 form of the game,\" Warne tweeted. Kohli has been the most successful Test captain India has ever produced. After taking over the reins from Mahendra Singh Dhoni, he led India in 68 Test matches and secured 40 victories at a win percentage of 58.82. As Test captain, he registered his first series win against Sri Lanka in 2015, a victory that India registered in the Emerald Island after 22 years. Last year, Warne was all praise for Kohli after his team beat England by 157 runs in the fourth Test at The Oval to take an unassailable 2-1 lead in the five-match series. Warne had then called Kohli the biggest superstar in world cricket. However, the Australian great was not too pleased with the Indian maestro after he let it rip on the stump mic following the DRS episode that gave a lifeline during the third and final Test against South Africa in Cape Town. \"Look it is an interesting one, I am not sure that should be happening from a captain of an international team. But sometimes frustration overflows, you just get so frustrated and that's why I said I wonder if that has happened three or four times through the series, and that was like okay that is enough now we can't have it anymore,\" Warne had said.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"“Don’t blame the players, it’s the system”: Kevin Pietersen gives some stick to ECB as England lose Ashes 2021-22","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-dont-blame-the-players-its-the-system-kevin-pietersen-gives-some-stick-to-ecb-as-england-lose-ashes-2021-22/","keywords":["Cricket","Ashes 2021-22","Australia","England","kevin pietersen"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kevin Pietersen gives some stick to ECB: The former English batter hopes to see substantial changes in the English county scene.

Former England greats aren’t holding back their criticism for the players and England Cricket Board after England have lost 0-4 in the recently concluded Ashes 2021-22. Having last won an away Ashes Test more than a decade ago, England have since lost 13 and drawn two to register three back-to-back shambolic Ashes campaigns in Australia. A 271-run chase in a pink-ball Test was never expected to be a smooth task for the visitors but them getting all out for 124 in 38.5 overs was a testament to their abysmal batting throughout the tour. “It’s been embarrassing. Gutless. That one thing that we have to do now is take out heads out of the sand, pull together and prioritise red-ball cricket,” former England captain Sir Ian Botham told 7 Cricket after the culmination of the fifth Test in Hobart. Kevin Pietersen gives some stick to ECB as England lose Ashes 2021-22 Former batter Kevin Pietersen, who has been quite vocal with respect to his criticism of ECB (England Cricket Board) and the shortcomings of current English county system, took to social media platform Twitter to express disapproval of the “current system”. “Let’s see WHAT the @englandcricket bosses do about English batting. This has been there for everyone to see for years! Don’t blame the players, it’s the system!,” read Pietersen’s tweet after England’s loss today.

A complete overhaul of their white-ball setup powered them to a World Cup victory in 2019 at home.

Other than Boland, all-rounder Cameron Green and captain Pat Cummins also picked three wickets each.

With the conditions and the team position, pretty special,” Head told Fox Cricket during the post-match presentation ceremony. “I have worked on a lot of things over the last couple of years and did not take my opportunities earlier on in my career.” The post 2021-22 Ashes Man of the Series today: Who won the Man of the Series in Australia vs England Ashes 2021? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-16 11:34:12","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Watch: England's Rory Burns survives bizarre bowled dismissal during Hobart Test in Ashes - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9hc2hlcy1yb3J5LWJ1cm5zLXN1cnZpdmVzLWJpemFycmUtYm93bGVkLWRpc21pc3NhbC1kdXJpbmctaG9iYXJ0LXRlc3QtMTAxNjQyMzMwMzIwNzU3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Watch: England's Rory Burns survives bizarre bowled dismissal during Hobart Test in Ashes  Hindustan TimesThe Ashes 5th Test Day 2: Should Sam Billings take over as England's Test keeper? | #PoliteEnquiries  ESPN UKLive Cricket Score - Australia vs England, 5th Test, Day 3 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzAUS vs ENG Stat Highlights 5th Ashes Test 2021–22 Day 2: Hosts in Control  LatestLYEngland's Wood grabs 5-32 but Australia extends lead to 256  Associated PressView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-16 11:24:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Thank you for supporting Test cricket so passionately: Warne to Kohli","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/thank-you-for-supporting-test-cricket-so-passionately-shane-warne-to-virat-kohli/article38278031.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["PTI"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kohli on Saturday ended his seven-year reign as India's most successful Test captain, the move coming a day after an unexpected 1-2 series loss to South Africa.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-16 11:22:13","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar"},{"title":"Anushka Sharma's Emotional Post For Virat Kohli After He Steps Down As India Test Captain - NDTVSports.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L2FudXNoa2Etc2hhcm1hcy1lbW90aW9uYWwtcG9zdC1mb3ItdmlyYXQta29obGktYWZ0ZXItaGUtc3RlcHMtZG93bi1hcy1pbmRpYS10ZXN0LWNhcHRhaW4tMjcxMTA4M9IBhgFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L2FudXNoa2Etc2hhcm1hcy1lbW90aW9uYWwtcG9zdC1mb3ItdmlyYXQta29obGktYWZ0ZXItaGUtc3RlcHMtZG93bi1hcy1pbmRpYS10ZXN0LWNhcHRhaW4tMjcxMTA4My9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Anushka Sharma's Emotional Post For Virat Kohli After He Steps Down As India Test Captain  NDTVSports.comMaking sense of Virat Kohli's decision to step down | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIt was never about statistics for Virat Kohli.

During the third day of the ongoing fifth Ashes 2021-22 Test match between Australia and England in Hobart, England captain Joe Root became victim of a peculiar dismissal which, sort of, summed up his whole tour. It all happened on the fourth delivery of the 32nd over when a Scott Boland delivery just didn’t bounce enough for the batter to defend it. With no such instance record earlier in the match, it was unlikely of Root to expect such a delivery. Hence, there was hardly which the right-hand batter could’ve done about that delivery. Coming in to bat at No. 4 in the 21st over, Root returned back to the pavilion after scoring 11 (31) with the help of a four as he will leave Australia without a Test century. Having scored 322 runs in 10 innings at an average of 32.20, Root will finish the series as England’s highest run-scorer. Having said that, his team much more out of him especially with other batters not being among the runs. In 14 Tests down under, Root’s 892 runs have come at an average of 35.68 including nine half-centuries as the 31-year old player would be looking to return for another away Ashes series in search of an elusive Test century in Australia. Chasing a 271-run target at the Bellerive Oval, Root was part of a batting collapse which saw the visitors getting bundled out for 124 in 38.5 overs. With bowling figures of 12-5-18-3, Boland was the pick of the Australian bowlers today. Other than Boland, all-rounder Cameron Green and captain Pat Cummins also picked three wickets each.

During the 50th match of the ongoing 11th season of the Big Bash League between Melbourne Stars and Brisbane Heat in Melbourne, Melbourne Stars captain Glenn Maxwell grabbed a breathtaking catch to astonish one and all. It all happened on the penultimate delivery of the 16th over when Brisbane Heat batter Sam Heazlett (9) aimed at hitting a Nathan Coulter-Nile delivery over Maxwell at mid-on. Not getting the required timing despite making room for himself, Heazlett mis-timed his shot to eventually walk back to the pavilion. Maxwell, who started to back-track, kept his eyes on the ball before pulling out his left hand to catch a stunner whilst running and falling down. Maxwell, who became a source of amazement with his fielding effort, was surprised himself with a catch which will doubtlessly go down as one of the bests of the season. Playing his 100th match for Heat (first player to play 100 T20s for one BBL team), captain Chris Lynn (28) had won the bat flip and chose to bat. Barring batter Ben Duckett top-scoring with his 51 (42) comprising of three fours and two sixes, no other batter from Heat appeared to create any real impact at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It is worth mentioning that Maxwell was also the pick of the bowlers for his team with figures of 4-0-19-2. While spinner Adam Zampa also picked a couple of wickets, pacers Ahmed Daniyal and Coulter-Nile picked a wicket apiece. Glenn Maxwell catch vs Brisbane Heat GLENN MAXWELL!
