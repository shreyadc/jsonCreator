Not just the good, the bad and the ugly of Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions, but the accommodations of those willing to take the money and look the other way. One moment from the fight in December 2019 lingers more than most: Joshua absorbing the cheers from the young crowd, many of whom were women in western clothes, before averting his gaze upwards towards the kingdom’s ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and giving a fist-pump to the man who had made it all possible. It felt disconcerting yet no one was really surprised. A couple of days earlier, Joshua had responded to questions about human rights by insisting the Saudis were “trying to do a good job politically” before adding: “I just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I’ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.” Anthony Joshua celebrates victory over Andy Ruiz Jr in Diriyah in 2019 – before the fight the Briton said Saudi Arabia was ‘trying to do a good job politically’. Photograph: Hassan Ammar/AP Perhaps Joshua was unwilling to delve any deeper for fear that those dissenting whispers would permanently stain his conscience. He was the first global sports star to display a sunny-side-up approach to the kingdom rarely seen outside its own PR campaigns, but far from the last. Only this week Bryson DeChambeau claimed the Saudis were “trying to do good for the world and showcase themselves in a light that hasn’t been seen in a while” by setting up LIV Golf . Meanwhile, taking it all in was Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, who sported the look of a man whose lottery numbers had just come in on the same day he had hit an 11-team accumulator. “This really feels like a really big moment where everything could change,” he told me. “If they’re going to be investing this kind of money in the sport, we’ve got to be realists.” ‘I still hate LIV’: Rory McIlroy calls for consequences over breakaway players Read more It was a comment to make Henry Kissinger purr. But Hearn was merely ahead of the game. That Joshua fight put the world on notice about how serious Saudi Arabia was about sport. The acquisition of Newcastle United , and the hosting of Formula One and high-profile golf events confirmed it. On Tuesday the Saudi regime flexed their muscles further by striking a deal with the PGA Tour to merge with LIV, backed by the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). At the same time they are also throwing impossible sums to attract western players to the Saudi Pro football league. The question now is what happens next. Saudi Arabia has not officially bid for the 2030 World Cup, but that is only a matter of time. Cricket is also said to be of interest, especially with so many of the population from Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. Esports is another major focus – next month it will host Gamers8, which is billed as the world’s largest gaming and esports festival. As Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions grow, people continue to wonder what lies behind it all. We live in a world that prefers certainty over nuance, simple answers not complex truths. But the following is all true: it is about sportswashing, using sport as a tool of soft power, and improving the lives of its population, 70% of which is under 35, and diversifying its economy, all at the same time. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund took control of Newcastle in October 2021. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images According to the Saudis, the value of their sports event industry is growing by 8% per year, rising from $2.1bn in 2018 to an estimated $3.3bn by next year. It wants to have more people coming to Saudi Arabia, playing golf and spending their pounds, dollars and euros in the country. Yet it will not be able to wash away its human rights record that easily. Not when in the last 15 months, it has jailed a woman, Salma al-Shehab, for 34 years for merely following and retweeting dissidents and activists . And also executed 81 people in one day . According to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, 41 of those killed were Muslims from the Shia minority “who had taken part in anti-government protests in 2011-12, calling for greater political participation ”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet for too many people sporting success trumps human rights. As Ben Freeman, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for responsible statecraft, puts it when asked about Newcastle United’s supporters cheering on their owners: “A lot of sports fans are easily bought off. If somebody buys their team, they support them. Even if it happens to be an authoritarian government, like the Saudis.” In other words, sportswashing works. Rory McIlroy asked: ‘Would you rather have one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds as a partner or an enemy? Money talks, and you’d rather have them as a partner.’ Photograph: Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images Of course there is hypocrisy here too. Sporting stars and supporters are hammered for taking the Saudi coin, while at the same time few question Britain when it exports billions of pounds in weapons to the country and receives billions of pounds in foreign investment in return. Meanwhile, the Saudis influence on sport is only going to grow, as Rory McIlroy painfully acknowledged on Wednesday. “The PIF and the Saudis want to spend money in the game of golf and they are not going to stop,” McIlroy said. “Would you rather have one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds as a partner or an enemy? At the end of the day money talks, and you’d rather have them as a partner.” As a statement of cold, hard realpolitik it was hard to argue.","pubDate":"2023-06-07 20:37:42","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef393d79da362473f7bba502b7c5aaea782cf1e/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6dbb7e6a1277ab8b93bc50b4544103e","source_id":"theguardian","category":["sports"],"country":["canada","united kingdom","india","singapore"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rising from Hardship, Maham shines in Women’s Cricket","link":"https://www.nation.com.pk/08-Jun-2023/rising-from-hardship-maham-shines-in-women-s-cricket","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["OUR STAFF REPORT"],"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE - Maham Manzoor, a talented left-arm orthodox spinner from Hyderabad Region, has overcome financial hardships to make a name for herself in the world of women’s cricket.","content":"LAHORE - Maham Manzoor, a talented left-arm orthodox spinner from Hyderabad Region, has overcome financial hardships to make a name for herself in the world of women’s cricket. Despite the challenges she faced, Maham’s dedication to her skill has propelled her to represent her region and aspire to represent her country at the international level. Starting her cricket journey by representing Hyderabad Region at the U19 level in the 2013-14 season, Maham quickly caught the attention of selectors with her natural talent for spinning the ball. Despite the financial obstacles in her path, she remained determined and continued to train and compete, determined to leave her mark in the sport. In 2014, Maham made her List-A cricket debut in the Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah Women Cricket Championship Seniors. Although her team’s overall performance may not have been outstanding, Maham’s individual contributions stood out, highlighting her potential as a rising star. Reflecting on her journey so far, Maham shared, “I started playing on the streets, and my family has been very supportive from the beginning, motivating and encouraging me to pursue this game. I had no knowledge that there existed a game played with a hard ball; I used to play with boys using a taped ball.” Recalling how she discovered women’s cricket, Maham explained, “I was in school when I saw on television that the women’s team was playing a cricket match, and that’s when I found out about women’s cricket.” When asked about her inspiration to pursue cricket professionally, Maham mentioned, “Javeria Khan inspired me. When I saw her on the ground for the first time, I realized she was a senior player, and watching her play gave me the feeling that I should also play.” Maham’s journey has been far from easy. She had to travel from Hyderabad to Karachi to pursue her dream due to the limited facilities available in her hometown. Despite financial constraints, she bears the responsibility of supporting her family while pursuing her cricketing aspirations. Nevertheless, Maham remains hopeful about representing her country in the future. Maham’s father, who passed away in 2018, dreamt of seeing his daughter representing the Pakistan women’s cricket team. Maham shared, “My father always pushed me to play this game. He encouraged me, telling me that good times would come and wanted to see me wearing Pakistan’s colors.” Recently, Maham had the opportunity to represent the Dynamites in the Pakistan Cup Women’s Cricket Tournament. In the T20 phase of the tournament, she performed exceptionally well, finishing fourth among the bowlers with five wickets from two matches. In the subsequent one-day phase, Maham claimed four wickets from four matches, helping her team secure victory and further establishing herself as an exciting prospect in Pakistan women’s cricket. Looking ahead, Maham remains determined and optimistic. She stated, “I have faced great struggles to reach this stage. I am grateful for what I have achieved so far and will continue to seize opportunities. I urge other girls to take up this sport and request their parents to support them.”","pubDate":"2023-06-07 20:23:02","image_url":"https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2023-06-08/rising-from-hardship-maham-shines-in-women-s-cricket-1686169378-2484.jpg","source_id":"nation_pk","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPC Minister proposes Zaka Ashraf name in PCB new setup","link":"https://www.nation.com.pk/08-Jun-2023/ipc-minister-proposes-zaka-ashraf-name-in-pcb-new-setup","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Agencies"],"video_url":null,"description":"Islamabad-As the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman elections just around the corner; one of the key allies of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, Pakistan People’s Party Federal Minister for Inter Provincial Coordination (IPC) Ehsan ur Rehman Mazari proposed the name of Muhammad Zaka Ashraf in the new setup of the PCB.","content":"Islamabad-As the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman elections just around the corner; one of the key allies of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, Pakistan People’s Party Federal Minister for Inter Provincial Coordination (IPC) Ehsan ur Rehman Mazari proposed the name of Muhammad Zaka Ashraf in the new setup of the PCB.

Australia were in a commanding position on 327-3 at stumps after losing the toss, with Head 146 not out and Steve Smith 95 not out. SCORECARD | WTC Final: Australia v India Smith brought up the pair's 250 stand off the last ball of the day when he guided Mohammed Shami through the covers for a sweetly timed four. The fourth-wicket duo had come together with Australia in trouble at 76-3 after being sent into bat in bowler-friendly conditions. But as the sun burst through the clouds in south London, the runs started to flow. \"Losing the toss this morning, we've done exceptionally well,\" Head told Sky Sports. \"I was trying to make sure I was in really good positions today. I got tested through parts of that. \"I just tried to work through those periods and be adjustable and stay relaxed.\" Head was troubled by left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja but by counter-attacking from the start of his innings -- 24 of his first 27 runs came in boundaries -- he put the pressure back on the bowlers. With Smith, who before this match averaged nearly 98 in Tests at The Oval, batting in more conventional fashion it gave the 29-year-old Head freedom to keep playing his shots. \"I always love batting with Steve (Smith),\" said Head. \"You need to have plans bowling to him because he's so unique. \"You say he played second fiddle but I always feel I'm playing second fiddle to him and can go a bit under the radar.\" By the time India tested Head with the short ball, he was well set and a pulled single off Shami took him to a sixth Test hundred in just 106 balls, including 14 fours and a six. \"Travis just goes about his business, sees the ball and hits it,\" said Smith, whose fifty came off 144 balls. \"He shifted the momentum. It was a tremendous innings.\" India took the new ball before the close but it made little difference on a day when captain Rohit Sharma would have been looking for many more wickets after winning the toss. And as Smith and Head repelled India, he might also have wondered about the wisdom of leaving out off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, the world's top-ranked Test bowler, who could have been a threat against an Australia top five featuring three left-handers. India had started strongly in what was their second WTC final after losing to New Zealand in the inaugural 2021 showpiece in Southampton. Mohammed Siraj removed Usman Khawaja for a duck with an excellent wobble-seam delivery and Australia were 2-1, to the raucous delight of an overwhelmingly pro-India crowd of nearly 23,000. But David Warner, who had managed just one century in his previous 32 Test innings, dug in before the increasingly assured opener struck Umesh Yadav for three fours in successive deliveries. The 36-year-old left-hander's promising innings ended on 43 when a gloved pull off medium-pacer Shardul Thakur was well caught down the legside by diving wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat. Marnus Labuschagne, the world's top-ranked Test batsman, fell early in the second session for his lunch score of 26 when he was bowled between bat and pad by a Shami inswinger. The WTC is the only major men's cricket trophy Australia have yet to win. The fixture also marks the start of a packed schedule of six Tests in eight weeks for Australia, including a five-match Ashes series against England.","pubDate":"2023-06-07 19:58:12","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India defend leaving out world No.1 Test bowler Ashwin","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/india-defend-leaving-out-world-no1-test-bowler-ashwin-c-10910291","keywords":null,"creator":["Ian Chadband"],"video_url":null,"description":"India have defended their omission of the world's top-ranked Test bowler Ravichandran Ashwin after they suffered a first-day mauling in the World Test final.","content":"India have defended their decision to leave the world's top-ranked Test bowler Ravichandran Ashwin out of an attack that got flogged by Australia's batters at the World Test Championship final. There was more than a little surprise when the veteran spin star's name was omitted from the Indian line-up for The Oval on Wednesday, with Ricky Ponting among the critics. Ashwin has for so long proved Australia's tormentor-in-chief with 114 wickets at 28.36 apiece, with regular success against a left-hander dominated top order. And by the end of a trying day for India's weary-looking seam attack, with only spin allrounder Ravi Jadeja to ease their load, the gamble of leaving the 36-year-old out looked to already be costly as Australia finished in a dominant position on 3-327. \"It's always a very difficult decision to drop a champion bowler like that,\" conceded Paras Mhambrey, India's former Test seamer who's now their bowling coach. \"But looking at the (cool) conditions in the morning, I thought having the additional seamer would definitely be beneficial - and it also has worked in the past. \"If you look at the earlier games that we played - the last Test match we went in with four seamers, which really did well. \"The seamers have done well out here for us but you can always look at the hindsight, saying additional spinner would have been a different.\" The workload on the Indian fast bowlers appeared to have taken its toll come the last session as Travis Head and Steve Smith punished them mercilessly in an unbroken 251-run partnership. But Mhambrey was still adamant India could win from their difficult position. \"Yes, why not? The second new ball, we saw the ball was getting a little seam, it was getting cut,\" he said. \"Tomorrow morning will be an important session for us. If we take a few wicket pick-ups quickly, then definitely we have an opportunity to come back in the game.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-07 19:46:27","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-10910291/26a561fe23ef72a8c30705a29f3c2e81a85b7708-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Head and Smith send Ashes warning in Test Championship batathon","link":"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/cricket/head-and-smith-send-ashes-warning-in-test-championship-20230608-p5dewi.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Malcolm Conn"],"video_url":null,"description":"Travis Head and Steve Smith have set Australia up with an unbeaten 251-run partnership on day one of the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval.","content":"Travis Head has announced himself as Australia’s most influential batsman and Steve Smith remains the most reliable just a week out from the Ashes. Head scored his first overseas century during the opening day of the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval and Smith is not far away from his seventh hundred in England. Travis Head celebrates his century. Credit: Getty Stamping his authority in Australia over the past two summers with counter-punching hundreds, Head has now become a game changer in England, scoring an unbeaten 146 in just 156 deliveries as Australia went to stumps at 3-327 on Wednesday with Smith 95 not out. It would have been more had India managed better than 85 of their scheduled 90 overs. After Australia were asked to bat on a green pitch under dull skies, Head came to the crease with his side teetering at 3-76. He added 251 with Smith, who played the unobtrusive anchor on a ground where he averaged almost a hundred going into the match. Smith has already scored six centuries in England, but no one else in the Australian squad had managed one, until Head came to the party in emphatic style. “We don’t talk too much,” Head said about batting with Smith. “I’ve always said I do really enjoy batting with Steve because of how much attention he receives. Obviously, he’s one of the best players in the world, probably our best player. He’s our best batter and unbelievable in these conditions, and he receives so much attention from the opposition in terms of plans and how difficult he is to bowl to. Head negotiated some short-pitched bowling, especially in the balls leading up to his century. Credit: Getty “Going out to bat with him, you’re in the shadow of that, and you can sort of sneak under the radar and go about your business because he’s drawn so much attention. It felt like that again today. It felt like he wasn’t going to leave, he wasn’t going to go anywhere. He’s at the other end and got in that rhythm and just went about his business. “A lot of balls that he may play at are a lot different to me, so I think we complement each other completely differently. But in the partnership, it works really nicely.” Head played four Tests during his last England tour in 2019 for an average of 27 and a highest score of 51 before being dropped. Now playing with an uncluttered mind and corresponding freedom, he shapes as a pivotal player in this Ashes series. Travis Head and Steve Smith combined to not only steady the ship, but to steer it into open waters. Credit: Getty Images Certainly England captain Ben Stokes knows how dangerous Head can be after he averaged almost 60 in a man-of-the-series performance in the home Ashes two summers ago. “I think Travis Head is someone who since he came into the team has really taken his opportunity, and gone ‘This is how I’m going to play’,” Stokes said in a recent interview. “Him being allowed to go out and play the way he has, he’s been so successful. “He was so hard to bowl to in Australia when we were there last time because he just threw counter-punches, and those innings he played against us were really hard to bowl to, really hard to set fields to.” Loading Seduced by the seamer-friendly conditions and no doubt concerned what Australia’s pace attack would do in such helpful circumstances, Indian captain Rohit Sharma must be ruing how quickly the cloud burnt off and sunshine sapped the moisture from the pitch. India’s bowling coach, former Test player Paras Mhambrey, was concerned about India’s lack of discipline after a good start. He also felt the four-man Indian pace attack could have started their bouncer attack against Head before he had motored into the 90s. “We discussed it as an area we could exploit,” Mhambrey said after play. Disconcertingly for India, the occasional delivery is already keeping low. Loading While Head’s innings was the most important and Smith’s the most reassuring, David Warner’s was the most pleasing. The veteran opener’s 43 may pale in comparison to the results of Smith and Head, but despite the most difficult of the batting conditions, Warner did not bat like a man whose Test place was in danger. It was his second-highest score in his last 10 Test innings. News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .

It’s not hard to track. It’s not as if it’s skittered off the fairway and away into the ti-tree. A year ago, back at the tee shall we say, the PGA Tour was busy trying to wrap a one-wood around LIV Golf’s kaffiyeh-ed head. Commissioner Jay Monahan said he personally knew people who’d lost loved ones in the 9/11 terrorist attacks and that anyone who professed ignorance of Saudi Arabia’s appalling human rights record was “living under a rock”. If you really have been living under a rock, know that the LIV Golf rebel tour that was so aggrieving the PGA is wholly owned by Saudi Arabia’s seemingly bottomless Public Investment Fund (PIF). Its assets also include Newcastle United in the EPL, the four best Saudi clubs whose rosters now feature Cristiano Ronaldo, and as of Tuesday Karim Benzema, and soon Lionel Messi, who is already on $50 million a year as an ambassador anyway. PIF’s sundries encompass an F1 race and a recent world heavyweight title promotion and its unofficial prospectus includes an Olympic Games and a World Cup, not to mention the United Nations, Davos and NATO. Loading A month ago, the PGA was lobbying American politicians to shun Saudi inroads into sport, damning their distasteful penchant for cutting off people’s heads. Last week, Jack Nicklaus no less was turning his revered back on renegades who had signed up with LIV for nine-figure considerations, saying: “I don’t even consider those guys part of the game anymore.” Those guys included Australia’s British Open winner Cam Smith. But there was an ad break, and now we’re at the green, and look: there’s commissioner Monahan and PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who coincidentally is also chairman of Newcastle and also-er chairman of Saudi state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, strolling arm-in-arm onto the green, where their balls sit side by cosy side, just about kissing. Greg Norman, right, with Phil Mickelson in Saudi Arabia in February. Credit: Getty “A transformational partnership,” said Monahan, who slips seamlessly from commissioner to CEO under Al-Rumayyan’s chairmanship of the new joint enterprise that will own and run everything in world golf and make it all right just like that. “Things have changed.” You can hazard your own guess about what has changed, and you’d be right. As for those human rights records, bit of a misunderstanding as it turns out. As LIV Golf chief Greg Norman said back at the start: “Look, anyone can make a mistake.” Oh, and yeah, FedEx, whose company name adorns the PGA’s championship cup, has had since 2021 a nice little half-a-bill deal going on in Saudi Arabia. That’s an awkward lie. Quick, where’s the toe iron? Cam Smith, LIV-ing the life. Credit: Getty Images. Still, “awesome day today,” tweeted LIV poster boy Phil Mickelson. Every day’s probably pretty awesome when the Saudis are stuffing haemo-dollars into your pocket. But the players who stayed loyal to the PGA were not told because as it turns out, they’re bit players in their own game. “Nothing like finding out through Twitter that we’re merging with a tour that we said we’d never do that with,” posted Canadian Mackenzie Hughes. And Norman was not told because as it turns out, he’s less the Great White Shark, more a pawn in a vastly bigger game. Kerry Packer. Credit: AAP Rebel ventures in sport have short half-lives. Typically, they either flame out or muscle in. Evidently, LIV was struggling for sponsors, broadcasters and spectators everywhere except Adelaide. And the PGA wasn’t keen to plough through a raft of fearfully expensive pending legislation, and so here they are, in lockstep bound for the next tee, high-fiving and wise-cracking as they go. There are minor details to buy out – sorry, thrash out – like who what and where and when, though we know why. There’s also the ticklish matter of whether the LIV players get to keep their mega-bribes and whether the PGA players who turned down LIV on principle (look under “archaic” in the dictionary) are going to hate their guts forever. But it can be presumed that Adelaide has as much chance of hosting another tournament in the new LIVy-lovey tour as Casey Station. Like cricket all those years ago, pro golf probably needed a shake-up. But this has played out more like a shake-down. If you want to know who runs world golf from now on, look at Australian cricket in the decades after World Series Cricket. Kerry Packer paid the piper and called the tune. Almost half a century later, sport is a cacophony of pipers and their paymasters. Loading Look around in almost any direction, but let’s do this one: Qatar bought a World Cup and are in for an Olympics and what they don’t own in soccer, the Saudis do. India – that is, a cartel of Indian tycoons – own world cricket and they’re still not satisfied. Packer bought cricket to make money. The Gulf states fork out for sport to buy status, influence and cover. The Indians buy cricket as a plaything. But it’s all buy, buy, buy. Who cares? Probably very few, and that’s what’s changed. Players get their prizemoney, fans get their entertainment, sponsors get their exposure and owners get their kicks and that’s all she wrote, folks. Humans have their rights. When the Saudis bought Newcastle off its unpopular previous owner, fans brandished signs to say that they’d gotten their club back. They didn’t of course, but they did just now secure a place in the Champions League for the first time in two decades. They’re following the bouncing ball.

India, by contrast, turned up to the Oval with all the flaws one might expect of a team for which only one member – Cheteshwar Pujara – had done anything other than spend the past four months preoccupied with the Twenty20 glitz of the IPL . Steve Smith applauds Travis Head’s first Test hundred overseas. Credit: Getty In essence, this was a case of roles reversed from February’s day one of the Border-Gavaskar bout in Nagpur , and left any pre-series noise about a lack of Australian tour games looking like so much stuff and nonsense. Mental and technical grounding was clearly in abundance. Having been sent in on an overcast morning on a green-tinged pitch, this was a commanding performance by Pat Cummins’ men, shrugging off the losses of Usman Khawaja then Marnus Labuschange to seaming deliveries and then forging the ideal platform. But it was made a far more straightforward task by the fact that India’s approach, in terms of selection, tactics and execution, was clearly affected by a lack of time to shrug off the IPL and recalibrate properly for the game billed as Test cricket’s “grand final” by breathless broadcasters. Loading Both sides, it seems, were fooled by the green grass on top of what proved to be quite a dry Oval surface, for Cummins would also have bowled first. Each of the past two Ashes Tests at the ground have been won by the team sent in to bat. However, it was India’s selectors who made the most questionable call, preferring a fourth seamer in Umesh Yadav or Shardul Thakur to Ravichandran Ashwin, so vital in Australia in 2020-21. With the Dukes ball in hand, none of Yadav, Shardul, Mohammad Shami or Mohammad Siraj were able to find the right length on the day, too often dropping short of the zone in which Australia’s batters would be tempted to drive or at risk of lbw. And in tactical terms, the inconsistency of the bowling made it difficult for Rohit Sharma to properly create pressure or hatch plans, despite plenty of attempts. Loading Australian decisiveness was articulated from the very first ball of the Test, when Warner offered a firm, straight bat to Shami, looked for a run, and then bellowed a clear cry of “no” as soon as he could not find one. Four years ago, Warner had been too defensive in mindset, giving Stuart Broad a more or less stationary target. His sole score of the series, on day one at Headingley, was a miracle of plays and misses. His best innings in England, including 85 at the Oval in 2015, have been proactive and positive, keeping the bowlers on edge. He did that here, unafraid to upper cut to the third man boundary, and then feasting off a rusty-looking Yadav. Warner’s dismissal shortly before lunch to Shardul was cause for Warner to throw his head back, but it has given him something to work with on this tour. Cummins and the selectors were looking for signs of positivity. They got them. The exit of a new Warner brought the arrival of an older version of Smith. The shuffle is back, carefully recast during the team’s training camp in Beckenham. So too is an unhurried sense of belief that runs will come - after spending much of the afternoon in Head’s slipstream, Smith clicked through the gears in the evening. David Warner fashioned 43. Credit: AP Twice Smith edged into the cordon, only to be reprieved by soft hands that saw the ball drop short of catching. But for the most part, his typically theatrical commentary as to how balls reacted off the surface was much more dramatic than the shots themselves: all but a few hit somewhere near the middle of the bat. Pleasingly for Cummins, who had imbued Head with so much confidence to think only of free scoring and counter-punching when he batted, the South Australian left-hander’s innings was arguably the least revelatory thing about the day. Granted favourable conditions after some of the morning’s lateral and vertical variation had subsided, Head was aggressive as ever, punching boundaries through the covers, upper cutting over the slips and flicking behind square leg. Loading A few belated short balls made him somewhat uncomfortable when directed at his hip and armpit, one edge falling just short of gully. But overall he was in control of his game and pouncing on anything he can attack - showing the complete clarity and commitment of England’s Bazball batters. At one point in the day, the commentator Harsha Bhogle questioned why India should be asked to play the Test Championship final in England when so much of their success had come at home, saying it was like playing all the preliminaries on Roland-Garros clay and then the final at Wimbledon. Yet it was by finding ways to win Test matches in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India over the preceding 15 months that Australia had qualified first on the table, doing so with careful preparation and a mature backroom approach after the volatile Justin Langer years . India’s resort to extreme turning pitches at home have, in contrast to the period in which teams coached by Ravi Shastri had twice won Test series in Australia, left the game’s financial giant looking short of the right rhythms and ideas for an equable English pitch. Steve Smith drives through point. Credit: Getty With a group dominated by thirty-somethings all looking for this England tour to be the crowning achievement of their careers, Cummins’ team have spoken freely of legacies in the leadup to this match. And as Head and Smith constructed a union worth more than 200 runs against increasingly bedraggled opposition, it seemed as though the foundations of a monument were being steadily hauled into place: as steadily as Smith manoeuvred the day’s final ball to the cover boundary.

Not just the good, the bad and the ugly of Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions, but the accommodations of those willing to take the money and look the other way. One moment from the fight in December 2019 lingers more than most: Joshua absorbing the cheers from the young crowd, many of whom were women in western clothes, before averting his gaze upwards towards the kingdom’s ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and giving a fist-pump to the man who had made it all possible. It felt disconcerting yet no one was really surprised. A couple of days earlier, Joshua had responded to questions about human rights by insisting the Saudis were “trying to do a good job politically” before adding: “I just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I’ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.” Anthony Joshua celebrates victory over Andy Ruiz Jr in Diriyah in 2019 – before the fight the Briton said Saudi Arabia was ‘trying to do a good job politically’. Photograph: Hassan Ammar/AP Perhaps Joshua was unwilling to delve any deeper for fear that those dissenting whispers would permanently stain his conscience. He was the first global sports star to display a sunny-side-up approach to the kingdom rarely seen outside its own PR campaigns, but far from the last. Only this week Bryson DeChambeau claimed the Saudis were “trying to do good for the world and showcase themselves in a light that hasn’t been seen in a while” by setting up LIV Golf . Meanwhile, taking it all in was Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, who sported the look of a man whose lottery numbers had just come in on the same day he had hit an 11-team accumulator. “This really feels like a really big moment where everything could change,” he told me. “If they’re going to be investing this kind of money in the sport, we’ve got to be realists.” ‘I still hate LIV’: Rory McIlroy calls for consequences over breakaway players Read more It was a comment to make Henry Kissinger purr. But Hearn was merely ahead of the game. That Joshua fight put the world on notice about how serious Saudi Arabia was about sport. The acquisition of Newcastle United , and the hosting of Formula One and high-profile golf events confirmed it. On Tuesday the Saudi regime flexed their muscles further by striking a deal with the PGA Tour to merge with LIV, backed by the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). At the same time they are also throwing impossible sums to attract western players to the Saudi Pro football league. The question now is what happens next. Saudi Arabia has not officially bid for the 2030 World Cup, but that is only a matter of time. Cricket is also said to be of interest, especially with so many of the population from Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. Esports is another major focus – next month it will host Gamers8, which is billed as the world’s largest gaming and esports festival. As Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions grow, people continue to wonder what lies behind it all. We live in a world that prefers certainty over nuance, simple answers not complex truths. But the following is all true: it is about sportswashing, using sport as a tool of soft power, and improving the lives of its population, 70% of which is under 35, and diversifying its economy, all at the same time. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund took control of Newcastle in October 2021. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images According to the Saudis, the value of their sports event industry is growing by 8% per year, rising from $2.1bn in 2018 to an estimated $3.3bn by next year. It wants to have more people coming to Saudi Arabia, playing golf and spending their pounds, dollars and euros in the country. Yet it will not be able to wash away its human rights record that easily. Not when in the last 15 months, it has jailed a woman, Salma al-Shehab, for 34 years for merely following and retweeting dissidents and activists . And also executed 81 people in one day . According to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, 41 of those killed were Muslims from the Shia minority “who had taken part in anti-government protests in 2011-12, calling for greater political participation ”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet for too many people sporting success trumps human rights. As Ben Freeman, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for responsible statecraft, puts it when asked about Newcastle United’s supporters cheering on their owners: “A lot of sports fans are easily bought off. If somebody buys their team, they support them. Even if it happens to be an authoritarian government, like the Saudis.” In other words, sportswashing works. Rory McIlroy asked: ‘Would you rather have one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds as a partner or an enemy? Money talks, and you’d rather have them as a partner.’ Photograph: Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images Of course there is hypocrisy here too. Sporting stars and supporters are hammered for taking the Saudi coin, while at the same time few question Britain when it exports billions of pounds in weapons to the country and receives billions of pounds in foreign investment in return. Meanwhile, the Saudis influence on sport is only going to grow, as Rory McIlroy painfully acknowledged on Wednesday. “The PIF and the Saudis want to spend money in the game of golf and they are not going to stop,” McIlroy said. “Would you rather have one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds as a partner or an enemy? At the end of the day money talks, and you’d rather have them as a partner.” As a statement of cold, hard realpolitik it was hard to argue.","pubDate":"2023-06-07 20:37:42","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef393d79da362473f7bba502b7c5aaea782cf1e/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6dbb7e6a1277ab8b93bc50b4544103e","source_id":"theguardian","category":["sports"],"country":["canada","united kingdom","india","singapore"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rising from Hardship, Maham shines in Women’s Cricket","link":"https://www.nation.com.pk/08-Jun-2023/rising-from-hardship-maham-shines-in-women-s-cricket","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["OUR STAFF REPORT"],"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE - Maham Manzoor, a talented left-arm orthodox spinner from Hyderabad Region, has overcome financial hardships to make a name for herself in the world of women’s cricket.","content":"LAHORE - Maham Manzoor, a talented left-arm orthodox spinner from Hyderabad Region, has overcome financial hardships to make a name for herself in the world of women’s cricket. Despite the challenges she faced, Maham’s dedication to her skill has propelled her to represent her region and aspire to represent her country at the international level. Starting her cricket journey by representing Hyderabad Region at the U19 level in the 2013-14 season, Maham quickly caught the attention of selectors with her natural talent for spinning the ball. Despite the financial obstacles in her path, she remained determined and continued to train and compete, determined to leave her mark in the sport. In 2014, Maham made her List-A cricket debut in the Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah Women Cricket Championship Seniors. Although her team’s overall performance may not have been outstanding, Maham’s individual contributions stood out, highlighting her potential as a rising star. Reflecting on her journey so far, Maham shared, “I started playing on the streets, and my family has been very supportive from the beginning, motivating and encouraging me to pursue this game. I had no knowledge that there existed a game played with a hard ball; I used to play with boys using a taped ball.” Recalling how she discovered women’s cricket, Maham explained, “I was in school when I saw on television that the women’s team was playing a cricket match, and that’s when I found out about women’s cricket.” When asked about her inspiration to pursue cricket professionally, Maham mentioned, “Javeria Khan inspired me. When I saw her on the ground for the first time, I realized she was a senior player, and watching her play gave me the feeling that I should also play.” Maham’s journey has been far from easy. She had to travel from Hyderabad to Karachi to pursue her dream due to the limited facilities available in her hometown. Despite financial constraints, she bears the responsibility of supporting her family while pursuing her cricketing aspirations. Nevertheless, Maham remains hopeful about representing her country in the future. Maham’s father, who passed away in 2018, dreamt of seeing his daughter representing the Pakistan women’s cricket team. Maham shared, “My father always pushed me to play this game. He encouraged me, telling me that good times would come and wanted to see me wearing Pakistan’s colors.” Recently, Maham had the opportunity to represent the Dynamites in the Pakistan Cup Women’s Cricket Tournament. In the T20 phase of the tournament, she performed exceptionally well, finishing fourth among the bowlers with five wickets from two matches. In the subsequent one-day phase, Maham claimed four wickets from four matches, helping her team secure victory and further establishing herself as an exciting prospect in Pakistan women’s cricket. Looking ahead, Maham remains determined and optimistic. She stated, “I have faced great struggles to reach this stage. I am grateful for what I have achieved so far and will continue to seize opportunities. I urge other girls to take up this sport and request their parents to support them.”","pubDate":"2023-06-07 20:23:02","image_url":"https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2023-06-08/rising-from-hardship-maham-shines-in-women-s-cricket-1686169378-2484.jpg","source_id":"nation_pk","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPC Minister proposes Zaka Ashraf name in PCB new setup","link":"https://www.nation.com.pk/08-Jun-2023/ipc-minister-proposes-zaka-ashraf-name-in-pcb-new-setup","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Agencies"],"video_url":null,"description":"Islamabad-As the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman elections just around the corner; one of the key allies of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, Pakistan People’s Party Federal Minister for Inter Provincial Coordination (IPC) Ehsan ur Rehman Mazari proposed the name of Muhammad Zaka Ashraf in the new setup of the PCB.","content":"Islamabad-As the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman elections just around the corner; one of the key allies of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, Pakistan People’s Party Federal Minister for Inter Provincial Coordination (IPC) Ehsan ur Rehman Mazari proposed the name of Muhammad Zaka Ashraf in the new setup of the PCB.

SCORECARD | WTC Final: Australia v India Smith brought up the pair's 250 stand off the last ball of the day when he guided Mohammed Shami through the covers for a sweetly timed four. The fourth-wicket duo had come together with Australia in trouble at 76-3 after being sent into bat in bowler-friendly conditions. But as the sun burst through the clouds in south London, the runs started to flow. \"Losing the toss this morning, we've done exceptionally well,\" Head told Sky Sports. \"I was trying to make sure I was in really good positions today. I got tested through parts of that. \"I just tried to work through those periods and be adjustable and stay relaxed.\" Head was troubled by left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja but by counter-attacking from the start of his innings -- 24 of his first 27 runs came in boundaries -- he put the pressure back on the bowlers. With Smith, who before this match averaged nearly 98 in Tests at The Oval, batting in more conventional fashion it gave the 29-year-old Head freedom to keep playing his shots. \"I always love batting with Steve (Smith),\" said Head. \"You need to have plans bowling to him because he's so unique. \"You say he played second fiddle but I always feel I'm playing second fiddle to him and can go a bit under the radar.\" By the time India tested Head with the short ball, he was well set and a pulled single off Shami took him to a sixth Test hundred in just 106 balls, including 14 fours and a six. \"Travis just goes about his business, sees the ball and hits it,\" said Smith, whose fifty came off 144 balls. \"He shifted the momentum. It was a tremendous innings.\" India took the new ball before the close but it made little difference on a day when captain Rohit Sharma would have been looking for many more wickets after winning the toss. And as Smith and Head repelled India, he might also have wondered about the wisdom of leaving out off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, the world's top-ranked Test bowler, who could have been a threat against an Australia top five featuring three left-handers. India had started strongly in what was their second WTC final after losing to New Zealand in the inaugural 2021 showpiece in Southampton. Mohammed Siraj removed Usman Khawaja for a duck with an excellent wobble-seam delivery and Australia were 2-1, to the raucous delight of an overwhelmingly pro-India crowd of nearly 23,000. But David Warner, who had managed just one century in his previous 32 Test innings, dug in before the increasingly assured opener struck Umesh Yadav for three fours in successive deliveries. The 36-year-old left-hander's promising innings ended on 43 when a gloved pull off medium-pacer Shardul Thakur was well caught down the legside by diving wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat. Marnus Labuschagne, the world's top-ranked Test batsman, fell early in the second session for his lunch score of 26 when he was bowled between bat and pad by a Shami inswinger. The WTC is the only major men's cricket trophy Australia have yet to win. The fixture also marks the start of a packed schedule of six Tests in eight weeks for Australia, including a five-match Ashes series against England.","pubDate":"2023-06-07 19:58:12","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India defend leaving out world No.1 Test bowler Ashwin","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/india-defend-leaving-out-world-no1-test-bowler-ashwin-c-10910291","keywords":null,"creator":["Ian Chadband"],"video_url":null,"description":"India have defended their omission of the world's top-ranked Test bowler Ravichandran Ashwin after they suffered a first-day mauling in the World Test final.","content":"India have defended their decision to leave the world's top-ranked Test bowler Ravichandran Ashwin out of an attack that got flogged by Australia's batters at the World Test Championship final. There was more than a little surprise when the veteran spin star's name was omitted from the Indian line-up for The Oval on Wednesday, with Ricky Ponting among the critics. Ashwin has for so long proved Australia's tormentor-in-chief with 114 wickets at 28.36 apiece, with regular success against a left-hander dominated top order. And by the end of a trying day for India's weary-looking seam attack, with only spin allrounder Ravi Jadeja to ease their load, the gamble of leaving the 36-year-old out looked to already be costly as Australia finished in a dominant position on 3-327. \"It's always a very difficult decision to drop a champion bowler like that,\" conceded Paras Mhambrey, India's former Test seamer who's now their bowling coach. \"But looking at the (cool) conditions in the morning, I thought having the additional seamer would definitely be beneficial - and it also has worked in the past. \"If you look at the earlier games that we played - the last Test match we went in with four seamers, which really did well. \"The seamers have done well out here for us but you can always look at the hindsight, saying additional spinner would have been a different.\" The workload on the Indian fast bowlers appeared to have taken its toll come the last session as Travis Head and Steve Smith punished them mercilessly in an unbroken 251-run partnership. But Mhambrey was still adamant India could win from their difficult position. \"Yes, why not? The second new ball, we saw the ball was getting a little seam, it was getting cut,\" he said. \"Tomorrow morning will be an important session for us.

Head scored his first overseas century during the opening day of the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval and Smith is not far away from his seventh hundred in England. Travis Head celebrates his century. Credit: Getty Stamping his authority in Australia over the past two summers with counter-punching hundreds, Head has now become a game changer in England, scoring an unbeaten 146 in just 156 deliveries as Australia went to stumps at 3-327 on Wednesday with Smith 95 not out. It would have been more had India managed better than 85 of their scheduled 90 overs. After Australia were asked to bat on a green pitch under dull skies, Head came to the crease with his side teetering at 3-76. He added 251 with Smith, who played the unobtrusive anchor on a ground where he averaged almost a hundred going into the match. Smith has already scored six centuries in England, but no one else in the Australian squad had managed one, until Head came to the party in emphatic style. “We don’t talk too much,” Head said about batting with Smith. “I’ve always said I do really enjoy batting with Steve because of how much attention he receives. Obviously, he’s one of the best players in the world, probably our best player. He’s our best batter and unbelievable in these conditions, and he receives so much attention from the opposition in terms of plans and how difficult he is to bowl to. Head negotiated some short-pitched bowling, especially in the balls leading up to his century. Credit: Getty “Going out to bat with him, you’re in the shadow of that, and you can sort of sneak under the radar and go about your business because he’s drawn so much attention. It felt like that again today. It felt like he wasn’t going to leave, he wasn’t going to go anywhere. He’s at the other end and got in that rhythm and just went about his business. “A lot of balls that he may play at are a lot different to me, so I think we complement each other completely differently. But in the partnership, it works really nicely.” Head played four Tests during his last England tour in 2019 for an average of 27 and a highest score of 51 before being dropped. Now playing with an uncluttered mind and corresponding freedom, he shapes as a pivotal player in this Ashes series. Travis Head and Steve Smith combined to not only steady the ship, but to steer it into open waters. Credit: Getty Images Certainly England captain Ben Stokes knows how dangerous Head can be after he averaged almost 60 in a man-of-the-series performance in the home Ashes two summers ago. “I think Travis Head is someone who since he came into the team has really taken his opportunity, and gone ‘This is how I’m going to play’,” Stokes said in a recent interview. “Him being allowed to go out and play the way he has, he’s been so successful. “He was so hard to bowl to in Australia when we were there last time because he just threw counter-punches, and those innings he played against us were really hard to bowl to, really hard to set fields to.” Loading Seduced by the seamer-friendly conditions and no doubt concerned what Australia’s pace attack would do in such helpful circumstances, Indian captain Rohit Sharma must be ruing how quickly the cloud burnt off and sunshine sapped the moisture from the pitch. India’s bowling coach, former Test player Paras Mhambrey, was concerned about India’s lack of discipline after a good start. He also felt the four-man Indian pace attack could have started their bouncer attack against Head before he had motored into the 90s. “We discussed it as an area we could exploit,” Mhambrey said after play. Disconcertingly for India, the occasional delivery is already keeping low. Loading While Head’s innings was the most important and Smith’s the most reassuring, David Warner’s was the most pleasing. The veteran opener’s 43 may pale in comparison to the results of Smith and Head, but despite the most difficult of the batting conditions, Warner did not bat like a man whose Test place was in danger. It was his second-highest score in his last 10 Test innings. News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .

It’s not hard to track. It’s not as if it’s skittered off the fairway and away into the ti-tree. A year ago, back at the tee shall we say, the PGA Tour was busy trying to wrap a one-wood around LIV Golf’s kaffiyeh-ed head. Commissioner Jay Monahan said he personally knew people who’d lost loved ones in the 9/11 terrorist attacks and that anyone who professed ignorance of Saudi Arabia’s appalling human rights record was “living under a rock”. If you really have been living under a rock, know that the LIV Golf rebel tour that was so aggrieving the PGA is wholly owned by Saudi Arabia’s seemingly bottomless Public Investment Fund (PIF). Its assets also include Newcastle United in the EPL, the four best Saudi clubs whose rosters now feature Cristiano Ronaldo, and as of Tuesday Karim Benzema, and soon Lionel Messi, who is already on $50 million a year as an ambassador anyway. PIF’s sundries encompass an F1 race and a recent world heavyweight title promotion and its unofficial prospectus includes an Olympic Games and a World Cup, not to mention the United Nations, Davos and NATO. Loading A month ago, the PGA was lobbying American politicians to shun Saudi inroads into sport, damning their distasteful penchant for cutting off people’s heads. Last week, Jack Nicklaus no less was turning his revered back on renegades who had signed up with LIV for nine-figure considerations, saying: “I don’t even consider those guys part of the game anymore.” Those guys included Australia’s British Open winner Cam Smith. But there was an ad break, and now we’re at the green, and look: there’s commissioner Monahan and PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who coincidentally is also chairman of Newcastle and also-er chairman of Saudi state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, strolling arm-in-arm onto the green, where their balls sit side by cosy side, just about kissing. Greg Norman, right, with Phil Mickelson in Saudi Arabia in February. Credit: Getty “A transformational partnership,” said Monahan, who slips seamlessly from commissioner to CEO under Al-Rumayyan’s chairmanship of the new joint enterprise that will own and run everything in world golf and make it all right just like that. “Things have changed.” You can hazard your own guess about what has changed, and you’d be right. As for those human rights records, bit of a misunderstanding as it turns out. As LIV Golf chief Greg Norman said back at the start: “Look, anyone can make a mistake.” Oh, and yeah, FedEx, whose company name adorns the PGA’s championship cup, has had since 2021 a nice little half-a-bill deal going on in Saudi Arabia. That’s an awkward lie. Quick, where’s the toe iron? Cam Smith, LIV-ing the life. Credit: Getty Images. Still, “awesome day today,” tweeted LIV poster boy Phil Mickelson. Every day’s probably pretty awesome when the Saudis are stuffing haemo-dollars into your pocket. But the players who stayed loyal to the PGA were not told because as it turns out, they’re bit players in their own game. “Nothing like finding out through Twitter that we’re merging with a tour that we said we’d never do that with,” posted Canadian Mackenzie Hughes. And Norman was not told because as it turns out, he’s less the Great White Shark, more a pawn in a vastly bigger game. Kerry Packer. Credit: AAP Rebel ventures in sport have short half-lives. Typically, they either flame out or muscle in. Evidently, LIV was struggling for sponsors, broadcasters and spectators everywhere except Adelaide. And the PGA wasn’t keen to plough through a raft of fearfully expensive pending legislation, and so here they are, in lockstep bound for the next tee, high-fiving and wise-cracking as they go. There are minor details to buy out – sorry, thrash out – like who what and where and when, though we know why. There’s also the ticklish matter of whether the LIV players get to keep their mega-bribes and whether the PGA players who turned down LIV on principle (look under “archaic” in the dictionary) are going to hate their guts forever. But it can be presumed that Adelaide has as much chance of hosting another tournament in the new LIVy-lovey tour as Casey Station. Like cricket all those years ago, pro golf probably needed a shake-up. But this has played out more like a shake-down. If you want to know who runs world golf from now on, look at Australian cricket in the decades after World Series Cricket. Kerry Packer paid the piper and called the tune. Almost half a century later, sport is a cacophony of pipers and their paymasters. Loading Look around in almost any direction, but let’s do this one: Qatar bought a World Cup and are in for an Olympics and what they don’t own in soccer, the Saudis do. India – that is, a cartel of Indian tycoons – own world cricket and they’re still not satisfied. Packer bought cricket to make money. The Gulf states fork out for sport to buy status, influence and cover. The Indians buy cricket as a plaything. But it’s all buy, buy, buy. Who cares? Probably very few, and that’s what’s changed. Players get their prizemoney, fans get their entertainment, sponsors get their exposure and owners get their kicks and that’s all she wrote, folks. Humans have their rights. When the Saudis bought Newcastle off its unpopular previous owner, fans brandished signs to say that they’d gotten their club back. They didn’t of course, but they did just now secure a place in the Champions League for the first time in two decades. They’re following the bouncing ball.

India, by contrast, turned up to the Oval with all the flaws one might expect of a team for which only one member – Cheteshwar Pujara – had done anything other than spend the past four months preoccupied with the Twenty20 glitz of the IPL . Steve Smith applauds Travis Head’s first Test hundred overseas. Credit: Getty In essence, this was a case of roles reversed from February’s day one of the Border-Gavaskar bout in Nagpur , and left any pre-series noise about a lack of Australian tour games looking like so much stuff and nonsense. Mental and technical grounding was clearly in abundance. Having been sent in on an overcast morning on a green-tinged pitch, this was a commanding performance by Pat Cummins’ men, shrugging off the losses of Usman Khawaja then Marnus Labuschange to seaming deliveries and then forging the ideal platform. But it was made a far more straightforward task by the fact that India’s approach, in terms of selection, tactics and execution, was clearly affected by a lack of time to shrug off the IPL and recalibrate properly for the game billed as Test cricket’s “grand final” by breathless broadcasters. Loading Both sides, it seems, were fooled by the green grass on top of what proved to be quite a dry Oval surface, for Cummins would also have bowled first. Each of the past two Ashes Tests at the ground have been won by the team sent in to bat. However, it was India’s selectors who made the most questionable call, preferring a fourth seamer in Umesh Yadav or Shardul Thakur to Ravichandran Ashwin, so vital in Australia in 2020-21. With the Dukes ball in hand, none of Yadav, Shardul, Mohammad Shami or Mohammad Siraj were able to find the right length on the day, too often dropping short of the zone in which Australia’s batters would be tempted to drive or at risk of lbw. And in tactical terms, the inconsistency of the bowling made it difficult for Rohit Sharma to properly create pressure or hatch plans, despite plenty of attempts. Loading Australian decisiveness was articulated from the very first ball of the Test, when Warner offered a firm, straight bat to Shami, looked for a run, and then bellowed a clear cry of “no” as soon as he could not find one. Four years ago, Warner had been too defensive in mindset, giving Stuart Broad a more or less stationary target. His sole score of the series, on day one at Headingley, was a miracle of plays and misses. His best innings in England, including 85 at the Oval in 2015, have been proactive and positive, keeping the bowlers on edge. He did that here, unafraid to upper cut to the third man boundary, and then feasting off a rusty-looking Yadav. Warner’s dismissal shortly before lunch to Shardul was cause for Warner to throw his head back, but it has given him something to work with on this tour. Cummins and the selectors were looking for signs of positivity. They got them. The exit of a new Warner brought the arrival of an older version of Smith. The shuffle is back, carefully recast during the team’s training camp in Beckenham. So too is an unhurried sense of belief that runs will come - after spending much of the afternoon in Head’s slipstream, Smith clicked through the gears in the evening. David Warner fashioned 43. Credit: AP Twice Smith edged into the cordon, only to be reprieved by soft hands that saw the ball drop short of catching. But for the most part, his typically theatrical commentary as to how balls reacted off the surface was much more dramatic than the shots themselves: all but a few hit somewhere near the middle of the bat. Pleasingly for Cummins, who had imbued Head with so much confidence to think only of free scoring and counter-punching when he batted, the South Australian left-hander’s innings was arguably the least revelatory thing about the day. Granted favourable conditions after some of the morning’s lateral and vertical variation had subsided, Head was aggressive as ever, punching boundaries through the covers, upper cutting over the slips and flicking behind square leg. Loading A few belated short balls made him somewhat uncomfortable when directed at his hip and armpit, one edge falling just short of gully. But overall he was in control of his game and pouncing on anything he can attack - showing the complete clarity and commitment of England’s Bazball batters. At one point in the day, the commentator Harsha Bhogle questioned why India should be asked to play the Test Championship final in England when so much of their success had come at home, saying it was like playing all the preliminaries on Roland-Garros clay and then the final at Wimbledon. Yet it was by finding ways to win Test matches in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India over the preceding 15 months that Australia had qualified first on the table, doing so with careful preparation and a mature backroom approach after the volatile Justin Langer years . India’s resort to extreme turning pitches at home have, in contrast to the period in which teams coached by Ravi Shastri had twice won Test series in Australia, left the game’s financial giant looking short of the right rhythms and ideas for an equable English pitch. Steve Smith drives through point. Credit: Getty With a group dominated by thirty-somethings all looking for this England tour to be the crowning achievement of their careers, Cummins’ team have spoken freely of legacies in the leadup to this match. And as Head and Smith constructed a union worth more than 200 runs against increasingly bedraggled opposition, it seemed as though the foundations of a monument were being steadily hauled into place: as steadily as Smith manoeuvred the day’s final ball to the cover boundary.

Not just the good, the bad and the ugly of Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions, but the accommodations of those willing to take the money and look the other way. One moment from the fight in December 2019 lingers more than most: Joshua absorbing the cheers from the young crowd, many of whom were women in western clothes, before averting his gaze upwards towards the kingdom’s ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and giving a fist-pump to the man who had made it all possible. It felt disconcerting yet no one was really surprised. A couple of days earlier, Joshua had responded to questions about human rights by insisting the Saudis were “trying to do a good job politically” before adding: “I just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I’ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.” Anthony Joshua celebrates victory over Andy Ruiz Jr in Diriyah in 2019 – before the fight the Briton said Saudi Arabia was ‘trying to do a good job politically’. Photograph: Hassan Ammar/AP Perhaps Joshua was unwilling to delve any deeper for fear that those dissenting whispers would permanently stain his conscience. He was the first global sports star to display a sunny-side-up approach to the kingdom rarely seen outside its own PR campaigns, but far from the last. Only this week Bryson DeChambeau claimed the Saudis were “trying to do good for the world and showcase themselves in a light that hasn’t been seen in a while” by setting up LIV Golf . Meanwhile, taking it all in was Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, who sported the look of a man whose lottery numbers had just come in on the same day he had hit an 11-team accumulator. “This really feels like a really big moment where everything could change,” he told me. “If they’re going to be investing this kind of money in the sport, we’ve got to be realists.” ‘I still hate LIV’: Rory McIlroy calls for consequences over breakaway players Read more It was a comment to make Henry Kissinger purr. But Hearn was merely ahead of the game. That Joshua fight put the world on notice about how serious Saudi Arabia was about sport. The acquisition of Newcastle United , and the hosting of Formula One and high-profile golf events confirmed it. On Tuesday the Saudi regime flexed their muscles further by striking a deal with the PGA Tour to merge with LIV, backed by the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). At the same time they are also throwing impossible sums to attract western players to the Saudi Pro football league. The question now is what happens next. Saudi Arabia has not officially bid for the 2030 World Cup, but that is only a matter of time. Cricket is also said to be of interest, especially with so many of the population from Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. Esports is another major focus – next month it will host Gamers8, which is billed as the world’s largest gaming and esports festival. As Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions grow, people continue to wonder what lies behind it all. We live in a world that prefers certainty over nuance, simple answers not complex truths. But the following is all true: it is about sportswashing, using sport as a tool of soft power, and improving the lives of its population, 70% of which is under 35, and diversifying its economy, all at the same time. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund took control of Newcastle in October 2021. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images According to the Saudis, the value of their sports event industry is growing by 8% per year, rising from $2.1bn in 2018 to an estimated $3.3bn by next year. It wants to have more people coming to Saudi Arabia, playing golf and spending their pounds, dollars and euros in the country. Yet it will not be able to wash away its human rights record that easily. Not when in the last 15 months, it has jailed a woman, Salma al-Shehab, for 34 years for merely following and retweeting dissidents and activists . And also executed 81 people in one day . According to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, 41 of those killed were Muslims from the Shia minority “who had taken part in anti-government protests in 2011-12, calling for greater political participation ”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet for too many people sporting success trumps human rights. As Ben Freeman, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for responsible statecraft, puts it when asked about Newcastle United’s supporters cheering on their owners: “A lot of sports fans are easily bought off. If somebody buys their team, they support them. Even if it happens to be an authoritarian government, like the Saudis.” In other words, sportswashing works. Rory McIlroy asked: ‘Would you rather have one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds as a partner or an enemy? Money talks, and you’d rather have them as a partner.’ Photograph: Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images Of course there is hypocrisy here too. Sporting stars and supporters are hammered for taking the Saudi coin, while at the same time few question Britain when it exports billions of pounds in weapons to the country and receives billions of pounds in foreign investment in return. Meanwhile, the Saudis influence on sport is only going to grow, as Rory McIlroy painfully acknowledged on Wednesday. “The PIF and the Saudis want to spend money in the game of golf and they are not going to stop,” McIlroy said. “Would you rather have one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds as a partner or an enemy? At the end of the day money talks, and you’d rather have them as a partner.” As a statement of cold, hard realpolitik it was hard to argue.","pubDate":"2023-06-07 20:37:42","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef393d79da362473f7bba502b7c5aaea782cf1e/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6dbb7e6a1277ab8b93bc50b4544103e","source_id":"theguardian","category":["sports"],"country":["canada","united kingdom","india","singapore"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rising from Hardship, Maham shines in Women’s Cricket","link":"https://www.nation.com.pk/08-Jun-2023/rising-from-hardship-maham-shines-in-women-s-cricket","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["OUR STAFF REPORT"],"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE - Maham Manzoor, a talented left-arm orthodox spinner from Hyderabad Region, has overcome financial hardships to make a name for herself in the world of women’s cricket.","content":"LAHORE - Maham Manzoor, a talented left-arm orthodox spinner from Hyderabad Region, has overcome financial hardships to make a name for herself in the world of women’s cricket. Despite the challenges she faced, Maham’s dedication to her skill has propelled her to represent her region and aspire to represent her country at the international level. Starting her cricket journey by representing Hyderabad Region at the U19 level in the 2013-14 season, Maham quickly caught the attention of selectors with her natural talent for spinning the ball. Despite the financial obstacles in her path, she remained determined and continued to train and compete, determined to leave her mark in the sport. In 2014, Maham made her List-A cricket debut in the Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah Women Cricket Championship Seniors. Although her team’s overall performance may not have been outstanding, Maham’s individual contributions stood out, highlighting her potential as a rising star. Reflecting on her journey so far, Maham shared, “I started playing on the streets, and my family has been very supportive from the beginning, motivating and encouraging me to pursue this game. I had no knowledge that there existed a game played with a hard ball; I used to play with boys using a taped ball.” Recalling how she discovered women’s cricket, Maham explained, “I was in school when I saw on television that the women’s team was playing a cricket match, and that’s when I found out about women’s cricket.” When asked about her inspiration to pursue cricket professionally, Maham mentioned, “Javeria Khan inspired me. When I saw her on the ground for the first time, I realized she was a senior player, and watching her play gave me the feeling that I should also play.” Maham’s journey has been far from easy. She had to travel from Hyderabad to Karachi to pursue her dream due to the limited facilities available in her hometown. Despite financial constraints, she bears the responsibility of supporting her family while pursuing her cricketing aspirations. Nevertheless, Maham remains hopeful about representing her country in the future. Maham’s father, who passed away in 2018, dreamt of seeing his daughter representing the Pakistan women’s cricket team. Maham shared, “My father always pushed me to play this game. He encouraged me, telling me that good times would come and wanted to see me wearing Pakistan’s colors.” Recently, Maham had the opportunity to represent the Dynamites in the Pakistan Cup Women’s Cricket Tournament. In the T20 phase of the tournament, she performed exceptionally well, finishing fourth among the bowlers with five wickets from two matches. In the subsequent one-day phase, Maham claimed four wickets from four matches, helping her team secure victory and further establishing herself as an exciting prospect in Pakistan women’s cricket. Looking ahead, Maham remains determined and optimistic. She stated, “I have faced great struggles to reach this stage. I am grateful for what I have achieved so far and will continue to seize opportunities. I urge other girls to take up this sport and request their parents to support them.”","pubDate":"2023-06-07 20:23:02","image_url":"https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2023-06-08/rising-from-hardship-maham-shines-in-women-s-cricket-1686169378-2484.jpg","source_id":"nation_pk","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPC Minister proposes Zaka Ashraf name in PCB new setup","link":"https://www.nation.com.pk/08-Jun-2023/ipc-minister-proposes-zaka-ashraf-name-in-pcb-new-setup","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Agencies"],"video_url":null,"description":"Islamabad-As the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman elections just around the corner; one of the key allies of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, Pakistan People’s Party Federal Minister for Inter Provincial Coordination (IPC) Ehsan ur Rehman Mazari proposed the name of Muhammad Zaka Ashraf in the new setup of the PCB.","content":"Islamabad-As the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman elections just around the corner; one of the key allies of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, Pakistan People’s Party Federal Minister for Inter Provincial Coordination (IPC) Ehsan ur Rehman Mazari proposed the name of Muhammad Zaka Ashraf in the new setup of the PCB.

Australia were in a commanding position on 327-3 at stumps after losing the toss, with Head 146 not out and Steve Smith 95 not out. SCORECARD | WTC Final: Australia v India Smith brought up the pair's 250 stand off the last ball of the day when he guided Mohammed Shami through the covers for a sweetly timed four. The fourth-wicket duo had come together with Australia in trouble at 76-3 after being sent into bat in bowler-friendly conditions. But as the sun burst through the clouds in south London, the runs started to flow. \"Losing the toss this morning, we've done exceptionally well,\" Head told Sky Sports. \"I was trying to make sure I was in really good positions today. I got tested through parts of that. \"I just tried to work through those periods and be adjustable and stay relaxed.\" Head was troubled by left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja but by counter-attacking from the start of his innings -- 24 of his first 27 runs came in boundaries -- he put the pressure back on the bowlers. With Smith, who before this match averaged nearly 98 in Tests at The Oval, batting in more conventional fashion it gave the 29-year-old Head freedom to keep playing his shots. \"I always love batting with Steve (Smith),\" said Head. \"You need to have plans bowling to him because he's so unique. \"You say he played second fiddle but I always feel I'm playing second fiddle to him and can go a bit under the radar.\" By the time India tested Head with the short ball, he was well set and a pulled single off Shami took him to a sixth Test hundred in just 106 balls, including 14 fours and a six. \"Travis just goes about his business, sees the ball and hits it,\" said Smith, whose fifty came off 144 balls. \"He shifted the momentum. It was a tremendous innings.\" India took the new ball before the close but it made little difference on a day when captain Rohit Sharma would have been looking for many more wickets after winning the toss. And as Smith and Head repelled India, he might also have wondered about the wisdom of leaving out off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, the world's top-ranked Test bowler, who could have been a threat against an Australia top five featuring three left-handers. India had started strongly in what was their second WTC final after losing to New Zealand in the inaugural 2021 showpiece in Southampton. Mohammed Siraj removed Usman Khawaja for a duck with an excellent wobble-seam delivery and Australia were 2-1, to the raucous delight of an overwhelmingly pro-India crowd of nearly 23,000. But David Warner, who had managed just one century in his previous 32 Test innings, dug in before the increasingly assured opener struck Umesh Yadav for three fours in successive deliveries. The 36-year-old left-hander's promising innings ended on 43 when a gloved pull off medium-pacer Shardul Thakur was well caught down the legside by diving wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat. Marnus Labuschagne, the world's top-ranked Test batsman, fell early in the second session for his lunch score of 26 when he was bowled between bat and pad by a Shami inswinger. The WTC is the only major men's cricket trophy Australia have yet to win. The fixture also marks the start of a packed schedule of six Tests in eight weeks for Australia, including a five-match Ashes series against England.","pubDate":"2023-06-07 19:58:12","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India defend leaving out world No.1 Test bowler Ashwin","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/india-defend-leaving-out-world-no1-test-bowler-ashwin-c-10910291","keywords":null,"creator":["Ian Chadband"],"video_url":null,"description":"India have defended their omission of the world's top-ranked Test bowler Ravichandran Ashwin after they suffered a first-day mauling in the World Test final.","content":"India have defended their decision to leave the world's top-ranked Test bowler Ravichandran Ashwin out of an attack that got flogged by Australia's batters at the World Test Championship final. There was more than a little surprise when the veteran spin star's name was omitted from the Indian line-up for The Oval on Wednesday, with Ricky Ponting among the critics. Ashwin has for so long proved Australia's tormentor-in-chief with 114 wickets at 28.36 apiece, with regular success against a left-hander dominated top order. And by the end of a trying day for India's weary-looking seam attack, with only spin allrounder Ravi Jadeja to ease their load, the gamble of leaving the 36-year-old out looked to already be costly as Australia finished in a dominant position on 3-327. \"It's always a very difficult decision to drop a champion bowler like that,\" conceded Paras Mhambrey, India's former Test seamer who's now their bowling coach. \"But looking at the (cool) conditions in the morning, I thought having the additional seamer would definitely be beneficial - and it also has worked in the past. \"If you look at the earlier games that we played - the last Test match we went in with four seamers, which really did well. \"The seamers have done well out here for us but you can always look at the hindsight, saying additional spinner would have been a different.\" The workload on the Indian fast bowlers appeared to have taken its toll come the last session as Travis Head and Steve Smith punished them mercilessly in an unbroken 251-run partnership. But Mhambrey was still adamant India could win from their difficult position. \"Yes, why not? The second new ball, we saw the ball was getting a little seam, it was getting cut,\" he said. \"Tomorrow morning will be an important session for us. If we take a few wicket pick-ups quickly, then definitely we have an opportunity to come back in the game.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-07 19:46:27","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-10910291/26a561fe23ef72a8c30705a29f3c2e81a85b7708-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Head and Smith send Ashes warning in Test Championship batathon","link":"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/cricket/head-and-smith-send-ashes-warning-in-test-championship-20230608-p5dewi.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Malcolm Conn"],"video_url":null,"description":"Travis Head and Steve Smith have set Australia up with an unbeaten 251-run partnership on day one of the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval.","content":"Travis Head has announced himself as Australia’s most influential batsman and Steve Smith remains the most reliable just a week out from the Ashes. Head scored his first overseas century during the opening day of the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval and Smith is not far away from his seventh hundred in England. Travis Head celebrates his century. Credit: Getty Stamping his authority in Australia over the past two summers with counter-punching hundreds, Head has now become a game changer in England, scoring an unbeaten 146 in just 156 deliveries as Australia went to stumps at 3-327 on Wednesday with Smith 95 not out. It would have been more had India managed better than 85 of their scheduled 90 overs. After Australia were asked to bat on a green pitch under dull skies, Head came to the crease with his side teetering at 3-76. He added 251 with Smith, who played the unobtrusive anchor on a ground where he averaged almost a hundred going into the match. Smith has already scored six centuries in England, but no one else in the Australian squad had managed one, until Head came to the party in emphatic style. “We don’t talk too much,” Head said about batting with Smith. “I’ve always said I do really enjoy batting with Steve because of how much attention he receives. Obviously, he’s one of the best players in the world, probably our best player. He’s our best batter and unbelievable in these conditions, and he receives so much attention from the opposition in terms of plans and how difficult he is to bowl to. Head negotiated some short-pitched bowling, especially in the balls leading up to his century. Credit: Getty “Going out to bat with him, you’re in the shadow of that, and you can sort of sneak under the radar and go about your business because he’s drawn so much attention. It felt like that again today. It felt like he wasn’t going to leave, he wasn’t going to go anywhere. He’s at the other end and got in that rhythm and just went about his business. “A lot of balls that he may play at are a lot different to me, so I think we complement each other completely differently. But in the partnership, it works really nicely.” Head played four Tests during his last England tour in 2019 for an average of 27 and a highest score of 51 before being dropped. Now playing with an uncluttered mind and corresponding freedom, he shapes as a pivotal player in this Ashes series. Travis Head and Steve Smith combined to not only steady the ship, but to steer it into open waters. Credit: Getty Images Certainly England captain Ben Stokes knows how dangerous Head can be after he averaged almost 60 in a man-of-the-series performance in the home Ashes two summers ago. “I think Travis Head is someone who since he came into the team has really taken his opportunity, and gone ‘This is how I’m going to play’,” Stokes said in a recent interview. “Him being allowed to go out and play the way he has, he’s been so successful. “He was so hard to bowl to in Australia when we were there last time because he just threw counter-punches, and those innings he played against us were really hard to bowl to, really hard to set fields to.” Loading Seduced by the seamer-friendly conditions and no doubt concerned what Australia’s pace attack would do in such helpful circumstances, Indian captain Rohit Sharma must be ruing how quickly the cloud burnt off and sunshine sapped the moisture from the pitch. India’s bowling coach, former Test player Paras Mhambrey, was concerned about India’s lack of discipline after a good start. He also felt the four-man Indian pace attack could have started their bouncer attack against Head before he had motored into the 90s. “We discussed it as an area we could exploit,” Mhambrey said after play. Disconcertingly for India, the occasional delivery is already keeping low. Loading While Head’s innings was the most important and Smith’s the most reassuring, David Warner’s was the most pleasing. The veteran opener’s 43 may pale in comparison to the results of Smith and Head, but despite the most difficult of the batting conditions, Warner did not bat like a man whose Test place was in danger. It was his second-highest score in his last 10 Test innings. News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .

It’s not hard to track. It’s not as if it’s skittered off the fairway and away into the ti-tree. A year ago, back at the tee shall we say, the PGA Tour was busy trying to wrap a one-wood around LIV Golf’s kaffiyeh-ed head. Commissioner Jay Monahan said he personally knew people who’d lost loved ones in the 9/11 terrorist attacks and that anyone who professed ignorance of Saudi Arabia’s appalling human rights record was “living under a rock”. If you really have been living under a rock, know that the LIV Golf rebel tour that was so aggrieving the PGA is wholly owned by Saudi Arabia’s seemingly bottomless Public Investment Fund (PIF). Its assets also include Newcastle United in the EPL, the four best Saudi clubs whose rosters now feature Cristiano Ronaldo, and as of Tuesday Karim Benzema, and soon Lionel Messi, who is already on $50 million a year as an ambassador anyway. PIF’s sundries encompass an F1 race and a recent world heavyweight title promotion and its unofficial prospectus includes an Olympic Games and a World Cup, not to mention the United Nations, Davos and NATO. Loading A month ago, the PGA was lobbying American politicians to shun Saudi inroads into sport, damning their distasteful penchant for cutting off people’s heads. Last week, Jack Nicklaus no less was turning his revered back on renegades who had signed up with LIV for nine-figure considerations, saying: “I don’t even consider those guys part of the game anymore.” Those guys included Australia’s British Open winner Cam Smith. But there was an ad break, and now we’re at the green, and look: there’s commissioner Monahan and PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who coincidentally is also chairman of Newcastle and also-er chairman of Saudi state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, strolling arm-in-arm onto the green, where their balls sit side by cosy side, just about kissing. Greg Norman, right, with Phil Mickelson in Saudi Arabia in February. Credit: Getty “A transformational partnership,” said Monahan, who slips seamlessly from commissioner to CEO under Al-Rumayyan’s chairmanship of the new joint enterprise that will own and run everything in world golf and make it all right just like that. “Things have changed.” You can hazard your own guess about what has changed, and you’d be right. As for those human rights records, bit of a misunderstanding as it turns out. As LIV Golf chief Greg Norman said back at the start: “Look, anyone can make a mistake.” Oh, and yeah, FedEx, whose company name adorns the PGA’s championship cup, has had since 2021 a nice little half-a-bill deal going on in Saudi Arabia. That’s an awkward lie. Quick, where’s the toe iron? Cam Smith, LIV-ing the life. Credit: Getty Images. Still, “awesome day today,” tweeted LIV poster boy Phil Mickelson. Every day’s probably pretty awesome when the Saudis are stuffing haemo-dollars into your pocket. But the players who stayed loyal to the PGA were not told because as it turns out, they’re bit players in their own game. “Nothing like finding out through Twitter that we’re merging with a tour that we said we’d never do that with,” posted Canadian Mackenzie Hughes. And Norman was not told because as it turns out, he’s less the Great White Shark, more a pawn in a vastly bigger game. Kerry Packer. Credit: AAP Rebel ventures in sport have short half-lives. Typically, they either flame out or muscle in. Evidently, LIV was struggling for sponsors, broadcasters and spectators everywhere except Adelaide. And the PGA wasn’t keen to plough through a raft of fearfully expensive pending legislation, and so here they are, in lockstep bound for the next tee, high-fiving and wise-cracking as they go. There are minor details to buy out – sorry, thrash out – like who what and where and when, though we know why. There’s also the ticklish matter of whether the LIV players get to keep their mega-bribes and whether the PGA players who turned down LIV on principle (look under “archaic” in the dictionary) are going to hate their guts forever. But it can be presumed that Adelaide has as much chance of hosting another tournament in the new LIVy-lovey tour as Casey Station. Like cricket all those years ago, pro golf probably needed a shake-up. But this has played out more like a shake-down. If you want to know who runs world golf from now on, look at Australian cricket in the decades after World Series Cricket. Kerry Packer paid the piper and called the tune. Almost half a century later, sport is a cacophony of pipers and their paymasters. Loading Look around in almost any direction, but let’s do this one: Qatar bought a World Cup and are in for an Olympics and what they don’t own in soccer, the Saudis do. India – that is, a cartel of Indian tycoons – own world cricket and they’re still not satisfied. Packer bought cricket to make money. The Gulf states fork out for sport to buy status, influence and cover. The Indians buy cricket as a plaything. But it’s all buy, buy, buy. Who cares? Probably very few, and that’s what’s changed. Players get their prizemoney, fans get their entertainment, sponsors get their exposure and owners get their kicks and that’s all she wrote, folks. Humans have their rights. When the Saudis bought Newcastle off its unpopular previous owner, fans brandished signs to say that they’d gotten their club back. They didn’t of course, but they did just now secure a place in the Champions League for the first time in two decades. They’re following the bouncing ball.

Steve Smith applauds Travis Head’s first Test hundred overseas. Credit: Getty In essence, this was a case of roles reversed from February’s day one of the Border-Gavaskar bout in Nagpur , and left any pre-series noise about a lack of Australian tour games looking like so much stuff and nonsense. Mental and technical grounding was clearly in abundance. Having been sent in on an overcast morning on a green-tinged pitch, this was a commanding performance by Pat Cummins’ men, shrugging off the losses of Usman Khawaja then Marnus Labuschange to seaming deliveries and then forging the ideal platform. But it was made a far more straightforward task by the fact that India’s approach, in terms of selection, tactics and execution, was clearly affected by a lack of time to shrug off the IPL and recalibrate properly for the game billed as Test cricket’s “grand final” by breathless broadcasters. Loading Both sides, it seems, were fooled by the green grass on top of what proved to be quite a dry Oval surface, for Cummins would also have bowled first. Each of the past two Ashes Tests at the ground have been won by the team sent in to bat. However, it was India’s selectors who made the most questionable call, preferring a fourth seamer in Umesh Yadav or Shardul Thakur to Ravichandran Ashwin, so vital in Australia in 2020-21. With the Dukes ball in hand, none of Yadav, Shardul, Mohammad Shami or Mohammad Siraj were able to find the right length on the day, too often dropping short of the zone in which Australia’s batters would be tempted to drive or at risk of lbw. And in tactical terms, the inconsistency of the bowling made it difficult for Rohit Sharma to properly create pressure or hatch plans, despite plenty of attempts. Loading Australian decisiveness was articulated from the very first ball of the Test, when Warner offered a firm, straight bat to Shami, looked for a run, and then bellowed a clear cry of “no” as soon as he could not find one. Four years ago, Warner had been too defensive in mindset, giving Stuart Broad a more or less stationary target. His sole score of the series, on day one at Headingley, was a miracle of plays and misses. His best innings in England, including 85 at the Oval in 2015, have been proactive and positive, keeping the bowlers on edge. He did that here, unafraid to upper cut to the third man boundary, and then feasting off a rusty-looking Yadav. Warner’s dismissal shortly before lunch to Shardul was cause for Warner to throw his head back, but it has given him something to work with on this tour. Cummins and the selectors were looking for signs of positivity. They got them. The exit of a new Warner brought the arrival of an older version of Smith. The shuffle is back, carefully recast during the team’s training camp in Beckenham. So too is an unhurried sense of belief that runs will come - after spending much of the afternoon in Head’s slipstream, Smith clicked through the gears in the evening. David Warner fashioned 43.

But for the most part, his typically theatrical commentary as to how balls reacted off the surface was much more dramatic than the shots themselves: all but a few hit somewhere near the middle of the bat. Pleasingly for Cummins, who had imbued Head with so much confidence to think only of free scoring and counter-punching when he batted, the South Australian left-hander’s innings was arguably the least revelatory thing about the day. Granted favourable conditions after some of the morning’s lateral and vertical variation had subsided, Head was aggressive as ever, punching boundaries through the covers, upper cutting over the slips and flicking behind square leg. Loading A few belated short balls made him somewhat uncomfortable when directed at his hip and armpit, one edge falling just short of gully. But overall he was in control of his game and pouncing on anything he can attack - showing the complete clarity and commitment of England’s Bazball batters. At one point in the day, the commentator Harsha Bhogle questioned why India should be asked to play the Test Championship final in England when so much of their success had come at home, saying it was like playing all the preliminaries on Roland-Garros clay and then the final at Wimbledon. Yet it was by finding ways to win Test matches in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India over the preceding 15 months that Australia had qualified first on the table, doing so with careful preparation and a mature backroom approach after the volatile Justin Langer years . India’s resort to extreme turning pitches at home have, in contrast to the period in which teams coached by Ravi Shastri had twice won Test series in Australia, left the game’s financial giant looking short of the right rhythms and ideas for an equable English pitch. Steve Smith drives through point. Credit: Getty With a group dominated by thirty-somethings all looking for this England tour to be the crowning achievement of their careers, Cummins’ team have spoken freely of legacies in the leadup to this match. And as Head and Smith constructed a union worth more than 200 runs against increasingly bedraggled opposition, it seemed as though the foundations of a monument were being steadily hauled into place: as steadily as Smith manoeuvred the day’s final ball to the cover boundary.
