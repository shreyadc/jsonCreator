Usually among the best fielders around the world, Jadeja unintentionally led from the front to drop a couple of catches tonight. In addition to him, all-rounders Dwayne Bravo and Shivam Dube also dropped catches. Former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, on the other hand, missed a stumping dismissal in what was a shambolic overall fielding performance. CSK should consider themselves fortunate for they had to chase only 156 runs to win the match in spite of handing as many as five reprieves to opposition batters. “I don’t take fielding for granted and still work on it. We need to do some work on our fielding and take catches because we can’t keep dropping catches in every game,” Jadeja told Star Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony. Ravindra Jadeja labels MS Dhoni as greatest finisher in cricket Furthermore, Jadeja credited the presence of numerous senior players behind a “calm and relax” dressing room. While Dhoni finished off things in style to seal a thrilling last-ball finish, other senior players namely Ambati Rayudu (40), Robin Uthappa (30) and Dwaine Pretorius (22) also chipped in with vital contributions in the second innings. “We have plenty of experience in our team so they know when to perform and what to do. So, if we’re not winning the game, we still look to be calm and relax,” Jadeja said. Ideally, Super Kings should’ve done better than needing to win 16 runs off four balls in a 156-run chase. Had it not been for Dhoni’s blazing knock towards the end, the match would’ve easily ended in a loss for Jadeja and his team.

MI suffered their seventh loss on the trot which is also the longest losing streak in the history of IPL. Unadkat started the over with a wicket of well-set Dwaine Pretorious who smashed 22 off 14 balls. It seemed as if MI will pull off their first win of the season.

The lower-order pair eventually called the shots, both literally and figuratively, when 42 runs were required to win off three overs. While Pretorius played an active role before his dismissal in the final over, it was Dhoni who hit a six and two fours to score 16 runs off four balls against Jaydev Unadkat to seal a thrilling last-ball finish at the Dr DY Patil Sports Academy.

Right, time for me to write up, sithee later. Al Davies has been in and out in his first innings for Warwicks - a five-boundaried 22 before being caught off Sam Cook. Warwicks 34-1 trail Essex by 134. Abell is nearing (this is NOT a jinx) three figures, as Somerset hit the unimaginable heights of 207-3 on what is presumably a batting paradise at The Oval. Yorkshire 254-7, Harry Brook out for 84.And at Canterbury DBD has moved onto 148 not out. Bad news for Kenickie fans, but we still love you Em Jackson. “Good Afternoon Tanya, alas I’m not but I’m certainly aware of said North-East band (more of a Dubstar fan myself - Not So Manic now and all that).” I must stretch my legs , back shortly. Essex have been bowled out for 168 in 64.2 overs after winning the toss and electing to bat. Three wickets apiece for Oliver Hannon-Dalby and Danny Briggs, the latter getting the last to fall when Tom Westley decided he had little choice but to have a crack and picked out Matt Lamb on the mid-wicket boundary. The Essex skipper departed for 80 from 176 balls and will be a bit miffed about the lack of support from his middle order, having been 42 not out - and the visitors 98 for two - when Dan Lawrence fell after lunch. Good work from his opposite number, mind you, Will Rhodes rotating his seamers from one end while Briggs twirled away at the other. Now to see if Warwickshire can either make a mockery of that effort or my earlier assertion this is a good batting surface. DIVISION ONE Old Trafford: Lancashire v Gloucestershire 170-6 Canterbury: Kent 183-3 v Hampshire The County Ground: Northamptonshire v Yorkshire 237-7 The Oval: Surrey v Somerset 163-3 Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Essex 168 all out DIVISION TWO The Riverside: Durham 187-6 v Notts Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 122 all out v Middlesex 75-2 Grace Road: Leicestershire 158-7 v Derbyshire New Road: Worcestershire 254-4 v Sussex That numbers XI in full (thanks all): Ryan Ten Doeschate, Roger TWOse, Dean JONEs, Sachin TENdulkar, Chris BalderSTONE, Geraint JONEs, Martin SpEIGHT, Craig OverTON, Jamie OverTON, BalFOUR Patrick Patterson, Simon JONEs. Not just applause but actual whoops from the Oval audience as Tom Abell reaches 50. In 14 first-class innings since his last half-century last June he had averaged 7.8, and had reached double figures only six times, so it’s not exactly underdue (is that a thing?). He celebrated by scoring two boundaries off Reece Topley’s next over, making it the most expensive of the day and adding to a feeling of pleasingly building pace as we approach tea. A second for Hasan, as now Hammond can’t resist a nibble. Gloucs 150-5. And that’s a third! Lace lbw for a duck. Hasan exuberantly triumphant, he’s made for musical theatres. Now on on a hat-trick! Glous 150-6. I’ve not written that for a while. A long while. His 12th in first-class cricket - huzzah! Kent 174-3. A second for Mahmood, his first ball back at the James Anderson end as Van Buuren feathers behind to Phi Salt. Saqib has been the pick of the bowlers today, that fluent high-armed action as smooth as ever. To my left, the diggers are busying themselves with the demolished remnants of the Red Rose Suite. Eventually the new yet-to-be-named stand [a white box like structure] will house the shop, heritage centre and ticket office underneath. An email floats by with the breeze. Hello Andrew Benton “When Marcus Harris was interviewed by Glos he mentioned doing and bit of teaching and a bit of learning - he seems to provide some stability for his partner batter, and if they can cool down and improve a bit with him there, then Glos should be looking at becoming more of a challenge all round. Chris Dent often seems to underperform with the bat, but not today! Still, with Bracey gone its time for a ‘new captain’s’ innings from van Buuren.” Yes, Harris looks certain to do for Gloucestershire what he did for Leicestershire last year. It’s a collapse! The departure of Adam Wheater, caught behind off Norwell for a seven-ball duck, means Essex have lost four for 10 in 36 balls. Smidgeon of movement away for that dismissal - Wheater was defending on the back foot - but this is no horror track by any stretch. And as tradition seemingly dictates while writing an update, they’ve lost another one: Simon Harmer, bowled by Danny Briggs while trying to dance down the pitch and whip it through leg, makes it five for 11 in 53 balls and Essex are 109 for seven. In Division Two: Glamorgan are currently changing their socks and cursing their luck for coming up against Shaheen Shah Afridi on Middlesex debut, 122 all out. Shaheen Afridi 3-35; Roland Jones 3-34. Durham 149-5 against Notts, Dickson the shining light, lbw for 54; Sam Evans and Wiaan Mulder have put on 43 for the fifth wicket at Derby; Leics 111-4; and a third wicket for Tom Haines at New Road, Worcs 185-4. D’Oliverira 50 not out. Adam Rossington has just given a brilliant impression of a man who has woken up, walked downstairs into the kitchen and immediately stepped in a pile of puppy poo, having tried to larrup a half volley from Liam Norwell (who replaced OHD at the Pavilion End) and seen it fly straight into the hands of cover. Essex, who won the toss remember, are 107 for five and in danger of squandering this advantage. All eyes on Tom Westley, who is unbeaten on 45 and now has Adam Wheater for company. Somerset, 107-2, are being uncharacteristically stoical. Abell grinding out a 93-ball 34; Banton a little more cocksure with two boundaries in his 11 not out. JOverton, bowling at his old team, had Renshaw caught for 48. Essex, meanwhile, are 108-6. At The County Ground , more quick-fire runs for Malan (64) and Brook (63 not out). All four wickets to fall have gone to goldenarm Gareth Berg. Yorks 161-4. Compton is out shock at Canterbury; where Kent are 120-3. He played 103 balls for his 27. Bell-Drummond still there on 81. Two wickets for Barker, one for Abbas. Dominos time at OT as last week’s centurion James Bracey seems to play down the wrong line to George Balderson. Gloucs 133-3. Let’s skip gently between the dandelions of Division One. Gloucs on top 127-1: a good pitch but slightly wayward from the Div 1 bowling A-team. And as I type that, Saqib, in a headband, has Harris caught by Phil Salt for 67. Gloucs 131-2 ...and Hannon-Dalby is giving it both barrels now, the second ball of his next over seeing Matt Critchley play a bit of a nothing shot outside off and edging behind for two. Essex 102 for four now Afternoon from Edgbados , where 80-odd minutes of diligent work from Tom Westley and Dan Lawrence either side of lunch has come to an end. Lawrence is the man to go for 30, Oliver Hannon-Dalby hammering away at off stump, seeing a shout for lbw declined on height and then going slightly fuller with a ball that swung in, beat the inside edge and shivered his timbers. Essex have just ticked past three figures to reach 102 for three. An animated action man celebration from Hassan Ali, who touches the ground and then springs up with both arms aloft, as Croft catches Chris Dent at second grab at second slip for 52. A breakthrough at last. Gloucs 119-1. A lovely little drive takes Harris to an unbeaten 52, joining Dent on 51. Gloucestershire 113-0. Easy pickings. This amused me some essential lunchtime reading, I've ranked every county's lineup announcement tweet from best to worst https://t.co/QTGM7UIoYY A pleasant perambulation reveals a hot sun but a squally wind, sandwiches in silver foil and lots of punters, who pottered onto the pitch and stared intently at the square. I missed Dent being dropped on 46 by Luke Wells at first slip, at shoulder height, off Hassan Ali. Lancs TV is showing a soft-focus interview with Paul Allot, all pastels and scatter cushions. And with Gloucestershire the only county not to have lost a wicket against Lancy’s mighty arsenal of Anderson, Mahmood, Hasan Ali and Parky - it’s time for lunch. DIVISION ONE Old Trafford: Lancashire v Gloucestershire 101-0 Canterbury: Kent 97-1 v Hampshire The County Ground: Northamptonshire v Yorkshire 110-3 The Oval: Surrey v Somerset 62-1 Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Essex 88-2 DIVISION TWO The Riverside: Durham 96-2 v Notts Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 71-7 v Middlesex Grace Road: Leicestershire 68-4 v Derbyshire New Road: Worcestershire 118-3 v Sussex Three wickets down at New Road where Tom Haines, inking his name down as the county captain with the biggest load, has dismissed Pollock for 77 and Libby for 11. Burrows snared Haynes for 2 and it’s been good morning’s fightback by Sussex. Worcs 111-3. At Chester-le-Street, Petersen (Keegan) is batting against Pattinson (James), Paterson (Dane) and Patterson-White (Liam). Durham 81-1. ...and Harris, quick-steps, swings, and smacks him for six. Parky is on. No brownies for The Oval’s peckish hacks , sadly, but we do have a full house of alternative milks at our hot drink station, with soya, oat, coconut, almond and cow available. On the pitch Matt Renshaw has started, er, milking the Surrey bowlers, scoring six runs off a single Sam Curran over, as many as he had off the previous 10 overs combined, swiftly followed by a boundary off Craig Overton, and having scored 11 off his first 60 deliveries he has since thrashed 10 from 10. Glamorgan’s neck sinks further into its shoulders: 52-7 as Helm and Andersson join the party. Here at OT, Dent plays a little short arm pull to the boundary off Balderson as Gloucestershire look towards lunch at a very unexpected 75-0. Gold. The 🦅 has taken off in the County Championship! Shaheen Shah Afridi gets Marnus Labuschagne (again)! 🐰 #LVCountyChamp pic.twitter.com/LxprKjdHyq “Good Afternoon-just Tanya, Good Afternoon-just everyone.” Lovely to hear from you Em Jackson. “Hoping to see Durham make hay whilst the North-East sun is shining (or at least is about 8 miles up the road on Tyneside). “There was Ryan ten Doeschate (Netherlands and I seem to recall Essex (?)) now there’s Erik ten Haag at Old Trafford. . . how many “numbers” have played cricket (or indeed soccer)?” Now there’s a challenge. It’s a knight to remember (sorry) for Will Rhodes, who has just pinned Alastair Cook lbw for 23 to see Essex 37 for two after 15 overs. Lovely set-up from the Warwickshire captain, who after a succession of deliveries outside off got one to nip back in and beat the inside edge. Dan Lawrence joins Tom Westley out in the middle, having had something of a low key start to the season - 7, 17, 0 - since returning from the Caribbean In Division Two : Glamorgan, dear Glamorgan, have lost four for nine. Two in two for Shaheen Shah Afridi, two for Roland Jones and, to the sound of a chirpy car horn, a run-out. Glamorgan 34-5 . Sean Dickson and Michael Jones move seamlessly onwards against Nottinghamshire, Durham 57-0. Azad and Rhodes are freshly showered, Leicestershire 41-2 ; while Ed Pollock is scoring at a run a ball at New Road, currently 67 not out in Worcestershire’s 80-0 against the babes in the wood. David Hopps’ long mulled over and meticulously written treatise on Yorkshire in this year’s Wisden. \"If Yorkshire don’t find what Martin Luther King called “a common humanity”, then the wreckage could be irreparable for another generation.\" @DavidKHopps in the 2022 @WisdenAlmanack . https://t.co/tdplqJi6AX Gareth Berg is ripping through Yorkshire - with Lyth, Karunaratne and Hill all gone with 28 on the board.Ben Compton is bedding himself in once more, at Canterbury, but Zak Crawley is back in the pavilion, after a gratuitous quick-step to Mohammad Abbas. Kent 40-1 v Hampshire. Alastair Cook and Westley moving along steadily at Edgbaston. At OT Jimmy has switched ends, in search of the breakthrough. At The Oval: Having decided to bat Somerset have made a circumspect start at the Oval : after 10 overs only one ball had gone for more than a single, they were tiptoeing along at 1.3 an over and they’d just lost their first wicket, Tom Lammonby caught by Ollie Pope at slip off Reece Topley. Previously the chief excitement was caused by Somerset giving their hosts an incorrect team sheet, details of which were duly relayed to the crowd. Roelof van der Merwe is not in fact playing, and Jack Brooks is. Somerset 14-1. Two tins of cake have arrived in the Old Trafford press box - brownies with caramel chunks - courtesy of Mike Birty . Beat that Birmingham and south London. All sweetness and light for Gloucestershire here: 29-0. Time for a wander round the grounds.. For your pleasure Following a good point made by @JamesNBCricket - how close do Lancashire go against England in a five Test series? pic.twitter.com/fHevEFHiXJ No place for Keaton Jennings today (out with a calf injury) - the player who came out top in Tim de Lisle’s fascinating win/loss ration index - also a shout out for Parky (who plays). Without wanting to sound like some kind of stalker, I’ve been peering through my bionoculars and JA still looks in peak physical condition, as lean as ever, even if he’s not been at his testing best - yet - this morning. At mid-on Saqib Mahmood warms up. Greetings from Edgbaston, [Hello Ali!] where it’s typically tropical weather-wise and the Essex boys are in town. We’ve got a very short boundary to the left as I look towards the city and what looks like a good pitch out in the middle - hence the decision by the visitors to have a bat upon winning the toss. So it’s Alastair Cook and Nick Browne starting out against a new-ball pairing of Oliver Hannon-Dalby and Liam Norwell, with the latter having missed the run-fest versus Surrey due to a bad back. A squirted four for Cook during an otherwise probing st.. oh, a wicket ... OHD tempts Browne with a wide one and the edge flies to a diving Michael Burgess behind the stumps. Essex six for one in the fifth over of the day. Only Glamorgan have lost a wicket in the first 15 mins of the day, Salter giving catching practise off Toby Roland-Jones. Stream alert - you can now watch Shaheen Shah Afridi bowling to Marnus Labuschagne: 1980s quality county cricket. 🧢 | SHAHEEN RECEIVES MIDDLESEX CAP A special moment for @iShaheenAfridi this morning as Club legend @tjmurtagh presents him with his Middlesex cap ahead of his debut against @GlamCricket ! Go well, Shaheen. #OneMiddlesex pic.twitter.com/9oxU46yukq For light relief, Hassan Ali starts off at the Statham end. There’s no messing about, straight to work, bustling and busy, wind ruffling his shirt. Morning Tanya, morning everyone. [ Hello Simon in south London!]. The bell has just rung out at The Oval, where the one big change I’ve spotted since last season involves the living wall outside the Vauxhall End/JM Finn Stand. Installed in 2005 amid some fanfair , by last year there were some unsightly dead sections and since then it seems drastic action has been taken, with the real plants having been replaced with plastic ones. I’m sure there’s a metaphor in there somewhere. At the James Anderson end , Jimmy has the ball, stretches, tosses the ball from hand to hand. And bowls a wide. Old Trafford is looking a treat. Gloucestershire won the toss and will bat. Which is endearingly bold. And editor Lawrence Booth gets stuck into the ECB with knife, spoon and pitchfork: Wisden 2022 is out today. So many juicy nuggets but the pillars for starters: the Five Cricketers of the Year are J asprit Bumrah, Devon Conway, Ollie Robinson, Rohit Sharma and Dane van Niekerk . Joe Root is the leading men’s cricketer in the world for 2021, Lizelle Lee the leading women’s cricketer, Mohammad Rizwan the world’s leading T20 cricketer. DIVISION ONE Old Trafford: Lancashire v Gloucestershire Canterbury: Kent v Hampshire The County Ground: Northamptonshire v Yorkshire The Oval: Surrey v Somerset Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Essex DIVISION TWO The Riverside: Durham v Notts Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan v Middlesex Grace Road: Leicestershire v Derbyshire New Road: Worcestershire v Sussex Good morning! It’s round three of the Championship, the blossom is billowing and the swallows arriving. All counties are playing in this round. I’m heading to Old Trafford shortly, where Gloucestershire are visiting; Simon Burnton is keeping an eye on things at The Oval between Surrey and an almost revitalised Somerset and Ali Martin is scooting along to Edgbaston for the big hitter: Warwicks v Essex. Lots to look out for at Old Trafford where Ali reported that Saqib Mahmood may be playing his last season for Lancs. That old timer Jimmy Anderson also turns out today, but still no Stuart Broad (Notts), Ollie Robinson (Sussex) or Chris Woakes (Warwicks) At Canterbury, Ben Compton prepares to try out his new-found batting superpowers against Hampshire. In Division Two, young blades Sussex travel to New Road, fresh from batting out a draw; Durham take on Notts in the north east; there’s a midlands derby at The County Ground and Middlesex face Marnus Labushchagne’s dibbly-dobblies at Sophia Gardens.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aaafb2376d9c17011a37319680df5825d5671f6/16_144_3997_2399/master/3997.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce13512ad91dc76c9930c5ecfeb3078e","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, MI vs CSK LIVE Updates: IPL Live: Hrithik Shokeen, Tilak Varma Rebuild After Early Jolts From Mukesh Choudhary - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9saXZlLWlwbC1zY29yZS1taS12cy1jc2stbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3JlLW11bWJhaS1pbmRpYW5zLXZzLWNoZW5haS1zdXBlci1raW5ncy1saXZlLXNjb3JlYm9hcmQtYW5kLXVwZGF0ZXMtMjkwNzcyONIBmwFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9saXZlLWlwbC1zY29yZS1taS12cy1jc2stbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3JlLW11bWJhaS1pbmRpYW5zLXZzLWNoZW5haS1zdXBlci1raW5ncy1saXZlLXNjb3JlYm9hcmQtYW5kLXVwZGF0ZXMtMjkwNzcyOC9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, MI vs CSK LIVE Updates: IPL Live: Hrithik Shokeen, Tilak Varma Rebuild After Early Jolts From Mukesh Choudhary  NDTV SportsMumbai Indians v Chennai Super Kings - Match Preview | IPL El Clasico  Chennai Super KingsMatch Preview - Mumbai vs Super Kings, Indian Premier League 2022, 33rd Match  ESPNcricinfoHere’s How Rohit Sharma Performed Against CSK In The Last 5 Innings  The Cricket LoungeCricbuzz Live: Match 33, #MIvCSK, Pre-match show  CricbuzzView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-21 15:02:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mumbai Indians vs Chennai Super Kings: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/mumbai-indians-vs-chennai-super-kings-live-score-over-match-33-t20-6-10-updates-2908071","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Mumbai Indians vs Chennai Super Kings from Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy, Navi Mumbai.

Hrithik Shokeen guides it to third man for a single. 9.4 overs (1 Run) Back of a length, around off. A slower-paced delivery and Varma just pushes it behind square on the off side for a single. The fielder there was quick to collect the ball and had a shy at the stumps but misses. Single in the end, quite easily. 9.3 overs (1 Run) Another delivery on that tight line, on off. Hrithik Shokeen defends it with soft hands towards the off side for a single. 9.2 overs (0 Run) On a length, on off. Hrithik Shokeen walks down the track but defends it in the end. 9.1 overs (1 Run) Dwaine Pretorius starts with a fullish delivery, on off. Varma opens the face of his blade and steers it towards backward point for a single. DRINKS! Don't think we need to mention who is on top at the moment! Chennai are bossing the game, they have the big names back in the dug out and they would want to continue the good work. Mumbai on the other hand, need a partnership, they still have quite some batting left but they will hope the two out there can play for at least another 5 overs. Can they do so? Can they get their team to a position where they can think of getting to the 150-run mark? 8.6 overs (0 Run) This one turns sharply! Jadeja serves this, around off. On the line that makes Hrithik Shokeen push for it. However, he does well to take his bat out of the line at the last minute as the ball turns and beats him. 8.5 overs (1 Run) It is slightly short, around off.

He is off the mark on his debut. 7.4 overs (0 Run) A flatter delivery on off. Hrithik Shokeen blocks it out. Hrithik Shokeen is the next man in. 7.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Now, Suryakumar Yadav departs and this is a big, big wicket for Chennai! Santner goes fuller on off. It is fired in quicker and Yadav looks to sweep it. He does not get the middle of his blade and the ball goes straight into the hands of Mukesh Choudhary at deep backward square leg. The pacer takes an easy catch and four down are now Mumbai. Rohit Sharma in the dugout is gutted and so are all the Mumbai fans. 7.2 overs (0 Run) Slower in the air, on off. Yadav defends it off the front foot. He gets an outside half of his blade. 7.1 overs (1 Run) Quicker and around off. Varma gets a bit across and works it towards square leg for a single. Mitchell Santner is back on. He has bowled one over so far and has given away 8 runs. 6.6 overs (1 Run) On the shorter side, on middle. Varma pulls it to deep square leg for a single. 6.5 overs (0 Run) Jadeja changes his length and goes a bit short, on off. Varma looks to push it away but gets the inside edge onto his pads. 6.4 overs (0 Run) A fuller delivery on off. Varma blocks it out. 6.3 overs (1 Run) Darted on the pads again.

Varma works it to deep square leg for a single. 6.1 overs (1 Run) Starts off with a fuller delivery on the pads. Yadav flicks it to deep mid-wicket for a single. Ravindra Jadeja is on now! 5.6 overs (1 Run) A low full toss on middle. Yadav works it to long on for a single. Good over for Mumbai but overall an excellent Powerplay for Chennai. Mumbai are 42/3 after the Powerplay. 5.5 overs (1 Run) Goes flatter and quicker on middle. Varma looks to push it away but gets the inside edge onto his pads. The ball goes towards the off side and a single is taken. 5.4 overs (1 Run) A full toss on middle. Yadav drives it to long on for just a single. 5.3 overs (2 Runs) A flatter delivery on the pads. Yadav clips it wide of long on and comes back for the second run. 5.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Suryakumar Yadav is in his groove today! What a shot! This is full on off. Yadav gets low quickly and sweeps it over deep backward square leg for a maximum. 5.1 overs (0 Run) A low full toss from Maheesh Theekshana, on off. Yadav drives it to mid off.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637861688407569873.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stents, courage, runs accompany Pakistan's Abid Ali on comeback trail","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/stents-courage-runs-accompany-pakistans-abid-ali-on-comeback-trail/articleshow/90984977.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"His footwork and technique aside, two coronary stents and courage, and runs, accompanied Abid Ali as the Pakistan opener began his comeback trail in competitive cricket four months after suffering a heart attack.

On a length and around off, Varma pushes it to covers. 4.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Dropped! That should have been taken, that should have been Mukesh Choudhary's 4th! This is on a length and around off, moves away. Varma looks to push at it, this goes off the outside edge and into the hands of Bravo at widish first slip but he spills it. To add to that, it rolls away to the fence. 3.6 overs (1 Run) This lands on off and then turns back in.

Mukesh Choudhary come back over the wicket and goes back of a length and it is angled across Brevis, around off. He looks to make room and hit it towards the off side.

Jadeja has put down one he would take 9 times out of 10. He was probably worried about the man running in from long off. This is tossed up on off, Brevis looks to play the slog sweep but this holds in the surface and turns away a little. It goes off the top edge towards mid off. Jadeja runs after it from covers and the fielder at long off runs in. Jadeja calls for it but then spills it. It would have been an easier catch for Dwaine Pretorius but he bailed out as Jadeja called for it. Two taken in the end. End of another over full of events. 1.5 overs (0 Run) Well bowled!

A stumping chance? Yes. it is! A huge let off for Yadav! This is fuller, on the pads, Yadav looks to flick, this one dips right at the end, it sneaks under the bat but Dhoni fails to collect it. Yadav had dragged his back foot out by a long way. 1.1 overs (1 Run) Angled into the pads, this is worked through square leg for one. Spin to start from the other end. Mitchell Santner comes on to bowl. 0.6 over (4 Runs) FOUR! What a shot to begin with! A boundary and a beautiful one to get off the mark! This is full and on middle, Yadav shows the full face of the bat and creams it past mid on and this one races away to the fence. End of an action-packed first over. 0.5 over (0 Run) OUT! TIMBER! There is number two and both the openers fall for a duck! This is a ripper of a delivery and Mukesh Choudhary is on fire here! This is full, very full, it starts on middle and then swings away. Not sure what Kishan tried to do there. He probably was looking to flick, he is beaten all ends up, he is down on the ground and the off stump is uprooted. Mumbai in deep trouble in the first over itself. Suryakumar Yadav is the next man in. 0.5 over (1 Run) WIDE! A loud, loud appeal but wide signaled! There was a noise and maybe it was off the pad. No review. Down the leg side, Kishan looks to flick but misses. It hits the pad and goes to Dhoni. A long chat between a few players but nothing done in the end. 0.4 over (1 Run) Goes for a yorker yet again, this one does tail back in but it is a full toss, this is driven to the right of mid on for one. 0.3 over (0 Run) On middle, defended. Dewald Brevis walks out at number 3. 0.2 over (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! That is a simple catch for Mitchell Santner who is making a comeback into the side. What a start for Chennai and Mukesh Choudhary! This guy is making a habit of taking big wickets, got Kohli earlier on in the tournament and now Rohit. This one seemed like it held in the surface! On middle, fuller, slightly fuller actually. Holds in the surface a touch. Rohit looks to flick but is a touch early in the stroke, he ends up chipping it to mid on where it is taken easily. 0.1 over (0 Run) Good start by Mukesh Choudhary! Starts off with a yorker, it comes back in from outside off, Rohit gets his bat down in time and jams it iout. We are moments away from the live action! Chennai players make their way out to the middle. Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan are the openers for Mumbai. Mukesh Choudhary to start with the ball for Chennai. Rohit Sharma is on strike. Here we go... There is an altogether different fan-base for this game, it is called El Clasico for a reason! Will it live up to the billing today. Both teams making changes and it will be interesting to see which of these players coming in make an impact. The new kid on the block, Hrithik Shokeen is one to watch out for! Mumbai (Playing XI) - Ishan Kishan (WK), Rohit Sharma (C), Dewald Brevis, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Kieron Pollard, Daniel Sams (In place of Fabian Allen), Riley Meredith (In place of Tymal Mills), Hrithik Shokeen (In place of Murugan Ashwin), Jasprit Bumrah, Jaydev Unadkat. Chennai (Playing XI) - Ruturaj Gaikwad, Robin Uthappa, Ambati Rayudu, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja (C), MS Dhoni (WK), Dwaine Pretorius (In place of Chris Jordan), Mitchell Santner,(In place of Moeen Ali) Dwayne Bravo, Maheesh Theekshana, Mukesh Choudhary. Rohit Sharma, the skipper of Mumbai, says that the surfaces have changed quite a lot from the last games but the team batting first have won and losing the toss maybe a blessing in disguise. Informs they have three changes, Riley Meredith comes in, Sams too and Hrithik Shokeen is making his debut and they want to maintain the balance of the side. Adds there is a bit of bounce and Riley Meredith can bowl quick and it will be interesting to see what they can do and the offie comes in as there are few left handers in the opposition. Ends by saying they need to win all games but they are taking one game at a time and not looking way too ahead. Ravindra Jadeja, the skipper of Chennai, says the wicket looks damp and they want to take advantage. Mentions it might spin a little bit and they wanted to take advantage and dew could also play a factor. Informs they have two changes, Dwaine Pretorius and Santner come in for Moeen and Jordan. TOSS - The coin goes up and lands in favour of Chennai. They have elected to BOWL first. PITCH REPORT - Matthew Hayden is down for the pitch report. He says that the conditions are hot and humid. Tells that they are playing at the centre of the venue. Adds that the last time this pitch was used when Punjab went against Bangalore, so expect lot of runs. Mentions that the pitch is little dry and it is nice and hard. Adds that the big question is whether the captain that win the toss bat first or not? He reckons that it will suit Chennai to bat first and it will bring their spinners in the game. Riley Meredith is seen getting his cap in the Mumbai huddle, so expect at least one change in the Mumbai lineup today. The big man from the Caribbean, the Mumbai all-rounder Kieron Pollard has decided to call time on his international career. He has been a tremendous servant of West Indies cricket and also for the team, he is representing today. Will we see Pollard unleashing his power today? Let's find out. Mumbai, on the other hand, are going through an even worst start as they have lost all their six games so far. Like Chennai, Mumbai's problem has been their bowling attack and apart from Bumrah, other bowlers have failed to make any impact. The batting looks strong but they need their skipper, Rohit Sharma to fire and we might just see him unleash his might today. Can Mumbai finally get their first points on the board? Or will Chennai bag their second win? We shall find out. Toss and team sheets in a while. The defending champions, Chennai came with a new skipper, Ravindra Jadeja this year in a bid to create the same magic of the last season but have unfortunately won only one out of the six games so far. Their batting has put up a decent show with Robin Uthappa and Shivam Dube playing some handy knocks but the bowling department has failed to step up. Maheesh Theekshana is doing his job quite well from the last few games but Chennai need an all-round effort to get those two crucial points on the board. It's El Clasico time, folks! Yes, Mumbai will be going head-to-head against Chennai in this game number 33 of the 15th edition of the Indian T20 League. It has been a season to forget so far for both these champion teams and let's hope the fierce rivalry and the urgency to get points on the board, brings out the best of both these teams. ...

Chennai Super Kings have struggled a lot in IPL 2022, where they have managed to win just one of their six games in the tournament so far. The CSK side suffered yet another injury blow in their campaign. Deepak Chahar has already been ruled out of the season due to a back injury and he has now been followed by the Kiwi pacer Adam Milne. Adam Milne is out of the IPL 2022 season due to a hamstring injury. Milne suffered the injury in the first game of the tournament against Kolkata Knight Riders. Chennai Super Kings have signed young Sri Lankan bowler Matheesha Pathirana as the replacement of Adam Milne for the ongoing IPL season. Matheesha Pathirana bowling speed Matheesha Pathirana is a young Sri Lankan bowler, who has represented Sri Lanka in two U-19 World Cups (2020 and 2022). In the 2022 U-19 World Cup, Pathirana scalped seven wickets in four games at an economy of 6.16. However, in the 2020 U-19 World Cup, Matheesha Pathirana surprised everyone with his bowling speed. Welcome Matheesha Pathirana, the Young pace into the SuperFam#Yellove #WhistlePodu pic.twitter.com/C7FURylQeS — Chennai Super Kings (@ChennaiIPL) April 21, 2022 In the game against India in the 2020 U-19 World Cup, Matheesha Pathirana shocked everyone when the speed clock recorded his delivery at 175 km/h. This is the fastest ball in the history of international cricket in any age group. Although, it was later revealed that there was some technical issue, and it was not a 175 km/h ball. Matheesha Pathirana has a slingling action and his action looks similar to that of Sri Lankan legend Lasith Malinga. Pathirana is also efficient at bowling yorkers and he has been on Chennai Super Kings’ radar for a long. Ahead of the IPL 2021 season, Pathirana was signed as a reserve player by the CSK. The price of Matheesha Pathirana is said to be INR 20 lacs. Pathirana has just played one List A game and two T20 games at the senior level.

Sometimes a single run could be the difference between winning and losing, triumph and defeat. Bowlers practice for hours just to get their lines and lengths right, but modern batters are almost always on the move - always looking to create space to play innovative shots to beat the fielders. Shuffling across the stumps and moving laterally across the crease to disturb the concentration and momentum of the bowler in search of quick runs, has become extremely commonplace in modern day limited overs cricket, especially in T20s. Trying to counter this and in anticipation of sudden movement by the batters, bowlers try to bowl different lines and length. They are successful sometimes and sometimes they err and the ball goes for a wide with the opposition team getting an extra run and with the bowler having to re-bowl the delivery. A wide yorker for example is a variation that bowlers these days have developed to try and stop the batters from trying to hit every possible delivery for a boundary. Read more about wide yorkers here: Read Also Explained: The wide yorker and its growing popularity in T20 cricket Taking the pitch out of the equation, a fast searing yorker is bowled at the base of the batter's boots and by the time he moves his legs to save them and before the bat comes into play, the ball, on many occasions would have already crashed into the stumps. Many batters have been injured also when Often these wide yorkers are just too wide or the umpires feel that despite the batter having shuffled too much towards his or her off stump before the delivery was bowled, the delivery could be judged as a wide if it goes over the tramline markers. So what exactly is a wide delivery? The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) laws state the following: Law 22.11: If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if, according to the definition in 22.1.2, the ball passes wide of where the striker is standing and which also would have passed wide of the striker standing in a normal guard position. Law 22.1.2 states: The ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently within reach for him/her to be able to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke. Law 22.4.1 further states: The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving, either causes the ball to pass wide of him/her, as defined in 22.1.2 or brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by means of a normal cricket stroke. THE STOINIS CONTROVERSY In the recent IPL match between the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Lucknow Super Giants in Navi Mumbai on Tuesday, Marcus Stoinis fell to his Australia teammate Josh Hazlewood in the penultimate over after he shuffled way too much outside his off stump and was almost on the tramline. He got a thick inside edge onto his stumps and was dismissed for 24, at a time when LSG needed 34 runs off 11 balls. Stonis's movement was an act that was prompted by the previous Hazlewood delivery that landed almost outside the pitch. What happened in that delivery was that Stoinis shuffled across his off stump early, which forced Hazlewood to go wider and it was beyond the tramline comfortably. But the umpire felt that it was a hittable delivery and deemed it legal and Stoinis was left fuming. The Aussie of course was even angrier after he was dismissed off the next ball. (BCCI/IPL Photo) RCB went on to win the match by 18 runs. Was this a blunder by the umpire or was Stonis in a position where he could have struck the ball? Former Indian opener and captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth thought it was a huge gaffe. What is happening with the umpiring @IPL , it's quite pathetic and small bad decisions lead to big outcomes! Wake u… https://t.co/SrpVTO4oXS — Kris Srikkanth (@KrisSrikkanth) 1650391012000 Stoinis was batting well on 24 and who knows had the big hitter stayed at the crease, he could have potentially taken LSG to victory. Come October this year and the new MCC rules will kick in and one of them talks about how umpires will have to tweak their reading and subsequent judging of wide deliveries. THE NEW MCC RULES FOR WIDE DELIVERIES - APPLICABLE FROM OCTOBER 1, 2022 As part of nine sweeping changes to the rules, the custodians of cricket laws, the MCC, as part of its amendments to its 2022 code announced the following as far as umpires judging wide deliveries is concerned: The rule: (As per MCC): Law 22.1 - Judging a Wide: In the modern game, batters are, more than ever, moving laterally around the crease before the ball is bowled. It was felt unfair that a delivery might be called 'Wide' if it passes where the batter had stood as the bowler entered his/her delivery stride. Therefore, Law 22.1 has been amended so that a Wide will apply to where the batter is standing, where the striker has stood at any point since the bowler began their run up, and which would also have passed wide of the striker in a normal batting position. What it means: To score quick runs, batsmen, especially in the shorter formats, regularly change their positions and stance to disturb the rhythm of the bowler. Often batsmen are seen shifting sideways in their crease quite a bit just before a ball is bowled. Earlier despite the sudden change in stance or position where the batter was, wide deliveries were judged on the basis of where the batter ended up. Now, umpires will take into account where the batter is standing vis-à-vis where the batter has stood in his or her crease at any point after the bowler began his or her run-up. It will be interesting to see if this also changes the way umpires call wides when batters attempt reverse scoops, reverse sweeps, reverse pulls etc by changing their stance at the last minute.","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-England&#039;s Root named Wisden&#039;s &#039;Leading Cricketer&#039;","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/04/21/cricket-england039s-root-named-wisden039s-039leading-cricketer039","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - England's Joe Root has been named the 'Leading Cricketer in the World' in the latest edition of the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack after scoring 1,708 test runs in 2021.

RCB had a huge hole in their middle-order when De Villiers announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. However, Dinesh Karthik has proved to be an ideal replacement in the role of a finisher so far. In just seven games, the 36-year-old has scored 210 runs at a mind-boggling average of 210 and a fantastic strike rate of 205.88. Speaking on the YouTube channel 'VUSport Streaming', here's what AB de Villiers had to say about Dinesh Karthik's unreal form: Ab de Villiers also feels that if Karthik is able to maintain his consistency, RCB could once again be able to go deep into the tournament. He added: As much as AB de Villiers was impressed with the way Dinesh Karthik was batting, he didn't expect it at first. This was due to the small amount of cricket that the 36-year-old had played coming into the tournament. As Dinesh Karthik made his commentary debut, Ab de Villiers felt that was probably the beginning of the end of the 36-year-old's cricketing career. However, the 38-year-old was presently surprised with the way Karthik made a statement with his incredible form. On this, De Villiers stated: It looks like RCB have given Karthik a clear role in the team which is bringing the best out of him. If he manages to sustain this form throughout the season, the 36-year-old could well be back in the reckoning for India 's T20 World Cup squad.","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/04/5cdc4-16505227548272-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pollard vs CSK stats in IPL history: Kieron Pollard vs Ravindra Jadeja head to head stats and record in IPL","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-pollard-vs-csk-stats-in-ipl-history-kieron-pollard-vs-ravindra-jadeja-head-to-head-stats-and-record-in-ipl/","keywords":["Cricket","CSK","IPL 2022","Mumbai Indians","chennai super kings","csk","Indian Premier League","Kieron Pollard","MI","Ravindra Jadeja"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pollard vs CSK stats: The vice-captain of Mumbai Indians has done quite well against Chennai Super Kings over the years.

Historically, the 34-year old player has done quite well against this opposition in the IPL. Pollard, who has faced Super Kings in each season they’ve played since his debut in 2010, has scored 622 runs in 24 innings (including two Champions League Twenty20 innings) against them at an average and strike rate of 36.59 and 169.95 respectively. Having scored four half-centuries, Pollard’s career-best knock against Chennai had come in Delhi as recent as a year ago. In what became the second-highest run-chase in the history of the IPL, Pollard had scored a match-winning 87* (34) with the help of six fours and eight sixes to seal an intriguing last-ball 219-run chase. A handy contributor with the ball in hand, Pollard’s 15 wickets in 17 innings against this opposition have come at an average of 27, an economy rate of 8.59 and a strike rate of 18.87. A brilliant fielder, Pollard has grabbed 15 catches in 28 matches against CSK. Kieron Pollard vs Ravindra Jadeja head to head stats in IPL Quite likely of facing CSK captain Ravindra Jadeja in the middle overs, Pollard would be banking on his outstanding past record against Jadeja’s left-arm spin. In the IPL, Pollard has scored 114 (51) against Jadeja across 11 innings. Pollard, who has hit six fours and 11 sixes over the years, bats at a strike rate of 223.52 against Jadeja.

In the same year, the pacer was roped in by Rajasthan Royals (RR) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 Player Auction and went on to pick nine wickets in his debut season. In the mega auction this year, he was picked by SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) for Rs 4 crore and recently credited Suresh Raina for backing his talent. Speaking via SunRisers Hyderabad's Instagram handle, he said, \"Like I always say one thing, that after Under-16, Suresh Raina entered my life like a god because people started to recognise me when I was selected for Ranji Trophy. When I was 13, I participated in the Under-14 trials and this is where my cricketing journey began. I started playing for the Under-14 team and then Under-16. In the U-16, there was a season where I got 50 wickets in 7 matches. That is where the selectors started noticing that there is a player who has been taking a lot of wickets at the State level.\" \"Despite taking plenty of wickets, we reached the finals but lost. It was there that Gyanendra Pandey sir spotted me and he said that he was impressed by my performances and he will promote me going forward\". \"From there I reached the State Ranji Trophy camp. When I arrived, I was just a 16-year-old youngster while the others were established players. Then there was an incident where Suresh Raina had also come\", he further revealed. \"I used to be very silent and was observing everything. He was about to leave after his practice, but I don't know why he came back to the ground. He then approached me and asked me about what was my role. I told him that I was a bowler and then he gave me a chance to bowl in the nets. He saw my performance and told me that I liked your bowling and I will ensure you get chances in the future. Personally, for me, it was a good thing that someone like Suresh Raina noticed my performance.\" \"I was a little shocked that such a big player has complimented me and for a moment, I thought that he was joking. When he said that I was doing well, I still couldn't believe that I will get a chance to play in the coming days.\" Promoted After that, it was quite shocking for me that my name was shortlisted in the UP Ranji team. My Ranji career started from there and later I progressed to the Under-19 team and eventually played the Under-19 World Cup\". The young pacer hasn't yet player a game for SRH this season but will be hoping to impress when given the chance. SRH are currently fifth in the IPL 2022 points table with eight points from six games.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-02/ma6q1csg_suresh-raina-bcciipl_650x400_15_February_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies Kieron Pollard retires from international cricket","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports-news/west-indies-kieron-pollard-retires-from-international-cricket-588419","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"West Indies all-rounder and limited-overs captain Kieron Pollard on Wednesday announced his retirement from international cricket.
