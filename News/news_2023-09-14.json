The Test captain was England‚Äôs key man in 2019 and looks ready to reprise the role in India next month after blowing the one-day cobwebs away with a match-winning 124-ball innings that fired the hosts to 368. New Zealand never got close, rounded up for 187 as the hosts closed out a 181-run thrashing to go 2-1 up with one game to play. The Black Caps managed just five more runs between them than Stokes thrashed on his own. Jason Roy, the man who held the England record for more than five years since his 180 against Australia in Melbourne, was watching from the balcony as Stokes nudged him out of the history books. The moment came in typically emphatic fashion, Stokes clobbering Ben Lister high over long-on, with Roy joining the crowd‚Äôs ovation with a smile on his face. Roy had been pencilled in to make his comeback in the match but another bout of back spasms in the morning meant he was once again confined to the sidelines. With Harry Brook still angling to break into the 15-man World Cup squad, the timing could hardly be worse for an unpredictable niggle to emerge. If there was one down side to Stokes‚Äô first limited-overs century in six years it was the now familiar sight of him grimacing in pain as his chronic knee problems continued to hinder his movements. Stokes has taken a calculated gamble that he can manage the condition in the weeks ahead but, even after a six-week post-Ashes lay-off, it was apparent that will not be an easy job. Dawid Malan had a better time of it than Roy, scrubbing any lingering question marks next to his name with an accomplished 96 at opener. He shared a stand of 199 with Stokes after the pair were brought together in the third over at 13 for two and would have been good value for a century of his own. His innings was less muscular than Stokes and he could not keep up with his partner‚Äôs furious strike-rate of 146.77 but Malan was a calm, authoritative presence at the top order despite dashing back from the birth of his second child to reclaim his spot. England are lucky to have him and any accommodation for Brook would surely have to come at somebody else‚Äôs expense. 1‚É£8‚É£2‚É£ reasons to catch up on that simply incredible innings üò± We put 3‚É£6‚É£8‚É£ on the board üèèüí• See the best of the action here üëá ‚Äî England Cricket (@englandcricket) The Yorkshireman was only edged out of the team in the first place by Stokes‚Äô change of heart and the value of having him around was proved over and over again as he imposed himself on a side who will provide England‚Äôs first World Cup opponents in Ahmedabad. Stokes‚Äô timing was not perfect during his first 50 runs, throwing himself into powerful shots that relied more on will-power and brute force than touch and technique. But he warmed to his task, taking just 32 balls to convert his half-century and 30 more to go from 100 to 150. His adaptability was on show throughout, with Lockie Ferguson cranking it up to 94mph at one stage only to be despatched repeatedly to the ropes as he strove for speed. At one stage he nonchalantly stepped inside the line of a short ball and helped it over his right shoulder for a one-bounce four. When New Zealand took pace off, it got even uglier as Stokes hit Rachin Ravindra out of the attack with three sixes in two chastening overs. Once Malan was strangled down leg off a Trent Boult delivery so wayward it was initially called as a wide, New Zealand picked up wickets with enough regularity to bowl England out with 11 balls unused. Boult, who began by dismissing Jonny Bairstow off the first ball of the match and had Joe Root playing on in his next over, finished in credit at five for 51 amid some messy figures. Stokes finally departed in the 45th over, mis-hitting a low full toss from Lister two balls after beating Roy‚Äôs record. The Kiwi chase never got off the ground, an excellent new ball spell from Chris Woakes reducing them to 37 for four. He took care of Will Young, Henry Nicholls and Daryl Mitchell to suck the heat out of the contest. The ground began to empty despite the best efforts of Glenn Phillips (72), with Liam Livingstone helping himself to three cheap wickets at the close.","pubDate":"2023-09-13 19:25:21","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17224846/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"ae75c854a5ece4f31fe595b3f5ac36aa","title":"Shoaib Akhtar Hits Back at Fans Accusing India of Fixing Game Against Sri Lanka in Asia Cup 2023 Super Four","link":"https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/sports-news-pakistan-pacer-shoaib-akhtar-hits-back-at-fans-who-accused-india-of-fixing-game-against-sri-lanka-5410657.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shoaib stated that many fans called him after the match that India had 'fixed the game' and were trying to lose the match deliberately.

Shoaib stated that many fans called him after the match that India had 'fixed the game' and were trying to lose the match deliberately. However, Akhtar hit back at the fans and said on his youtube channel, \"I don't know what you guys are doing. I am getting memes and messages saying 'India have fixed the game', that they are losing deliberately in order to eliminate Pakistan. Are you alright? They (Sri Lanka) are bowling their heart out. Wellalalge and Asalanka bowled their heart out. You saw that 20-year-old kid? He scored 43 runs and took 5 wickets. I am getting phonecalls from India and other countries, saying India were losing deliberately.\" Akhtar further went on to point out why India would have deliberately wanted to lose the game when a chance to seal a spot for the Asia Cup final was right in their hands. \"Why would they lose, tell me? They want to go through to the final. You end up making memes without any reason. It was a great fightback from India. The way Kuldeep played, it was massive. Look at Jasprit Bumrah, look at the fight while defending a small total,\" Akhtar added. Coming to the much debated match, India's bowling attack combined to end Sri Lanka's 13 ODI match unbeaten streak and seal their spot in the final of the Asia Cup 2023 with a game to spare, as the hosts were bundled out for 172 chasing a paltry target at the R Premadasa Stadium.

With two wins in two days, against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Butt feels India have made their intentions clear ahead of this year's World Cup. So far, the Indian batters have delivered the goods, while the bowlers have made a strong statement. Jasprit Bumrah and KL Rahul 's return to action after injury has been huge positive for Rohit and his men. Rahul scored an unbeaten century against Pakistan on his return to the side, while Bumrah, despite picking just three wickets, has troubled the opposition batters, especially with the new ball. Butt feels Bumrah's comeback has been exceptional, and said that the pacer has \"looked on a different level\". He also praised spinner Kuldeep Yadav , who has picked nine wickets in two-matches, including a five-wicket haul against Pakistan. \"Jasprit Bumrah right now looks on a different level. Siraj has bowl well. Kuldeep is a special bowler. It is not easy check him, whether he'll bowl a googly or his leg-spin. Most batters struggle to pick him up. Sometimes they are late on his bowling, that's why it is not easy to hit him in the gap,\" Butt said on his YouTube channel. \"So, a lot of positives for India so far in the Asia Cup. Batters have done their job. Injured players are back to full fitness. The top four has scored runs. Pandya has been bowling well, looks fitter. The world has witnessed Bumrah's exceptional comeback.

Iyer, who has come back after a long lay-off and a back surgery to cure his stress fracture, played against Pakistan and Nepal in the group league stage before pulling out of the match against the arch-rivals at the eleventh hour, complaining back spasms. A clearer picture will emerge on Thursday during the optional training ahead of the Bangladesh game. Those in the know of the things said that there seems to be \"some amount of stiffness\", which will definitely impact his movements during fielding but they are hopeful that it won't turn out to be very serious. The Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee is expected to name the squad for the Australia series sometime during the ongoing week. It could be on the day of the Bangladesh game or prior to the Asia Cup final on Sunday. While the preliminary World Cup squad has been named, the Indian team management will be worried about Iyer's fitness and if he misses the Australia series, he would be really short of match practice with only two warm-up games left before the first match against Australia in Chennai on October 8. KL Rahul has put an end to all fitness worries with his 100 and 39 in the two Super 4 games and even though he still looked a tad rusty initially while keeping to Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja, he did regain a lot of confidence after gathering a few. Ishan Kishan is now a designated outfielder and it is there to be seen whether Iyer, if fit, replaces Kishan in the final Super 4 game against Bangladesh. Kishan, despite a great run in recent ODIs, did seem to struggle on slow tracks but to be fair to him, none of the batters save skipper Rohit Sharma and to some extent Rahul, looked comfortable against left-arm spin of Dunith Wellalage. Travelling reserve Sanju Samson has returned home and Tilak Verma is supposed to join the Asian Games camp after the end of this tournament. Possibly Tilak being a left-hander could pip a more experienced Sanju in worst possible case where he is unable to recover in time. However with two weeks (September 27) left to announce final squad, every stakeholder in Indian cricket will keep its fingers crossed.

In the third innings of the match, Sussex made 344 for 9 and declared and set a huge total for Leicestershire. Leicestershire nearly pulled off the chase but Unadkat's sensational spell made sure Sussex notched up their second County Championship win of the season.

The Test captain was England‚Äôs key man in 2019 and looks ready to reprise the role in India next month after blowing the one-day cobwebs away with a match-winning 124-ball innings that fired the hosts to 368. New Zealand never got close, rounded up for 187 as the hosts closed out a 181-run thrashing to go 2-1 up with one game to play. The Black Caps managed just five more runs between them than Stokes thrashed on his own. Jason Roy, the man who held the England record for more than five years since his 180 against Australia in Melbourne, was watching from the balcony as Stokes nudged him out of the history books. The moment came in typically emphatic fashion, Stokes clobbering Ben Lister high over long-on, with Roy joining the crowd‚Äôs ovation with a smile on his face. Roy had been pencilled in to make his comeback in the match but another bout of back spasms in the morning meant he was once again confined to the sidelines. With Harry Brook still angling to break into the 15-man World Cup squad, the timing could hardly be worse for an unpredictable niggle to emerge. If there was one down side to Stokes‚Äô first limited-overs century in six years it was the now familiar sight of him grimacing in pain as his chronic knee problems continued to hinder his movements. Stokes has taken a calculated gamble that he can manage the condition in the weeks ahead but, even after a six-week post-Ashes lay-off, it was apparent that will not be an easy job. Dawid Malan had a better time of it than Roy, scrubbing any lingering question marks next to his name with an accomplished 96 at opener. He shared a stand of 199 with Stokes after the pair were brought together in the third over at 13 for two and would have been good value for a century of his own. His innings was less muscular than Stokes and he could not keep up with his partner‚Äôs furious strike-rate of 146.77 but Malan was a calm, authoritative presence at the top order despite dashing back from the birth of his second child to reclaim his spot. England are lucky to have him and any accommodation for Brook would surely have to come at somebody else‚Äôs expense. 1‚É£8‚É£2‚É£ reasons to catch up on that simply incredible innings üò± We put 3‚É£6‚É£8‚É£ on the board üèèüí• See the best of the action here üëá ‚Äî England Cricket (@englandcricket) The Yorkshireman was only edged out of the team in the first place by Stokes‚Äô change of heart and the value of having him around was proved over and over again as he imposed himself on a side who will provide England‚Äôs first World Cup opponents in Ahmedabad. Stokes‚Äô timing was not perfect during his first 50 runs, throwing himself into powerful shots that relied more on will-power and brute force than touch and technique. But he warmed to his task, taking just 32 balls to convert his half-century and 30 more to go from 100 to 150. His adaptability was on show throughout, with Lockie Ferguson cranking it up to 94mph at one stage only to be despatched repeatedly to the ropes as he strove for speed. At one stage he nonchalantly stepped inside the line of a short ball and helped it over his right shoulder for a one-bounce four. When New Zealand took pace off, it got even uglier as Stokes hit Rachin Ravindra out of the attack with three sixes in two chastening overs. Once Malan was strangled down leg off a Trent Boult delivery so wayward it was initially called as a wide, New Zealand picked up wickets with enough regularity to bowl England out with 11 balls unused. Boult, who began by dismissing Jonny Bairstow off the first ball of the match and had Joe Root playing on in his next over, finished in credit at five for 51 amid some messy figures. Stokes finally departed in the 45th over, mis-hitting a low full toss from Lister two balls after beating Roy‚Äôs record. The Kiwi chase never got off the ground, an excellent new ball spell from Chris Woakes reducing them to 37 for four. He took care of Will Young, Henry Nicholls and Daryl Mitchell to suck the heat out of the contest. The ground began to empty despite the best efforts of Glenn Phillips (72), with Liam Livingstone helping himself to three cheap wickets at the close.","pubDate":"2023-09-13 19:25:21","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17224846/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"ae75c854a5ece4f31fe595b3f5ac36aa","title":"Shoaib Akhtar Hits Back at Fans Accusing India of Fixing Game Against Sri Lanka in Asia Cup 2023 Super Four","link":"https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/sports-news-pakistan-pacer-shoaib-akhtar-hits-back-at-fans-who-accused-india-of-fixing-game-against-sri-lanka-5410657.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shoaib stated that many fans called him after the match that India had 'fixed the game' and were trying to lose the match deliberately.

They want to go through to the final. You end up making memes without any reason. It was a great fightback from India. The way Kuldeep played, it was massive.

With two wins in two days, against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Butt feels India have made their intentions clear ahead of this year's World Cup. So far, the Indian batters have delivered the goods, while the bowlers have made a strong statement. Jasprit Bumrah and KL Rahul 's return to action after injury has been huge positive for Rohit and his men. Rahul scored an unbeaten century against Pakistan on his return to the side, while Bumrah, despite picking just three wickets, has troubled the opposition batters, especially with the new ball. Butt feels Bumrah's comeback has been exceptional, and said that the pacer has \"looked on a different level\". He also praised spinner Kuldeep Yadav , who has picked nine wickets in two-matches, including a five-wicket haul against Pakistan. \"Jasprit Bumrah right now looks on a different level. Siraj has bowl well. Kuldeep is a special bowler. It is not easy check him, whether he'll bowl a googly or his leg-spin. Most batters struggle to pick him up. Sometimes they are late on his bowling, that's why it is not easy to hit him in the gap,\" Butt said on his YouTube channel. \"So, a lot of positives for India so far in the Asia Cup. Batters have done their job. Injured players are back to full fitness. The top four has scored runs. Pandya has been bowling well, looks fitter. The world has witnessed Bumrah's exceptional comeback.

Iyer, who has come back after a long lay-off and a back surgery to cure his stress fracture, played against Pakistan and Nepal in the group league stage before pulling out of the match against the arch-rivals at the eleventh hour, complaining back spasms. A clearer picture will emerge on Thursday during the optional training ahead of the Bangladesh game. Those in the know of the things said that there seems to be \"some amount of stiffness\", which will definitely impact his movements during fielding but they are hopeful that it won't turn out to be very serious. The Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee is expected to name the squad for the Australia series sometime during the ongoing week. It could be on the day of the Bangladesh game or prior to the Asia Cup final on Sunday. While the preliminary World Cup squad has been named, the Indian team management will be worried about Iyer's fitness and if he misses the Australia series, he would be really short of match practice with only two warm-up games left before the first match against Australia in Chennai on October 8. KL Rahul has put an end to all fitness worries with his 100 and 39 in the two Super 4 games and even though he still looked a tad rusty initially while keeping to Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja, he did regain a lot of confidence after gathering a few. Ishan Kishan is now a designated outfielder and it is there to be seen whether Iyer, if fit, replaces Kishan in the final Super 4 game against Bangladesh. Kishan, despite a great run in recent ODIs, did seem to struggle on slow tracks but to be fair to him, none of the batters save skipper Rohit Sharma and to some extent Rahul, looked comfortable against left-arm spin of Dunith Wellalage. Travelling reserve Sanju Samson has returned home and Tilak Verma is supposed to join the Asian Games camp after the end of this tournament. Possibly Tilak being a left-hander could pip a more experienced Sanju in worst possible case where he is unable to recover in time. However with two weeks (September 27) left to announce final squad, every stakeholder in Indian cricket will keep its fingers crossed.

Leicestershire were heading toward the 498-run target as Ben Cox and Tom Scriven stitched a 120-run stand for the 7th wicket. Leicestershire were 453 for 6 before Unadkat got the two set batters and cleaned up the tail as they were bowled out for 483. His last 4 wickets came in just 31 balls as the left-arm pacer from Saurashtra continued his love affair with the red ball. Unadkat had picked up 3 wickets in the first innings with the ball for Sussex in his second match for the County Championships. After completing the tour of the West Indies in July-August, Unadkat signed up to play for Cheteshwar Pujara-led side in the final stages of the county championship season. The winning moment! √∞¬ü¬é√Ø ‚Äî Sussex Cricket (@SussexCCC) A special shout out to , what a performance! √∞¬ü¬í√´ ‚Äî Sussex Cricket (@SussexCCC) Sussex scored 262 in the first innings with captain Pujara managing only 26. Judson Prentice top-scored for Sussex with 65. Leicestershire were shot out for just 108 as Unadkat and Ari Karvelas shared 7 wickets between them. In the third innings of the match, Sussex made 344 for 9 and declared and set a huge total for Leicestershire. Leicestershire nearly pulled off the chase but Unadkat's sensational spell made sure Sussex notched up their second County Championship win of the season. Unadkat made his County Championship debut against Durham on September 3 and managed just 1 wicket for Sussex at Chester-le-Street. Unadkat, who has played 4 Tests for India, took his first-class tally to 392 wickets in 105 matches.","pubDate":"2023-09-13 17:06:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8c36b0ce6590bd0571c52ad7f979dfa1","title":"Ben Stokes breaks England record in dominant ODI win over New Zealand","link":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/national/23788139.ben-stokes-breaks-england-record-dominant-odi-win-new-zealand/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Stokes bludgeoned 182 as England won the third ODI by 181 runs to take a 2-1 lead in the four-match series.","content":"Stokes, playing just his third 50-over match a year after walking away from the format, was in brutal form as he unloaded nine sixes and 15 fours on his way to the biggest score by an English batter. The Test captain was England‚Äôs key man in 2019 and looks ready to reprise the role in India next month after blowing the one-day cobwebs away with a match-winning 124-ball innings that fired the hosts to 368. New Zealand never got close, rounded up for 187 as the hosts closed out a 181-run thrashing to go 2-1 up with one game to play. The Black Caps managed just five more runs between them than Stokes thrashed on his own. Jason Roy, the man who held the England record for more than five years since his 180 against Australia in Melbourne, was watching from the balcony as Stokes nudged him out of the history books. The moment came in typically emphatic fashion, Stokes clobbering Ben Lister high over long-on, with Roy joining the crowd‚Äôs ovation with a smile on his face. Roy had been pencilled in to make his comeback in the match but another bout of back spasms in the morning meant he was once again confined to the sidelines. With Harry Brook still angling to break into the 15-man World Cup squad, the timing could hardly be worse for an unpredictable niggle to emerge. If there was one down side to Stokes‚Äô first limited-overs century in six years it was the now familiar sight of him grimacing in pain as his chronic knee problems continued to hinder his movements. Stokes has taken a calculated gamble that he can manage the condition in the weeks ahead but, even after a six-week post-Ashes lay-off, it was apparent that will not be an easy job. Dawid Malan had a better time of it than Roy, scrubbing any lingering question marks next to his name with an accomplished 96 at opener. He shared a stand of 199 with Stokes after the pair were brought together in the third over at 13 for two and would have been good value for a century of his own. His innings was less muscular than Stokes and he could not keep up with his partner‚Äôs furious strike-rate of 146.77 but Malan was a calm, authoritative presence at the top order despite dashing back from the birth of his second child to reclaim his spot. England are lucky to have him and any accommodation for Brook would surely have to come at somebody else‚Äôs expense. 1‚É£8‚É£2‚É£ reasons to catch up on that simply incredible innings üò± We put 3‚É£6‚É£8‚É£ on the board üèèüí• See the best of the action here üëá ‚Äî England Cricket (@englandcricket) The Yorkshireman was only edged out of the team in the first place by Stokes‚Äô change of heart and the value of having him around was proved over and over again as he imposed himself on a side who will provide England‚Äôs first World Cup opponents in Ahmedabad. Stokes‚Äô timing was not perfect during his first 50 runs, throwing himself into powerful shots that relied more on will-power and brute force than touch and technique. But he warmed to his task, taking just 32 balls to convert his half-century and 30 more to go from 100 to 150. His adaptability was on show throughout, with Lockie Ferguson cranking it up to 94mph at one stage only to be despatched repeatedly to the ropes as he strove for speed. At one stage he nonchalantly stepped inside the line of a short ball and helped it over his right shoulder for a one-bounce four. When New Zealand took pace off, it got even uglier as Stokes hit Rachin Ravindra out of the attack with three sixes in two chastening overs. Once Malan was strangled down leg off a Trent Boult delivery so wayward it was initially called as a wide, New Zealand picked up wickets with enough regularity to bowl England out with 11 balls unused. Boult, who began by dismissing Jonny Bairstow off the first ball of the match and had Joe Root playing on in his next over, finished in credit at five for 51 amid some messy figures. Stokes finally departed in the 45th over, mis-hitting a low full toss from Lister two balls after beating Roy‚Äôs record. The Kiwi chase never got off the ground, an excellent new ball spell from Chris Woakes reducing them to 37 for four. He took care of Will Young, Henry Nicholls and Daryl Mitchell to suck the heat out of the contest. The ground began to empty despite the best efforts of Glenn Phillips (72), with Liam Livingstone helping himself to three cheap wickets at the close.","pubDate":"2023-09-13 19:25:21","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17224846/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"ae75c854a5ece4f31fe595b3f5ac36aa","title":"Shoaib Akhtar Hits Back at Fans Accusing India of Fixing Game Against Sri Lanka in Asia Cup 2023 Super Four","link":"https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/sports-news-pakistan-pacer-shoaib-akhtar-hits-back-at-fans-who-accused-india-of-fixing-game-against-sri-lanka-5410657.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shoaib stated that many fans called him after the match that India had 'fixed the game' and were trying to lose the match deliberately.

They want to go through to the final. You end up making memes without any reason. It was a great fightback from India. The way Kuldeep played, it was massive.

So far, the Indian batters have delivered the goods, while the bowlers have made a strong statement. Jasprit Bumrah and KL Rahul 's return to action after injury has been huge positive for Rohit and his men. Rahul scored an unbeaten century against Pakistan on his return to the side, while Bumrah, despite picking just three wickets, has troubled the opposition batters, especially with the new ball. Butt feels Bumrah's comeback has been exceptional, and said that the pacer has \"looked on a different level\". He also praised spinner Kuldeep Yadav , who has picked nine wickets in two-matches, including a five-wicket haul against Pakistan. \"Jasprit Bumrah right now looks on a different level. Siraj has bowl well. Kuldeep is a special bowler. It is not easy check him, whether he'll bowl a googly or his leg-spin. Most batters struggle to pick him up.

Iyer, who has come back after a long lay-off and a back surgery to cure his stress fracture, played against Pakistan and Nepal in the group league stage before pulling out of the match against the arch-rivals at the eleventh hour, complaining back spasms. A clearer picture will emerge on Thursday during the optional training ahead of the Bangladesh game. Those in the know of the things said that there seems to be \"some amount of stiffness\", which will definitely impact his movements during fielding but they are hopeful that it won't turn out to be very serious. The Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee is expected to name the squad for the Australia series sometime during the ongoing week. It could be on the day of the Bangladesh game or prior to the Asia Cup final on Sunday. While the preliminary World Cup squad has been named, the Indian team management will be worried about Iyer's fitness and if he misses the Australia series, he would be really short of match practice with only two warm-up games left before the first match against Australia in Chennai on October 8. KL Rahul has put an end to all fitness worries with his 100 and 39 in the two Super 4 games and even though he still looked a tad rusty initially while keeping to Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja, he did regain a lot of confidence after gathering a few. Ishan Kishan is now a designated outfielder and it is there to be seen whether Iyer, if fit, replaces Kishan in the final Super 4 game against Bangladesh. Kishan, despite a great run in recent ODIs, did seem to struggle on slow tracks but to be fair to him, none of the batters save skipper Rohit Sharma and to some extent Rahul, looked comfortable against left-arm spin of Dunith Wellalage. Travelling reserve Sanju Samson has returned home and Tilak Verma is supposed to join the Asian Games camp after the end of this tournament. Possibly Tilak being a left-hander could pip a more experienced Sanju in worst possible case where he is unable to recover in time. However with two weeks (September 27) left to announce final squad, every stakeholder in Indian cricket will keep its fingers crossed.
