Such is the rate at which major tournaments are being announced, it is hard to stay up to date. This week not one but two major tournaments were confirmed, with rugby union’s governing body officially rubber stamping Australia as host of the 2027 men’s World Cup and 2029 women’s World Cup . These are just the latest additions to what is shaping up as a golden decade on the Australian sporting calendar. In August, Australian and American swimmers will face off in the “duel in the pool” in Sydney – the return of an event that saw its heyday in the 2000s. In September, Australia will host the UCI Road World Championships, with the world’s best cyclists racing on the scenic roads around Wollongong. At the same time, Sydney is set to host the basketball women’s World Cup. Soon after the men’s cricket T20 World Cup will begin, after a two-year pandemic-induced postponement. Show us the money, say women’s rugby stars with Australia to host World Cups Read more These three major events are just the beginning. The Fifa Women’s World Cup in mid-2023, co-hosted with New Zealand, will be the biggest international sporting event of the year. It will build on a hugely successful last edition in France in 2019 and cement the Matildas’ status as one of the country’s favourite national teams. Then comes the Commonwealth Games in 2026, spread across regional Victoria, the Netball World Cup in 2027 in Sydney, the two Rugby World Cups, and a host of other major events (including world championships for BMX and canoe slalom, and the British and Irish Lions Tour). No doubt more will be added. It all builds towards the main event: the 2032 Olympics and Paralympics, in Queensland, the third time in history that Australia has hosted the crown jewel on the global sporting calendar. In attracting these major tournaments, Australia has many natural advantages: a relatively wealthy, sports-loving population, high-quality infrastructure, commercial interest and plenty of government support. But it remains remarkable that so many high-profile events have been persuaded down under in such a short space of time, particularly given the disadvantages posted by our time zone (disliked by American broadcasters) and the parochial local sporting codes ( who are not keen on sharing stadia ). The decade ahead, then, will be unprecedented for Australia, a parade of the biggest sporting events on the planet. Let’s not waste it. Because despite appearances, not all is well in Australian sport. At a participation level, sport is expensive – and rapidly becoming out of reach for some families, particularly as the cost of living rises. Recent data from AusPlay, an arm of government agency Sport Australia, found that the average cost of participation sport in almost $1,000 per year. 20% of children surveyed who didn’t participate in sport identified the cost as the primary barrier. Earlier Sport Australia research found a major gulf in child sporting participation between low-income and high-income families. While the pandemic has interrupted many sporting seasons, making year-on-year comparison of participation data unreliable, a survey by the Australian Sports Foundation (ASF) found that 43% of polled sports club had seen a decrease in participation numbers, and a similar decline in volunteering. On average, Australians are less active, and more overweight, than we once were. Each year the federal government spends about a quarter of a billion dollars on elite sport . Depending on who you ask, this is either too much or not enough. While that perennial debate will never be settled – and Australia’s equal best-ever showing at the Olympics last year suggests the funding is being well-spent – structural change is needed. The funding model is transitioning from year-on-year to more sustainable, longer-term funding, but that remains a work in progress. At the grass roots level, money is a major problem, made worse by the Covid-19 interruptions. The ASF’s research found that that 9,000 sporting clubs across Australia were at risk of insolvency. The future of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), established in the early 1980s and the source of many medals over the decades, is unclear; with its facilities ageing, it requires a major funding boost, a relocation (a move to Queensland to coincide with 2032 has been mooted) or a new approach entirely. The crumbling infrastructure at the AIS’s leafy campus in Canberra is a poignant, if not entirely accurate, metaphor for the flagship program’s uncertain outlook. Australian sport also has much work to do on ensuring safe, supportive environments and diversity among participants, athletes and leadership. Allegations of mistreatment in sport, contemporary and historic, and at all levels, are sadly all too commonplace. It is hard to think of an Australian sport that has not been rocked by allegations of sexual harassment, sexism, racism or abuse in recent years. At a senior level, sporting codes remain dominated by men. Despite considerable improvement, money and media coverage in this country is still disproportionately directed at male sport. The golden decade of sport will present Australia with abundant opportunity, with heightened interest and the likelihood of a significant funding injection. If we seize the opportunity, Australian grass roots and high-performance sport can enter the 2030s in a better place. Equally, just as it is possible to blink and miss new hosting announcements right now, so too will the following decade pass quickly, and opportunities be missed, if sporting administrators fail to rise to the challenge. Done well, the sport ecosystem is tightly-integrated and self-sustained. Participation sport is a pipeline for elite sport; medal glory and school visits from Olympians inspire the next generation; money invested in sport ensures active lifestyles and minimises the need for health spending. The golden decade ahead can turbo-charge that ecosystem. But nothing in sport is inevitable.","pubDate":"2022-05-13 20:00:43","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ec4cd59804c12b4b5ce1131022e388e7bbbddb4/0_85_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0ee7a2cfbc33311afd71216b04e4f094","source_id":"theguardian","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“He’s the leader in the team”: Mayank Agarwal lauds Arshdeep Singh for taking responsibility at Punjab Kings in 2022 IPL","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-hes-the-leader-in-the-team-mayank-agarwal-lauds-arshdeep-singh-for-taking-responsibility-at-punjab-kings-in-2022-ipl/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Punjab Kings","RCB","Arshdeep Singh","Indian Premier League","Mayank Agarwal","PBKS","Royal Challengers Bangalore"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mayank Agarwal lauds Arshdeep Singh: The captain of Punjab Kings credits his pacer for taking the additional responsibility.

Punjab Kings captain Mayank Agarwal has credited England batters Jonny Bairstow and Liam Livingstone for their 54-run victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Brabourne Stadium tonight. Although they batted together for a 15-ball 16-run third-wicket partnership, Bairstow and Livingstone scored individual half-centuries in the first and second half of Punjab’s innings respectively. The pair scoring a combined total of 136 (71) at a strike rate of 191.54 was a vital reason behind the team scoring a match-winning 209/9 in 20 overs after being asked to bat first by RCB captain Faf du Plessis. “We were brilliant with the bat. Wicket was holding up a bit. The way Jonny [Bairstow] and Livi [Liam Livingstone] batted, was amazing. We haven’t changed a lot to be honest, just about understanding few situations, understanding the wicket,” Agarwal told Star Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony. With PBKS adding a couple of points under their belt, they have moved to the sixth position on the points table. Yet to play a couple of league matches this season, as many wins could witness Kings qualifying for the playoffs. Agarwal, who has sacrificed his preferred opening slot to accommodate Bairstow at the top, was unconcerned about his batting position. “If batsman get going, it doesn’t matter, the boundaries don’t matter these days. Two points the most crucial thing for us. As long as the job gets done, I’m fine batting at [Number] five,” Agarwal added. Other than Bairstow and Livingstone, Agarwal particularly credited fast bowler Arshdeep Singh for not only bowling well himself but also emerging as a “leader” within the team especially the bowling unit. Fighting spirit 💪 Top team effort tonight 👏👏 @PunjabKingsIPL pic.twitter.com/V8cScG7Z4V — Shikhar Dhawan (@SDhawan25) May 13, 2022 The only other player apart from Agarwal to get retained by Punjab ahead of IPL 2022 mega auction earlier this year, Arshdeep hasn’t picked a lot of wickets but his composure while bowling in the death overs remains unmatched among uncapped players. In 12 IPL 2022 matches, the left-arm pacer’s seven wickets have come at an economy rate of 7.69. ALSO READ: Arshdeep Singh credits Mayank Agarwal’s captaincy for his impressive death bowling in IPL 2022 “Very very energetic person, very confident guy. Enjoys his cricket. Must say he’s the leader in the team. He rallies around everyone, takes up the responsibility, even goes up and speaks to the bowlers sometimes,” Agarwal said of Arshdeep before concluding.","pubDate":"2022-05-13 19:36:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Spare a thought for fans of Norwich, Derby and Oldham in the flurry of end-of-season jubilation and relief","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/18562202/karren-brady-wigan-derby-oldham-fans/","keywords":["Championship","EFL","Football","Premier League","Exclusives"],"creator":["Jake Lambourne"],"video_url":null,"description":"AMID the end-of-season jubilation, disappointment and relief, there are clubs that fall in my gone-but-not-forgotten category.

First, players are being blamed generally for sins they did not know they had committed. Second, points earned on the field should stay on the field and, third, because blameless supporters are also being penalised. Derby suffered two heavy fines and were docked 21 points, a number that left not so much a mountain to climb as trying to clamber up it blindfold wearing carpet slippers. The quarter of a million citizens of Derby have a lot to be proud of — Rolls Royce factories, a cathedral, a county cricket club and it was the first place in England to have a public park, which inspired New York’s Central Park. Yet the love for Derby County FC ranges above these. Former owner Mel Morris tried his best and went close to ruining himself. But, instead of longed-for promotion to the Premier League, it’s off to League One. There are many matters to settle, not least the new ownership. And will Rooney stay or leave? England’s all-time top scorer’s appointment to the Pride Park job looked to be a gamble on a famous past rather than on the promise of a football thinker.

Shrunken back, sandblasted by confusing cultural forces, English cricket has entered a new managerial age, at least in its visible faces. Tom Harrison is still hanging in there. But around him there is at least the appearance of change. With the appointment of Rob Key as managing director and Brendon McCullum as Test coach, English cricket is no longer fronted up by blazers or wonks. It is instead being run by … guys. The future is here – and it’s wearing Stan Smiths and tweeting memes. Welcome to the rise of the Blokes. Keysey, Baz, Morgs, Stokesey. This is the new world order in English cricket. Informal, matey, dressed down, banterish. Dudes. Bros. Dudes with views. The Blokes are in the house, and they’ve junked the standard interview process. They know a guy. A really cool guy. And the clincher, the real key, is they’re not like those other people. That’s the big thing. Or at least that seems to be the spin. Perhaps the greatest achievement of the new order to date is convincing the world that this is something new. That, as Key has suggested, the Blokes are in some way outsiders, mavericks, an astringent alternative to the usual “choir boys” who fill leadership roles. In reality of course this is simply a different clique, wearing trainers not brogues, and presenting its lack of qualification and experience as an act of liberation, a tearing down of the barricades. England’s white-ball captain Eoin Morgan (right) is best friends with Brendon McCullum, whom he recommended to Rob Key for the role of Test coach. Photograph: Philip Brown/Reuters How did we get here anyway? Key didn’t actually apply for the job of managing director of English cricket. He was approached by his golf partner, Andrew Strauss. McCullum was approached in turn by Key, having been recommended by Eoin Morgan, who is one of McCullum’s best mates. McCullum has never coached a red-ball team. Key has never managed anything. Old thinking bro-skis! Key has also never overseen an interview process, but he knew enough to declare that McCullum had “smashed” his one by having vision, vibes, mad energy and the like. So it came to pass. The cool guys are staking the summer sport out as their own private fiefdom. And to be fair these blokes, with their skinny trousers, their cool shades, their everyman vibe, do represent a current version of sporting masculinity: the sensitive alpha guy, banterish and clubbable, but also tattoo-sleeved and gym buffed and, like, totally down with mental health and cool views, more aggressively inclusive than you, high on big no-dickheads energy, on artisan coffee, on semi-ironical yoga, on just being a great guy. And who’s to say it won’t be a success. This is undeniably an exciting time, and a super-talented lineup. What’s not to like about Key? He knows cricket from the ground up. He’s intelligent and strong willed. People who know him seem to adore him. The same goes for McCullum, who is a really impressive person, who knows about teams and systems, and who was a very good orthodox Test cricketer. Dynamism and soul: what Brendon McCullum will bring to England role | Ali Martin Read more It’s a change too. We’ve not really had blokes before. We had Peter Moores, who was bright and capable but also resembled a minor Doctor Who seeing out his final series. Trevor Bayliss was good but almost laughably relaxed, basically a hat on a stick. Chris Silverwood tried hard, but was more dad-at-a-barbecue than cool guy head coach. Bring on the bros. This feels, at the very least, like the modern world. And yet, we should be wary of confusing it with something new, or indeed a setup that seems to have any obvious answers beyond hopeful window dressing. McCullum is going to “give England an identity”. That identity will, we hear, be vibrant, and brave and forward looking, because those are words that sound good. Key, meanwhile says he will appoint “the best people”. But who are the best people? There have already been some scathing comments about things like coaching qualifications. Perhaps elite England cricket well now be run on a kind of strongman model, a world of populism and personal appointments. Is this good? Does it make cricket seem more likely to survive and grow? Because beneath the dude-ness of it all there are some uncomfortable truths here. Most obviously, it is laughable that English cricket can preach about inclusion and opening up to new people, and then set up its seat of power in this way, by avoiding due process in favour of phone calls from mates and people who are good on TV. This is the problem, right there: closed shops, invisible barriers, hiring based on good feelings and whoever is in your eyeline. Even odder, those inside this process don’t seem to see any problem with parcelling out power in this way. Er, bros? Not cool. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. What will success look like from here? Winning games? Playing exciting cricket? Getting people to care? It is telling that such is the sense of doom around this team, this format, that the general response is a kind of hopeful shrug. Keysey has jumped down out of the comms box. The Spice Girls are presenting Top of the Pops. But there is at least talent and energy and charisma here. Like a military coup in a failing state, the Blokes have taken over. We wish them well. Just don’t call it a revolution.","pubDate":"2022-05-13 18:03:05","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac2ca711a17d6443f4f1b58a472870640dfa63b6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85499f0090b8ff0fdfc41ed3933a8eab","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL Live Score, RCB vs PBKS Live Updates: Punjab Kings Close In On Victory As RCB Go 9 Wickets Down - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L2xpdmUtaXBsLXNjb3JlLXJjYi12cy1wYmtzLWxpdmUtY3JpY2tldC1zY29yZS1yb3lhbC1jaGFsbGVuZ2Vycy1iYW5nYWxvcmUtdnMtcHVuamFiLWtpbmdzLWxpdmUtc2NvcmVib2FyZC1hbmQtdXBkYXRlcy0yOTczMzMx0gGjAWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvbGl2ZS1pcGwtc2NvcmUtcmNiLXZzLXBia3MtbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3JlLXJveWFsLWNoYWxsZW5nZXJzLWJhbmdhbG9yZS12cy1wdW5qYWIta2luZ3MtbGl2ZS1zY29yZWJvYXJkLWFuZC11cGRhdGVzLTI5NzMzMzEvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL Live Score, RCB vs PBKS Live Updates: Punjab Kings Close In On Victory As RCB Go 9 Wickets Down  NDTV SportsVirat Kohli, Faf, Maxwell & DK at practice  Royal Challengers BangaloreLive Cricket Score: RCB vs PBKS, Match 60, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzMatch Preview - Punjab Kings vs RCB, Indian Premier League 2022, 60th Match  ESPNcricinfoRCB vs PBKS, Preview: Game Day | IPL 2022  Royal Challengers BangaloreView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-13 17:49:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Will RCB qualify for playoffs 2022: How can RCB qualify for playoffs 2022?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-will-rcb-qualify-for-playoffs-2022-how-can-rcb-qualify-for-playoffs-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Punjab Kings","RCB","Indian Premier League","PBKS","Royal Challengers Bangalore"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Will RCB qualify for playoffs 2022: Royal Challengers Bangalore lost their sixth Indian Premier League 2022 league match tonight.

During the 60th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Punjab Kings at the Brabourne Stadium, Punjab Kings beat Royal Challengers Bangalore by 54 runs to win their sixth match of the season. Chasing a challenging 210-run target, all Bangalore could manage was 155/9 in 20 overs. A poor start in the powerplay resulted in RCB scoring 44/3 in the powerplay. However, a 37-ball 64-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Rajat Patidar (26) and Glenn Maxwell (35) did raise hopes of a comeback. With both the batters getting out withing three deliveries, Kings once again sat on the driver’s seat. The likes of Dinesh Karthik (11) and Shahbaz Ahmed (9) failed to replicate their previous heroics of the season to put their team in a spot of bother. As a result, registering their highest-ever run-chase ended up being a distant affair for Royal Challengers tonight. Oh shabaash shero! Kamaal karta @PunjabKingsIPL 👏 👏 👏 A thumping win and crucial 2 points in the kitty. Not to forget the NRR that will be crucial in the tournament ahead. #RCBvPBKS #IPL2022 — Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh) May 13, 2022 PBKS fast bowler Kagiso Rabada was the pick of their bowlers with bowling figures of 4-0-21-3 comprising of dismissals of Virat Kohli (20), Ahmed and Harshal Patel (11). In addition to Rabada, all-rounder Rishi Dhawan and spinner Rahul Chahar picked a couple of wickets each at the Cricket Club of India on Friday. Having lost their sixth match of the season, Bangalore’s position on the points table hasn’t changed at all. Still at the fourth position, RCB will have to add to their seven IPL 2022 victories in order to stand a chance of qualifying for the playoffs. With three playoffs slots up for grabs, Royal Challengers can make it to the next round assuming they beat Gujarat Lions at the Wankhede Stadium in their last league match of the season on Thursday. While the same wouldn’t guarantee them a playoff spot for other teams could also end up with 16 points, qualifying with 14 points (if they lose vs Gujarat) is almost impossible. Hence, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that RCB vs GT match next week will be like a knockout fixture for Faf du Plessis (10) and his men.","pubDate":"2022-05-13 17:46:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: Rajat Patidar's 102m Six Lands On An Old Fan's Head, Leaves Him Injured In The Stands - Cricket Addictor","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL2NyaWNrZXRhZGRpY3Rvci5jb20vaW5kaWFuLXByZW1pZXItbGVhZ3VlLWlwbC0yMDIyL3JjYi12cy1wYmtzLXdhdGNoLXJhamF0LXBhdGlkYXJzLTEwMm0tc2l4LWxhbmRzLW9uLWFuLW9sZC1mYW5zLWhlYWQtbGVhdmVzLWhpbS1pbmp1cmVkLWluLXRoZS1zdGFuZHMv0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Watch: Rajat Patidar's 102m Six Lands On An Old Fan's Head, Leaves Him Injured In The Stands  Cricket AddictorVirat Kohli, Faf, Maxwell & DK at practice  Royal Challengers BangaloreLive Cricket Score: RCB vs PBKS, Match 60, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzMatch Preview - Punjab Kings vs RCB, Indian Premier League 2022, 60th Match  ESPNcricinfoRCB vs PBKS, Preview: Game Day | IPL 2022  Royal Challengers BangaloreView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-13 17:22:47","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"KKR vs SRH Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022 - Cricket Addictor","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL2NyaWNrZXRhZGRpY3Rvci5jb20vZmFudGFzeS1jcmlja2V0L2trci12cy1zcmgtZHJlYW0xMS1wcmVkaWN0aW9uLWZhbnRhc3ktY3JpY2tldC10aXBzLWRyZWFtMTEtdGVhbS1wbGF5aW5nLXhpLXBpdGNoLXJlcG9ydC1pbmp1cnktdXBkYXRlLXRhdGEtaXBsLTIwMjIv0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KKR vs SRH Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022  Cricket AddictorIPL 2022: Match 61, KKR vs SRH Match Prediction – Who will win today’s IPL match between Kolkata and Sunrisers?  CricTrackerIPL 2022: Do-or-die clash for Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad  wknd.KKR vs SRH Match Prediction- Who Will Win Today's IPL Match Between Kolkata Knight Riders vs Sunrisers Hyderabad IPL 2022, Match 61 KKR vs SRH  Cricket AddictorIPL 2022: Match 61 – Predicted Kolkata Knight Riders Playing XI vs Sunrisers Hyderabad  CricTrackerView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-13 16:36:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jonny Bairstow IPL 2022 price: Fastest 50 in IPL by Punjab Kings batters full list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-jonny-bairstow-ipl-2022-price-fastest-50-in-ipl-by-punjab-kings-batters-full-list/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Punjab Kings","RCB","Indian Premier League","Jonny Bairstow","PBKS","Royal Challengers Bangalore"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Fastest 50 in IPL: The opening batter from Punjab Kings registered a 21-ball half-century at the Brabourne Stadium tonight.

During the 60th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Punjab Kings at the Brabourne Stadium, Punjab Kings opening batter Jonny Bairstow provided a quickfire start to his team after put in to bat first by Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Faf du Plessis. With Bairstow opening the batting with Shikhar Dhawan (21), Punjab’s opening batters shared a 30-ball 60-run partnership to make the most of fielding restrictions. Bairstow, whose first boundary came in the form of a six off Glenn Maxwell in the first over itself, hit two fours and and as many sixes off Josh Hazlewood in the second over. Bangalore fast bowler Mohammed Siraj became Bairstow’s next target as the 32-year old batter hit a four and three sixes in his last over of the powerplay. It was in the same over that Bairstow registered a 21-ball half-century at the Cricket Club of India. Bairstow’s gone berserk. RCB will be chasing 200-plus if they don’t get him soon — Cricketwallah (@cricketwallah) May 13, 2022 In what is Bairstow’s 24th T20 half-century, it is his ninth in the IPL, second against Royal Challengers and first at this venue. Despite his stroke-filled innings tonight, Bairstow was nowhere near the fastest IPL half-centuries . As far as the fastest half-centuries for a Punjab batter in the IPL is concerned, a 21-ball half-century is the joint sixth-fastest. Bairstow, who scored 66 (29) with the help of four fours and seven sixes at a strike rate of 227.58 before getting out in the 10th over, is playing his first season for PBKS. Bairstow, who had registered himself for INR 1.5 crore in the mega auction, had allured interest from Delhi Capitals and Sunrisers Hyderabad before Kings bought him for INR 6.75 crore.","pubDate":"2022-05-13 15:33:14","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"County cricket: Yorkshire v Lancashire, Durham v Glamorgan and more – live!","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/may/13/county-cricket-yorkshire-v-lancashire-durham-v-glamorgan-and-more-live","keywords":["County Championship","Sport","Cricket"],"creator":["Tanya Aldred at Headingley"],"video_url":null,"description":"The latest from around the grounds in the latest roundWatchful Stokes lets fly under lights for dominant DurhamAny comments?

Karthik teamed up with McCullum during their stint together in the IPL with the Kolkata Knight Riders -- McCullum and Karthik were coach and captain of the franchise respectively in the 2019 season. The Indian wicketkeeper-batter expects McCullum to bring a positive attitude to the England Test team. \"The one thing I can tell you in the enormous amounts of time I've spent with him is that there is no negative bone in his body,\" Karthik said on the ICC Review. \"He is somebody who wants to do everything in a positive manner.\" \"So it's going to be very interesting when Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum meet up and figure out what's the positive way for England cricket to do things.\" McCullum is still an inexperienced coach in the international circuit, and Karthik believes he will have to adapt to the role. \"I think there will be certain things that will be definitely new to Brendon McCullum,\" he said. \"There is no doubt about it. Even though he has done his coaching bit for Kolkata Knight Riders and for Trinbago Knight Riders , I think red-ball cricket is a completely different kettle of fish.\" The England men's team has been going through a difficult time -- they lost the Ashes 4-0 in Australia, and then suffered a series defeat in the West Indies as well, prompting Joe Root to step down as captain. \"I think McCullum wants to take this up because he sees this as a major challenge.\" \"A team that has obviously not done really well in the last two years. A bit in the dumps but to try and resurrect and try and take them to the pinnacle of Test cricket, which is what they are aiming to do.\" During his stint as the New Zealand captain, McCullum was widely credited with improving the culture of the team. This led to an improvement in results, culminating in some famous victories. Asked what culture McCullum would inculcate in the side, Karthik believed the atmosphere around the team would be a \"relaxed\" one. \"It will be a very relaxed dressing room. I've seen that he is somebody who focuses a lot on playing a lot of sports off the field and off the field having a lot of fun as well. \"He emphasizes a lot on it like a young kid who likes to play all the sports possible and gets very physical as well. He is a very strong man, there is no doubt about it. Sometimes even too strong for the current cricketers today. It will be a very relaxed dressing room, a very chill dressing room. \"It'll be very interesting how the youngsters are able to draw energy from that and make sure they are doing all things right to take English cricket forward.\" McCullum does have a task on his hands, especially with many white-ball tournaments coming up, including the T20 World Cup in Australia later this year and the World Cup next year. In such a case, managing the workload of the players playing both formats could pose a tricky situation for McCullum. When quizzed on what would be McCullum's first priority as the head coach, Karthik said, \"I think to find out how much of a priority is it for ECB to play red-ball cricket. \"Because there are so many white-ball tournaments coming up, where is Test cricket placed right now in terms of availability of the players so that he can move the team forward. \"The English cricket team has a few players that overlap between white-ball and red-ball cricket and it can get hard to play both formats throughout the summer. So sometimes you have to give up on a format for a certain time so that you can focus on a major tournament or Test series that is going to come up. \"So the priority on which player and how many good players is he going to get to play Test cricket is something he has to figure out with the administrators.\"","pubDate":"2022-05-13 15:08:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"KKR vs SRH MCA Stadium Pune pitch report today match 2022: Knight Riders vs Sunrisers pitch report Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-kkr-vs-srh-mca-stadium-pune-pitch-report-today-match-2022-knight-riders-vs-sunrisers-pitch-report-maharashtra-cricket-association-stadium/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","KKR","Sunrisers Hyderabad","KKR vs SRH","mca stadium","Pune Pitch Report"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"KKR vs SRH MCA Stadium Pune pitch report today match 2022: Kolkata and Hyderabad will battle it out at the MCA Stadium in Pune.

Kolkata Knight Riders will take on Sunrisers Hyderabad in the 61st league game of the Indian Premier League 2022. The match will be played at the MCA Stadium in Pune. This is a Do or Die game for the Kolkata Knight Riders, and they have to win this one. Sunrisers Hyderabad also have to win this game if they want to reach the golden number of 16 points this season. Australian pacer Pat Cummins has been ruled out of the tournament for Kolkata Knight Riders. The surface at the MCA Stadium in Pune has always been a paradise for the batters. A black soil surface is used at the venue, which supports the batters as there is an even bounce on the track. In the middle-overs, the spinners can take advantage of the grip on the surface at Pune. The boundaries at the MCA Stadium in Pune are not that large, and the batters can easily clear the fence. Pat Cummins scored the joint-fastest half-century of the IPL history this season at this very ground only. It is an open stadium so the breeze passes throughout the game.

Out of 12, the defending teams have won nine games, whereas the chasing teams have just won thrice. It is interesting to note that the teams batting first have won the last six games at this venue. Rajasthan Royals have posted the highest score this year at this venue when they scored 210 runs against the Sunrisers Hyderabad. Lucknow Super Giants bundled out for just 82 runs in the last game, and this was the lowest score at the venue this season. The biggest advantage of the matches in Pune is the dew factor, there is negligible dew in Pune as compared to the venues in Mumbai so the toss won’t play a huge part here.","pubDate":"2022-05-13 14:56:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Punjab Kings Live Score Ball by Ball, IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/royal-challengers-bangalore-vs-punjab-kings-live-score-over-match-60-t20-6-10-updates-2973761","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Punjab Kings from Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai.

At the halfway mark, Punjab are 105/3! 9.5 overs (1 Run) Too full and on middle, Mayank leans forward and strokes it down to long off for a single. 9.4 overs (0 Run) Nearly drags it on!

Mayank Agarwal comes in. 9.1 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! A wicket immediately after the break, keeps happening every time. The break just disturbs the tempo. Shahbaz Ahmed has hunted down the danger man. Serves it full and around off, Jonny Bairstow advances down the track for a big shot but only manages to slice it off the outer edge to backward point. Two fielders converge and Mohammed Siraj takes the catch. End of a very entertaining knock from the Englishman and it's important here for Punjab to not lose the momentum. Strategic Break! Punjab are scoring at a very quick rate but runs have slightly dropped down since the end of the Powerplay. They have two power-hitters in the middle and 200 should be on their mind from hereon. Bangalore have done well to calm things down, through their spinners. Even the luck is not favouring them but they will hope to get the current batters out of here quickly. 8.6 overs (1 Run) Jumps down the track to a full ball and nudges it to deep mid-wicket for a run. Two miserly overs from Wanindu Hasaranga. 8.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Streaky! Full and flighted, around off and turning back in, Jonny Bairstow wears his skates and tries to heave it over the leg side. But it takes the inside edge, beats the stumps and races behind to fine leg for a boundary. 100 up! 8.4 overs (0 Run) Shout for an lbw! Not given. Floated delivery, full and around middle, Jonny Bairstow walks down the track but fails to flick. He is hit on the pads but the umpire turns down the appeal. 8.3 overs (1 Run) Quicker one, full and on middle, eased down to long on for a single. 8.2 overs (0 Run) Flatter and around leg, Liam gets back and helps it to short mid-wicket. 8.1 overs (0 Run) Floated and full, around off, pushed off the front foot to covers. 7.6 overs (0 Run) Bowls it short and outside off, Jonny gets back to cut but under-edges it on one bounce to the keeper. DK gets his body behind the ball and makes the stop. 7.5 overs (1 Run) Shahbaz continues to fire it in, full and on middle, it's knocked down to long on for a run. 7.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Bang! Very full, around leg, Liam Livingstone uses his feet and clubs it down the ground for a boundary at long on. 7.3 overs (2 Runs) Wonderful bowling! Shahbaz Ahmed senses the charge from the batter and dishes it out full and wide outside off. Liam Livingstone chases and drags it off the inner edge. Luckily for him, it beats the stumps and goes past the keeper. Two runs. 7.2 overs (1 Run) Flatter and fuller again, on off, Jonny Bairstow pushes it down to long off for one. 7.1 overs (1 Run) Fuller and around off, driven through covers for a single. Will Mohammed Siraj bowl another over? Nope, Shahbaz Ahmed will replace him. 6.6 overs (1 Run) Quicker and shorter, on off, Liam punches it down to long off and opens his account with a single. 6.5 overs (0 Run) Flighted and full, around off, driven to covers. Liam Livingstone walks out to the middle. 6.4 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Wanindu Hasaranga wins the battle of the Lankans. Flights this one up and lands it full and outside off, Bhanuka Rajapaksa finds the room to free his arms and attempts to go inside-out over the cover region. But the ball spins away to take the outside edge and Harshal Patel takes a decent catch at short third man. Bangalore will need to keep chipping away at the wickets as Punjab bat deep and have some dangerous batters in their ranks. 6.3 overs (1 Run) Loopy and full, around off, Jonny uses his feet and drills it down to long on for one. 6.2 overs (1 Run) Drags his length short, around off, Bhanuka Rajapaksa goes back and pulls it to deep mid-wicket for a run. 6.1 overs (0 Run) Flatter and around off, defended off the back foot to the off side. Change in bowling! Wanindu Hasaranga is into the attack. 5.6 overs (6 Runs) SIX! A flat hit! Back of a length, around off, Jonny Bairstow camps back and muscles it in front of square on the leg side. Yet another biggie from the bat of Jonny and Punjab have raced to 83/1 in the Powerplay - the best score by any team this season! 5.5 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Flicked away in style to reach his 9th fifty in the Indian T20 League, off just 21 balls. Fuller in length, around leg, Jonny Bairstow picks it off his pads and effortlessly dismisses it over square leg. 5.4 overs (0 Run) Misses out! A length ball, around middle and leg, skidding off the surface, Jonny rocks back to heave but misses. 5.4 overs (1 Run) A high full toss, around middle, Bairstow pulls it down to deep square leg and turns down the single. Reason - It's a no ball for height and Jonny wants to take the Free Hit! 5.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Smashed! A harmless delivery, short and outside off, Jonny Bairstow latches onto it and powers it over long on for a biggie. 5.2 overs (0 Run) Lands it on a length and outside off, it's pushed to covers. 5.1 overs (4 Runs) SAFE! And it's FOUR! Siraj comes up with a cracking yorker, around middle and leg, Bairstow tries to dig it out but misses and is hit on the back leg. The ball deflects towards third man and finds the fence. There is an appeal but the finger stays down. Faf du Plessis has decided to review the decision. The third umpire is having a look. UltraEdge takes some time to load and then shows that there is an inside edge. Jonny is safe and he gets FOUR!","pubDate":"2022-05-13 14:56:00","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637880703520210030.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ian Herbert: De ce sunt eroii mei trei reporteri sportivi români care au pus întrebări grele?","link":"https://www.obiectivtulcea.ro/ian-herbert-de-ce-sunt-eroii-mei-trei-reporteri-sportivi-romani-care-au-pus-intrebari-grele/","keywords":["sport"],"creator":["Sidony Cato"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sunt momente când comentarea – a face declarații despre asta sau cutare – nu este...","content":"Sunt momente când comentarea – a face declarații despre asta sau cutare – nu este suficient. Ca momentul în care apar creditele de închidere ale unui nou film care probabil ar ascunde orice altceva din munca jurnaliştilor. Într-un fel, viața de zi cu zi a celor trei reporteri care urmăresc The Collective — Katalin Tolontan, Mirella Neg și Razvan Lutak — sunt familiare multora dintre noi care facem treaba. Lucrează la Gazeta Sporturilor, un cotidian de sport din România, așa că rivalitatea dintre Steaua și Dynamo București este foarte proeminentă. Vorbește bine despre o echipă și fanii celeilalte echipe te vor jignit în general. viceversa. Notificările nu sunt luate în considerare în câteva săptămâni. Însă rușinea publică care vine odată cu accesul său acum – și atacabilitatea sa – i-a făcut, de asemenea, imuni la abuzurile și avertismentele disimulate din partea clasei politice din România, când au început să investigheze și să pună la îndoială felul în care banii publici presupus destinați sportului românesc dispareau vizibil. . Scenă. De la stânga la dreapta: reporterii sportivi români Mirella Neg, Katalin Tolontan și Razvan Lutak ies din zona lor de confort și încep să pună întrebări dure Milioane s-au angajat într-un meci de box cu legenda română Lucien Pott, umplând buzunarele influentului și popularului ministru al turismului. Milioane au fost clătite ilegal din meciul românesc de Jorge Popescu, legenda națională a fotbalului devenit agent, care era căpitanul Barcelonei. „Dacă ești obișnuit cu multă ostilitate din partea fanilor, ăsta e un mare plus”, mi-a spus Tolontan, privind ecranul la un apel Zoom de la București. Nimeni, nici guvernul, nici mafia, nu este mai ostil decât fanii fotbalului. Un grup sau altul te urăște mereu. Este jocul. Cheia este să rezistați tentației de a mulțumi publicul. Și când înveți acest lucru, este foarte util în domeniile de investigație. Au rezistat. Acțiunea lor a văzut condamnarea ministrului și încarcerarea lui Popescu. Când un incendiu a izbucnit în 2015 într-un club de noapte aglomerat din București, Kultif, ucigând 27 de oameni și rănind încă 180, Tolontan și echipa sa au reluat – și la început, nu a fost complet contradictoriu. Printre victime s-a numărat și fiul legendarei scriitoare romane, Anna Pasco. Stadionul Național de Fotbal București, unul dintre stadioanele Euro 2020, nu avea certificat complet de incendiu. Dar apoi au început să apară întrebări mai fundamentale cu privire la răspunsul statului la incendiu și a devenit imposibil pentru acești sportivi să-i împartă. Regizorul roman Alexandre Nanau a fost surprins de modul in care reporterii care scriau despre fotbal puneau brusc intrebari dure. De ce așa-zisa unitate specializată de arși din București nu a fost echipată pentru a face față victimelor arsurilor? De ce nu existau ieșiri de incendiu în club de noapte? De ce au refuzat autoritățile să transfere multe dintre cele mai periculoase victime în spitale din alte țări? Nanao a început să-i urmărească, fără să-și imagineze că următorul documentar, „Collective”, va înfățișa o amploare a corupției de stat atât de devastatoare încât cei trei sunt îngrijorați în fața camerei de filmare dacă cititorii îi vor crede cu adevărat. „Este atât de uimitor, mă tem că vom arăta nebuni”, a spus Neg la una dintre întâlnirile de deschidere. Tolontan stătea în biroul lui la 9 dimineața într-o zi a săptămânii — „e timpul liniștit, când nu se întâmplă nimic”, îmi spune el — când a sosit un e-mail deosebit de fatidic în căsuța de e-mail. I-am spus că un furnizor diluează în mod curent cantitatea necesară de dezinfectant în produsele folosite în sute de spitale din România. Aceasta înseamnă că bacteriile se găsesc înfloritoare în cabinetele de sterilizare chirurgicală. Tolontan nu a fost singurul jurnalist care a primit e-mailul. Dar el a fost singurul care i-a răspuns. Nu a fost nimic din acel proces de presă când dai naștere unei alte mărturii și procesul devine de fapt o plimbare în parc. Afirmația s-a dovedit a fi corectă, dar necesită o sursă dublă. Într-o încercare disperată de a ascunde scandalul, Ministerul Sănătății din România a susținut că a testat antiseptice și a constatat că 95 dintre acestea sunt eficiente. Au fost apeluri la rece, bătăi la ușă, alei oarbe – și trei luni mai târziu, o a doua sursă a verificat. De parcă focul nu ar fi fost suficient de grav, părinții și-au văzut copiii cu răni dureroase murind din cauza unei infecții prevenite. Când povestea a fost publicată, oamenii au ieșit în stradă pentru a protesta. Prima pagină a Gazetei Sporturilor, poartă numele celor uciși după un incendiu izbucnit în 2015 într-un club de noapte aglomerat din București. Au existat înainte filme bune despre grupuri mici și neobosite de reporteri. Boston Globe a dezvăluit abuzul sistematic asupra copiilor de către preoții catolici în „lucruri”. Woodward și Bernstein în All the President’s Men. Dar contul observat și deschis în „colectiv” este mai simplu decât oricare dintre ele. Jurnaliştii sunt vedetele ei. Este documentarul timpului nostru și va rezona în toate locurile în care oficialii guvernamentali mint în mod flagrant pentru a ascunde incompetența. Iar în toate acele locuri în care jurnaliştii – cei care întreabă, sapă şi nu se tem să ridice telefonul – erau consideraţi bunuri de unică folosinţă. Multe dintre ele sunt acum redundante. Povestea nu a arătat vânzările Gazzetta Sportoril așa cum ar putea câștiga Steaua București. Vânzările zilnice sunt încă în jur de 25 000.

Dar, cu răbdare, perseverență și calm, acești oameni au biruit – și urmărindu-i în timp ce o fac, îți face inima să se ridice. Sunt momente când comentarea nu este suficientă. Colectiv lansat pe platformele digitale pe 20 noiembrie Banca Centrală Europeană ar trebui să se uite la Mike Brierley Mike Brierley, căpitanul de vis al Angliei din vara lui ’81 – Bothham, Willis, Headingley, The Ashes – a contribuit inteligent și atent la prânz de duminica trecută la Private Passions de la Radio 3, un program excelent în fiecare săptămână a anului. S-a bazat pe înțelepciunea anilor săi ca psihanalist când a întrebat dacă dimensiunea echipei de sprijin din jurul unor echipe de cricket ar putea fi de fapt mai mare decât este necesar. Și când a povestit cum Willis, asupra lui însuși și era total lipsit de credință înainte de acel Test 81, s-a vorbit despre el într-un spectacol pentru veacuri. Sănătatea mintală nu este o problemă mai mică atunci decât acum. Banca Centrală Europeană l-ar putea folosi pe Mike Burley. BCE ar putea folosi ajutorul lui Mike Brierley (dreapta) – căpitanul Angliei în vara anului 1981 F1 este un sport informat… Cât de satisfăcător este pentru F1 să fie binecuvântată cu gloria autoreflexivă pe care a creat-o Lewis Hamilton, depășind recordul lui Michael Schumacher și vorbind apoi atât de elocvent despre diversitate și toleranță.

During the 60th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Punjab Kings at the Brabourne Stadium, Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Faf du Plessis has won the toss and chose to bowl. “We’ll have a bowl. The trends in the competition suggests that the wickets are getting better, toss isn’t making much of a difference. One side is a bit short, so that’s a factor. Looks a good wicket, just unsure how it will play early on, so just want to have a bowl,” du Plessis told Star Sports at the toss. Coming on the back of consecutive victories against Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad, Royal Challengers have refrained from making any change to their Playing XI for this match.

Having lost yet another toss this season, Punjab Kings captain Mayank Agarwal remained unaffected by the prospect of setting a total in what is a practically a must-win match for them. “Not a bad toss to lose. Want to put runs on the board and put pressure on them. We have been playing good cricket but it’s been a bit on and off,” Agarwal told Star Sports at the toss. Unlike the opposition, Kings have made a lone change to their Playing XI for this match. All-rounder Harpreet Brar has replaced pacer Sandeep Sharma for this match. Playing only his third match of the season, Brar has leaked 58 runs in his five IPL 2022 overs without picking any wicket. Fourth highest wicket-taker against RCB in the history of the IPL, Sharma also possesses of an excellent record against former Bangalore captain Virat Kohli. However, a couple of wickets in the 20 overs that he’s bowled across five matches this season, doesn’t count for great current form for the 28-year old player. “Harpreet Brar comes in for Sandeep Sharma. Left-arm spinner against them is a good match-up. So, that’s why we have made the change,” Agarwal added.
