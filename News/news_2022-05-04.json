His appointment came as a surprise as he, like many former Test players, found himself a job as a cricket columnist and television commentator. Since taking over the hot seat in mid-April, he has resembled a chess master. He was left to make two crucial moves – trying to install a captain and a coach – to revive England’s flagging red-ball game. He managed to convince Ben Stokes to take over the captaincy from Joe Root , who was pressured to stand down following that Ashes embarrassment and the series loss to the West Indies. Stokes was an automatic choice, as there was no other captaincy material in the lineup. Stokes wasted no time in trying to right things by confirming that pace bowlers James Anderson and Stuart Broad , who were controversially canned from the tour of the West Indies, will be available for selection for his first Test as captain against New Zealand on June 2. Key’s task of landing a coach to replace Chris Silverwood , who was fired after that Ashes debacle, hasn’t been a cakewalk. At least half a dozen of the best men Key contacted to replace Silverwood politely declined. In a column he penned recently, Key mentioned he was looking for a “savvy, tough tactician” such as former Aussie captain Ricky Ponting or Mahela Jayawardene , the former Sri Lanka captain. Both declined, and his search has now narrowed to former South Africa and India coach Gary Kirsten . The South African led India to the World Cup in 2011 and he is interested, as the new England role does not involve him coaching the white-ball teams as well. Expect Kirsten to be announced as the new coach by next week. MALIK MAKES HIS MARK Shoaib Akhtar struck fear in the hearts of batsmen. Known as the Rawalpindi Express, the Pakistani speed merchant made life uncomfortable for those at the other end of the pitch, as balls flew at them and past them at terrifying speed. On Feb. 22, 2003, Akhtar became the first bowler to crack the 100 miles per hour barrier with a delivery that was clocked at 100.2 m.p.h. in a World Cup match versus England. Australia’s Shaun Tait was right on Akhtar’s heels with a delivery timed at 101.1. No other speedster has touched three figures, although some have come close. Australians Brett Lee scorched one down at 99.9, Jeffrey Thomson 99.8 and Mitchell Starc 99.7. There’s nothing more thrilling in cricket then watching a fast bowler take a long run, wind up and let fly a screamer. The latest to set the Indian Premier League alight with his speed is practically an unknown. Umran Malik has bowled consistently around 154 km/h (95.6 m.p.h.) by far the quickest in the IPL this season with Gujarat’s New Zealand import Lockie Ferguson next quickest at 153.9 km/h. The 22-year-old was brought on board by Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2021 as a COVID replacement for Thangarasu Natarajan . Hyderabad then retained Malik for 2022 by paying him $523,000 (U.S.) for the season under the urging of bowling coach Dale Steyn . The South African was at one time rated one of the fastest bowlers in the world. “ Umran will play international cricket, no doubt about that,” said Steyn. “He bowls at 150 km/h consistently, and nobody else is doing that in the world right now, maybe Lockie Ferguson is the other guy who does it, but they are very different bowlers. “But from an Indian point of view, he is the only guy that consistently bowls over 145-150km/h every single ball, so he will play for India. But how India manages him is completely up to them,” Steyn told Sportstar. Malik was born in the Jammu region of Indian-administered Kashmir and his rise in the sport has been nothing short of a fairy-tale. The son of a fruit vendor, he impressed the Indian selectors with his speed during last year’s T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, when he was somehow roped in as a net bowler. Malik made his mark this season by taking five for 25 against Gujarat Titans to get Indian fans all excited. India’s pace attack is led by Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami with excellent back up quickies in Mohammed Siraj and Shardul Thakur . But with his raw pace Malik should make his debut for India this year. There was a time when the West Indies produced some of the most fearsome speed merchants, but unfortunately this was before the advent of speed guns. Some of the fastest and greatest included Malcolm Marshall , Curtly Ambrose , Joel Garner , Michael Holding , Andy Roberts , and Wesley Hall .","image_url":null,"source_id":"torontosun","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bizarre Barty move a ‘weird one to explain’","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/weird-to-explain-new-teammate-opens-up-on-ash-barty-after-code-switch/news-story/39355898551ad51a3726beb57cac50fe","keywords":["Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ash Barty’s retirement in March when she was women’s tennis number one and just 25 years old is a “weird one to explain”, South African cricket legend AB de Villiers said in an interview before they team up for a golf event.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-03 21:11:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Livingstone fireworks keep Punjab&#039;s IPL playoff hopes alive","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/05/04/cricket-livingstone-fireworks-keep-punjab039s-ipl-playoff-hopes-alive","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - Liam Livingstone smashed the biggest six in the Indian Premier League this season, a 117-metre effort, as his late cameo allowed the Punjab Kings to seal an eight-wicket win over leaders Gujarat Titans with four overs to spare on Tuesday.

Livingstone plundered 28 runs off the 16th over against Mohammad Shami, smashing three sixes in a row along with two fours, as Punjab made light work of the 144-run chase. England batter Livingstone, the IPL's most expensive player this season, remained not out at 30 from 10 balls, having scored two from his first four. According to ESPN Cricinfo, the 28-year-old has hit three of the five biggest sixes this season, with Tuesday's monstrous 117m effort topping the list. \"I didn't think I was going to bat at one point tonight so it was nice to go in and hit a few out of the middle,\" Livingstone said. \"We needed it after some bad cricket over the last couple of games so it's nice to turn it around.\" The win lifted Punjab from eighth to fifth in the standings and revived their playoff push, following three defeats in their previous four games. Kagiso Rabada snared four wickets earlier as Gujarat were restricted to a below-par 143-8 before Shikhar Dhawan's 62 not out and 40 runs from Bhanuka Rajapaksa ensured Punjab were comfortably on their way to victory.

But he returned as a mentor of the Royals team. Then I said to him, ‘Shane can you bowl me a couple of balls, and then he replied, ‘why not mate’. He had a different swag at that age as well. We all at the Royals have memories with him. If he was sitting among the whole team and support staff, everyone can feel Shane Warne is sitting there, that’s the kind of energy he had,” exclaimed Samson. Unbelievably surprised by the ‘rip’ he still offered to the ball at the age of 50, Samson further exclaimed, “He’s built different man. His rhythm, the way he runs up and releases the ball. He was different. He had that swag; he was really unbelievable.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, GT vs PBKS Live Score: Kagiso Rabada Takes 4, Sai Sudharshan Fifty Takes Gujarat Titans To 143/8 - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2lwbC0yMDIyL2lwbC0yMDIyLWd0LXZzLXBia3MtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLWd1amFyYXQtdGl0YW5zLXZzLXB1bmphYi1raW5ncy1saXZlLXNjb3JlLTI5NDI1NDfSAX9odHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9pcGwtMjAyMi1ndC12cy1wYmtzLWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtdXBkYXRlcy1ndWphcmF0LXRpdGFucy12cy1wdW5qYWIta2luZ3MtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS0yOTQyNTQ3L2FtcC8x?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, GT vs PBKS Live Score: Kagiso Rabada Takes 4, Sai Sudharshan Fifty Takes Gujarat Titans To 143/8  NDTV SportsIPL 2022 LIVE: GT vs PBKS LIVE | Preview LIVE | Hardik Pandya | Mayank Agarwal | Rashid Khan  NEWS9 liveGT vs PBKS Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022  Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - Titans vs Punjab Kings, Indian Premier League 2022, 48th Match  ESPNcricinfoGT vs PBKS Live Score, IPL 2022: Kagiso Rabada four-for restricts Gujarat Titans to 143/8  Times of IndiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-03 15:56:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, GT vs PBKS Live Score Updates: Rabada gets 4 as Ferguson departs, Gujarat 8 down - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvaXBsL2lwbC0yMDIyLWd0LXZzLXBia3MtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS1vbmxpbmUtNzg5OTU3My_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, GT vs PBKS Live Score Updates: Rabada gets 4 as Ferguson departs, Gujarat 8 down  The Indian ExpressIPL 2022 LIVE: GT vs PBKS LIVE | Preview LIVE | Hardik Pandya | Mayank Agarwal | Rashid Khan  NEWS9 liveGT vs PBKS Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022  Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - Titans vs Punjab Kings, Indian Premier League 2022, 48th Match  ESPNcricinfoGT vs PBKS Live Score, IPL 2022: Livingstone gets Miller as Gujarat Titans slide  Times of IndiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-03 15:42:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"DY Patil Stadium dimensions: DY Patil Stadium boundary length 2022 IPL","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-dy-patil-stadium-dimensions-dy-patil-stadium-boundary-length-2022-ipl/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","DY Patil Stadium","Indian Premier League","IPL"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"DY Patil Stadium dimensions: The venue is hosting its fifteenth match of the ongoing 15th season of the IPL.

All-rounder Stokes was unveiled as England's captain last week by the country's cricket board (ECB) as the struggling team look to bounce back from a long slump. Stokes took over from Joe Root who led England in a record 64 tests. Anderson and Broad, who have taken a combined 1,177 wickets in test cricket, were surprisingly left out of the test tour of West Indies earlier this year and England struggled in the Caribbean without their experience, losing the series. \"I've made it pretty clear to Rob (Key, ECB managing director) and he's on the same wavelength as me. You pick your best 11 players. If Stuart Broad and James Anderson are fit, they're definitely a part of that,\" Stokes told reporters. In a separate interview with Sky Sports, he said Anderson and Broad were two of the greats of the game and it would be \"stupid to never consider them for selection\". Stokes said being named captain was a \"huge honour\" and that he was looking forward to \"very exciting times\" as England prepare for the visit of world test champions New Zealand next month. \"One thing I feel like I've got to do is to make sure I get everyone not focusing on the past. We want to turn (things) around and it's all about the future, what we've got ahead of us. If anything, it's a clean slate,\" he added. \"Being a captain is not just about focusing on what goes on between 11 o'clock and 6 o'clock. It's a job that continues after those hours. \"It's also not just about controlling things on the field, it's about building yourself to be someone that your players can always come to... I've always felt like I am that person in the team, I hope that doesn't change now just because I'm captain.\" England have yet to replace Chris Silverwood as head coach, with the position vacant. Stokes said a lot of names have been \"thrown around\" but confirmed he would be involved when the decision is made on the next appointment.

Sai Sudharsan cuts it past backward point. The fielder at deep point will cut it off and the batters pick up two runs! 4.3 overs (0 Run) On a length, around off, nipping in a tad. Sai Sudharsan blocks it out. 4.2 overs (0 Run) A fullish delivery, around off. Sai Sudharsan leans forward and drives it to cover-point. 4.2 overs (1 Run) Wide! Sliding down the leg side, Sai Sudharsan tries flicking but misses. 4.1 overs (0 Run) Edged but safe! Angling away from the batter, Sai pushes inside the line and gets a soft outside edge. It doesn't carry to wide first slip. 3.6 overs (0 Run) On a length, outside off. Hardik Pandya leaves it alone. End of a successful over by Kagiso Rabada! The skipper, Hardik Pandya is the next man in. 3.5 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Saha gets carried away with his attacking batting. Tries to take on Rabada again but it's not easy to do that every time against a bowler of his calibre. The speedster persists with his line outside off and delivers it on a length at 144.1 kph. Saha's attempt for another lofted shot results in a top edge and Mayank Agarwal backtracks from extra cover to grab the skier safely. It's been a good start from Punjab. 3.4 overs (6 Runs) SIX! KABOOM! A length ball, around off. Wriddhiman Saha tonks it high over long on for a biggie! First six for Gujarat! 3.3 overs (2 Runs) A fuller ball, outside off. Wriddhiman Saha lifts it over cover.

Kagiso Rabada will continue. He went for 13 runs in his first over but Mayank Agarwal knows that one more wicket here will put more pressure on Gujarat. 2.6 overs (1 Run) Quick single! A length ball, outside off. Wriddhiman Saha pushes it towards covers and runs across to the other end. Once again, it's Rishi Dhawan there but this time they get a single as Rishi misses the stumps. 2.5 overs (0 Run) Length delivery, around middle and leg. Wriddhiman Saha works it away towards mid-wicket. 2.4 overs (0 Run) Pitches it up, around off. Wriddhiman Saha pushes it towards mid off. No run there! 2.3 overs (0 Run) Outside off, on a length, Saha taps it down to backward point. Looks for a run but is sent back. 2.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Up and over! Fuller ball, around middle.

A direct hit and Shubman Gill is on his way back! He is not happy with something but Punjab have their first breakthrough! A fuller ball, outside off. Shubman Gill taps it towards short extra cover and scampers across to the other end. Rishi Dhawan collects the ball and hits it directly at the stumps at the non-striker's end. Shubman Gill is nowhere near and he has to walk back. He turns and stares at the bowler. Maybe, Gill feels that Sandeep Sharma got in his way. To be honest, he didn't. 1.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Top shot! Back of a length, around middle. Wriddhiman Saha punches it off the back foot past mid on for a boundary. 1.5 overs (1 Run) On a length, outside off.

Edgy runs! Some luck going Gill's way! A length ball, outside off. Shubman Gill looks to push this away, but the ball goes off the inside edge away from the stumps and towards fine leg for a boundary. 1.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Shubman Gill gets off the mark with a boundary as well! A length ball, darting it on the pads. Shubman Gill flicks it past square leg for a boundary. 1.1 overs (0 Run) Kagiso Rabada starts off with a length ball, around middle and leg. Shubman Gill blocks this one away. Kagiso Rabada will start from the other end. Can the premier bowler provide an early breakthrough? 0.6 over (0 Run) Marginally short, outside off, this one tails back in. Wriddhiman Saha blocks it out. 4 runs off the first over! 0.5 over (0 Run) Shorter ball, outside off, some extra bounce there as well. Wriddhiman Saha does well to fend it away towards point. 0.4 over (0 Run) Back of a length, outside off. Wriddhiman Saha stays in his crease and pushes it towards the fielder at cover. 0.3 over (0 Run) Good-length delivery, outside off. Wriddhiman Saha defends it out. 0.2 over (4 Runs) FOUR! Wriddhiman Saha and Gujarat are up and running in style! On a length, outside off, shaping away again. Wriddhiman Saha drives it beautifully through covers for a boundary. 0.1 over (0 Run) Sandeep Sharma begins with a fuller ball, outside off, shaping away. Wriddhiman Saha leaves it alone. We are all set to begin! The Punjab players make their way out to the middle. Wriddhiman Saha and Shubman Gill are the openers for Gujarat. Will Gill fire today? He is surely due for some runs. Sandeep Sharma will start with the ball for Punjab. Here we go... So both teams are going with an unchanged XI. The table-toppers have decided to take a challenge and have elected to bat first but going by their record this season, they would be pretty confident. Punjab, on the other hand, might get some help from the dew later on and they need to seize this opportunity to get those two crucial points on the board. Let's see how things pan out. Shikhar Dhawan is down for a chat. Says that he is doing well with the bat and is happy with the consistency. Adds that he keeps looking at ways to improve his game. Feels that they have not been consistent as a batting unit and they need to rectify that thing. Praises Arshdeep Singh for his bowling, especially at the death and further says that the pacer has been amazing, and he is making the ball talk at his will which is amazing to watch. Mayank Agarwal, the captain of Punjab, was looking to bowl anyway but says that losing so many tosses isn't a good sign for them. Adds that they are playing good aggressive cricket and it's just that they are not seizing the key moments. Tells that the belief in the camp is good and informs that they are also UNCHANGED. Hardik Pandya, the skipper of Gujarat, says that they are going to bat first as he reckons that dew won't play much of a role today. Adds that they have to be on the top of their game and can't get complacent. Further says that things have gone their way but they could have gone the other way as well. Mentions that he is feeling alright and he is quite close to bowling now, but he does not want to rush. Informs that they are playing with the same XI. Punjab (Unchanged Playing XI) - Mayank Agarwal (C), Shikhar Dhawan, Jonny Bairstow, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Rishi Dhawan, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh, Sandeep Sharma. Gujarat (Unchanged Playing XI) - Wriddhiman Saha (WK), Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Hardik Pandya (C), David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Pradeep Sangwan, Alzarri Joseph, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammad Shami. TOSS - The coin goes up and lands in favour of Gujarat. Hardik Pandya lets out a big laugh but then surprises everyone with his decision. GUJARAT ELECT TO BAT! Pitch report - Graeme Smith is near the pitch and informs that one side of the ground has a very big hit. Regarding the pitch, he feels that it is a much better surface with an even covering of grass. Adds that the ball will come onto the bat better, and we can expect good stroke-making. The South African opines that the captain winning the toss will stick to bowling first. The last time these two sides met, we witnessed an absolute nail-biter and we can expect the same today. Which team will come out on top? We will find out. Stay tuned for more updates... Punjab, on the other hand, are having yet another inconsistent season. They do have a strong team on paper but they have just not been able to click yet. They have managed to win just 1 out of their last four games and will be hoping to change things around before it gets too late for them. Gujarat seem like a formidable unit. They are making winning a habit now and have outplayed most of their opponents in their inaugural Indian T20 League season and it appears nothing can stop them at the moment. If their top order fails to perform, players like Rashid Khan, David Miller, and Rahul Tewatia put their hands up and guide them to victory. They will want to carry on in the same way and continue their winning streak. Hello and a warm welcome, folks to match number 48 of the Indian T20 League between Gujarat and Punjab at the Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy. The two sides are at the opposite ends of the points table. Gujarat are comfortably stationed at the top of the table, while Punjab are languishing in the bottom half with just 8 points by their name. Can they revive their fortunes starting this evening? ...

Ben Stokes has the drive and celebrity wattage to revive the pulse of Test cricket | Barney Ronay Read more “At the end of the day, the most important thing for me is winning. I want to be a part of a team that has that real mentality and isn’t going to take a backward step. And the most important people to deliver that message to is the guys in the changing room.” His own first steps as captain will be taken with the assistance of Root, who will remain in the team as a specialist batter. “Joe can help take the added pressures that come with the captaincy off my shoulders,” Stokes said. “I’m going to be using him going forward, especially in my first few months because of how long he did the role for and how good he was doing it. I’ll be learning from Joe about things to keep on top of and also things that he maybe thought he could have done better as well. “It’s naive and stupid to think that now because I’m captain my way is the only way and no one else has a voice or an input. I feel that’s one thing that a leader needs to do – always make sure that the other people around them feel valued and have a voice. It’s one thing I did against West Indies at Southampton [in his one previous match as captain, in July 2020]. I’ll be using that and not just thinking I can do everything.” The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Stokes also dispelled concerns about his own mental fortitude, insisting that the four-month break from cricket he took last summer ended with him stronger than ever. “I’ve read what’s been said about me taking a break and then taking this role on,” he said. “There’s always a negative feeling around it, but I took my break, I spoke to a bunch of people and I will continue to do that. I see it as a positive that I’m in this role having gone through what I went through last summer and even before that. “I’ve got a huge amount of experience in what the game and what life can throw at you. So I don’t see any of this as a negative whatsoever – I just see it as a huge positive that I’ve got experience of a lot of different scenarios.”","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd963bbd2d9a77019a79e73876e02829bd0f845/0_47_3997_2399/master/3997.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ebf8768ac137edf707fb8704360757f6","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BCCI secretary Jay Shah meets Shane Warne's younger brother Jason Warne","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/bcci-secretary-jay-shah-meets-shane-warne-s-younger-brother-jason-warne-122050300553_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary met legendary Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne's younger brother Jason Warne and recalled Warnie's contribution to world cricket, specially IPL.Jason Warne called on Jay Shah at his residence.Shah said in a tweet that Warne had left a rich legacy behind.\"It was lovely to meet and host Jason Warne, Shane Warne's younger brother at home.
