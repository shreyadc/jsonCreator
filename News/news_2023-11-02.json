Mr. Abeysekera, better known as ‘Uncle Percy’ passed away on Monday at the age of 87. He was the original cheerleader and the mascot of the Sri Lanka national team for many decades, standing with the team through thick and thin. Sharma visited him at his home in September while he was in the island to play the Asia Cup along with few other Indian players to look into his well-being. “It's a sad loss, sad loss to the cricketing fraternity because in my eyes, he was the number one supporter of cricket at that point in time,” Sharma responded when asked about uncle Percy. “I was lucky to get an opportunity to meet him in Sri Lanka during the Asia Cup. He's been such a great fan of cricket. Of course, Sri Lankan team but he's probably the first ever fan that I met, who was so genuine and the support towards the players was fantastic to see. When I first went to Sri Lanka in 2006 for the U19 World Cup, he was there, but I was a little boy. I had no idea about how things work outside the cricket field. But when I went with the Indian team for the first time in 2008, I saw him for the first time. I saw how passionate he was. I got lucky as well to meet his family, his son, his grandson, their family is very sweet, I went with a few of my team members as well,” Sharma added.","pubDate":"2023-11-01 23:19:38","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_f4ceec556d.png","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"32a717d31ec494c7f808b6e56be62d3a","title":"India start favourite in 2011 final rematch","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/top-story-02/India-start-favourite-in-2011-final-rematch/317-270427","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The last time India and Sri Lanka met at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai was on April 2, 2011.

It was the World Cup final. With just four runs needed off 11 balls, a thunderous wallop from MS Dhoni off Nuwan Kulasekara flew over long-on into the crowd as India recorded the highest run-chase in World Cup history and beat Sri Lanka by six wickets, lifting the trophy. The two seats where the six landed are preserved with a special stand depicting two replicas of the trophy against the backdrop of a photograph of the jubilant Indian team with the cup. It was heartbreak for the Sri Lankans who had put themselves in a strong position with an excellent century from Mahela Jayawardena. A meticulous chase however saw India send billions across the country into a state of frenzied joy by winning after 28 long years. The two teams will meet again at the Wankhede 4,537 days later, with India firmly in place for a semi-final spot in the 2023 edition of the Men’s Cricket World Cup and Sri Lanka just praying to survive the match. Despite winning only two games out of six, Sri Lanka are hanging on by a thread in the tournament. A defeat here will decide their fate, although they still have Bangladesh and New Zealand to play. However, two back-to-back wins against Netherlands and England, the ICC World Cup defending champions, gave Sri Lankans a sense of belief that they were back on track. It was short-lived. They crashed to a humiliating seven-wicket defeat against Afghanistan in Pune, further diminishing their chances. Add to this Sri Lanka’s horrendous record against India in ODIs. They have lost all of their last five ODI encounters against India, including a 10-wicket thrashing at the Asia Cup final in Colombo. What was expected to be an exciting finale, turned out to be an anticlimax as Mohammed Siraj (6-21) singlehandedly demolished Sri Lanka in the blink of an eye to bowl them out for 50 runs; their second lowest ODI score. India, so far, has an unblemished record in the tournament. They won all six matches including a convincing win over defending champions England in their sixth game of the tournament. They sit at the top of the points table and a win here will confirm their place in the semis. Sri Lanka’s roller-coaster ride is primarily due to inconsistency across all departments. They have performed well in patches but a lack of dependable performances has put their campaign in jeopardy. The top-order, Pathum Nissanka and Sadeera Samarawickrama, in particular, have been in excellent form. But Sri Lanka’s nagging problems with its middle order have continued to hurt them badly. Charith Asalanka and Dhananjaya de Silva have been pale shadows of themselves, contributing to Sri Lanka’s lacklustre campaign. In fact, Sri Lanka might bench de Silva and replace him with either left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage or wrist spinner Dushan Hemantha for today’s game. Wellalage enjoyed rare success against India on a turning pitch in Colombo, claiming his best bowling figures of 5-40 in an Asia Cup Super-Fours match. If picked, whether he can enjoy similar success on the batting paradise of Wankhede remains to be seen. Samarawickrema has had two stitches on his right index finger after hurting it again while attempting a catch during the Afghanistan game. He sustained a cut during the England game while batting but team sources confirmed he will play today. With Dushmantha Chameera reporting a tight muscle during the Afghan game, Sri Lanka brought in Pramod Madushan as the travelling reserve. The good news is that Chameera is now fit enough to play. He was seen at the nets, first with the bat, before sweating it out bowling for a while. The hosts have been particularly impressive when bowling first as their star-studded batting unit has chased down targets with ease. Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Siraj, Mohammed Shami, Kuldip Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja have formed a lethal bowling attack and have taken 56 out of a possible 60 wickets in the six games. India have not really been tested so far in the tournament and have been clinical batting second as they won five of their games chasing. Virat Kohli, the chase-master, and skipper Sharma have been in their best form but the concern still is the fitness of Hardik Pandya, the allrounder. His replacement, Mohammed Shami, has been excellent with nine wickets in two games, but India will love to have Pandya in the side, given his all-round ability. Sri Lanka possible XI: Pathum Nissanka, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kusal Mendis (c & wk), Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Dhananjaya de Silva/Dunith Wellalage/Dushan Hemantha, Angelo Mathews, Maheesh Theekshana, Kasun Rajitha, Dilshan Madushanka, Dushmantha Chameera. India World Cup squad: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ishan Kishan (wk), Suryakumar Yadav","pubDate":"2023-11-01 23:19:38","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_f366e19acc.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"2d90a2fcdc59b59cf690b0d95b6ee71d","title":"De Kock, Van der Dussen centuries help South Africa thrash New Zealand","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket-news/De-Kock--Van-der-Dussen-centuries-help-South-Africa-thrash-New-Zealand/320-270428","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Quinton de Kock hit his fourth century of the World Cup while Rassie van der Dussen cracked his second as South Africa thrashed New Zealand by 190 runs on Wednesday to take a step closer to the semi-finals.","content":"Quinton de Kock hit his fourth century of the World Cup while Rassie van der Dussen cracked his second as South Africa thrashed New Zealand by 190 runs on Wednesday to take a step closer to the semi-finals. The Proteas' commanding 357-4 was built on De Kock's 114 and Van der Dussen's 133. New Zealand, just days from only narrowly falling short chasing 389 in a five-run defeat by Australia, collapsed to 190 all out with more than 14 overs left in Pune. Marco Jansen (3-31) and his fellow South Africa fast bowlers ripped through the top order -- still without the injured Kane Williamson -- as New Zealand slumped to 67-4. Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj (4-46) then strengthened South Africa's grip on the game as the Black Caps collapsed to 110-8. Glenn Phillips made a defiant 60 but the game had long been over as a contest by the time he was last man out. Victory, which ended South Africa's run of five straight World Cup defeats by New Zealand since 1999, left the Proteas, bidding for a first one-day international World Cup title, virtually assured of a semi-final spot. \"Quinny played brilliantly,\" said Van der Dussen afterwards. \"They (New Zealand) did well to keep a lid on us for large part of the innings, but we knew if Quinny and I could take it deep we could get momentum on our side.\" New Zealand's third loss of the tournament was a blow to their hopes of reaching the last four as they slipped to fourth in the table with eight points, two ahead of Pakistan as well as Afghanistan who have a game in hand. \"It's important we reflect on this one quickly and go into the next game with a positive mind, you don't become a bad team overnight,\" said New Zealand captain Tom Latham. By opting to field upon winning the toss, Latham played into South Africa's strength. He defended his call by saying: \"You expect yourself to perform at your best, but those two (De Kock and Van der Dussen) played fantastically well.\" Left-handed opener De Kock reached his 21st ODI ton off 103 balls with eight fours and three sixes. He brought up his century with a huge six off Jimmy Neesham. \"I'm feeling really good lately. It's nice that everything is coming together at an important time for us,\" said De Kock, who plans to quit ODI cricket after this tournament, at the innings break. He added: \"My career is coming down to a finish, I'm trying to bat as much as I can.\" De Kock also made 100 against Sri Lanka, 109 in the game with Australia and 174 in the victory over Bangladesh. He started the day needing just 69 more runs to pass 500 for the tournament and broke through that barrier with a legside boundary off recalled paceman Tim Southee. He was eventually out for 114 caught by Phillips off Southee, ending a 200-run partnership for the second wicket. Van der Dussen maintained the assault with 133 off 118 balls, including nine fours and five sixes. It was his second hundred of the tournament after his 108 against Sri Lanka and sixth of his ODI career. Southee clean bowled Van der Dussen in the 48th over. David Miller added a blistering 53 off just 30 balls with four sixes, while Aiden Markram arrivied at the wicket for the last ball which he smashed for six. New Zealand used seven bowlers after seamer Matt Henry suffered a hamstring injury and left the field midway through his sixth over.

That didn't exactly go to plan. Things look bleak for the Red Devils at the moment. Newcastle showed up and bossed the tie with a much-changed side of their own. 22:12 FT: Man United 0 - 3 Newcastle 22:07 , 90 ' Four minutes added on 22:05 , 86 ' Scores of empty seats at Old Trafford And you can't blame them. Where do United and Ten Hag go from here? 21:59 , 81 ' Newcastle caution Joelinton gets a yellow card for a shove. 21:56 United players are losing their heads Reguilon and Amrabat go into the referee's book after poor tackles. 21:54 , 75 ' That would have been the icing on the cake! Longstaff cracked an unbelievable half volley from 30 yards that looked in from the moment it left his foot. But it wasn't. Some strike it would have been. 21:52 , 74 ' Newcastle changes Trippier and Burn come on Hall and Ritchie 21:51 , 72 ' Great chance for Fernandes The Unted skipper ran in between two Newcastle centre back and tried to scoop a finish over Dubravka but put his effort wide of the mark. 21:47 , 69 ' Mount's shot sums United up The England midfielder blasted an effort high over the bar from about 35 yards. It's a sorry state of affairs for the home side right now. The changes have done little to spark action. 21:42 , 63 ' Man United changes Fernandes, Hojlund and Rashford come on for Martial, Hannibal and Garnacho 21:41 , 63 ' Newcastle changes Gordon and Willock come off for Wilson and Guimaraes 21:40 , 60 ' Sucker punch from the Magpies Amrabat is dispossessed by Joelinton before the Brazilian played in Willock who strode through the United defence and unleashed a fierce drive that flashed past Onana. Just as United threatened to start a comeback, Newcastle showed their class. 21:37 , 60 ' GOAL! Man United 0 - 3 Newcastle (Willock) 21:37 , 60 ' Pressure continues to build on the Newcastle goal A United goal looks like it's coming. Eddie Howe is looking to his bench for a change that could turn the tide. 21:34 , 56 ' Antony fires high and wide The Brazilian shows off his quality in the move's early stages with a wonderful pass and turn but Antony's poor decision-making led to a wayward effort that had no chance of troubling the Newcastle goal. 21:32 , 53 ' United searching for a goal The level of urgency has certainly increased in United's play, The home team have been far better with both substitutes making an impact but Newcastle have remained solid so far. Amrabat had the most recent chance for United with a shot that curled high over Dubravka's goal. 21:27 , 47 ' United nearly find a route back Nice play from Wan-Bissaka and Antony leads to the ball coming into the box for Martial. But the Frenchman was well defended and on the stretch so could only get a toe onto the cross. United got themselves a corner for their efforts in a start that will bring some hope to the Old Trafford faithful. 21:23 , 46 ' Newcastle caution Willock gets himself in the book after chasing down Amrabat. 21:22 , 45 ' Second-half underway Newcastle kick things off in the second period. 21:22 Ten Hag makes changes Casemiro and Dalot are replaced by Amrabat and Wan-Bissaka. Ten Hag has decided to keep Hannibal on the pitch. We'll see if he is made to regret that decision. 21:20 Latest from the other Carabao Cup matches West Ham 3 - 0 Arsenal Chelsea 2 - 0 Blackburn ROvers Bournemouth 1 - 2 Liverpool Everton 2 - 0 Burnley Ipswich Town 0 - 2 Fulham 21:11 Newcastle pile on the United misery Well, that was something. Boos rang out around Old Traffiord as the half-time whistle blew. Ten Hag stern-faced and United's star studden subs bench forlorn. A much-changed Newcastle have been brilliant and the young fullbacks Livramento and Hall have shown why the Magpies shelled out so much money over the summer to get them. But United looked just as bad as they did against City, maybe worse. The likes of Mount, Martial and Antony - who were hoping stake a claim for a starting bert - have shown nothing. Changes will have to come at the break. 21:06 HT: Man United 0 - 2 Newcastle 21:04 , 48 ' Mount with a shot from range Mount takes the oppurtunity to have a long range effort this time. His fizzing strike was hit with power but Dubravka was more than equal to the attemot. 21:03 , 46 ' Dalot goes close The defender had a go from 25 yards but unlikely his stunner against Sheffield United this one went wide. The frustration on the United player's faces is evident. A goal before the break would do wonders. 21:01 , 45 ' Five added minutes 20:58 , 40 ' Effort from Willock Newcastle are enjoying themselves at the moment. The former Arsenal midfielder cut inside after recieving the ball and tried to curl an effort into the top corner from 25 yards. Onana was able to gather on this ocassion but a third looks likely. 20:54 , 35 ' A spectacular finish from Hall The youngster volleys his first senior goal from the edge of the area after tidy play between Almiron and Willock on the left flank. United were caught out from a quickly taken Newcastle free-kick and were made to pay. 20:52 , 35 ' GOAL! Man United 0 - 2 Newcastle (Hall) 20:51 'Sacked in the morning chants' The chant rings out around Old Trafford. It's not a happy time right now for the United boss Erik ten Hag. 20:49 , 30 ' Mount nearly scores an immediate equaliser United were sparked into action and had some joy down the left flank again. Garnacho found Mount sliding in but his effort went wide of the mark. 20:46 , 28 ' A super Newcastle counter Newcastle finally get a counter attack right. Tino Livramento takes the ball off Garnacho before going on a lung bursting run down the field when he pass finds on the on-rushing Almiron. The winger's first touch was good enough and he kept his cool to fire past Onana for the opener. 20:44 , 28 ' GOAL! Man United 0 - 1 Newcastle (Almiron) 20:41 , 25 ' Newcastle take control Newcastle have emerged as the dominant side in the first 25 minutes of the game. Man United have shown energy in attack but are being carved open when possession has been lost. If Newcastle get a counter right then they'll be in with a chance to strike on goal. 20:38 , 21 ' Wayward shot from Ritchie Joelinton nipped infront of Mount on a stray United throw-in which presented the long shot oppurtunity to the veteran. But Ritchie's effort sailed ay over Onana's goal. 20:36 , 18 ' United Caution Casemiro gets a yellow after halting a promising Newcastle attack. The Brazilian brought down Willock as he strode into the final third. Two of the home side's midfielders are now walking a tightrope. 20:34 , 16 ' Hannibal lucky to stay on The youngster is involved in another challenge, this time on Kraft. Hannibal is lucky to still be on the pitch as he was late in the tackle on the Newcastle defender's ankle. 20:32 , 15 ' A bit of pressure from Newcastle Matt Ritchie's free-kick caused a few problems in the United area, forcing Lindelof to clear for the first corner kick of the game. 20:31 , 13 ' United caution Hannibal is shown a yellow card for a needless foul after the ball had gone. 20:30 , 12 ' First chance of the game Man United get their reward for hunting down Newcastle on the left wing before Garnacho fired a pass into the box to Antony. After struggling to get the ball under control the winger found his countryman Casemiro who fired a shot that was comfortable for Dubravka to claim. 20:27 , 9 ' Hall denies Antony's nutmeg A rare bit of excitment came from the Brazilian winger who attemted to ut the ball through the legs of the young defender. Hall stood strong and cleared, averting a potentially dangerous United attack. 20:23 , 6 ' A slow start to the game The early injury to Targett has contributed to the stuttering start of the game. Both teams are trying to gain control but have mustered only a handful of passes before possesion lost or a foul is committed. 20:19 , 2 ' Magpies forced into an early change Newcastle's injury woes continue as Matt Targett makes it only a minute into the game. The defender grabbed the back of his right leg after challenging for a ball with Anthony Martial. Almiron is getting ready to replace him. 20:16 Here we go! Man United get us underway at Old Trafford. 20:10 Latest from across the other Carabao Cup ties West Ham 1 - 0 Arsenal Chelsea 0 - 0 Blackburn Rovers Bournemouth 0 - 0 Liverpool Everton 1 - 0 Burnley Ipswich Town 0 - 1 Fulham The draw for the quarter-finals will take place after the conclusion of the game at Old Trafford. 20:07 Magpies finish up their pre-match preparations Newcastle youngster Lewis Hall is set to make just his second start for the away side since his move from Chelsea in the summer.

It’s important to Newcastle because Eddie Howe has been brought into the club and they have invested into the team to win trophies,' he told Sky Sports. 'I was there for 12 years and I was reminded every year that it’s another year without a trophy.' 19:45 United players are out for their warm up Casemiro captains the home side tonight on his return to the starting line-up after injury. They'll need his big game expeience to navigate the tricky tie. 19:40 Where is Varane? The most notable omission from United's match day squad is Raphael Varane. The veteran defender, who has struggled with injuries, may have not bee fit to feature tonight. But after beig benched for the Manchester derby he was expected to play some part. 19:33 Ten Hag tells players 'there is no point feeling sorry for ourselves' Erik Ten Hag says his players must handle the pressure of being at Manchester United as he backed them to rebound from an embarrassing defeat in the Old Trafford derby.

The Red Devils caimed a 2-0 victory in last season's Carabao Cup final at Wembley. Newcastle won the last meeting of the teams in the Premier League in April. United haven't lost at home to today's opponents since 2013 when Yohan Cabaye's effort handed the Magpies a 1-0 win. 18:58 Man United's kit farce As revealed by Mail Sport, United players have been wearing replica items of their kit as the Adidas gear has been too tight for them. The kitwear company are now looking into a solution after complaints from some of Erik ten Hag ’s team. 18:52 Howe will Eddie manage his squad? Newcastle's last two results, a Champions League defeat to Dortmund and a league draw with Wolves, point to a side coming to grips with the rigours of a midweek schedule. As a result, Eddie Howe will likely heavily rotate his side as he did in the last round against Manchester City. The likes of Tino Livramento, Lewis Hall and Joe Willock could all feature for the Magpies. 18:46 Rumblings of disharmony between the dressing room and the manager make a result in this game crucial for Ten Hag Manchester United players fear head coach Erik ten Hag ’s abrupt approach is affecting squad harmony.

That's all for our coverage of the Carabao Cup tonight, we hope you enjoyed it! Until next time! 21:48 FULL-TIME Bournemouth 1-2 Liverpool Chelsea 2-0 Blackburn Everton 3-0 Burnley Ipswich 1-3 Fulham 21:40 GOAL: Everton 3-0 Burnley Game. Set. Match. The Toffees secure their hat in the next round as Ashley Young gets in between two defenders to finish from close-range after some fantastic work by Beto. 21:30 FULL-TIME: West Ham 3-1 Arsenal The Hammers advance to the quarter-finals in comfortable fashion. A Ben White own-goal opened the scoring before Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen ensured a derby delight for David Moyes' side. For Arsenal, it's a night to forget as their 30-year wait for League Cup glory continues. 21:25 GOAL: West Ham 3-1 Arsenal Martin Odegaard gets a consolation for the Gunners in the dying second with a low strike into the bottom corner. 21:16 GOAL: Bournemouth 1-2 Liverpool What. A. Goal. Darwin Nunez completely miscontrols a long ball but makes up for it by cutting in from the left and unleashing a powerful striker which beats Radu. The Bournemouth goalkeeper had absoloutely no chance! 21:09 GOAL: Bournemouth 1-1 Liverpool A corner falls all the way to the unmarked Justin Kuilvert at the backpost and he makes no mistake with a close-range header. 21:03 GOAL: Everton 2-0 Burnley The Toffees double their lead as Tarkowski heads it into the patch of Onana, who finishes from close range. 20:55 Double change for Arsenal Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli come on for Reiss Nelson and Leandro Trossard. 20:50 GOAL: West Ham 3-0 Arsenal It's game over, surely! White heads away a cross but it falls to Bowen, who unleashes a shot which takes a few deflections before beating Ramsdale. 20:47 Rice comes on Just as I said that, Rice comes in to replace Jorginho. He recieves a round of applause (mixed with some boos) from the home supporters. Zinchenko also goes off to be replaces by Tomiyasu. 20:45 Arsenal struggling The Gunners look short on ideas as Jorginho overhits a pass towards Trossard. You feel it won't be long until Arteta makes come changes. 20:39 GOAL: West Ham 2-0 Arsenal The Hammers double their lead! Aguerd finds Kudus with a brilliant long ball. The Ghanian cuts into the box with his first touch before firing into the bottom corner. Magical! 20:36 Half-time The whistle blows for half-time at Chelsea, Bournemouth, Everton and Ipswich. 20:35 CLOSE! Straight from kick-off the hosts almost double their lead. Paqueta slips in Bowen, who dinks the ball over Ramsdale. The Arsenal goalkeeper palms it towards his own goal but White is there to clear the ball away. 20:33 Kick-off Arsenal get us back underway at the London Stadium. Could we be in for some derama in this second-half? 20:31 West Ham's goal There's no VAR in use tonight and former Arsenal striker Alan Smith believes West Ham's goal should not have stood Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: 'It was delivered into a good area but there’s no doubt Aaron Ramsdale was impeded. 'I thought it was unusual that he was backtracking towards his own goal when the cross was whipped in. It was an awkward position he found himself in. No VAR so don’t know what they would’ve made of that.' 20:18 HALFTIME: West Ham 1-0 Arsenal David Moyes' side have one foot into the quarter-finals after a miserable week. Ben White's own-goal is the difference at the break. 20:17 GOAL: Chelsea 1-0 Blackburn The Blues take the lead at Stamford bridge as Badiashille sidefoots it in after some questiuionable goakkeeping by goalkeeper Wahlstedt. 20:17 GOAL: Bournemouth 0-1 Liverpool It's a bit off a scrappy one but Liverpool will not care one bit. Bournemouth clear away a corner towards the path of Elliott, who drills a shot which is saved by Radu before Gakpo pounces to get it over the line. 20:15 Liverpool go close The Reds put together a fantastic move down the right before Szoboszlai fires in a cross which Elliott gets on the end of. But his shot is held by Bournemouth goalkeeper Radu. 20:10 Nketiah goes close It's probably Arsenal's best chance of the game. Trossard finds Zinchenko on the left, he fizzles in a cross which Nketiah hooks over the bar from eight yards out. 20:04 GOAL: Everton 1-0 Burnley Tarkowski haunts his former club as he rises high to head into the bottom corner after a deep cross into the box by McNeil. 20:03 Not Havertz's night It's just not clicking for the German so far tonight. He rises high for an inswinging corner from Vieira, but his header rolls wide of the post. 19:59 GOAL: Ipswich 0-1 Fulham Fulham take the lead ahainst the in-form Championship outfit as Harry Wilson rounds goalkeeper Christian Walton before rolling the ball into the net. 19:56 Fabianski tips it away Ben white gets a head onto a free-kick as he looks to redeem himself but Fabianski tips it over. Nketiah's header from the resulting corner lands on the roof of the net. Close! 19:53 Arsenal enjoy possession The visitors have upped the tempo since conceding. The ball has fallen to Kai Havertz in dangerous areas but it's just not coming off for him at the moment. He has scored just one goal in 15 apperances so far... 19:47 GOAL: West Ham 1-0 Arsenal The Hammers take the lead against the run of play thanks to some luck. Bowen whips in a corner from the right side and Ben White heads it into his own goal. 19:47 Action gets underway elsewhere The ties at Chelsea, Bournemouth, Everton and Ipswich are all underway. 19:41 Save by Fabianski First proper sign of danger from Arsenal as Havertz is brought down by Alvarez on the left side. Reiss Nelson delivers the free-kick and Havertz flicks a header which Fabianski palms over. 19:36 Early signs of danger from West Ham The Hammers manage to get past Arsenal's high press and come forward with Paqueta. But the Brazilian overhits a simple through ball to Bowen. 19:34 Arsenal dominate the ball Unsuprisingly, it's the visitors who are enjoying the lion's share of possession. But it's all in front of a deep West Ham block at the moment. 19:31 KICK-OFF: Underway at the London Stadium It's the hosts who get us underway in what should be an intrguing encounter. 19:25 Kick-off approaching Both sets of players have cimpleted their warmups and we're now just five minutes away from kick-off at the London Stadium.

The hosts will take on Sri Lanka at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium on Thursday where a win will extend their unbeaten streak to seven and seal a semi-final spot. But concerns about air quality dominated news in the commercial capital of India, forcing the Board of Control for Cricket in India to take action. “BCCI is sensitive to environmental concerns. I took up the matter formally with the ICC (International Cricket Council) and there won’t be any fireworks display in Mumbai, which can add to the pollution level,” secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.” “The BCCI acknowledges the urgent concern surrounding air quality in both Mumbai and New Delhi. While we strive to host the World Cup in a manner befitting the celebration of cricket, we remain steadfast in our commitment to prioritising the health and safety of all our stakeholders.” According to India’s National Air Quality Index, air in Mumbai was “poor”, a ranking which it warns has the possible health impacts of “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure”, when the team started training at 18.30 local time. The concentration in Mumbai was four times above the recommended limit advised by the World Health Organisation. “I mean, in an ideal world, you don’t want a situation like this, but I’m pretty sure the concerned people are taking the necessary steps to avoid these kind of situations,” India captain Rohit Sharma said Wednesday. “It’s not ideal, everyone knows that. But obviously, looking at our future generation, your kids, my kids, obviously, it’s quite important that they get to live without any fear.” He added, “So, yeah, every time I get to speak outside of cricket, if we are not discussing cricket, I always talk about this, that you know we have to look after our future generation.”","pubDate":"2023-11-01 18:04:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","source_priority":1484530,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"342d27348bfdf742ec02a0ef4af71a59","title":"RMI Media Cricket League: Wins for PPC Panthers, Fighters & Cobras","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/rmi-media-cricket-league-wins-for-ppc-panthers-fighters-cobras/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"F.P.

The England and Wales Cricket Board has revamped its central contract system in a bid to ward off the growing threat from T20 franchises, handing out long-term deals for the first time in addition to the usual annual extensions. Wood was one of three players to sign a lucrative three-year term, having previously admitted that a huge offer to play in the United Arab Emirates was testing his resolve, with Joe Root and Harry Brook following suit. The ECB hoped to have agreements in place before the tournament in India but, while some were finalised swiftly, others dragged on into the campaign and the announcement was finally made last week. By then England had already played four times, losing three, and things have continued to veer off course, leaving the defending champions rock bottom in 10th place after six rounds. Wood does not believe the two issues are linked but acknowledges the timing of England’s unexpected dip in results has not been helpful. “I don’t think they were a distraction, no,” he said. “If we’re trying to look for excuses, I think players need to look at themselves a little bit more, me included. “But we’ve not lived up to that reward of the contract. I can understand people’s frustration. I would totally get that. “Obviously when lads are rewarded with things and then they don’t perform at the level that you think, that’s justified. But it’s not through lack of trying. We are trying our hardest to get this right. “There’s no cracks in the group. There’s no falling out. Everyone is generally trying to do it for each other. We believe in each other. It’s just not happening the way we want.” Wood was honest about his own status, insisting that turning out for his country remained his primary motivation while acknowledging the financial muscle being flexed by franchise owners. At 33, and with a long history of fitness issues behind him, he sought security and was pleased to see the ECB provide it. “My motivation has always been to play for England. That was always what I’ve wanted to do as a kid growing up. That’s the pinnacle for me, so I’m delighted with the deal,” he said. “I had some positive conversation with (ECB managing director of men’s cricket) Rob Key, to see if he wanted me to stay in the team or what he envisioned for me going forward with England. “He said that I was part of the plans and I’m obviously delighted to have signed three years. It gives me security for me and my family. “But I would definitely have had to consider (franchise offers), which is why I had lots of conversations with Keysy behind the scenes. “As an injury-prone lad, if I ever have trouble, I’ll be well looked after by England physios. “If you’re effectively self-employed, you go to these teams and say ‘Who wants me?’. But if I have a bad season or you get a bad injury, who then looks after you? So now I’m looked after by England and employed by England.” England’s next match sees them take on Australia in Ahmedabad on Saturday, a renewal of hostilities between the old rivals after a tense Ashes summer. Wood excelled for England in the series, helping inspire his side to a 2-2 draw after coming into the side 2-0 down. Australia head into the match as favourites given England’s recent struggles and their own strong form, but Wood is still hoping to shift the balance. “It’s completely different conditions, different players, different timing, different form (from the Ashes) but we’ve played against them for years,” he said. “In one-day cricket, we’ve done well against them in recent times. I don’t think they’ll be going into this game pooing their pants, but it’s up to us to change that.”","pubDate":"2023-11-01 18:01:32","image_url":"https://www.northwalespioneer.co.uk/resources/images/17397446/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"northwalespioneer","source_priority":1008924,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"034e48468ca987f4d1ab41b53b77267b","title":"Mark Wood insists contract talks were not distraction for England at World Cup","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23895882.mark-wood-insists-contract-talks-not-distraction-england-world-cup/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Wood was one of three players to sign a lucrative three-year term, having previously admitted being tempted by a lucrative offer to play in the UAE.","content":"Mark Wood has denied England were sidetracked by contract negotiations at the World Cup but admitted performances need to improve to live up to the new terms.

That’s the pinnacle for me, so I’m delighted with the deal,” he said. “I had some positive conversation with (ECB managing director of men’s cricket) Rob Key, to see if he wanted me to stay in the team or what he envisioned for me going forward with England. “He said that I was part of the plans and I’m obviously delighted to have signed three years. It gives me security for me and my family. “But I would definitely have had to consider (franchise offers), which is why I had lots of conversations with Keysy behind the scenes. “As an injury-prone lad, if I ever have trouble, I’ll be well looked after by England physios. “If you’re effectively self-employed, you go to these teams and say ‘Who wants me?’. But if I have a bad season or you get a bad injury, who then looks after you? So now I’m looked after by England and employed by England.” England’s next match sees them take on Australia in Ahmedabad on Saturday, a renewal of hostilities between the old rivals after a tense Ashes summer. Wood excelled for England in the series, helping inspire his side to a 2-2 draw after coming into the side 2-0 down. Australia head into the match as favourites given England’s recent struggles and their own strong form, but Wood is still hoping to shift the balance. “It’s completely different conditions, different players, different timing, different form (from the Ashes) but we’ve played against them for years,” he said. “In one-day cricket, we’ve done well against them in recent times. I don’t think they’ll be going into this game pooing their pants, but it’s up to us to change that.”","pubDate":"2023-11-01 18:01:32","image_url":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/resources/images/17397446/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesguardian","source_priority":1703505,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8097d2090b8699dcffa944691571f227","title":"Rohit Sharma pays tribute to â€™Uncle Percyâ€™","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/top-story-01/Rohit-Sharma-pays-tribute-to-â€™Uncle-Percyâ€™/316-270426","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ahead of meeting Sri Lanka in their next World Cup fixture, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma hailed Sri Lankaâ€™s legendary super-fan Mr. Percy Abeysekera as the first and the number one supporter of cricket.","content":"Ahead of meeting Sri Lanka in their next World Cup fixture, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma hailed Sri Lanka’s legendary super-fan Mr. Percy Abeysekera as the first and the number one supporter of cricket. Mr. Abeysekera, better known as ‘Uncle Percy’ passed away on Monday at the age of 87. He was the original cheerleader and the mascot of the Sri Lanka national team for many decades, standing with the team through thick and thin. Sharma visited him at his home in September while he was in the island to play the Asia Cup along with few other Indian players to look into his well-being. “It's a sad loss, sad loss to the cricketing fraternity because in my eyes, he was the number one supporter of cricket at that point in time,” Sharma responded when asked about uncle Percy. “I was lucky to get an opportunity to meet him in Sri Lanka during the Asia Cup. He's been such a great fan of cricket. Of course, Sri Lankan team but he's probably the first ever fan that I met, who was so genuine and the support towards the players was fantastic to see. When I first went to Sri Lanka in 2006 for the U19 World Cup, he was there, but I was a little boy. I had no idea about how things work outside the cricket field. But when I went with the Indian team for the first time in 2008, I saw him for the first time. I saw how passionate he was. I got lucky as well to meet his family, his son, his grandson, their family is very sweet, I went with a few of my team members as well,” Sharma added.","pubDate":"2023-11-01 23:19:38","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_f4ceec556d.png","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"32a717d31ec494c7f808b6e56be62d3a","title":"India start favourite in 2011 final rematch","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/top-story-02/India-start-favourite-in-2011-final-rematch/317-270427","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The last time India and Sri Lanka met at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai was on April 2, 2011.

It was the World Cup final. With just four runs needed off 11 balls, a thunderous wallop from MS Dhoni off Nuwan Kulasekara flew over long-on into the crowd as India recorded the highest run-chase in World Cup history and beat Sri Lanka by six wickets, lifting the trophy. The two seats where the six landed are preserved with a special stand depicting two replicas of the trophy against the backdrop of a photograph of the jubilant Indian team with the cup. It was heartbreak for the Sri Lankans who had put themselves in a strong position with an excellent century from Mahela Jayawardena. A meticulous chase however saw India send billions across the country into a state of frenzied joy by winning after 28 long years. The two teams will meet again at the Wankhede 4,537 days later, with India firmly in place for a semi-final spot in the 2023 edition of the Men’s Cricket World Cup and Sri Lanka just praying to survive the match. Despite winning only two games out of six, Sri Lanka are hanging on by a thread in the tournament. A defeat here will decide their fate, although they still have Bangladesh and New Zealand to play. However, two back-to-back wins against Netherlands and England, the ICC World Cup defending champions, gave Sri Lankans a sense of belief that they were back on track. It was short-lived. They crashed to a humiliating seven-wicket defeat against Afghanistan in Pune, further diminishing their chances. Add to this Sri Lanka’s horrendous record against India in ODIs. They have lost all of their last five ODI encounters against India, including a 10-wicket thrashing at the Asia Cup final in Colombo. What was expected to be an exciting finale, turned out to be an anticlimax as Mohammed Siraj (6-21) singlehandedly demolished Sri Lanka in the blink of an eye to bowl them out for 50 runs; their second lowest ODI score. India, so far, has an unblemished record in the tournament. They won all six matches including a convincing win over defending champions England in their sixth game of the tournament. They sit at the top of the points table and a win here will confirm their place in the semis. Sri Lanka’s roller-coaster ride is primarily due to inconsistency across all departments. They have performed well in patches but a lack of dependable performances has put their campaign in jeopardy. The top-order, Pathum Nissanka and Sadeera Samarawickrama, in particular, have been in excellent form. But Sri Lanka’s nagging problems with its middle order have continued to hurt them badly. Charith Asalanka and Dhananjaya de Silva have been pale shadows of themselves, contributing to Sri Lanka’s lacklustre campaign. In fact, Sri Lanka might bench de Silva and replace him with either left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage or wrist spinner Dushan Hemantha for today’s game. Wellalage enjoyed rare success against India on a turning pitch in Colombo, claiming his best bowling figures of 5-40 in an Asia Cup Super-Fours match. If picked, whether he can enjoy similar success on the batting paradise of Wankhede remains to be seen. Samarawickrema has had two stitches on his right index finger after hurting it again while attempting a catch during the Afghanistan game. He sustained a cut during the England game while batting but team sources confirmed he will play today. With Dushmantha Chameera reporting a tight muscle during the Afghan game, Sri Lanka brought in Pramod Madushan as the travelling reserve. The good news is that Chameera is now fit enough to play. He was seen at the nets, first with the bat, before sweating it out bowling for a while. The hosts have been particularly impressive when bowling first as their star-studded batting unit has chased down targets with ease. Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Siraj, Mohammed Shami, Kuldip Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja have formed a lethal bowling attack and have taken 56 out of a possible 60 wickets in the six games. India have not really been tested so far in the tournament and have been clinical batting second as they won five of their games chasing. Virat Kohli, the chase-master, and skipper Sharma have been in their best form but the concern still is the fitness of Hardik Pandya, the allrounder. His replacement, Mohammed Shami, has been excellent with nine wickets in two games, but India will love to have Pandya in the side, given his all-round ability. Sri Lanka possible XI: Pathum Nissanka, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kusal Mendis (c & wk), Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Dhananjaya de Silva/Dunith Wellalage/Dushan Hemantha, Angelo Mathews, Maheesh Theekshana, Kasun Rajitha, Dilshan Madushanka, Dushmantha Chameera. India World Cup squad: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ishan Kishan (wk), Suryakumar Yadav","pubDate":"2023-11-01 23:19:38","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_f366e19acc.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"2d90a2fcdc59b59cf690b0d95b6ee71d","title":"De Kock, Van der Dussen centuries help South Africa thrash New Zealand","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket-news/De-Kock--Van-der-Dussen-centuries-help-South-Africa-thrash-New-Zealand/320-270428","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Quinton de Kock hit his fourth century of the World Cup while Rassie van der Dussen cracked his second as South Africa thrashed New Zealand by 190 runs on Wednesday to take a step closer to the semi-finals.","content":"Quinton de Kock hit his fourth century of the World Cup while Rassie van der Dussen cracked his second as South Africa thrashed New Zealand by 190 runs on Wednesday to take a step closer to the semi-finals. The Proteas' commanding 357-4 was built on De Kock's 114 and Van der Dussen's 133. New Zealand, just days from only narrowly falling short chasing 389 in a five-run defeat by Australia, collapsed to 190 all out with more than 14 overs left in Pune. Marco Jansen (3-31) and his fellow South Africa fast bowlers ripped through the top order -- still without the injured Kane Williamson -- as New Zealand slumped to 67-4. Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj (4-46) then strengthened South Africa's grip on the game as the Black Caps collapsed to 110-8. Glenn Phillips made a defiant 60 but the game had long been over as a contest by the time he was last man out. Victory, which ended South Africa's run of five straight World Cup defeats by New Zealand since 1999, left the Proteas, bidding for a first one-day international World Cup title, virtually assured of a semi-final spot. \"Quinny played brilliantly,\" said Van der Dussen afterwards. \"They (New Zealand) did well to keep a lid on us for large part of the innings, but we knew if Quinny and I could take it deep we could get momentum on our side.\" New Zealand's third loss of the tournament was a blow to their hopes of reaching the last four as they slipped to fourth in the table with eight points, two ahead of Pakistan as well as Afghanistan who have a game in hand. \"It's important we reflect on this one quickly and go into the next game with a positive mind, you don't become a bad team overnight,\" said New Zealand captain Tom Latham. By opting to field upon winning the toss, Latham played into South Africa's strength. He defended his call by saying: \"You expect yourself to perform at your best, but those two (De Kock and Van der Dussen) played fantastically well.\" Left-handed opener De Kock reached his 21st ODI ton off 103 balls with eight fours and three sixes. He brought up his century with a huge six off Jimmy Neesham. \"I'm feeling really good lately. It's nice that everything is coming together at an important time for us,\" said De Kock, who plans to quit ODI cricket after this tournament, at the innings break. He added: \"My career is coming down to a finish, I'm trying to bat as much as I can.\" De Kock also made 100 against Sri Lanka, 109 in the game with Australia and 174 in the victory over Bangladesh. He started the day needing just 69 more runs to pass 500 for the tournament and broke through that barrier with a legside boundary off recalled paceman Tim Southee. He was eventually out for 114 caught by Phillips off Southee, ending a 200-run partnership for the second wicket. Van der Dussen maintained the assault with 133 off 118 balls, including nine fours and five sixes. It was his second hundred of the tournament after his 108 against Sri Lanka and sixth of his ODI career. Southee clean bowled Van der Dussen in the 48th over. David Miller added a blistering 53 off just 30 balls with four sixes, while Aiden Markram arrivied at the wicket for the last ball which he smashed for six. New Zealand used seven bowlers after seamer Matt Henry suffered a hamstring injury and left the field midway through his sixth over.

That didn't exactly go to plan. Things look bleak for the Red Devils at the moment. Newcastle showed up and bossed the tie with a much-changed side of their own. 22:12 FT: Man United 0 - 3 Newcastle 22:07 , 90 ' Four minutes added on 22:05 , 86 ' Scores of empty seats at Old Trafford And you can't blame them. Where do United and Ten Hag go from here? 21:59 , 81 ' Newcastle caution Joelinton gets a yellow card for a shove. 21:56 United players are losing their heads Reguilon and Amrabat go into the referee's book after poor tackles. 21:54 , 75 ' That would have been the icing on the cake! Longstaff cracked an unbelievable half volley from 30 yards that looked in from the moment it left his foot. But it wasn't. Some strike it would have been. 21:52 , 74 ' Newcastle changes Trippier and Burn come on Hall and Ritchie 21:51 , 72 ' Great chance for Fernandes The Unted skipper ran in between two Newcastle centre back and tried to scoop a finish over Dubravka but put his effort wide of the mark. 21:47 , 69 ' Mount's shot sums United up The England midfielder blasted an effort high over the bar from about 35 yards. It's a sorry state of affairs for the home side right now. The changes have done little to spark action. 21:42 , 63 ' Man United changes Fernandes, Hojlund and Rashford come on for Martial, Hannibal and Garnacho 21:41 , 63 ' Newcastle changes Gordon and Willock come off for Wilson and Guimaraes 21:40 , 60 ' Sucker punch from the Magpies Amrabat is dispossessed by Joelinton before the Brazilian played in Willock who strode through the United defence and unleashed a fierce drive that flashed past Onana. Just as United threatened to start a comeback, Newcastle showed their class. 21:37 , 60 ' GOAL! Man United 0 - 3 Newcastle (Willock) 21:37 , 60 ' Pressure continues to build on the Newcastle goal A United goal looks like it's coming. Eddie Howe is looking to his bench for a change that could turn the tide. 21:34 , 56 ' Antony fires high and wide The Brazilian shows off his quality in the move's early stages with a wonderful pass and turn but Antony's poor decision-making led to a wayward effort that had no chance of troubling the Newcastle goal. 21:32 , 53 ' United searching for a goal The level of urgency has certainly increased in United's play, The home team have been far better with both substitutes making an impact but Newcastle have remained solid so far. Amrabat had the most recent chance for United with a shot that curled high over Dubravka's goal. 21:27 , 47 ' United nearly find a route back Nice play from Wan-Bissaka and Antony leads to the ball coming into the box for Martial. But the Frenchman was well defended and on the stretch so could only get a toe onto the cross. United got themselves a corner for their efforts in a start that will bring some hope to the Old Trafford faithful. 21:23 , 46 ' Newcastle caution Willock gets himself in the book after chasing down Amrabat. 21:22 , 45 ' Second-half underway Newcastle kick things off in the second period. 21:22 Ten Hag makes changes Casemiro and Dalot are replaced by Amrabat and Wan-Bissaka. Ten Hag has decided to keep Hannibal on the pitch. We'll see if he is made to regret that decision. 21:20 Latest from the other Carabao Cup matches West Ham 3 - 0 Arsenal Chelsea 2 - 0 Blackburn ROvers Bournemouth 1 - 2 Liverpool Everton 2 - 0 Burnley Ipswich Town 0 - 2 Fulham 21:11 Newcastle pile on the United misery Well, that was something. Boos rang out around Old Traffiord as the half-time whistle blew. Ten Hag stern-faced and United's star studden subs bench forlorn. A much-changed Newcastle have been brilliant and the young fullbacks Livramento and Hall have shown why the Magpies shelled out so much money over the summer to get them. But United looked just as bad as they did against City, maybe worse. The likes of Mount, Martial and Antony - who were hoping stake a claim for a starting bert - have shown nothing. Changes will have to come at the break. 21:06 HT: Man United 0 - 2 Newcastle 21:04 , 48 ' Mount with a shot from range Mount takes the oppurtunity to have a long range effort this time. His fizzing strike was hit with power but Dubravka was more than equal to the attemot. 21:03 , 46 ' Dalot goes close The defender had a go from 25 yards but unlikely his stunner against Sheffield United this one went wide. The frustration on the United player's faces is evident. A goal before the break would do wonders. 21:01 , 45 ' Five added minutes 20:58 , 40 ' Effort from Willock Newcastle are enjoying themselves at the moment. The former Arsenal midfielder cut inside after recieving the ball and tried to curl an effort into the top corner from 25 yards. Onana was able to gather on this ocassion but a third looks likely. 20:54 , 35 ' A spectacular finish from Hall The youngster volleys his first senior goal from the edge of the area after tidy play between Almiron and Willock on the left flank. United were caught out from a quickly taken Newcastle free-kick and were made to pay. 20:52 , 35 ' GOAL! Man United 0 - 2 Newcastle (Hall) 20:51 'Sacked in the morning chants' The chant rings out around Old Trafford. It's not a happy time right now for the United boss Erik ten Hag. 20:49 , 30 ' Mount nearly scores an immediate equaliser United were sparked into action and had some joy down the left flank again. Garnacho found Mount sliding in but his effort went wide of the mark. 20:46 , 28 ' A super Newcastle counter Newcastle finally get a counter attack right. Tino Livramento takes the ball off Garnacho before going on a lung bursting run down the field when he pass finds on the on-rushing Almiron. The winger's first touch was good enough and he kept his cool to fire past Onana for the opener. 20:44 , 28 ' GOAL! Man United 0 - 1 Newcastle (Almiron) 20:41 , 25 ' Newcastle take control Newcastle have emerged as the dominant side in the first 25 minutes of the game. Man United have shown energy in attack but are being carved open when possession has been lost. If Newcastle get a counter right then they'll be in with a chance to strike on goal. 20:38 , 21 ' Wayward shot from Ritchie Joelinton nipped infront of Mount on a stray United throw-in which presented the long shot oppurtunity to the veteran. But Ritchie's effort sailed ay over Onana's goal. 20:36 , 18 ' United Caution Casemiro gets a yellow after halting a promising Newcastle attack. The Brazilian brought down Willock as he strode into the final third. Two of the home side's midfielders are now walking a tightrope. 20:34 , 16 ' Hannibal lucky to stay on The youngster is involved in another challenge, this time on Kraft. Hannibal is lucky to still be on the pitch as he was late in the tackle on the Newcastle defender's ankle. 20:32 , 15 ' A bit of pressure from Newcastle Matt Ritchie's free-kick caused a few problems in the United area, forcing Lindelof to clear for the first corner kick of the game. 20:31 , 13 ' United caution Hannibal is shown a yellow card for a needless foul after the ball had gone. 20:30 , 12 ' First chance of the game Man United get their reward for hunting down Newcastle on the left wing before Garnacho fired a pass into the box to Antony. After struggling to get the ball under control the winger found his countryman Casemiro who fired a shot that was comfortable for Dubravka to claim. 20:27 , 9 ' Hall denies Antony's nutmeg A rare bit of excitment came from the Brazilian winger who attemted to ut the ball through the legs of the young defender. Hall stood strong and cleared, averting a potentially dangerous United attack. 20:23 , 6 ' A slow start to the game The early injury to Targett has contributed to the stuttering start of the game. Both teams are trying to gain control but have mustered only a handful of passes before possesion lost or a foul is committed. 20:19 , 2 ' Magpies forced into an early change Newcastle's injury woes continue as Matt Targett makes it only a minute into the game. The defender grabbed the back of his right leg after challenging for a ball with Anthony Martial. Almiron is getting ready to replace him. 20:16 Here we go! Man United get us underway at Old Trafford. 20:10 Latest from across the other Carabao Cup ties West Ham 1 - 0 Arsenal Chelsea 0 - 0 Blackburn Rovers Bournemouth 0 - 0 Liverpool Everton 1 - 0 Burnley Ipswich Town 0 - 1 Fulham The draw for the quarter-finals will take place after the conclusion of the game at Old Trafford. 20:07 Magpies finish up their pre-match preparations Newcastle youngster Lewis Hall is set to make just his second start for the away side since his move from Chelsea in the summer.

It’s important to Newcastle because Eddie Howe has been brought into the club and they have invested into the team to win trophies,' he told Sky Sports. 'I was there for 12 years and I was reminded every year that it’s another year without a trophy.' 19:45 United players are out for their warm up Casemiro captains the home side tonight on his return to the starting line-up after injury. They'll need his big game expeience to navigate the tricky tie. 19:40 Where is Varane? The most notable omission from United's match day squad is Raphael Varane. The veteran defender, who has struggled with injuries, may have not bee fit to feature tonight. But after beig benched for the Manchester derby he was expected to play some part. 19:33 Ten Hag tells players 'there is no point feeling sorry for ourselves' Erik Ten Hag says his players must handle the pressure of being at Manchester United as he backed them to rebound from an embarrassing defeat in the Old Trafford derby.

The Red Devils caimed a 2-0 victory in last season's Carabao Cup final at Wembley. Newcastle won the last meeting of the teams in the Premier League in April. United haven't lost at home to today's opponents since 2013 when Yohan Cabaye's effort handed the Magpies a 1-0 win. 18:58 Man United's kit farce As revealed by Mail Sport, United players have been wearing replica items of their kit as the Adidas gear has been too tight for them. The kitwear company are now looking into a solution after complaints from some of Erik ten Hag ’s team. 18:52 Howe will Eddie manage his squad? Newcastle's last two results, a Champions League defeat to Dortmund and a league draw with Wolves, point to a side coming to grips with the rigours of a midweek schedule. As a result, Eddie Howe will likely heavily rotate his side as he did in the last round against Manchester City. The likes of Tino Livramento, Lewis Hall and Joe Willock could all feature for the Magpies. 18:46 Rumblings of disharmony between the dressing room and the manager make a result in this game crucial for Ten Hag Manchester United players fear head coach Erik ten Hag ’s abrupt approach is affecting squad harmony.

That's all for our coverage of the Carabao Cup tonight, we hope you enjoyed it! Until next time! 21:48 FULL-TIME Bournemouth 1-2 Liverpool Chelsea 2-0 Blackburn Everton 3-0 Burnley Ipswich 1-3 Fulham 21:40 GOAL: Everton 3-0 Burnley Game. Set. Match. The Toffees secure their hat in the next round as Ashley Young gets in between two defenders to finish from close-range after some fantastic work by Beto. 21:30 FULL-TIME: West Ham 3-1 Arsenal The Hammers advance to the quarter-finals in comfortable fashion. A Ben White own-goal opened the scoring before Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen ensured a derby delight for David Moyes' side. For Arsenal, it's a night to forget as their 30-year wait for League Cup glory continues. 21:25 GOAL: West Ham 3-1 Arsenal Martin Odegaard gets a consolation for the Gunners in the dying second with a low strike into the bottom corner. 21:16 GOAL: Bournemouth 1-2 Liverpool What. A. Goal. Darwin Nunez completely miscontrols a long ball but makes up for it by cutting in from the left and unleashing a powerful striker which beats Radu. The Bournemouth goalkeeper had absoloutely no chance! 21:09 GOAL: Bournemouth 1-1 Liverpool A corner falls all the way to the unmarked Justin Kuilvert at the backpost and he makes no mistake with a close-range header. 21:03 GOAL: Everton 2-0 Burnley The Toffees double their lead as Tarkowski heads it into the patch of Onana, who finishes from close range. 20:55 Double change for Arsenal Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli come on for Reiss Nelson and Leandro Trossard. 20:50 GOAL: West Ham 3-0 Arsenal It's game over, surely! White heads away a cross but it falls to Bowen, who unleashes a shot which takes a few deflections before beating Ramsdale. 20:47 Rice comes on Just as I said that, Rice comes in to replace Jorginho. He recieves a round of applause (mixed with some boos) from the home supporters. Zinchenko also goes off to be replaces by Tomiyasu. 20:45 Arsenal struggling The Gunners look short on ideas as Jorginho overhits a pass towards Trossard. You feel it won't be long until Arteta makes come changes. 20:39 GOAL: West Ham 2-0 Arsenal The Hammers double their lead! Aguerd finds Kudus with a brilliant long ball. The Ghanian cuts into the box with his first touch before firing into the bottom corner. Magical! 20:36 Half-time The whistle blows for half-time at Chelsea, Bournemouth, Everton and Ipswich. 20:35 CLOSE! Straight from kick-off the hosts almost double their lead. Paqueta slips in Bowen, who dinks the ball over Ramsdale. The Arsenal goalkeeper palms it towards his own goal but White is there to clear the ball away. 20:33 Kick-off Arsenal get us back underway at the London Stadium. Could we be in for some derama in this second-half? 20:31 West Ham's goal There's no VAR in use tonight and former Arsenal striker Alan Smith believes West Ham's goal should not have stood Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: 'It was delivered into a good area but there’s no doubt Aaron Ramsdale was impeded. 'I thought it was unusual that he was backtracking towards his own goal when the cross was whipped in. It was an awkward position he found himself in. No VAR so don’t know what they would’ve made of that.' 20:18 HALFTIME: West Ham 1-0 Arsenal David Moyes' side have one foot into the quarter-finals after a miserable week. Ben White's own-goal is the difference at the break. 20:17 GOAL: Chelsea 1-0 Blackburn The Blues take the lead at Stamford bridge as Badiashille sidefoots it in after some questiuionable goakkeeping by goalkeeper Wahlstedt. 20:17 GOAL: Bournemouth 0-1 Liverpool It's a bit off a scrappy one but Liverpool will not care one bit. Bournemouth clear away a corner towards the path of Elliott, who drills a shot which is saved by Radu before Gakpo pounces to get it over the line. 20:15 Liverpool go close The Reds put together a fantastic move down the right before Szoboszlai fires in a cross which Elliott gets on the end of. But his shot is held by Bournemouth goalkeeper Radu. 20:10 Nketiah goes close It's probably Arsenal's best chance of the game. Trossard finds Zinchenko on the left, he fizzles in a cross which Nketiah hooks over the bar from eight yards out. 20:04 GOAL: Everton 1-0 Burnley Tarkowski haunts his former club as he rises high to head into the bottom corner after a deep cross into the box by McNeil. 20:03 Not Havertz's night It's just not clicking for the German so far tonight. He rises high for an inswinging corner from Vieira, but his header rolls wide of the post. 19:59 GOAL: Ipswich 0-1 Fulham Fulham take the lead ahainst the in-form Championship outfit as Harry Wilson rounds goalkeeper Christian Walton before rolling the ball into the net. 19:56 Fabianski tips it away Ben white gets a head onto a free-kick as he looks to redeem himself but Fabianski tips it over. Nketiah's header from the resulting corner lands on the roof of the net. Close! 19:53 Arsenal enjoy possession The visitors have upped the tempo since conceding. The ball has fallen to Kai Havertz in dangerous areas but it's just not coming off for him at the moment. He has scored just one goal in 15 apperances so far... 19:47 GOAL: West Ham 1-0 Arsenal The Hammers take the lead against the run of play thanks to some luck. Bowen whips in a corner from the right side and Ben White heads it into his own goal. 19:47 Action gets underway elsewhere The ties at Chelsea, Bournemouth, Everton and Ipswich are all underway. 19:41 Save by Fabianski First proper sign of danger from Arsenal as Havertz is brought down by Alvarez on the left side. Reiss Nelson delivers the free-kick and Havertz flicks a header which Fabianski palms over. 19:36 Early signs of danger from West Ham The Hammers manage to get past Arsenal's high press and come forward with Paqueta. But the Brazilian overhits a simple through ball to Bowen. 19:34 Arsenal dominate the ball Unsuprisingly, it's the visitors who are enjoying the lion's share of possession. But it's all in front of a deep West Ham block at the moment. 19:31 KICK-OFF: Underway at the London Stadium It's the hosts who get us underway in what should be an intrguing encounter. 19:25 Kick-off approaching Both sets of players have cimpleted their warmups and we're now just five minutes away from kick-off at the London Stadium.

The hosts will take on Sri Lanka at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium on Thursday where a win will extend their unbeaten streak to seven and seal a semi-final spot. But concerns about air quality dominated news in the commercial capital of India, forcing the Board of Control for Cricket in India to take action. “BCCI is sensitive to environmental concerns. I took up the matter formally with the ICC (International Cricket Council) and there won’t be any fireworks display in Mumbai, which can add to the pollution level,” secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.” “The BCCI acknowledges the urgent concern surrounding air quality in both Mumbai and New Delhi. While we strive to host the World Cup in a manner befitting the celebration of cricket, we remain steadfast in our commitment to prioritising the health and safety of all our stakeholders.” According to India’s National Air Quality Index, air in Mumbai was “poor”, a ranking which it warns has the possible health impacts of “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure”, when the team started training at 18.30 local time. The concentration in Mumbai was four times above the recommended limit advised by the World Health Organisation. “I mean, in an ideal world, you don’t want a situation like this, but I’m pretty sure the concerned people are taking the necessary steps to avoid these kind of situations,” India captain Rohit Sharma said Wednesday. “It’s not ideal, everyone knows that. But obviously, looking at our future generation, your kids, my kids, obviously, it’s quite important that they get to live without any fear.” He added, “So, yeah, every time I get to speak outside of cricket, if we are not discussing cricket, I always talk about this, that you know we have to look after our future generation.”","pubDate":"2023-11-01 18:04:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","source_priority":1484530,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"342d27348bfdf742ec02a0ef4af71a59","title":"RMI Media Cricket League: Wins for PPC Panthers, Fighters & Cobras","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/rmi-media-cricket-league-wins-for-ppc-panthers-fighters-cobras/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"F.P.

The England and Wales Cricket Board has revamped its central contract system in a bid to ward off the growing threat from T20 franchises, handing out long-term deals for the first time in addition to the usual annual extensions. Wood was one of three players to sign a lucrative three-year term, having previously admitted that a huge offer to play in the United Arab Emirates was testing his resolve, with Joe Root and Harry Brook following suit. The ECB hoped to have agreements in place before the tournament in India but, while some were finalised swiftly, others dragged on into the campaign and the announcement was finally made last week. By then England had already played four times, losing three, and things have continued to veer off course, leaving the defending champions rock bottom in 10th place after six rounds. Wood does not believe the two issues are linked but acknowledges the timing of England’s unexpected dip in results has not been helpful. “I don’t think they were a distraction, no,” he said. “If we’re trying to look for excuses, I think players need to look at themselves a little bit more, me included. “But we’ve not lived up to that reward of the contract. I can understand people’s frustration. I would totally get that. “Obviously when lads are rewarded with things and then they don’t perform at the level that you think, that’s justified. But it’s not through lack of trying. We are trying our hardest to get this right. “There’s no cracks in the group. There’s no falling out. Everyone is generally trying to do it for each other. We believe in each other. It’s just not happening the way we want.” Wood was honest about his own status, insisting that turning out for his country remained his primary motivation while acknowledging the financial muscle being flexed by franchise owners. At 33, and with a long history of fitness issues behind him, he sought security and was pleased to see the ECB provide it. “My motivation has always been to play for England. That was always what I’ve wanted to do as a kid growing up. That’s the pinnacle for me, so I’m delighted with the deal,” he said. “I had some positive conversation with (ECB managing director of men’s cricket) Rob Key, to see if he wanted me to stay in the team or what he envisioned for me going forward with England. “He said that I was part of the plans and I’m obviously delighted to have signed three years. It gives me security for me and my family. “But I would definitely have had to consider (franchise offers), which is why I had lots of conversations with Keysy behind the scenes. “As an injury-prone lad, if I ever have trouble, I’ll be well looked after by England physios. “If you’re effectively self-employed, you go to these teams and say ‘Who wants me?’. But if I have a bad season or you get a bad injury, who then looks after you? So now I’m looked after by England and employed by England.” England’s next match sees them take on Australia in Ahmedabad on Saturday, a renewal of hostilities between the old rivals after a tense Ashes summer. Wood excelled for England in the series, helping inspire his side to a 2-2 draw after coming into the side 2-0 down. Australia head into the match as favourites given England’s recent struggles and their own strong form, but Wood is still hoping to shift the balance. “It’s completely different conditions, different players, different timing, different form (from the Ashes) but we’ve played against them for years,” he said. “In one-day cricket, we’ve done well against them in recent times. I don’t think they’ll be going into this game pooing their pants, but it’s up to us to change that.”","pubDate":"2023-11-01 18:01:32","image_url":"https://www.northwalespioneer.co.uk/resources/images/17397446/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"northwalespioneer","source_priority":1008924,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"034e48468ca987f4d1ab41b53b77267b","title":"Mark Wood insists contract talks were not distraction for England at World Cup","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23895882.mark-wood-insists-contract-talks-not-distraction-england-world-cup/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Wood was one of three players to sign a lucrative three-year term, having previously admitted being tempted by a lucrative offer to play in the UAE.","content":"Mark Wood has denied England were sidetracked by contract negotiations at the World Cup but admitted performances need to improve to live up to the new terms.

The ECB hoped to have agreements in place before the tournament in India but, while some were finalised swiftly, others dragged on into the campaign and the announcement was finally made last week. By then England had already played four times, losing three, and things have continued to veer off course, leaving the defending champions rock bottom in 10th place after six rounds. Wood does not believe the two issues are linked but acknowledges the timing of England’s unexpected dip in results has not been helpful. “I don’t think they were a distraction, no,” he said. “If we’re trying to look for excuses, I think players need to look at themselves a little bit more, me included. “But we’ve not lived up to that reward of the contract. I can understand people’s frustration. I would totally get that. “Obviously when lads are rewarded with things and then they don’t perform at the level that you think, that’s justified. But it’s not through lack of trying. We are trying our hardest to get this right. “There’s no cracks in the group. There’s no falling out. Everyone is generally trying to do it for each other. We believe in each other. It’s just not happening the way we want.” Wood was honest about his own status, insisting that turning out for his country remained his primary motivation while acknowledging the financial muscle being flexed by franchise owners. At 33, and with a long history of fitness issues behind him, he sought security and was pleased to see the ECB provide it. “My motivation has always been to play for England. That was always what I’ve wanted to do as a kid growing up. That’s the pinnacle for me, so I’m delighted with the deal,” he said. “I had some positive conversation with (ECB managing director of men’s cricket) Rob Key, to see if he wanted me to stay in the team or what he envisioned for me going forward with England. “He said that I was part of the plans and I’m obviously delighted to have signed three years. It gives me security for me and my family. “But I would definitely have had to consider (franchise offers), which is why I had lots of conversations with Keysy behind the scenes. “As an injury-prone lad, if I ever have trouble, I’ll be well looked after by England physios. “If you’re effectively self-employed, you go to these teams and say ‘Who wants me?’. But if I have a bad season or you get a bad injury, who then looks after you? So now I’m looked after by England and employed by England.” England’s next match sees them take on Australia in Ahmedabad on Saturday, a renewal of hostilities between the old rivals after a tense Ashes summer. Wood excelled for England in the series, helping inspire his side to a 2-2 draw after coming into the side 2-0 down. Australia head into the match as favourites given England’s recent struggles and their own strong form, but Wood is still hoping to shift the balance. “It’s completely different conditions, different players, different timing, different form (from the Ashes) but we’ve played against them for years,” he said. “In one-day cricket, we’ve done well against them in recent times. I don’t think they’ll be going into this game pooing their pants, but it’s up to us to change that.”","pubDate":"2023-11-01 18:01:32","image_url":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/resources/images/17397446/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesguardian","source_priority":1703505,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8097d2090b8699dcffa944691571f227","title":"Rohit Sharma pays tribute to â€™Uncle Percyâ€™","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/top-story-01/Rohit-Sharma-pays-tribute-to-â€™Uncle-Percyâ€™/316-270426","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ahead of meeting Sri Lanka in their next World Cup fixture, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma hailed Sri Lankaâ€™s legendary super-fan Mr. Percy Abeysekera as the first and the number one supporter of cricket.","content":"Ahead of meeting Sri Lanka in their next World Cup fixture, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma hailed Sri Lanka’s legendary super-fan Mr. Percy Abeysekera as the first and the number one supporter of cricket. Mr. Abeysekera, better known as ‘Uncle Percy’ passed away on Monday at the age of 87. He was the original cheerleader and the mascot of the Sri Lanka national team for many decades, standing with the team through thick and thin. Sharma visited him at his home in September while he was in the island to play the Asia Cup along with few other Indian players to look into his well-being. “It's a sad loss, sad loss to the cricketing fraternity because in my eyes, he was the number one supporter of cricket at that point in time,” Sharma responded when asked about uncle Percy. “I was lucky to get an opportunity to meet him in Sri Lanka during the Asia Cup. He's been such a great fan of cricket. Of course, Sri Lankan team but he's probably the first ever fan that I met, who was so genuine and the support towards the players was fantastic to see. When I first went to Sri Lanka in 2006 for the U19 World Cup, he was there, but I was a little boy. I had no idea about how things work outside the cricket field. But when I went with the Indian team for the first time in 2008, I saw him for the first time. I saw how passionate he was. I got lucky as well to meet his family, his son, his grandson, their family is very sweet, I went with a few of my team members as well,” Sharma added.","pubDate":"2023-11-01 23:19:38","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_f4ceec556d.png","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"32a717d31ec494c7f808b6e56be62d3a","title":"India start favourite in 2011 final rematch","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/top-story-02/India-start-favourite-in-2011-final-rematch/317-270427","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The last time India and Sri Lanka met at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai was on April 2, 2011.

It was the World Cup final. With just four runs needed off 11 balls, a thunderous wallop from MS Dhoni off Nuwan Kulasekara flew over long-on into the crowd as India recorded the highest run-chase in World Cup history and beat Sri Lanka by six wickets, lifting the trophy. The two seats where the six landed are preserved with a special stand depicting two replicas of the trophy against the backdrop of a photograph of the jubilant Indian team with the cup. It was heartbreak for the Sri Lankans who had put themselves in a strong position with an excellent century from Mahela Jayawardena. A meticulous chase however saw India send billions across the country into a state of frenzied joy by winning after 28 long years. The two teams will meet again at the Wankhede 4,537 days later, with India firmly in place for a semi-final spot in the 2023 edition of the Men’s Cricket World Cup and Sri Lanka just praying to survive the match. Despite winning only two games out of six, Sri Lanka are hanging on by a thread in the tournament. A defeat here will decide their fate, although they still have Bangladesh and New Zealand to play. However, two back-to-back wins against Netherlands and England, the ICC World Cup defending champions, gave Sri Lankans a sense of belief that they were back on track. It was short-lived. They crashed to a humiliating seven-wicket defeat against Afghanistan in Pune, further diminishing their chances. Add to this Sri Lanka’s horrendous record against India in ODIs. They have lost all of their last five ODI encounters against India, including a 10-wicket thrashing at the Asia Cup final in Colombo. What was expected to be an exciting finale, turned out to be an anticlimax as Mohammed Siraj (6-21) singlehandedly demolished Sri Lanka in the blink of an eye to bowl them out for 50 runs; their second lowest ODI score. India, so far, has an unblemished record in the tournament. They won all six matches including a convincing win over defending champions England in their sixth game of the tournament. They sit at the top of the points table and a win here will confirm their place in the semis. Sri Lanka’s roller-coaster ride is primarily due to inconsistency across all departments. They have performed well in patches but a lack of dependable performances has put their campaign in jeopardy. The top-order, Pathum Nissanka and Sadeera Samarawickrama, in particular, have been in excellent form. But Sri Lanka’s nagging problems with its middle order have continued to hurt them badly. Charith Asalanka and Dhananjaya de Silva have been pale shadows of themselves, contributing to Sri Lanka’s lacklustre campaign. In fact, Sri Lanka might bench de Silva and replace him with either left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage or wrist spinner Dushan Hemantha for today’s game. Wellalage enjoyed rare success against India on a turning pitch in Colombo, claiming his best bowling figures of 5-40 in an Asia Cup Super-Fours match. If picked, whether he can enjoy similar success on the batting paradise of Wankhede remains to be seen. Samarawickrema has had two stitches on his right index finger after hurting it again while attempting a catch during the Afghanistan game. He sustained a cut during the England game while batting but team sources confirmed he will play today. With Dushmantha Chameera reporting a tight muscle during the Afghan game, Sri Lanka brought in Pramod Madushan as the travelling reserve. The good news is that Chameera is now fit enough to play. He was seen at the nets, first with the bat, before sweating it out bowling for a while. The hosts have been particularly impressive when bowling first as their star-studded batting unit has chased down targets with ease. Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Siraj, Mohammed Shami, Kuldip Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja have formed a lethal bowling attack and have taken 56 out of a possible 60 wickets in the six games. India have not really been tested so far in the tournament and have been clinical batting second as they won five of their games chasing. Virat Kohli, the chase-master, and skipper Sharma have been in their best form but the concern still is the fitness of Hardik Pandya, the allrounder. His replacement, Mohammed Shami, has been excellent with nine wickets in two games, but India will love to have Pandya in the side, given his all-round ability. Sri Lanka possible XI: Pathum Nissanka, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kusal Mendis (c & wk), Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Dhananjaya de Silva/Dunith Wellalage/Dushan Hemantha, Angelo Mathews, Maheesh Theekshana, Kasun Rajitha, Dilshan Madushanka, Dushmantha Chameera.

The Proteas' commanding 357-4 was built on De Kock's 114 and Van der Dussen's 133. New Zealand, just days from only narrowly falling short chasing 389 in a five-run defeat by Australia, collapsed to 190 all out with more than 14 overs left in Pune. Marco Jansen (3-31) and his fellow South Africa fast bowlers ripped through the top order -- still without the injured Kane Williamson -- as New Zealand slumped to 67-4. Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj (4-46) then strengthened South Africa's grip on the game as the Black Caps collapsed to 110-8. Glenn Phillips made a defiant 60 but the game had long been over as a contest by the time he was last man out. Victory, which ended South Africa's run of five straight World Cup defeats by New Zealand since 1999, left the Proteas, bidding for a first one-day international World Cup title, virtually assured of a semi-final spot. \"Quinny played brilliantly,\" said Van der Dussen afterwards. \"They (New Zealand) did well to keep a lid on us for large part of the innings, but we knew if Quinny and I could take it deep we could get momentum on our side.\" New Zealand's third loss of the tournament was a blow to their hopes of reaching the last four as they slipped to fourth in the table with eight points, two ahead of Pakistan as well as Afghanistan who have a game in hand. \"It's important we reflect on this one quickly and go into the next game with a positive mind, you don't become a bad team overnight,\" said New Zealand captain Tom Latham. By opting to field upon winning the toss, Latham played into South Africa's strength. He defended his call by saying: \"You expect yourself to perform at your best, but those two (De Kock and Van der Dussen) played fantastically well.\" Left-handed opener De Kock reached his 21st ODI ton off 103 balls with eight fours and three sixes. He brought up his century with a huge six off Jimmy Neesham. \"I'm feeling really good lately. It's nice that everything is coming together at an important time for us,\" said De Kock, who plans to quit ODI cricket after this tournament, at the innings break. He added: \"My career is coming down to a finish, I'm trying to bat as much as I can.\" De Kock also made 100 against Sri Lanka, 109 in the game with Australia and 174 in the victory over Bangladesh. He started the day needing just 69 more runs to pass 500 for the tournament and broke through that barrier with a legside boundary off recalled paceman Tim Southee. He was eventually out for 114 caught by Phillips off Southee, ending a 200-run partnership for the second wicket. Van der Dussen maintained the assault with 133 off 118 balls, including nine fours and five sixes. It was his second hundred of the tournament after his 108 against Sri Lanka and sixth of his ODI career. Southee clean bowled Van der Dussen in the 48th over. David Miller added a blistering 53 off just 30 balls with four sixes, while Aiden Markram arrivied at the wicket for the last ball which he smashed for six. New Zealand used seven bowlers after seamer Matt Henry suffered a hamstring injury and left the field midway through his sixth over.

That didn't exactly go to plan. Things look bleak for the Red Devils at the moment. Newcastle showed up and bossed the tie with a much-changed side of their own. 22:12 FT: Man United 0 - 3 Newcastle 22:07 , 90 ' Four minutes added on 22:05 , 86 ' Scores of empty seats at Old Trafford And you can't blame them. Where do United and Ten Hag go from here? 21:59 , 81 ' Newcastle caution Joelinton gets a yellow card for a shove. 21:56 United players are losing their heads Reguilon and Amrabat go into the referee's book after poor tackles. 21:54 , 75 ' That would have been the icing on the cake! Longstaff cracked an unbelievable half volley from 30 yards that looked in from the moment it left his foot. But it wasn't. Some strike it would have been. 21:52 , 74 ' Newcastle changes Trippier and Burn come on Hall and Ritchie 21:51 , 72 ' Great chance for Fernandes The Unted skipper ran in between two Newcastle centre back and tried to scoop a finish over Dubravka but put his effort wide of the mark. 21:47 , 69 ' Mount's shot sums United up The England midfielder blasted an effort high over the bar from about 35 yards. It's a sorry state of affairs for the home side right now. The changes have done little to spark action. 21:42 , 63 ' Man United changes Fernandes, Hojlund and Rashford come on for Martial, Hannibal and Garnacho 21:41 , 63 ' Newcastle changes Gordon and Willock come off for Wilson and Guimaraes 21:40 , 60 ' Sucker punch from the Magpies Amrabat is dispossessed by Joelinton before the Brazilian played in Willock who strode through the United defence and unleashed a fierce drive that flashed past Onana. Just as United threatened to start a comeback, Newcastle showed their class. 21:37 , 60 ' GOAL! Man United 0 - 3 Newcastle (Willock) 21:37 , 60 ' Pressure continues to build on the Newcastle goal A United goal looks like it's coming. Eddie Howe is looking to his bench for a change that could turn the tide. 21:34 , 56 ' Antony fires high and wide The Brazilian shows off his quality in the move's early stages with a wonderful pass and turn but Antony's poor decision-making led to a wayward effort that had no chance of troubling the Newcastle goal. 21:32 , 53 ' United searching for a goal The level of urgency has certainly increased in United's play, The home team have been far better with both substitutes making an impact but Newcastle have remained solid so far. Amrabat had the most recent chance for United with a shot that curled high over Dubravka's goal. 21:27 , 47 ' United nearly find a route back Nice play from Wan-Bissaka and Antony leads to the ball coming into the box for Martial. But the Frenchman was well defended and on the stretch so could only get a toe onto the cross. United got themselves a corner for their efforts in a start that will bring some hope to the Old Trafford faithful. 21:23 , 46 ' Newcastle caution Willock gets himself in the book after chasing down Amrabat. 21:22 , 45 ' Second-half underway Newcastle kick things off in the second period. 21:22 Ten Hag makes changes Casemiro and Dalot are replaced by Amrabat and Wan-Bissaka. Ten Hag has decided to keep Hannibal on the pitch. We'll see if he is made to regret that decision. 21:20 Latest from the other Carabao Cup matches West Ham 3 - 0 Arsenal Chelsea 2 - 0 Blackburn ROvers Bournemouth 1 - 2 Liverpool Everton 2 - 0 Burnley Ipswich Town 0 - 2 Fulham 21:11 Newcastle pile on the United misery Well, that was something. Boos rang out around Old Traffiord as the half-time whistle blew. Ten Hag stern-faced and United's star studden subs bench forlorn. A much-changed Newcastle have been brilliant and the young fullbacks Livramento and Hall have shown why the Magpies shelled out so much money over the summer to get them. But United looked just as bad as they did against City, maybe worse. The likes of Mount, Martial and Antony - who were hoping stake a claim for a starting bert - have shown nothing. Changes will have to come at the break. 21:06 HT: Man United 0 - 2 Newcastle 21:04 , 48 ' Mount with a shot from range Mount takes the oppurtunity to have a long range effort this time. His fizzing strike was hit with power but Dubravka was more than equal to the attemot. 21:03 , 46 ' Dalot goes close The defender had a go from 25 yards but unlikely his stunner against Sheffield United this one went wide. The frustration on the United player's faces is evident. A goal before the break would do wonders. 21:01 , 45 ' Five added minutes 20:58 , 40 ' Effort from Willock Newcastle are enjoying themselves at the moment. The former Arsenal midfielder cut inside after recieving the ball and tried to curl an effort into the top corner from 25 yards. Onana was able to gather on this ocassion but a third looks likely. 20:54 , 35 ' A spectacular finish from Hall The youngster volleys his first senior goal from the edge of the area after tidy play between Almiron and Willock on the left flank. United were caught out from a quickly taken Newcastle free-kick and were made to pay. 20:52 , 35 ' GOAL! Man United 0 - 2 Newcastle (Hall) 20:51 'Sacked in the morning chants' The chant rings out around Old Trafford. It's not a happy time right now for the United boss Erik ten Hag. 20:49 , 30 ' Mount nearly scores an immediate equaliser United were sparked into action and had some joy down the left flank again. Garnacho found Mount sliding in but his effort went wide of the mark. 20:46 , 28 ' A super Newcastle counter Newcastle finally get a counter attack right. Tino Livramento takes the ball off Garnacho before going on a lung bursting run down the field when he pass finds on the on-rushing Almiron. The winger's first touch was good enough and he kept his cool to fire past Onana for the opener. 20:44 , 28 ' GOAL! Man United 0 - 1 Newcastle (Almiron) 20:41 , 25 ' Newcastle take control Newcastle have emerged as the dominant side in the first 25 minutes of the game. Man United have shown energy in attack but are being carved open when possession has been lost. If Newcastle get a counter right then they'll be in with a chance to strike on goal. 20:38 , 21 ' Wayward shot from Ritchie Joelinton nipped infront of Mount on a stray United throw-in which presented the long shot oppurtunity to the veteran. But Ritchie's effort sailed ay over Onana's goal. 20:36 , 18 ' United Caution Casemiro gets a yellow after halting a promising Newcastle attack. The Brazilian brought down Willock as he strode into the final third. Two of the home side's midfielders are now walking a tightrope. 20:34 , 16 ' Hannibal lucky to stay on The youngster is involved in another challenge, this time on Kraft. Hannibal is lucky to still be on the pitch as he was late in the tackle on the Newcastle defender's ankle. 20:32 , 15 ' A bit of pressure from Newcastle Matt Ritchie's free-kick caused a few problems in the United area, forcing Lindelof to clear for the first corner kick of the game. 20:31 , 13 ' United caution Hannibal is shown a yellow card for a needless foul after the ball had gone. 20:30 , 12 ' First chance of the game Man United get their reward for hunting down Newcastle on the left wing before Garnacho fired a pass into the box to Antony. After struggling to get the ball under control the winger found his countryman Casemiro who fired a shot that was comfortable for Dubravka to claim. 20:27 , 9 ' Hall denies Antony's nutmeg A rare bit of excitment came from the Brazilian winger who attemted to ut the ball through the legs of the young defender. Hall stood strong and cleared, averting a potentially dangerous United attack. 20:23 , 6 ' A slow start to the game The early injury to Targett has contributed to the stuttering start of the game. Both teams are trying to gain control but have mustered only a handful of passes before possesion lost or a foul is committed. 20:19 , 2 ' Magpies forced into an early change Newcastle's injury woes continue as Matt Targett makes it only a minute into the game. The defender grabbed the back of his right leg after challenging for a ball with Anthony Martial. Almiron is getting ready to replace him. 20:16 Here we go! Man United get us underway at Old Trafford. 20:10 Latest from across the other Carabao Cup ties West Ham 1 - 0 Arsenal Chelsea 0 - 0 Blackburn Rovers Bournemouth 0 - 0 Liverpool Everton 1 - 0 Burnley Ipswich Town 0 - 1 Fulham The draw for the quarter-finals will take place after the conclusion of the game at Old Trafford. 20:07 Magpies finish up their pre-match preparations Newcastle youngster Lewis Hall is set to make just his second start for the away side since his move from Chelsea in the summer.

It’s important to Newcastle because Eddie Howe has been brought into the club and they have invested into the team to win trophies,' he told Sky Sports.

They'll need his big game expeience to navigate the tricky tie. 19:40 Where is Varane? The most notable omission from United's match day squad is Raphael Varane.

The kitwear company are now looking into a solution after complaints from some of Erik ten Hag ’s team. 18:52 Howe will Eddie manage his squad? Newcastle's last two results, a Champions League defeat to Dortmund and a league draw with Wolves, point to a side coming to grips with the rigours of a midweek schedule.

That's all for our coverage of the Carabao Cup tonight, we hope you enjoyed it! Until next time! 21:48 FULL-TIME Bournemouth 1-2 Liverpool Chelsea 2-0 Blackburn Everton 3-0 Burnley Ipswich 1-3 Fulham 21:40 GOAL: Everton 3-0 Burnley Game. Set. Match. The Toffees secure their hat in the next round as Ashley Young gets in between two defenders to finish from close-range after some fantastic work by Beto. 21:30 FULL-TIME: West Ham 3-1 Arsenal The Hammers advance to the quarter-finals in comfortable fashion. A Ben White own-goal opened the scoring before Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen ensured a derby delight for David Moyes' side. For Arsenal, it's a night to forget as their 30-year wait for League Cup glory continues. 21:25 GOAL: West Ham 3-1 Arsenal Martin Odegaard gets a consolation for the Gunners in the dying second with a low strike into the bottom corner. 21:16 GOAL: Bournemouth 1-2 Liverpool What. A. Goal. Darwin Nunez completely miscontrols a long ball but makes up for it by cutting in from the left and unleashing a powerful striker which beats Radu. The Bournemouth goalkeeper had absoloutely no chance! 21:09 GOAL: Bournemouth 1-1 Liverpool A corner falls all the way to the unmarked Justin Kuilvert at the backpost and he makes no mistake with a close-range header. 21:03 GOAL: Everton 2-0 Burnley The Toffees double their lead as Tarkowski heads it into the patch of Onana, who finishes from close range. 20:55 Double change for Arsenal Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli come on for Reiss Nelson and Leandro Trossard. 20:50 GOAL: West Ham 3-0 Arsenal It's game over, surely! White heads away a cross but it falls to Bowen, who unleashes a shot which takes a few deflections before beating Ramsdale. 20:47 Rice comes on Just as I said that, Rice comes in to replace Jorginho. He recieves a round of applause (mixed with some boos) from the home supporters. Zinchenko also goes off to be replaces by Tomiyasu. 20:45 Arsenal struggling The Gunners look short on ideas as Jorginho overhits a pass towards Trossard. You feel it won't be long until Arteta makes come changes. 20:39 GOAL: West Ham 2-0 Arsenal The Hammers double their lead! Aguerd finds Kudus with a brilliant long ball. The Ghanian cuts into the box with his first touch before firing into the bottom corner. Magical! 20:36 Half-time The whistle blows for half-time at Chelsea, Bournemouth, Everton and Ipswich. 20:35 CLOSE! Straight from kick-off the hosts almost double their lead. Paqueta slips in Bowen, who dinks the ball over Ramsdale. The Arsenal goalkeeper palms it towards his own goal but White is there to clear the ball away. 20:33 Kick-off Arsenal get us back underway at the London Stadium. Could we be in for some derama in this second-half? 20:31 West Ham's goal There's no VAR in use tonight and former Arsenal striker Alan Smith believes West Ham's goal should not have stood Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: 'It was delivered into a good area but there’s no doubt Aaron Ramsdale was impeded. 'I thought it was unusual that he was backtracking towards his own goal when the cross was whipped in. It was an awkward position he found himself in. No VAR so don’t know what they would’ve made of that.' 20:18 HALFTIME: West Ham 1-0 Arsenal David Moyes' side have one foot into the quarter-finals after a miserable week. Ben White's own-goal is the difference at the break. 20:17 GOAL: Chelsea 1-0 Blackburn The Blues take the lead at Stamford bridge as Badiashille sidefoots it in after some questiuionable goakkeeping by goalkeeper Wahlstedt. 20:17 GOAL: Bournemouth 0-1 Liverpool It's a bit off a scrappy one but Liverpool will not care one bit. Bournemouth clear away a corner towards the path of Elliott, who drills a shot which is saved by Radu before Gakpo pounces to get it over the line. 20:15 Liverpool go close The Reds put together a fantastic move down the right before Szoboszlai fires in a cross which Elliott gets on the end of. But his shot is held by Bournemouth goalkeeper Radu. 20:10 Nketiah goes close It's probably Arsenal's best chance of the game. Trossard finds Zinchenko on the left, he fizzles in a cross which Nketiah hooks over the bar from eight yards out. 20:04 GOAL: Everton 1-0 Burnley Tarkowski haunts his former club as he rises high to head into the bottom corner after a deep cross into the box by McNeil. 20:03 Not Havertz's night It's just not clicking for the German so far tonight. He rises high for an inswinging corner from Vieira, but his header rolls wide of the post. 19:59 GOAL: Ipswich 0-1 Fulham Fulham take the lead ahainst the in-form Championship outfit as Harry Wilson rounds goalkeeper Christian Walton before rolling the ball into the net. 19:56 Fabianski tips it away Ben white gets a head onto a free-kick as he looks to redeem himself but Fabianski tips it over. Nketiah's header from the resulting corner lands on the roof of the net. Close! 19:53 Arsenal enjoy possession The visitors have upped the tempo since conceding. The ball has fallen to Kai Havertz in dangerous areas but it's just not coming off for him at the moment. He has scored just one goal in 15 apperances so far... 19:47 GOAL: West Ham 1-0 Arsenal The Hammers take the lead against the run of play thanks to some luck. Bowen whips in a corner from the right side and Ben White heads it into his own goal. 19:47 Action gets underway elsewhere The ties at Chelsea, Bournemouth, Everton and Ipswich are all underway. 19:41 Save by Fabianski First proper sign of danger from Arsenal as Havertz is brought down by Alvarez on the left side. Reiss Nelson delivers the free-kick and Havertz flicks a header which Fabianski palms over. 19:36 Early signs of danger from West Ham The Hammers manage to get past Arsenal's high press and come forward with Paqueta. But the Brazilian overhits a simple through ball to Bowen. 19:34 Arsenal dominate the ball Unsuprisingly, it's the visitors who are enjoying the lion's share of possession. But it's all in front of a deep West Ham block at the moment. 19:31 KICK-OFF: Underway at the London Stadium It's the hosts who get us underway in what should be an intrguing encounter. 19:25 Kick-off approaching Both sets of players have cimpleted their warmups and we're now just five minutes away from kick-off at the London Stadium.

The hosts will take on Sri Lanka at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium on Thursday where a win will extend their unbeaten streak to seven and seal a semi-final spot. But concerns about air quality dominated news in the commercial capital of India, forcing the Board of Control for Cricket in India to take action. “BCCI is sensitive to environmental concerns. I took up the matter formally with the ICC (International Cricket Council) and there won’t be any fireworks display in Mumbai, which can add to the pollution level,” secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.” “The BCCI acknowledges the urgent concern surrounding air quality in both Mumbai and New Delhi. While we strive to host the World Cup in a manner befitting the celebration of cricket, we remain steadfast in our commitment to prioritising the health and safety of all our stakeholders.” According to India’s National Air Quality Index, air in Mumbai was “poor”, a ranking which it warns has the possible health impacts of “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure”, when the team started training at 18.30 local time. The concentration in Mumbai was four times above the recommended limit advised by the World Health Organisation. “I mean, in an ideal world, you don’t want a situation like this, but I’m pretty sure the concerned people are taking the necessary steps to avoid these kind of situations,” India captain Rohit Sharma said Wednesday. “It’s not ideal, everyone knows that. But obviously, looking at our future generation, your kids, my kids, obviously, it’s quite important that they get to live without any fear.” He added, “So, yeah, every time I get to speak outside of cricket, if we are not discussing cricket, I always talk about this, that you know we have to look after our future generation.”","pubDate":"2023-11-01 18:04:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","source_priority":1484530,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"342d27348bfdf742ec02a0ef4af71a59","title":"RMI Media Cricket League: Wins for PPC Panthers, Fighters & Cobras","link":"https://thefrontierpost.com/rmi-media-cricket-league-wins-for-ppc-panthers-fighters-cobras/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Frontier Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"F.P.

The England and Wales Cricket Board has revamped its central contract system in a bid to ward off the growing threat from T20 franchises, handing out long-term deals for the first time in addition to the usual annual extensions. Wood was one of three players to sign a lucrative three-year term, having previously admitted that a huge offer to play in the United Arab Emirates was testing his resolve, with Joe Root and Harry Brook following suit. The ECB hoped to have agreements in place before the tournament in India but, while some were finalised swiftly, others dragged on into the campaign and the announcement was finally made last week. By then England had already played four times, losing three, and things have continued to veer off course, leaving the defending champions rock bottom in 10th place after six rounds. Wood does not believe the two issues are linked but acknowledges the timing of England’s unexpected dip in results has not been helpful. “I don’t think they were a distraction, no,” he said. “If we’re trying to look for excuses, I think players need to look at themselves a little bit more, me included. “But we’ve not lived up to that reward of the contract. I can understand people’s frustration. I would totally get that. “Obviously when lads are rewarded with things and then they don’t perform at the level that you think, that’s justified. But it’s not through lack of trying. We are trying our hardest to get this right. “There’s no cracks in the group. There’s no falling out. Everyone is generally trying to do it for each other. We believe in each other. It’s just not happening the way we want.” Wood was honest about his own status, insisting that turning out for his country remained his primary motivation while acknowledging the financial muscle being flexed by franchise owners. At 33, and with a long history of fitness issues behind him, he sought security and was pleased to see the ECB provide it. “My motivation has always been to play for England. That was always what I’ve wanted to do as a kid growing up. That’s the pinnacle for me, so I’m delighted with the deal,” he said. “I had some positive conversation with (ECB managing director of men’s cricket) Rob Key, to see if he wanted me to stay in the team or what he envisioned for me going forward with England. “He said that I was part of the plans and I’m obviously delighted to have signed three years. It gives me security for me and my family. “But I would definitely have had to consider (franchise offers), which is why I had lots of conversations with Keysy behind the scenes. “As an injury-prone lad, if I ever have trouble, I’ll be well looked after by England physios. “If you’re effectively self-employed, you go to these teams and say ‘Who wants me?’. But if I have a bad season or you get a bad injury, who then looks after you? So now I’m looked after by England and employed by England.” England’s next match sees them take on Australia in Ahmedabad on Saturday, a renewal of hostilities between the old rivals after a tense Ashes summer. Wood excelled for England in the series, helping inspire his side to a 2-2 draw after coming into the side 2-0 down. Australia head into the match as favourites given England’s recent struggles and their own strong form, but Wood is still hoping to shift the balance. “It’s completely different conditions, different players, different timing, different form (from the Ashes) but we’ve played against them for years,” he said. “In one-day cricket, we’ve done well against them in recent times. I don’t think they’ll be going into this game pooing their pants, but it’s up to us to change that.”","pubDate":"2023-11-01 18:01:32","image_url":"https://www.northwalespioneer.co.uk/resources/images/17397446/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"northwalespioneer","source_priority":1008924,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"034e48468ca987f4d1ab41b53b77267b","title":"Mark Wood insists contract talks were not distraction for England at World Cup","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23895882.mark-wood-insists-contract-talks-not-distraction-england-world-cup/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Wood was one of three players to sign a lucrative three-year term, having previously admitted being tempted by a lucrative offer to play in the UAE.","content":"Mark Wood has denied England were sidetracked by contract negotiations at the World Cup but admitted performances need to improve to live up to the new terms.

The England and Wales Cricket Board has revamped its central contract system in a bid to ward off the growing threat from T20 franchises, handing out long-term deals for the first time in addition to the usual annual extensions. Wood was one of three players to sign a lucrative three-year term, having previously admitted that a huge offer to play in the United Arab Emirates was testing his resolve, with Joe Root and Harry Brook following suit. The ECB hoped to have agreements in place before the tournament in India but, while some were finalised swiftly, others dragged on into the campaign and the announcement was finally made last week. By then England had already played four times, losing three, and things have continued to veer off course, leaving the defending champions rock bottom in 10th place after six rounds. Wood does not believe the two issues are linked but acknowledges the timing of England’s unexpected dip in results has not been helpful. “I don’t think they were a distraction, no,” he said. “If we’re trying to look for excuses, I think players need to look at themselves a little bit more, me included. “But we’ve not lived up to that reward of the contract. I can understand people’s frustration. I would totally get that. “Obviously when lads are rewarded with things and then they don’t perform at the level that you think, that’s justified. But it’s not through lack of trying. We are trying our hardest to get this right. “There’s no cracks in the group. There’s no falling out. Everyone is generally trying to do it for each other. We believe in each other. It’s just not happening the way we want.” Wood was honest about his own status, insisting that turning out for his country remained his primary motivation while acknowledging the financial muscle being flexed by franchise owners. At 33, and with a long history of fitness issues behind him, he sought security and was pleased to see the ECB provide it. “My motivation has always been to play for England. That was always what I’ve wanted to do as a kid growing up. That’s the pinnacle for me, so I’m delighted with the deal,” he said. “I had some positive conversation with (ECB managing director of men’s cricket) Rob Key, to see if he wanted me to stay in the team or what he envisioned for me going forward with England. “He said that I was part of the plans and I’m obviously delighted to have signed three years. It gives me security for me and my family. “But I would definitely have had to consider (franchise offers), which is why I had lots of conversations with Keysy behind the scenes. “As an injury-prone lad, if I ever have trouble, I’ll be well looked after by England physios. “If you’re effectively self-employed, you go to these teams and say ‘Who wants me?’. But if I have a bad season or you get a bad injury, who then looks after you? So now I’m looked after by England and employed by England.” England’s next match sees them take on Australia in Ahmedabad on Saturday, a renewal of hostilities between the old rivals after a tense Ashes summer.
