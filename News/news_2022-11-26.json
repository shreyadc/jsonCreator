CA’s integrity unit investigated an alleged incident in the UAE in October 2018, which involved a heavy night of drinking between Whittaker – one of the most senior CA officials on tour - and another member of staff.It occurred at the Australian team hotel in Abu Dhabi, the night before Australia’s second Test against Pakistan.It was alleged Whittaker’s behaviour made the man feel uncomfortable and in the days following sent text messages allegedly pressuring the victim not to mention the night to anyone. News Corp understands that once an internal CA investigation was completed into what had taken place in Abu Dhabi, Whittaker was put on gardening leave by CA bosses for a number of weeks.Whittaker also provided a written apology to the member of staff before returning to work and was asked to delete a video taken on the night.A Cricket Australia spokesperson confirmed the investigation into Whittaker.“CA can confirm the Integrity Unit investigated an incident involving Tim Whittaker in 2018. As a result of the investigation, Whittaker was given a formal warning over both his conduct and excessive consumption of alcohol,” said the statement.“In relation to the two separate alleged incidents involving Whittaker that have led to sex assault charges, we have been supporting current and former staff members who have been affected directly and indirectly.“Cricket Australia has no tolerance for any form of abuse and is committed to ensuring a safe environment for all staff, participants and their families in all their interactions with the game.“These include Integrity Hotline and reporting channels and our Respect@Work policy. Our confidential Cricket Integrity Hotline can be contacted anytime on 1300 FAIR GAME (1300 3247 4263) or at fairgame@coreintegrity.com.au.”Whittaker’s absence was explained to members of staff and the media at the time as ‘burn out’ from his busy work schedule.News Corp does not allege Whittaker was a direct boss of the other man involved in the integrity unit investigation in the UAE in 2018.When Whittaker did return to work, CA did not separate him from the staffer who had made the complaint against him in the UAE, and they continued to cross paths in the same work environment at Test matches during the 2018-19 summer.Kevin Roberts was the Cricket Australia chief executive at the time but declined to comment when contacted by News Corp on Friday.By the end of that summer, Whittaker had accepted a job to go and work for the International Cricket Council in Dubai, and was farewelled at CA’s end-of-year staff party on March 15, 2019 and in a speech on the night was hailed as an outstanding CA employee.The ICC since confirmed to News Corp they rescinded his job offer once made aware of the sexual assault allegations arising from March 2019.It can be revealed CA notified the ICC immediately after the employee came forward with the March 2019 complaint and the job offer was rescinded within a week.In the early hours of March 16, police allege Whittaker sexually assaulted a fellow CA staffer at a residence in Melbourne.In the wake of that charge being levelled in the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court late last year, Whittaker has also subsequently been charged with another unrelated alleged incident of sexual touching involving a male employee of Cricket Victoria, said to have occurred three years earlier, in January, 2016.On Thursday at the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court, Prosecution argued Whittaker’s moral culpability was high on both charges given he was essentially in an executive role in cricket, however it was accepted by the Court that Whittaker was not working in a role of authority above either of the two men.It was accepted by the Court that the second alleged victim from January 16, did not work directly with Whittaker given Cricket Australia and Cricket Victoria are separate organisations. Magistrate Metcalf told the Court on Thursday she accepted the submission of the prosecution that Whittaker’s alleged offending represented elements of predatory behaviour, although prosecutors did not allege it was prolonged behavior .","pubDate":"2022-11-25 23:02:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Trinity Sport Scholarships unveiled for 2022-23","link":"https://www.cricketireland.ie/news/article/trinity-sport-scholarship-news","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Trinity College Dublin recently unveiled its Sport Scholarship students for 2022-23.

FirstCricket Staff November 26th, 2022 1:40:59 IST Jasprit Bumrah in a file photo. AFP Jasprit Bumrah has been missing in action for quite sometime now and has already sat out of two major events this year — the Asia Cup as well as the T20 World Cup. And the Indian pace spearhead isn’t part of India’s tours of New Zealand and Bangladesh either, given he is yet to be declared fully fit from the back stress injury that had ruled him out of the T20 World Cup that took place in Australia and concluded earlier this month. Bumrah, however, has given an update on his fitness status through a video posted on his official Instagram account in which he’s seen training hard in an indoor facility. “Never easy, but always worth it,” is what the Mumbai Indians pacer wrote in the caption of the video posted on Friday. Watch the video here: View this post on Instagram A post shared by jasprit bumrah (@jaspritb1) The Gujarat pacer, who has had a meteoric rise in international cricket since making his debut in the tour of Australia in 2016, had earlier captained India in their rescheduled Test against England in Birmingham, but had shown signs of fitness issues during the white-ball fixtures against Jos Buttler’s men that followed. Bumrah had skipped India’s tours of the West Indies and Zimbabwe, and was ultimately ruled out of the Asia Cup, where India had failed to progress beyond the Super Four stage. Bumrah had made a comeback during India’s home T20I series against Australia, raising hopes of him featuring in India’s T20 World Cup campaign, only for the back problem to resurface days before India’s opening game against Pakistan. India would go on to top their group in the Super 12 stage before suffering a humiliating 10-wicket loss against eventual champions England in Adelaide.

FirstCricket Staff November 26th, 2022 1:06:07 IST PCB chairperson Ramiz Raja. AP Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja has reportedly issued a stern warning to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), threatening to boycott the 2023 ODI World Cup if India failed to show up for the Asia Cup that is to be hosted in Pakistan next year. BCCI secretary and Asian Cricket Council chief Jay Shah had earlier said that the Indian team would not be travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup, and that they would instead play at a neutral venue, ruffling feathers among the Pakistani cricketing community and causing the PCB to convene an emergency meeting with the ACC. Raja, a former Pakistan batter who had taken up a career in commentary before being appointed the board chief, further threw shade at the Men in Blue, saying that the Babar Azam-led Pakistan team had defeated the “billion-dollar economy team” twice in less than a year. “If Pakistan doesn’t take part in the World Cup scheduled in India next year, who will watch it? We have a clear stand: If the Indian team comes here then we will go for the World Cup. If they don’t come then they can play the World Cup without us. “We will adopt an aggressive approach. Our team is showing performance. I’ve always said we need to improve the economy of Pakistan cricket, and that can only happen when we perform well. In the 2021 T20 World Cup, we beat India. We beat India in the T20 Asia Cup. In one year, the Pakistan cricket team defeated a billion-dollar economy team twice,” Raja was quoted as telling Urdu News . The 2008 Asia Cup was the last multi-nation tournament that Pakistan had hosted, before the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team the following year brought cricket in the South Asian nation to a screeching halt and forced the PCB to conduct its home games in the UAE. The sport, however, has been limping back to normalcy in recent years with teams such as England, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa besides Pakistan’s Asian neighbours (except India) visiting the country for bilateral assignments, including Test cricket.

By PTI Published Date - 10:48 PM, Fri - 25 November 22 File Photo Hyderabad: Former India captain and current Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) president Mohammed Azharuddin, in a strongly worded letter addressed to the members of Supreme Court-appointed Supervisory Committee, has accused its chairman Justice (Retd) Nissar Ahmed Kakru of ‘Conflict of Interest’. The Supreme Court had back on August 22, formed a Supervisory Committee led by Kakru (former Chief Justice of Andhra High Court), Anjani Kumar, DG (ACB) Telangana State, former cricketers Venkatapathy Raju and Vanka Pratap. The committee was formed to ensure smooth administrative functioning of HCA, which has witnessed internal squabbling among its senior members for years. Also Read HCA: Kakru proposes to form selection panel for upcoming tournaments However, Azharuddin, in a letter to the committee, had alleged that Kakru is “promoting and espousing the cause of opposing group members”. Azhar’s opposition group comprises his long-time adversaries and former India off-spinners Shivlal Yadav and Arshad Ayub along with Shesh Narayan and Adnan Mahmood. “First of all, I had my own reservations to the appointment of Justice (Retd) N A Kakru as the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee & his very selection to the committee,” Azhar wrote in his letter to the committee, alleging ‘Conflict of Interest’. “….Justice (Retd) N A Kakru had been propped up as the alternate candidate for appointment as the Ombudsman by the opposing group in the HCA AGM held on April 7, 2021. This was after Justice Deepak Verma’s appointment was already made & was upheld by the Hon’ble High Court of Telangana in CRP 117/2021. “Justice Kakru at the that time presumably consented to his appointment in HCA & his appointment as Ombudsman finds a mention in the minutes of AGM circulated by the opposing group which is subject matter in OP 262/2021 and is pending trial. “With this background, the appointment of Justice NA Kakru as a member of the Supervisory Committee of HCA, would appear to be a case of conflict of interest to any ordinary mind.” For Azhar , his main objection is Kakru supporting “sinister agenda” of Shivlal and Ayub, who are allegedly pushing for “fraudulent memberships”. “Further, it is my understanding that Justice (Retd) N A Kakru is promoting & espousing the cause of the opposing group comprising of Adnan Mahmood, Shivlal Yadav, Arshad Ayub, Seshnarayan, who were instrumental in promoting his candidature for appointment as Ombudsman & promoting their sinister agenda of pushing the fraudulent memberships under the carpet & is in a hurry to declare my term as ended & hold elections with a fraudulent electoral roll.” Azhar further accused the rival faction of trying to stop his bid of cleaning the mess surrounding HCA cricket. “There is no order on the end of my term as President HCA. I have raised complaints against fraudulent memberships in HCA & these have been continuing since the last 20 years. I discovered the depth of this fraud after I took over as president in 2019. “I made my best efforts to clean the fraud through the Ombudsman but unfortunately, politics prevailed over my quest for a clean structure in the association that has made me an international cricketer. As the enquiry by Ombudsman HCA did not happen, I preferred to raise the same issues before the Supervisory Committee,” he wrote. Azhar wrote that members of the committee should look into Kakru’s alleged Conflict of Interest. “To make sure that the supervisory committee is able to do its work in a fair manner, it is my humble request that the Conflict of Interest of Justice (Retd) N A Kakru as member of the Supervisory Committee may be taken on record by the supervisory committee & appropriate action may be initiated to resolve the conflict,” Azhar said.

They’ve either got an axe to grind with someone and they won’t come and say it to your face, or they’re just leaking stuff for their own agenda. “I hate that.” Langer insists he was not using the word coward in relation to current captain Pat Cummins, former one-day captain Aaron Finch or former Test captain Tim Paine.","pubDate":"2022-11-25 14:06:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Imran Khawaja Re-Appointed As Deputy Chair Of ICC","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/imran-khawaja-re-appointed-as-deputy-chair-of-international-cricket-council-3553536","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["PTI"],"video_url":null,"description":"The International Cricket Council (ICC) has re-appointed Singapore's Imran Khwaja as Deputy Chair for a two-year term","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-25 13:23:57","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-05/cpgs7hpg_icc-logo_625x300_27_May_20.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New Zealand turn attention towards 2023 World Cup through ODI series opener","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-turn-attention-towards-2023-world-cup-through-odi-series-opener-625211","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"With the international cricket schedule having one ICC event in almost every year","content":"AUCKLAND: With the international cricket schedule having one ICC event in almost every year, there is less time for the teams to brush off the mistakes from the past events and prepare for upcoming competition with renewed approach.In this cycle of non-stop cricket at the international level, India and New Zealand will realise that they need to move on from their respective semifinal exits in the T20 World Cup and build-up to the ODI World Cup which is now less than 12 months away. With India all set to host the mega event next year, their three-match series against New Zealand, starting from Friday at the Eden Park in Auckland, will be the formal commencement of the path to finalising their squad for the same. India, ranked third in the Men's ODI rankings, have achieved automatic qualification for the World Cup next year by virtue of being hosts. It has been a year where their first-choice players like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, and Jasprit Bumrah haven't been consistent starters in the ODI series, largely due to the hectic cricketing schedule. But such has been the riches of Indian cricket in recent years that despite missing the main players since middle of the year in 50-over matches, they have managed to win series in West Indies (3-0), Zimbabwe (3-0) and more recently, against a full-strength South Africa at home (2-1) in October. Left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan will be taking over the captaincy mantle yet again and, in all probability, will open the innings with Shubman Gill. The duo have amassed three century stands in eight ODIs this year and would be hoping to push their cases with sparking performances in the matches against New Zealand. Suryakumar Yadav would be aiming to carry his superlative T20I form and 360-degree strokeplay into ODIs while Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Sanju Samson and Deepak Hooda would form the middle-order. Hooda can also be the handy sixth bowling option, something which India have missed of late, and can form the spin attack which is a three-way battle between Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal. In the pace bowling department, Deepak Chahar, Mohammed Siraj, and Shardul Thakur could be tipped to form the bowling attack. But there is a chance for Arshdeep Singh, India's find in T20Is this year, to be given a debut ODI cap, and the same goes for Umran Malik too. New Zealand, on the other hand, will be hoping that their talismanic skipper Kane Williamson comes into his best self in ODIs. Williamson has struggled to get the desired acceleration in T20Is. But with his ability to spend a lot of time in the middle, he can use that to his advantage and get big scores in ODIs. In batting, New Zealand will be boosted by the return of Tom Latham, who will take keeping gloves from Devon Conway and also, of pacer Matt Henry in the fast-bowling department. With India and New Zealand having firepower in the batting scene, it could come down to whose bowling attack performs better as the two teams kickstart their road to preparing and spotting their best personnel for the 2023 ODI World Cup.

Dhawan and Gill shared a 124-run opening stand before both departed in quick succession while Iyer stayed at the crease till the final over to ensure the team got past the 300-mark.The game also witnessed the ODI debut of Umran Malik, who had made his T20I debut in the tour of England earlier this year. Malik dismissed in-form opener Devon Conway and Daryl Mitchell and touched speeds of up to 153 kmph during his lively spell.With the opening game of the series coming to an end, we take a look at some statistics from the match:— Tom Latham brought up his highest ODI score, going past his 137 that he had scored against Bangladesh in Christchurch in 2016.— Latham’s unbeaten 145 is also the highest ODI individual score for New Zealand against India, going past Nathan Astle’s 120 in Rajkot in 1999.Highest ODI Score for New Zealand against India145 – Tom Latham (2022)* 120 – Nathan Astle (1999) 118 – Kane Williamson (2016) 117 – Nathan Astle (2001) 115 – Nathan Astle (2005)#NZvIND | #TomLatham— Cricbaba (@thecricbaba) November 25, 2022— The unbroken 221-run stand between Latham and Williamson is the fourth-highest for New Zealand in ODIs as well as the highest for the fourth wicket.— Shreyas Iyer brought up his fourth consecutive fifty-plus score against New Zealand in ODIs, the most by an Indian, going past MS Dhoni (3).Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

On Wednesday, Guptill, widely considered as one of New Zealand's best-ever white-ball openers, was granted a release from the central contract after he was dropped from the ongoing series against India and didn't get to play a single game in the T20 World Cup in Australia.\"He's added so much value over the years and been, without doubt, one of our best white-ball players we ever had. There's no sort of questioning that. It's a matter of trying to strike that balance, as we've seen with a few other players that have also looked at some of those opportunities. \"Obviously, he's decided to explore a few other options, but as a player and as a member of the team, he's added so much value over the years. Even at the T20 World Cup, without getting a playing opportunity, he was outstanding at offering to all the players in the group. \"Absolutely, he'll be missed, but he's not retired, so there's a lot to keep working through over the next period to get a feel for how the picture looks,\" said Williamson in the pre-match press conference. Guptill's decision to leave the central contract comes after some of his team-mates opted for the same route. Fast-bowling all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme retired from international cricket after a contract from the Big Bash League (BBL). Fellow all-rounder James Neesham rejected a central contract offer, after taking up various T20 franchise league assignments. Notably, left-arm fast bowler Trent Boult too left the central contract to spend more time with his family — and take up lucrative opportunities in various T20 leagues like BBL and ILT20.

So it came as a pleasant surprise when both openers Shikhar Dhawan and Shubman Gill and No 3 batter Shreyas Iyer scored half-centuries and laid the foundation for a sizeable total after the Indians were invited to bat by Black Caps captain Kane Williamson.Dhawan (72) and Gill (50) got the Men in Blue off to a promising start with a 124-run opening stand and Iyer, who top-scored with a 76-ball 80, took over once the pair departed in quick succession, staying at the crease till the final over and ensuring India got past the 300-mark.Rishabh Pant’s form still a concernA score of 300 was used to be a winning total about two decades ago, but is considered very much achievable with the T20 format revolutionising the art of batting. And with the kind of start they got at the Eden Park, India would’ve fancied crossing the 350-mark in the end, but fell way short in the end as the middle-order couldn’t replicate the top-three’s efforts.And among the middle-order batters who failed to get going on Friday was Rishabh Pant, who continues to be backed by the team leadership as their first-choice wicketkeeper-batter but somehow isn’t able to repay their faith with the bat. Pant was dismissed for a 23-ball 15, during which he collected two boundaries, extending a lean run that saw him struggle throughout the T20 World Cup as well as in the T20Is against New Zealand.Umran Malik impresses with his paceThe Indian team think-tank, however, would’ve been pleased with the way tearaway quick Umran Malik conducted himself on Friday after the Jammu and Kashmir pacer got his first opportunity to represent the nation since the tour of England earlier this year.Not only did Malik grab two wickets on ODI debut, giving India a semblance of hope by dismissing in-form opener Devon Conway and an equally dangerous Daryl Mitchell, he also hit express speeds during his spell with one of his deliveries touching the 153kmph mark. Safe to say we’re in for a pace battle this series between Malik and Lockie Ferguson should skipper Dhawan and stand-in head coach VVS Laxman persist with him in the attack.Tom Latham’s assault on Shardul ThakurHe might not be part of the New Zealand T20 setup any longer given his style of play isn’t suited to the fast-paced nature of the shortest format, but Tom Latham gave a solid reminder as to why he remains an integral member of the ODI side with a career-best knock of 145 not out that came off just 104 balls.The southpaw, who opens in the five-day format but bats in the middle-order in ODIs, smashed 19 fours and five maximums during his scintillating knock that came at a time when the Black Caps found themselves in a spot of bother. Latham played the aggressor’s role to perfection and it was his assault on Shardul Thakur in the 40th over — in which he smashed a six and four consecutive fours as the all-rounder went for 25 runs — that particularly stood out and signalled the shift in momentum towards the Kiwis.Areas of concern for the Indian bowling unit While the Indian bowling performance on Friday did show some promise especially in the manner in which Malik performed early during New Zealand’s chase, they failed to come up with answers once skipper Williamson and Latham got settled at the crease and began to rotate strike at will.While left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh has shown plenty of promise and has entrenched himself in both white-ball formats, his consistency remains an issue as he went wicketless for 68 runs at an economy in excess of 8. And neither spin option — Yuzvendra Chahal and Washington Sundar — could get the breakthrough in the middle overs although the latter did well to contain the run flow during his overs. And once Latham unleashed his fury on Thakur in the final over of the second powerplay, the game appeared well beyond Inda’s reach.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Earlier this year, Archer was ruled out of the entire competitive cricketing action of the English season after being diagnosed with a stress fracture in his lower back. But on Wednesday, in England versus England Lions warm-up match at Tolerance Oval in Abu Dhabi, Archer bowled nine overs across two spells and even hit Zak Crawley on the helmet with a sharp bouncer in first over of cricketing comeback. \"I am so, so glad to be back and this is a big year, we just won the T20, we have the 50-over coming up so, hopefully, I get a chance to help defend the title. That (50-over World Cup) is the goal,\" Archer was quoted as saying by Sky Sports. For now, Archer is happy to be back in the mix for England and feels he needs to work a bit harder to be fully fit. \"Being back here in Abu Dhabi, in and around the guys, it is kind of heart-warming, it makes you feel like you are at home again, seeing all the familiar faces, seeing all the boys again.\" \"I still don't think I am 100 per cent as yet; I still need to do some more work to get the body back up and fit and firing. But in the short-term, just to be fit is the most important thing.\" Archer, who was later unveiled as MI Cape Town's wildcard signing for the inaugural season of the SA20, admitted that he had some pain afterwards after bowling nine overs in the practice match, largely due to coming back after a lot of time on the sidelines. \"This morning, it kind of felt like a bus hit me but that is a good feeling. I was glad to get a run out, especially with the boys. It is almost like being back playing with them.\" \"There are some restrictions.... the coach and the physio said I could use my discretion with how much I wanted to bowl. I think I did enough for a first run out.\" Archer will join his England team-mates Sam Curran, Liam Livingstone and Olly Stone at MI Cape Town in SA20, apart from South Africa duo of fast-bowler Kagiso Rabada, batter Dewald Brevis and Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan.

It has taken it upon itself to educate Americans about what it considers as caste privilege enjoyed by Brahmins in the US. Its founder Thenmozhi Soundararajan is spearheading this movement by posing as a spokesperson for all Dalits with the stated goal of empowering them and ending their oppression.Equality Labs’ mission is to use “community research, political base-building, culture-shifting art, and digital security to end the oppression of caste apartheid, Islamophobia, white supremacy, and religious intolerance”. This conflating of issues is typical of the Woke cult that has the goal of bringing together people with grievances to topple the traditional structures of society.With funding from mysterious sources, this organisation has suddenly produced fake surveys and created a power base in the mainstream American media. It has converted dubious social sciences theories into activism on the ground.Its fifty-two-page report on the American workplace claims that corporate power is controlled by Brahmins/upper castes and that Dalits are routinely oppressed and discriminated against. In my recent book, Snakes in the Ganga, my co-author Vijaya Viswanathan and I show that the report is full of flaws.But this kind of activism attracts huge audiences because it has roped in many Blacks to lend credibility to the Dalit-Black hyphenation, i.e., Dalits are Blacks and upper caste Indians are Whites. However ridiculous, the theory has helped Soundararajan latch on to the Woke movement that Blacks are using to fight racism in the US. This is a dangerous cocktail designed to explode in Silicon Valley.Soundararajan has helped file lawsuits against tech companies in Silicon Valley. This created havoc at Cisco, for instance, which has fought hard to defend itself in court. As a result, Indian Americans find themselves trapped in a terrible situation. Much to their embarrassment, Soundararajan is aggressively calling for surveys of caste discrimination in workplaces across America.She is using the Cisco lawsuit to pressure many companies into accepting her “caste training” workshops. The claim that caste equals race labels a company a racist organisation if it doesn’t fall in line with these activists’ thinking. Racism is a terrible allegation in the US with legal and political consequences. Moreover, the share price of a company would fall if it faced such a scandal.Rich technology companies prefer to pacify the trouble-makers, which actually plays into Soundararajan’s hands. She has entered large HR departments to coach employees to be able to recognize caste discrimination as racism.Her account of the history of caste is packed with Hinduphobia. It’s very difficult for White Americans to tell the caste of Indians because they look the same, mostly speak English, eat the same food, enjoy the same kind of entertainment, and so on. This confusion causes nervous HR departments to opt for these training programmes. They are allocating significant budgets to deal with the issue. In 2020 for example, US companies promised thirty-five billion dollars toward racial equality efforts, making this a huge industry that generates millions of dollars for “consultants” like Equality Labs.The effect on Indians who work in large numbers in Silicon Valley is devastating. In these “caste training” workshops, Indian employees are forced to sit quietly and listen. Many acquiesce to the indoctrination by apologizing for their casteism. Any employee who raises issues with the workshop and counters with facts is labelled casteist. It is an experience of public humiliation for most Indians in front of their American colleagues. It is unfair because they have not personally committed any act of oppression against Dalits.This is hurting the brand value that Indian tech workers have built for themselves through their hard work. It is also hurting India’s competitiveness. The Chinese for instance are quick to capitalise on any situation and wanting to take jobs and contracts away from Indians. And even among Americans, there are those that are jealous of the success of Indians. Soundararajan is giving them ammunition by accusing Indians of bringing caste oppression into the American workplace. It is a manipulative bullying tactic in the guise of a noble social justice cause.What started in Silicon Valley has spread like wildfire already. Even American college campuses are not being spared. Many have already adopted official policies to treat caste just like race and prosecute complaints of bias as acts of racism. Here too, Indians are harassed with lecturing and public shaming. Such policies make Hindu professors and students seem like suspects.This is also the root cause behind the rapid flareups of Hinduphobia on campuses and in the media. I predict this tsunami will enter India via the business offices of US technology companies. It will create divisiveness among employees and feed the Breaking India forces.For more details on this syndrome, please see www.SnakesInTheGanga.com.The author is a researcher, writer, speaker and public intellectual on current affairs as they relate to civilisations, cross-cultural encounters, religion and science.

De Kock is a part of Durban's Super Giants, where he will be joined by his Proteas team-mate, left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who is excited to feature in a T20 game in his home-town. \"I'm looking forward to obviously rubbing shoulders with some new faces, learning more about the game from some T20 specialist, but most importantly making new friendships on and off the field and yeah playing in my hometown, most especially Durban.\" One of the striking features of SA will be that each of the six franchises — MI Cape Town (MICT), Paarl Royals (PR), Pretoria Capitals (PC), Joburg Super Kings (JSK), Durban's Super Giants (DSG) and Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC) — are owned by IPL franchise owners. Moreover, de Kock was a part of Lucknow Super Giants in IPL 2022, giving him a solid understanding of foreign players who will also be playing in SA20's inaugural edition too. \"I've played with everyone, I know what I'm dealing with, and so, I know the boys are going to have a lot of fun with the children, with the fisherman as well. So I know that what I'm dealing with, so it's pretty easy for me.\" Maharaj, on the other hand, is excited to rub shoulders alongside West Indies pace all-rounders Jason Holder and Kyle Mayers. \"Well, Quinton played with pretty much everyone, I'm looking forward to playing with Kyle Mayers and Jason Holder, having seen what they did in this last Caribbean League, it's actually quite exciting, bringing some proper flair and some interesting cricketing shots, so looking forward to that yeah.\" MI Cape Town and neighbours Paarl Royals kickstart the tournament at Newlands, followed by Durban's Super Giants hosting the Jo'burg Super Kings at Kingsmead on January 11, before Pretoria Capitals travel to Gqeberha on January 12 to face the Sunrisers Eastern Cape at St George's Park.

Now, he has received praise from veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin for expertly handling the questions about Sanju Samson’s exclusion from the T20I squad against New Zealand.While applauding Pandya’s composure, Ashwin referred to former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni who had a knack for maintaining his cool in any pressure situation.In the absence of Rohit Sharma, Pandya was appointed as the interim captain of the T20I side. While the opening fixture was abandoned due to rain, the third match was declared a tie as per the DLS method after rain once again interrupted the action. With their victory in the second game, the Men in Blue triumphed 1-0.Questions about Sanju Samson being sidelined even after his good form began to arise during the series. In India’s previous series against South Africa, the Kerala batter recorded 118 runs in three matches, but Rishabh Pant was considered the first-choice wicketkeeper against the Black Caps.When asked about the decision, Pandya answered, “He (Samson) definitely knows it is not personal. It has to do with the circumstances. Everyone is aware that I always have my doors open for anyone to talk with me if they are feeling something. This is because I can also relate.”Referring to Pandya’s response, Ashwin noted that the all-rounder might have adopted the style of “Thala Dhoni.” According to him, this can be the byproduct of the close bonding the duo share with each other.During Dhoni’s tenure, Pandya was spotted several times taking valuable advice from the former captain. Those suggestions seem to have clicked for him and the results reflect it, whether it’s in the IPL or in the international circuit. “Kudos to Hardik,” Ashwin said while speaking on his YouTube channel.Additionally, Ashwin lauded Pandya for trying to ensure that India didn’t fall short of the required total with his bat in the third T20I, which concluded in a tie under the DLS technique. The senior player noted that Pandya’s quick-fire 30 runs in 18 balls immensely helped India reach the par score of 75 runs.“Pandya’s performance with the bat was similar to what he did for the Gujarat Titans. He came out all guns blazing and it was the only factor that led the match resulting in a tie,” Ashwin explained.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Hyderabad: Indian fast bowler Umran Malik, who made his debut today against New Zealand at Eden Park in Auckland, lived up to his reputation by clocking 153.1 kmph in his debut match. He achieved the feat in his 3rd over of the first ODI match. Umran, who came to bowl the 16 th over for India, also claimed his first international wicket by dismissing New Zealand opener Devon Conway.

Top-order batsmen – Shikhar Dhawan (72), Shubman Gill (50), and Shreyas Iyer (80) – helped India post a huge total.

Kane Williamson and Tom Latham proved their class in the ODI format yet again. Michael Vaughan had some advice for the Indian team after their defeat in the 1st ODI. India scored a decent total of 306-7 runs in the first innings, where Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer and Shikhar Dhawan scored half-centuries. Rishabh Pant and Suryakumar Yadav failed to impress, but Washington Sundar played an excellent knock of 37 runs in 16 balls. At one stage, New Zealand lost three wickets for just 88 runs where Umran Malik took a couple of wickets. But, the pair of Williamson and Latham stitched an unbeaten partnership of 221 runs to take the Kiwis home. It is one of the best-ever partnerships in ODI cricket. Michael Vaughan slams India in response to Wasim Jaffer tweet Former Indian batter Wasim Jaffer applauded the efforts of Kane Williamson and Tom Latham in New Zealand’s easy win over India. However, former English batter Michael Vaughan slammed Jaffer on his tweet by saying that the Indian team lacked in terms of bowling options. Vaughan called New Zealand a dated ODI team and advised India to play with at least 6 or 7 bowling options against teams like New Zealand. Team India just played with 5 options in the Auckland ODI, and they had no further option in bowling if any bowler had a bad day. “They are a dated ODI team .. you need at least 6 if not 7 bowling options,” Michael Vaughan tweeted. They are a dated ODI team .. you need at least 6 if not 7 bowling options .. https://t.co/UXsgWb2PvN — Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) November 25, 2022 The same problem forced the Indian team to play with Deepak Hooda in the T20Is as Hooda could offer a 6th bowling option to the Indian team. However, India opted to go with Sanju Samson, and it forced India to play with just 5 bowling options. Hardik Pandya’s absence is certainly hurting the Indian team. After the T20I series, Pandya said that the Indian team needs more batters who can bowl, and the same problem got exposed in this 1st ODI as well.

Dhawan’s knock soon grabbed the attention of former coach Ravi Shastri, who said Dhawan does not get the accolades he deserves, while adding that the spotlight largely falls on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.“He’s vastly experienced. He doesn’t get the accolades that he deserves. To be honest, most of the spotlight is on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. But when you look at his one-day cricket record, and you look at some of the innings he has played against top teams in big games, it’s an outstanding record. A left-hander at the top makes a lot of difference,” Shastri said on Amazon Prime Video during the first ODI.Ravi Shastri went on to complement Dhawan’s natural stroke play, and added that Dhawan’s experience in the 50-pver format will come in handy for youngsters in the squad.“He is a natural stroke player, he has got all the shots to countertop class fast bowling, the pull, the cut, and the drive,” the 60-year-old said.“He likes it when the ball is coming onto the bat, and I think his experience will be handy here. There are a lot of talented youngsters around, but I think in this format of the game, his experience will be in value,” Shastri added.Dhawan got off to a slow start on Friday, but his innings gained speed later on. He reached his 39th ODI fifty in 63 balls, while also hitting Lockie Ferguson for consecutive fours in the 15th over.Apart from Dhawan, Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer also scored fifties, while Washington Sundar amassed an unbeaten 37 off just 16 deliveries to take India to 306/7.However, all their efforts went in vain as Tom Latham (145*) and Kane Williamson (95*) helped the Kiwis chase down the total with seven wickets and 17 deliveries remaining.India will look to bounce back when the two teams face off in the second ODI in Hamilton on Sunday.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Talking about the same, India skipper Shikhar Dhawan said that the back of the length balls didn’t really work against Latham and the over from Thakur shifted the momentum completely.“We felt good about the total. First 10-15 overs the ball did a lot. It’s a bit different than other grounds. Have to plan accordingly. Today we’ve bowled short of length and Latham attacked us there.

Would’ve been happier if we won but that’s part and parcel. They’re all young boys and lots of learning for them. Bowling side and fielding side as well (what areas need improvement?). We need to implement our plans more wisely and make sure we don’t make the batsmen play on their strength,” he added.Williamson lauded Latham for his brilliant performance with the bat and added that the left-handed batter was “absolutely on fire”.“At the halfway stage I thought it was a competitive total. The wicket was starting to turn a bit. And the cross-seamers got a bit out of it. But as we know on this ground if you build partnerships you can chase anything. Incredible knock by Latham. Absolutely on fire. We’re talking in the middle about getting through this over and that over. And then he just flicked a switch. Incredible innings. On this ground with the drop-in pitch, if you bowl nice and straight, it can be hard to get the ball away a little bit. ”1-0 up in the Sterling Reserve ODI Series!
