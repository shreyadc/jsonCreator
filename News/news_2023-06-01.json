The Irish have made their reputation on the back of their exploits in white-ball internationals. They defeated Pakistan, England and the West Indies at the 2007, 2011 and 2015 50-over World Cups respectively and beat eventual champions England at the 2022 T20 World Cup. Ireland, however, have played just six Tests in their history and are still searching for a first win in that form of the game. Four years ago, in their previous Test at Lord's, they dismissed England for just 85, only to suffer a 143-run defeat after they themselves slumped to 38 all out in the fourth innings of the match. “It didn't play out the way we wanted to but we got a glimpse into what would happen if we were to win a Test,” said Balbirnie on Wednesday's eve of the four-day Test. “And, I think if we were to beat England, it would easily be our best achievement in cricket in the game.” The odds, though, are stacked against Ireland, with England having won 10 of their 12 Tests since skipper Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum joined forces last year. “We know that this England team is in a really good place leading to the Ashes,” said Balbirnie. Ireland will be without Josh Little at Lord's after the young fast bowler, who starred for the Gujarat Titans side that reached the recent Indian Premier League final, was rested for next month's 50-over World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe. Little also missed Tests against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after his IPL exploits. Ireland's high performance director, Richard Holdsworth, defended the 23-year-old's absence on the grounds a Test at Lord's, a major landmark for most players, was not a “pinnacle event” for his side this year. “Of course, we would have loved him here but I understand completely that he's got to focus on resting up and getting ready for our World Cup qualifier,” said Balbirnie. “Josh played in an IPL final in his first IPL appearance, I'm not stupid, he's going to get picked up by other leagues and we are going to have this situation again, but he still wants to play for Ireland. “I've spoken to him and he still loves playing for this team. “","pubDate":"2023-05-31 22:09:00","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_aa26f2cee6.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"News24.com | 'Preparations have gone well,' says skipper De Zorzi as SA A jet off to Sri Lanka","link":"https://www.news24.com/sport/Cricket/Proteas/preparations-have-gone-well-says-skipper-de-zorzi-as-sa-a-jet-off-to-sri-lanka-20230531","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"With three one-dayers and two four-day matches ahead of them in the subcontinent, Tony de Zorzi is looking forward to the South African A sides tour to Sri Lanka that gets underway this weekend.","content":"With three one-dayers and two four-day matches ahead of them in the subcontinent, Tony de Zorzi is looking forward to the South African A sides tour to Sri Lanka that gets underway this weekend.

The venue offers one of the best batting conditions in the UK with true pace and bounce. India are expected to play their frontline spinners R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in their bid to make the most of the conditions. “The Oval can present itself with some spin occasionally particularly as the game wears on so we could face some sort of similarities to what we had in India at certain stages of the game. “But The Oval is a wonderful place to play cricket in. Lightening fast outfield, the square goes whole way across the ground so it is a nice place to bat when you get in and has some decent pace and bounce for an English surface. Should be an absolute cracker,” Smith told cricket.com.au ahead of the final beginning June 7. Australia recently lost the Test series in India 1-2 though their spin play improved as the series progressed. Smith was the captain when the team won the third Test in Indore. “The WTC is a great initiative. It gives every game we play a lot of relevance and for us to have qualified on top and face India in the final is incredibly exciting. It is going to be India and us at the Oval. “I am sure there will be plenty of fans out there, probably more Indian than Australian but I am sure it is going to be great fun and guys are looking forward to it,” he said. Smith is among the Australian batters who played county cricket in England as part of the preparations for the WTC final and subsequent Ashes.","pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:40:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ireland need more than the crumbs on the ICC’s table to grow, says Kyle McCallan","link":"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/ireland-need-more-than-the-crumbs-on-the-iccs-table-to-grow-says-kyle-mccallan/1609681348.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Kyle McCallan has spoken about the financial challenges faced by Irish cricket in recent years and how increased funding from the International Cricket Council (ICC) can help the sport on the island in the future.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:22:58","image_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-mh-ireland/f8eaad14-0799-4a74-98bb-b61683ae3b70/263d03ef-e1c6-4232-a475-97d87d50d29c/f8eaad14-0799-4a74-98bb-b61683ae3b70.jpg","source_id":"belfasttelegraph","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Former captain Kyle McCallan hails Irish cricket’s remarkable journey ahead of Lord’s Test","link":"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/former-captain-kyle-mccallan-hails-irish-crickets-remarkable-journey-ahead-of-lords-test/1867496839.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former captain Kyle McCallan says that the Ireland team face an almighty challenge against England in the eagerly awaited Test match at Lord’s but insists the visitors will feel inspired walking through the Long Room at the home of cricket on the opening day.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:22:57","image_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-mh-ireland/cbaeb809-dfed-4e84-bb04-32a9ce08e1bc/ffd7fd11-1561-465f-81c3-411ca852f81a/cbaeb809-dfed-4e84-bb04-32a9ce08e1bc.jpg","source_id":"belfasttelegraph","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WTC Final: Indian batters will have to work on bat speed, says Gavaskar","link":"https://telanganatoday.com/wtc-final-indian-batters-will-have-to-work-on-bat-speed-says-gavaskar","keywords":["News","Sport","Australia","Sunil Gavaskar","World Test Championship"],"creator":["IANS"],"video_url":null,"description":"Gavaskar emphasised the need for batters to play as late as possible in English conditions, allowing for swing and avoiding the mistake of reaching out for the ball","content":"New Delhi: Batting great Sunil Gavaskar feels that the Indian batters will have to work on their bat speed control in order to make that transition from the fast-paced T20 format to the Test cricket as they are going to face Australia in the upcoming World Test Championship final from June 7 at The Oval. Gavaskar emphasised the need for batters to play as late as possible in English conditions, allowing for swing and avoiding the mistake of reaching out for the ball. “I think they are going to look at their bat speed. Coming from T20 where the bat speed is very fast to test cricket where the bat speeds have to be a lot more controlled, that is something they’ll need to do. They’ll need to play in England as late as possible to allow for the swing to do its bit, not to reach out for the ball which often a lot of people make the mistake of having played on good pitches,” said Gavaskar on Star Sports’ ‘Follow the Blues’. “Wherever you play on good pitches, you tend to play through the line, not necessarily half volleys, but in England those deliveries can move just that little bit. So, I think those are the things that as a batter you need to watch out for. As a bowling unit also you’ll need to bowl a much fuller length for your new ball, for the bowlers to be able to get the movement in the air as well as after pitching,” he added. Former India captain also highlighted the challenges Team India would face playing in English conditions, including the overcast weather and swing in the air, aspects unfamiliar to Indian, West Indian, and Sri Lankan players. “I think the English conditions are challenging because firstly we are used to playing with the sun on our backs. When you are playing in England, often you are playing in conditions where there is no sun, it’s a little overcast, the weather is a little bit cooler, so you sometimes wear a jumper. That’s something that you know, the Indian players, West Indian players and Sri Lankan players are not really used to so that can be just a little bit of a dampener, little sort of light but you just feel a little bit encumbered by that,” he said. So, that is one thing and because in these conditions the ball tends to swing in the air not just after pitching which doesn’t happen in India and therefore the swing in the air is what sometimes can take you some time to get used to and which is a reason people generally when you are going overseas suggest that you should may be play two or three warm-up matches, which will give you a better idea of what to get when you are playing in a test match,” he added. The 73-year old feels that Cheteshwar Pujara can give some valuable insights to the team having experienced the conditions at The Oval. “The fact that he has been around will mean that he will have also seen how the pitch has been behaving at The Oval. He might not have played at The Oval, he might be in Sussex not too far away from London but he will have kept an eye on what is happening and his inputs will be invaluable as far as the batting unit is concerned or even as far as the captaincy is concerned,” said Gavaskar. “He will have the captains here as far as the Oval pitch is concerned and don’t forget he has also captained the team, so he definitely will have worked out quite a few strategies seeing that Steve Smith, the Australian is his teammate at the moment,” he added.","pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:00:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lance Klusener To Take Over As Tripura Cricket Operations Head","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/lance-klusener-to-take-over-as-tripura-cricket-operations-head-4083432","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former South African allrounder Lance Klusener will take over as head of cricket operation of Tripura for the upcoming season, the state association announced on Wednesday","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-31 16:50:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ben Stokes Says England Will Not Change Attacking Approach vs Australia","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ben-stokes-says-england-will-not-change-attacking-approach-against-australia-in-ashes-4083382","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England captain Ben Stokes insisted that his team would continue to play the aggressive brand of cricket that has helped them win 10 of their last 12 Test matches","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-31 16:32:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Test win over England would be new high for Irish cricket: Balbirnie","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Test-win-over-England-would-be-new-high-for-Irish-cricket:-Balbirnie/315-260210","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie said beating England in a Test would “easily be our best achievement in cricket” as the underdogs prepare to face Ben Stokes’ men at Lord’s this week.","content":"Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie said beating England in a Test would “easily be our best achievement in cricket” as the underdogs prepare to face Ben Stokes' men at Lord's this week.

Smith is among the Australian batters who played county cricket in England as part of the preparations for the WTC final and subsequent Ashes.","pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:40:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ireland need more than the crumbs on the ICC’s table to grow, says Kyle McCallan","link":"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/ireland-need-more-than-the-crumbs-on-the-iccs-table-to-grow-says-kyle-mccallan/1609681348.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Kyle McCallan has spoken about the financial challenges faced by Irish cricket in recent years and how increased funding from the International Cricket Council (ICC) can help the sport on the island in the future.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:22:58","image_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-mh-ireland/f8eaad14-0799-4a74-98bb-b61683ae3b70/263d03ef-e1c6-4232-a475-97d87d50d29c/f8eaad14-0799-4a74-98bb-b61683ae3b70.jpg","source_id":"belfasttelegraph","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Former captain Kyle McCallan hails Irish cricket’s remarkable journey ahead of Lord’s Test","link":"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/former-captain-kyle-mccallan-hails-irish-crickets-remarkable-journey-ahead-of-lords-test/1867496839.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former captain Kyle McCallan says that the Ireland team face an almighty challenge against England in the eagerly awaited Test match at Lord’s but insists the visitors will feel inspired walking through the Long Room at the home of cricket on the opening day.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:22:57","image_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-mh-ireland/cbaeb809-dfed-4e84-bb04-32a9ce08e1bc/ffd7fd11-1561-465f-81c3-411ca852f81a/cbaeb809-dfed-4e84-bb04-32a9ce08e1bc.jpg","source_id":"belfasttelegraph","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WTC Final: Indian batters will have to work on bat speed, says Gavaskar","link":"https://telanganatoday.com/wtc-final-indian-batters-will-have-to-work-on-bat-speed-says-gavaskar","keywords":["News","Sport","Australia","Sunil Gavaskar","World Test Championship"],"creator":["IANS"],"video_url":null,"description":"Gavaskar emphasised the need for batters to play as late as possible in English conditions, allowing for swing and avoiding the mistake of reaching out for the ball","content":"New Delhi: Batting great Sunil Gavaskar feels that the Indian batters will have to work on their bat speed control in order to make that transition from the fast-paced T20 format to the Test cricket as they are going to face Australia in the upcoming World Test Championship final from June 7 at The Oval. Gavaskar emphasised the need for batters to play as late as possible in English conditions, allowing for swing and avoiding the mistake of reaching out for the ball. “I think they are going to look at their bat speed. Coming from T20 where the bat speed is very fast to test cricket where the bat speeds have to be a lot more controlled, that is something they’ll need to do. They’ll need to play in England as late as possible to allow for the swing to do its bit, not to reach out for the ball which often a lot of people make the mistake of having played on good pitches,” said Gavaskar on Star Sports’ ‘Follow the Blues’. “Wherever you play on good pitches, you tend to play through the line, not necessarily half volleys, but in England those deliveries can move just that little bit. So, I think those are the things that as a batter you need to watch out for. As a bowling unit also you’ll need to bowl a much fuller length for your new ball, for the bowlers to be able to get the movement in the air as well as after pitching,” he added. Former India captain also highlighted the challenges Team India would face playing in English conditions, including the overcast weather and swing in the air, aspects unfamiliar to Indian, West Indian, and Sri Lankan players. “I think the English conditions are challenging because firstly we are used to playing with the sun on our backs. When you are playing in England, often you are playing in conditions where there is no sun, it’s a little overcast, the weather is a little bit cooler, so you sometimes wear a jumper. That’s something that you know, the Indian players, West Indian players and Sri Lankan players are not really used to so that can be just a little bit of a dampener, little sort of light but you just feel a little bit encumbered by that,” he said. So, that is one thing and because in these conditions the ball tends to swing in the air not just after pitching which doesn’t happen in India and therefore the swing in the air is what sometimes can take you some time to get used to and which is a reason people generally when you are going overseas suggest that you should may be play two or three warm-up matches, which will give you a better idea of what to get when you are playing in a test match,” he added. The 73-year old feels that Cheteshwar Pujara can give some valuable insights to the team having experienced the conditions at The Oval. “The fact that he has been around will mean that he will have also seen how the pitch has been behaving at The Oval. He might not have played at The Oval, he might be in Sussex not too far away from London but he will have kept an eye on what is happening and his inputs will be invaluable as far as the batting unit is concerned or even as far as the captaincy is concerned,” said Gavaskar. “He will have the captains here as far as the Oval pitch is concerned and don’t forget he has also captained the team, so he definitely will have worked out quite a few strategies seeing that Steve Smith, the Australian is his teammate at the moment,” he added.","pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:00:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lance Klusener To Take Over As Tripura Cricket Operations Head","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/lance-klusener-to-take-over-as-tripura-cricket-operations-head-4083432","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former South African allrounder Lance Klusener will take over as head of cricket operation of Tripura for the upcoming season, the state association announced on Wednesday","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-31 16:50:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ben Stokes Says England Will Not Change Attacking Approach vs Australia","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ben-stokes-says-england-will-not-change-attacking-approach-against-australia-in-ashes-4083382","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England captain Ben Stokes insisted that his team would continue to play the aggressive brand of cricket that has helped them win 10 of their last 12 Test matches","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-31 16:32:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Test win over England would be new high for Irish cricket: Balbirnie","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Test-win-over-England-would-be-new-high-for-Irish-cricket:-Balbirnie/315-260210","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie said beating England in a Test would “easily be our best achievement in cricket” as the underdogs prepare to face Ben Stokes’ men at Lord’s this week.","content":"Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie said beating England in a Test would “easily be our best achievement in cricket” as the underdogs prepare to face Ben Stokes' men at Lord's this week. The Irish have made their reputation on the back of their exploits in white-ball internationals. They defeated Pakistan, England and the West Indies at the 2007, 2011 and 2015 50-over World Cups respectively and beat eventual champions England at the 2022 T20 World Cup. Ireland, however, have played just six Tests in their history and are still searching for a first win in that form of the game. Four years ago, in their previous Test at Lord's, they dismissed England for just 85, only to suffer a 143-run defeat after they themselves slumped to 38 all out in the fourth innings of the match. “It didn't play out the way we wanted to but we got a glimpse into what would happen if we were to win a Test,” said Balbirnie on Wednesday's eve of the four-day Test. “And, I think if we were to beat England, it would easily be our best achievement in cricket in the game.” The odds, though, are stacked against Ireland, with England having won 10 of their 12 Tests since skipper Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum joined forces last year. “We know that this England team is in a really good place leading to the Ashes,” said Balbirnie. Ireland will be without Josh Little at Lord's after the young fast bowler, who starred for the Gujarat Titans side that reached the recent Indian Premier League final, was rested for next month's 50-over World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe. Little also missed Tests against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after his IPL exploits. Ireland's high performance director, Richard Holdsworth, defended the 23-year-old's absence on the grounds a Test at Lord's, a major landmark for most players, was not a “pinnacle event” for his side this year. “Of course, we would have loved him here but I understand completely that he's got to focus on resting up and getting ready for our World Cup qualifier,” said Balbirnie. “Josh played in an IPL final in his first IPL appearance, I'm not stupid, he's going to get picked up by other leagues and we are going to have this situation again, but he still wants to play for Ireland. “I've spoken to him and he still loves playing for this team. “","pubDate":"2023-05-31 22:09:00","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_aa26f2cee6.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"News24.com | 'Preparations have gone well,' says skipper De Zorzi as SA A jet off to Sri Lanka","link":"https://www.news24.com/sport/Cricket/Proteas/preparations-have-gone-well-says-skipper-de-zorzi-as-sa-a-jet-off-to-sri-lanka-20230531","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"With three one-dayers and two four-day matches ahead of them in the subcontinent, Tony de Zorzi is looking forward to the South African A sides tour to Sri Lanka that gets underway this weekend.","content":"With three one-dayers and two four-day matches ahead of them in the subcontinent, Tony de Zorzi is looking forward to the South African A sides tour to Sri Lanka that gets underway this weekend.

The venue offers one of the best batting conditions in the UK with true pace and bounce. India are expected to play their frontline spinners R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in their bid to make the most of the conditions. “The Oval can present itself with some spin occasionally particularly as the game wears on so we could face some sort of similarities to what we had in India at certain stages of the game. “But The Oval is a wonderful place to play cricket in. Lightening fast outfield, the square goes whole way across the ground so it is a nice place to bat when you get in and has some decent pace and bounce for an English surface. Should be an absolute cracker,” Smith told cricket.com.au ahead of the final beginning June 7. Australia recently lost the Test series in India 1-2 though their spin play improved as the series progressed. Smith was the captain when the team won the third Test in Indore. “The WTC is a great initiative. It gives every game we play a lot of relevance and for us to have qualified on top and face India in the final is incredibly exciting. It is going to be India and us at the Oval. “I am sure there will be plenty of fans out there, probably more Indian than Australian but I am sure it is going to be great fun and guys are looking forward to it,” he said. Smith is among the Australian batters who played county cricket in England as part of the preparations for the WTC final and subsequent Ashes.","pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:40:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ireland need more than the crumbs on the ICC’s table to grow, says Kyle McCallan","link":"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/ireland-need-more-than-the-crumbs-on-the-iccs-table-to-grow-says-kyle-mccallan/1609681348.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Kyle McCallan has spoken about the financial challenges faced by Irish cricket in recent years and how increased funding from the International Cricket Council (ICC) can help the sport on the island in the future.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:22:58","image_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-mh-ireland/f8eaad14-0799-4a74-98bb-b61683ae3b70/263d03ef-e1c6-4232-a475-97d87d50d29c/f8eaad14-0799-4a74-98bb-b61683ae3b70.jpg","source_id":"belfasttelegraph","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Former captain Kyle McCallan hails Irish cricket’s remarkable journey ahead of Lord’s Test","link":"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/former-captain-kyle-mccallan-hails-irish-crickets-remarkable-journey-ahead-of-lords-test/1867496839.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former captain Kyle McCallan says that the Ireland team face an almighty challenge against England in the eagerly awaited Test match at Lord’s but insists the visitors will feel inspired walking through the Long Room at the home of cricket on the opening day.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-31 17:22:57","image_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-mh-ireland/cbaeb809-dfed-4e84-bb04-32a9ce08e1bc/ffd7fd11-1561-465f-81c3-411ca852f81a/cbaeb809-dfed-4e84-bb04-32a9ce08e1bc.jpg","source_id":"belfasttelegraph","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WTC Final: Indian batters will have to work on bat speed, says Gavaskar","link":"https://telanganatoday.com/wtc-final-indian-batters-will-have-to-work-on-bat-speed-says-gavaskar","keywords":["News","Sport","Australia","Sunil Gavaskar","World Test Championship"],"creator":["IANS"],"video_url":null,"description":"Gavaskar emphasised the need for batters to play as late as possible in English conditions, allowing for swing and avoiding the mistake of reaching out for the ball","content":"New Delhi: Batting great Sunil Gavaskar feels that the Indian batters will have to work on their bat speed control in order to make that transition from the fast-paced T20 format to the Test cricket as they are going to face Australia in the upcoming World Test Championship final from June 7 at The Oval.
