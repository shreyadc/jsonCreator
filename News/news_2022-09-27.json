But on Saturday, we’ll witness a North London derby between two teams with genuine ambitions of challenging for the title. Mikel Areta’s Arsenal face Antonio Conte’s Spurs in the North London this SaturdayGetty PAArsenal legend Tony Adams raised eyebrows with his appearance on Strictly[/caption] This is a rivalry so intense that 47,000 watched their Women’s Super League clash at the weekend. But for the first time in six years, Arsenal v Tottenham is a truly elite Premier League fixture, rather than a local squabble of little interest north of Watford. Last year’s derbies were two of the most one-sided home wins you’ll ever see — when Nuno Espirito Santo’s Spurs were demolished at the Emirates and Arsenal choked with Champions League football up for grabs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in May. This one promises to be different with Arsenal top, and unbeaten Spurs in third, after both clubs kicked a deeply ingrained habit by nailing the summer transfer window. READ MORE FOOTBALL WEMBLEY CHAOS Five injured after 100 German hooligans 'disguised as England fans' storm pub Nobody could have seen this coming a year ago, during Nuno’s disastrous Spurs reign, following a laughable 76-day search for Jose Mourinho’s successor and with Arsenal still floundering under Mikel Arteta. Yet the appointment of Antonio Conte was a game-changer at Spurs, enabling them to seize fourth spot — before the summer signings of Richarlison, Yves Bissouma, Ivan Perisic and Clement Lenglet added experience and quality to significantly bolster the squad. And after blowing a return to the Champions League, Arsenal bought in two multiple Manchester City title-winners in Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko, who, along with returning loanee William Saliba, have improved Arteta’s team immeasurably. Both managers have enjoyed the authority to make tough decisions which have gone against the grain — and, crucially, both are sharing a hymn sheet with their sporting directors: Edu at Arsenal and Fabio Paratici at Spurs.

But that move was a logical extension of Arsenal’s policies of prioritising squad unity and promoting youth — an approach which reached hallucinatory extremes when 15-year-old midfielder Ethan Nwaneri made his first-team debut at Brentford. Conte has also been able to challenge his club’s culture — though in a different direction to Arsenal. Spurs bought early and added experience this summer, rather than their usual obsession with late bargains and resale value. Tottenham have not been swashbuckling this season and, under Conte, they probably won’t be as thrilling as Mauricio Pochettino’s peak side, nor the under-rated Harry Redknapp team which included Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Rafael van der Vaart. But the ability to grind out results is what Spurs have too often lacked. Richarlison is already proving to be a big hit at TottenhamRex And in Richarlison they have a player who is all kinds of everything. A great individual talent, yet also a team player who gives them the ability to rotate their attack without a drop in quality. He is a crowd-pleaser, flair player and a cynical irritant, loathed by opposing players and fans. And having scored twice for Brazil against Ghana last Friday, there’s a decent chance Richarlison will be a World Cup winner by Christmas. Especially when you consider that Brazil are strong enough to have left Arsenal striker Jesus out of their latest squad. Jesus didn’t look such an obvious hit when Arsenal signed him from Manchester City. Pep Guardiola was unsure of his abilities as a top-class, out-and-out centre-forward. But Arteta had no doubts — and he’s being proved right. Both North London managers know what it takes to win the Premier League. Conte did it himself at Chelsea, while Arteta assisted Guardiola in back-to-back title-winning campaigns at the Etihad. Can either of them finish above City this season? It’s highly doubtful. But if there is a winner on Saturday, in a fixture which feels unusually significant so early in the campaign, then they must fancy their chances of at least being part of the title argument. And that would be as unfamiliar as watching Adams do the paso doble. SALUTE SARDAR I’M not sure how many armbands Harry Kane could fit around his bicep at the World Cup. The rainbow ‘One Love’ effort, which he will wear to promote LGBTQ+ equality, is a well-intentioned if largely meaningless, gesture against Qatari state homophobia. But England kick off their campaign against Iran, whose Islamic-extremist government subjugates women to a barbaric extent. Iran’s Bayer Leverkusen forward Sardar Azmoun bravely spoke out in favour of women’s-rights campaigners, claiming he ‘doesn’t care’ if it costs him his place at the World Cup. Now that is a protest of genuine meaning. England vs Iran – all you need to know for Three Lions’ openerUSA vs Wales – all the TV and live stream info for Dragons’ first World Cup match in 64 years GREA-T DINING AFTER Jack Grealish claimed that Graeme Souness has a ‘problem’ with him, the great Scotsman invited Manchester City’s £100million man for a night out together. The player has apparently accepted and he should go because sharing a meal with Souness is an enriching experience. Grealish should expect to find a warm, decent, fascinating bloke — with far greater depth than his TV pundit persona — but also someone who genuinely feels angry when he believes a footballer is not fulfilling his potential. He should also expect to foot the bill. And for there to be some pricey champagne on it…  STORMING IT YOU might consider Jose Mourinho an outdated coach. But the fact the Portuguese appears on a new track, and video, by the rapper Stormzy — and it actually works — is testament to his enduring charisma. No other football manager could pull that off. JOE OVER AJ? WHILE Tyson Fury v Anthony Joshua would undoubtedly be the ‘biggest’ fight in British boxing history, would it currently be a contest between Britain’s best two heavyweights? After witnessing AJ’s recent struggles and Joe Joyce’s impressive KO of Joseph Parker, it’s tempting to rate Joyce as our second-best big man. Joe Joyce produced a stunning knockout to Joseph Parker on SaturdayGetty CHEAT STORM THERE was uproar at Lord’s when India’s women won a one-day international by virtue of Deepti Sharma executing a ‘Mankad’ run-out of England’s Charlie Dean at the non-striker’s end. This caused a predictable outcry of the ‘it’s just not cricket’ variety by those who falsely claim the game has ever been a haven for fair play. Sharma acted within cricket’s laws. And whenever elite women’s sport proves that it’s not all a bit too ‘nicey-nicey’ — as with the ultra-physical Euros football final between England and Germany — it’s a welcome slap round the chops for the misogynists who want to do it down.  HORNETS NEST GOOD luck to the new Watford boss Slaven Bilic. After the end of Rob Edwards’ 11-match reign, the average life span  of the last seven permanent Watford bosses — Edwards, Roy Hodgson, Claudio Ranieri, Xisco Munoz, Vladimir Ivic, Nigel Pearson and Quique Sanchez Flores — is 19 games. At that rate, Bilic can expect to be sacked on January 28. MIT THE JACKPOT ALEKSANDAR MITROVIC hit a hat-trick for Serbia against Sweden and it takes the Fulham striker’s tally to 47 goals in his last 57 internationals. That comes on top of the 49 he has scored in his last 50 league games. Yet most bookies are offering 66-1 against Mitrovic winning the World Cup Golden Boot — get in quick. ON THE MARK THE appointment of Mark Noble as West Ham’s sporting director just four months after he finished playing caused some predictable sniggering. But the long-serving former club captain has completed a Harvard Business degree and a deep knowledge of West Ham’s academy and senior squad. If Noble wasn’t a working-class bloke from Canning Town, there wouldn’t be nearly so much sneering.","pubDate":"2022-09-26 21:11:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WACA statues: Legends quit board over progressive CEO’s plan to honour diversity in cricket","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/waca-statues-legends-quit-board-over-progressive-ceos-plan-to-honour-diversity-in-cricket-c-8359382","keywords":null,"creator":["Peter Law"],"video_url":null,"description":"A plan to erect statues honouring fast bowling icon Dennis Lillee, female Test cricketer Zoe Goss and an Aboriginal cricketer was a flashpoint in the divide at the highest levels of WA cricket.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-26 21:00:00","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-8359382/d034a8045abcc8dc21dad69c67d57254e4b23231-16x9-x0y209w4000h2250.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LLC: हरभजन की मणिपाल टाइगर्स ने रोमांचक मुकाबले में इरफान की भीलवाड़ा किंग्स को 3 रन से हराया","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/news/sports/cricket-harbhajan-singh-manipal-tigers-beat-irfan-pathan-bhilwara-kings-by-3-runs-in-a-thrilling-match-4654443.html","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Legends League Cricket 2022: लीजेंड्स क्रिकेट लीग में सोमवार से कटक लेग के मैच स्टार्ट हुए. पहले मैच में मणिपाल टाइगर्स ने भीलवाड़ा किंग्स को रोमांचक मुकाबले में 3 रन हरा दिया. हरभजन की टीम टाइगर्स और इरफान पठान की टीम किंग्स के बीच कड़ा मुकाबला देखने को मिला.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-26 19:59:19","image_url":"https://images.news18.com/ibnkhabar/uploads/2022/09/Untitled7-16642213563x2.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=675","source_id":"hindinews18","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"‘I’ve always looked up to you’: Jemimah Rodrigues on Jhulan Goswami‘s retirement","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/womens-cricket/jhulan-goswami-retirement-ind-vs-eng-jemimah-rodrigues-tribute-indian-women-cricket-team/article65939419.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Team Sportstar  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"Goswami ended her career with 255 ODI wickets, the most in women’s cricket, in 204 matches.

Sharma has since claimed she gave Dean ‘repeated warnings’ about leaving her crease before running her out at the non-striker’s end, telling reporters: “It was a plan, because we had warned her [for leaving the crease early] repeatedly. “We did things as per the rules and guidelines.

The Men in Blue accomplished this feat after their win over Australia in the third and final ODI in Hyderabad. Chasing a challenging total of 187 set by Aaron Finch's Australia, India showed great character to chase the target with star batter Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav hitting fifties. Surya (69) and Kohli (63) helped the Men in Blue win their 21st T20I win of the year 2022, which is most by a team in a calendar year. The record was previously held by Pakistan, who had won 20 T20I matches in 2021. India has had a lot of match practice for themselves in the shortest format ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup , which will be played from October 16-November 13 this year. India started their year off with a 3-0 T20I series win over the West Indies in February 2022. Following up with another whitewash at home of Sri Lanka 3-0 in the same month. In June, another T20I home series against South Africa happened and the series ended in a 2-2 draw after the final match was washed out due to rain. India continued their winning ways in the shortest format with a 2-1 win in T20I against England in their own territory in July. In the same month, they had also defeated Ireland 2-0 at their home.

Hope from the team in the upcoming wc #INDvAUS #PakvsEngland @mufaddal_vohra #GOAT — Yash kumar (@kyash3931) September 26, 2022 In July-August, Men in Blue toured the Caribbean, where they defeated West Indies by 4-1 in five-match T20I series. This was followed by a rare blot on India's resume in T20Is this year, as they failed to defend their Asia Cup title in August-September this year, finishing third in the Super Four phase. After this Australia series, they will play a three-match T20I series against South Africa at home, which will start from September 28 onwards.India will start its T20 WC campaign against arch-rivals Pakistan on October 23.India could not even qualify for the final four last year as they crashed out of the tournament in the Super 12 phase. Coming to the third T20I against Australia, visitors Aussies posted 186/7 in their 20 overs. Cameron Green (52 off 21 balls) helped the Aussies get to an explosive start. But following that, spinners Yuzvendra Chahal (1/22) and Axar Patel (3/33) helped Men in Blue make a comeback, restricting Aussies' run flow and leaving them struggling at 117/6 in 13.5 overs. Then a 68-run stand between Tim David (54) and Daniel Sams (28*) helped the visitors reach 186/7 in their 20 overs. Axar was India's star with the ball and continued his good run in the series. Chahal, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Harshal Patel also got one wicket each. Chasing 187, Team India lost openers KL Rahul (1) and skipper Rohit Sharma (17) quickly, leaving them struggling at 2/30. Then Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav stitched a quickfire 104-run stand in 62 balls, with Yadav smashing Aussies all over the park and Virat anchoring the innings after scoring some quick runs in his first 20 balls. Yadav`s dismissal for 69 off 36 to Josh Hazlewood broke the stand. Following that, Virat brought up his half-century and looked to finish off the game, but was caught by skipper Aaron Finch on a Sams delivery for a well-made 63 off 48. Hardik Pandya (25* off 16 balls) finished the game for India with a four, with one ball to spare. Team India finished their innings at 187/4, winning the game by six wickets. Sams (2/33) bowled well for Aussies. Hazlewood and Pat Cummins also took a wicket each.Suryakumar Yadav was adjudged as 'Man of the Match' for his fifty.

Interestingly, the MCA election has been scheduled two days after the BCCI election in the same premises. With MCA having nominated former president Ashish Shelar, a political heavyweight of the Bharatiya Janata Party, as its representative for the BCCI annual general meeting, it will be interesting to see if Shelar throws his hat in the ring for the MCA top job. Former India allrounder and head coach Sandeep Patil has made his intentions of contesting for the president’s post clear. It remains to be seen if Patil, who had withdrawn from the race three years ago, actually files his nomination papers from the Sharad Pawar Group, the erstwhile Bal Mahaddalkar Group. Incumbent Vijay Patil is uncertain to contest, with vice-president Amol Kale and T20 league chairman Milind Narvekar also eyeing the president’s post. While Kale is a close aide of deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Narvekar’s proximity to former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is well-documented. Secretary Sanjay Naik is set to run for another term, but is likely to be challenged by apex council member Ajinkya Naik from the Pawar group.

On the fourth ball of the 44th over, Deepti saw Charlie venturing out of the crease at the non-striker's end while in her delivery stride and knocked the bails off, giving India a 16-run win and 3-0 ODI series sweep over England. Charlie was left in tears after the dismissal ended her gritty knock at 47 and was comforted by Freya, which left the cricketing world divided over the legal mode of the dismissal, with majority of England cricketers calling it against the spirit of the game. After touching down at Kolkata airport, Deepti said,\"It was a plan (to do the run-out fo Charlie from non-striker's end), because we had warned her (for leaving the crease early) repeatedly. Whatever we did things was as per the rules and guidelines. We had told the umpires as well. But still she (Charlie Dean) was there (outside the crease).

Charlie was dismissed legitimately, India were deserved winners of the match and the series. But no warnings were given. They don't need to be given, so it hasn't made the dismissal any less legitimate. But if they're comfortable with the decision to affect the run out, India shouldn't feel the need to justify by lying about warnings.\" Earlier, on Sunday, while welcoming the debate on the run-out from non-striker's end, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in a statement called for batters to remain in their crease till the time the ball leaves the bowler's hand. \"The Law is clear, as it needs to be for all umpires to be able to easily interpret throughout all levels of the game and at all moments in the game. Cricket is a broad church and the spirit by which it is played is no different.

Then dismissals, such as the one seen yesterday, cannot happen. Whilst yesterday was indeed an unusual end to an exciting match, it was properly officiated and should not be considered as anything more.\" Previously in the year, the MCC amended the game's Laws to move being run out at the non-striker's end from being deemed \"unfair play\" in Law 41 to \"run out\" in Law 38. MCC said the change is only due to come into effect from October 1 but \"this was done to clarify this matter and to place an onus on batters to ensure that they do not leave the crease at the non-striker's end, prior to a bowler releasing the ball.\"","pubDate":"2022-09-26 13:29:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Lying’: Cricket rocked as scandal erupts","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/england-captain-blasts-india-over-lying-as-mankad-scandal-explodes/news-story/d0569c8f335d94383e4636ff672be5de","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries","Swoop"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket’s most infamous debate has opened a massive can of worms as England and India go to war over the Mankad.","content":"India wrapped up a 3-0 series whitewash with a 16-run win in the third and final ODI on Saturday, when Deepti Sharma ran England’s Charlie Dean out at the nonstriker’s end, an act colloquially known as a “Mankad”.Catch the T20 World Cup Live on Kayo. Don’t Risk Missing All Your Teams’ Matches. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >Dean, who was on 47 at the time, wandered out of the crease while Sharma was in her delivery stride, and the Indian all-rounder quickly spun around and dislodged the bails.The fans in the stands were left in disbelief by the scenes as the Mankad had long been a controversial form of dismissal.The term “Mankading” was coined 70 years ago when Indian great Vinoo Mankad twice ran out Bill Brown at the bowler’s end during India’s tour of Australia in 1947.Although rare, every time it comes up, it proves a divisive topic, and it’s bound to resurface much more often in the future now it’s been enshrined in cricket’s laws.In March, Marylebone Cricket Club, the sport’s custodians and lawmakers, removed running out the nonstriker from the “Unfair Play” section of the Laws, making it a legitimate form of dismissal.The International Cricket Council endorsed the decision last week.But the drama hasn’t gone away as England skipper Heather Knight accused India of “lying” after the visitors claimed they had warned Dean before dismissing her.After arriving back in Indai, Sharma said she and her team had done nothing wrong. “That was our plan because she was repeatedly doing it and we had warned them too,” she told reporters.“We had also informed the umpires. But still she was right there so there wasn’t much we could do. We did everything according to the rules and guidelines.” Indian cricketers and pundits were supporting of Sharma’s position. Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur saying: “I don’t think it was any crime.” But Knight, who missed the series after undergoing recent hip surgery hit back via social media, admitting it was a legitimate dismissal but accused India of “lying”.“The game is over, Charlie was dismissed legitimately. India were deserved winners of the match and the series,” Knight began. “But no warnings were given. They don’t need to be given, so it hasn’t made the dismissal any less legitimate …“But if they’re comfortable with the decision to affect the run out, India shouldn’t feel the need to justify it by lying about warnings.”Dean clearly didn’t believe she had been given any warnings, bursting into tears after the result.However, she clearly moved on quickly, making a joke the following day for the South Vipers in the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy at Lord’s, when she mocked a Mankad of her own before laughing it off.The debate has raged in cricket circles however, forcing the MCC to reiterate the dismissal was within the rules of the game.“MCC’s message to nonstrikers continues to be to remain in their ground until they have seen the ball leave the bowler’s hand. Then dismissals, such as the one seen yesterday, cannot happen,” it said in a statement.“Whilst yesterday was indeed an unusual end to an exciting match, it was properly officiated and should not be considered as anything more.” The cricket world has been left divided on the issue, which has long been considered against the spirit of the sport.“You surely don’t train all your lives to win a game using that tactic … and I know batters should train to stay behind the line but it stinks seeing a game won like that,” former England men’s captain Michael Vaughan tweeted.India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, whose Mankad run-out of England’s Jos Buttler in an Indian Premier League match in 2019 was widely criticised, also joined the debate on social media.“How about awarding that wicket to the bowler for ‘presence of mind’ under immense pressure and of course knowing the social stigma that he/she would have to deal with post doing it,” he wrote on Twitter. “How about a bravery award to go with it too @ICC?”England batter Alex Hales added: “It shouldn’t be difficult for the non striker to stay in their crease til the ball has left the hand …”With AFP","pubDate":"2022-09-26 13:18:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"लीजेंड्स लीग क्रिकेट: इरफान के भीलवाड़ा किंग्स के इरादों पर पानी फेर सकते हैं गुजरात जाएंट्स और मणिपाल टाइगर्स","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/news/sports/cricket-legends-league-cricket-gujarat-giants-and-manipal-tigers-challenge-irfan-pathans-bhilwara-kings-4651401.html","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Legends League Cricket: भीलवाड़ा किंग्स को इरफान पठान, फिडेल एडवर्ड्स, टीनो बेस्ट, मोंटी पनेसर और एस. श्रीसंत से बड़ी उम्मीदें हैं. लीजेंड्स लीग क्रिकेट में उनके सामने हरभजन सिंह, मोहम्मद कैफ, ब्रेट ली, लॉन्स क्लूजनर, डैरेन सैमी, कोरी एंडरसन, इमरान ताहिर जैसे दिग्गजों की चुनौती है.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-26 13:05:26","image_url":"https://images.news18.com/ibnkhabar/uploads/2022/09/Bhilwara-Kings-LLC-C1-16641974563x2.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=675","source_id":"hindinews18","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"\"Instead Of Intense Debates...\": Kapil Dev Suggests A \"Better Solution\" After Deepti Sharma's Run-Ou.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L2luc3RlYWQtb2YtaW50ZW5zZS1kZWJhdGVzLWthcGlsLWRldi1zdWdnZXN0cy1hLWJldHRlci1zb2x1dGlvbi1hZnRlci1kZWVwdGktc2hhcm1hcy1ydW4tb3V0LW9mLWNoYXJsaWUtZGVhbi0zMzc4ODc00gGaAWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvaW5zdGVhZC1vZi1pbnRlbnNlLWRlYmF0ZXMta2FwaWwtZGV2LXN1Z2dlc3RzLWEtYmV0dGVyLXNvbHV0aW9uLWFmdGVyLWRlZXB0aS1zaGFybWFzLXJ1bi1vdXQtb2YtY2hhcmxpZS1kZWFuLTMzNzg4NzQvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"\"Instead Of Intense Debates...\": Kapil Dev Suggests A \"Better Solution\" After Deepti Sharma's Run-Ou..  NDTV Sports'We had warned her' - Deepti Sharma on the Charlie Dean dismissal  ESPNcricinfoMCC clarify position on Charlie Dean dismissal at Lord's  ICC CricketDeepti Sharma is the latest to be crucified by cricket’s self-appointed godmen | Mint  MintDelhi Traffic Police Use Deepti Sharma's Run-out to Raise Road Safety Awareness, Internet Loves It  News18View Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-26 12:43:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Anushka Sharma posts THIS for husband Virat Kohli after Team India's win in 3rd T20I vs Australia","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-vs-aus-3rd-t20i-anushka-sharma-cant-keep-calm-as-chasemaster-virat-kohli-hits-another-fifty-posts-this-message-for-husband-check-2514640.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Now, Kohli has 16,004 runs across T20I and ODI formats.

India lost the T20I series and won the ODI series by 3-0. The last and third ODI was played at Lord’s Stadium. Indian team batted first and scored 169 runs. England chased down the target of 170 to win. However, the team lost all wickets in 43.3 overs and scored just 153 runs. Deepti Sharma had run out Charlie Dean, the last wicket of the England team. Deepti had run out Charlie at the non-striker’s end. It will go by the rules of cricket. However, some people do not accept this. It has been reported that it will be declared a run out as per ICC Cricket Rules from 1st. This is what the English side has made controversial. “That is our plan. Because he tried to run out of the crease before releasing the ball. We had warned him about it a few times. But he kept doing it over and over again. So we got out according to the rules. There is nothing wrong in this,” said Deepti. It is noteworthy that Indian women’s cricket team captain Harmanpreet Kaur also extended her support to Deepti.

In the 1947 Test match against Australia in Sydney, Indian bowler Vinu Mankat ran out Australian Phil Brown in similar fashion. Munkat had run out the same Phil Brown in the practice match against Australia before that. Then the media criticized Mankat that he had ruined the honor of the game. But Australian legend Sir Donald Bradman has come out in favor of Vinu Mankat on this matter.

The runout, also wrongly referred to as ‘Mankading’ by many, happened when the last wicket stand between Dean and Freya Davies had reached 35, and England needed only 17 more runs to win from 39 balls. Deepti Sharma removed the bails while in her bowling action as she saw dean backing up way too much at the non-striker’s end. I find the debate of the Mankad really interesting. So many views from either side. I personally wouldn’t like to win a match like that, also, very happy for others to feel differently https://t.co/BItCNJZqYB Stuart Broad (@StuartBroad8) September 24, 2022 The Indian team appealed, and it was given out. By law, it was correct to run Dean out. However, the question came down to the spirit of the game as many England cricketers and cricket pundits termed it as being against the spirit, especially running out the last player to win a match that could have gone either way. Absolutely pathetic way to 'win' a cricket match. The whole India team should be ashamed of themselves. https://t.co/TrGcU8CwqW — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) September 24, 2022 Spot on. No intention of bowling the ball — James Anderson (@jimmy9) September 24, 2022 Is this different to fake fielding? Which is 5 penalty runs… Last thought, why is this tactic only ever used when all other tactics have failed and the game is slipping away? https://t.co/LzdFFNcmSe — Sam Billings (@sambillings) September 25, 2022 Deepti Sharma said \"We had warned Charlie Dean multiple times, even informed to the umpires about this and then we did run-out under the rules\". — Johns. (@CricCrazyJohns) September 26, 2022 Went back to the full match replay. Charlie Dean was leaving her crease early starting with her 2nd ball at the non-striker's end in the 18th over. Ball still in bowler's hand. Dean is never looking at the bowler to see if/when the ball has been released. Basic lack of awareness. pic.twitter.com/yRokOftidg — Peter Della Penna (@PeterDellaPenna) September 25, 2022 He then shows the screengrab of the replay from the 21st over, where Dean is at least six inches away from the crease, and her bat is not even grounded. In contrast to Dean, Peter gives the example of English skipper Amy Jones who has her bat grounded in the crease while backing up. This was just to show that only Dean was backing up so much outside the crease. Here's an even more egregious example a few overs later in the 21st. Dean doesn't even have her bat grounded. She's left her crease early, at least six inches outside, with the bat dangling in the air, before the bowler has the ball even close to delivery. pic.twitter.com/3V5R58yzfG — Peter Della Penna (@PeterDellaPenna) September 25, 2022 There is also an instance where Dean is inside the crease and notices the hand of the bowler to detect the movement of the ball. In the 30th over, Dean is seen out of the crease again, and Deepti looks at her from the corner of her eye, standing at short mid-off, noticing that she is standing out of her crease. This is the wicket of Amy Jones in 30th over. Dean is at least a foot out of the crease before Renuka is close to her release point. It's the 30th instance of Dean leaving the crease early. Deepti is looking at Renuka for release of ball but also has to notice Dean leaving early. pic.twitter.com/rLYI5KXUUc — Peter Della Penna (@PeterDellaPenna) September 25, 2022 Peter further shows that Dean’s partner at the other end during the last wicket partnership, Davies is constantly inside her crease and looks at the bowler’s hand while delivering the ball. Finally, in the over before the dismissal, Dean is again constantly seen being ahead in her stride while backing up, trying to get a quick single. Same 37th over that Davies is keenly watching Deepti release the ball and staying well in the crease before delivery, Dean pays no attention. Head start of at least 12 inches again looking for quick single. This is her 50th instance of leaving non-striker's end before delivery. pic.twitter.com/Y9ofm1NKah — Peter Della Penna (@PeterDellaPenna) September 25, 2022 In the over that she got out, Dean left the crease twice before the ball was delivered. It was after the first two digressions in the over that Deepti decided to remove the bails. In total, Dean had left the crease 72 times before the bowler delivered the ball, and she got out on the 73rd digression. Deepti breaks the bails before the 4th ball is delivered. Indian huddle looks pretty content with the decision to appeal on field while it is sent to the third umpire. No ambivalence whatsoever from Harmanpreet. pic.twitter.com/Mxo8zetYcs — Peter Della Penna (@PeterDellaPenna) September 26, 2022 When she batted with Amy Jones, she generally got a head start of 3-6 inches. But batting with Cross & Davies, the No 10 & 11, her starts were much bigger, typically at least a foot early, and when both were new to the crease, it was as much as 2 feet early to try to get strike. — Peter Della Penna (@PeterDellaPenna) September 26, 2022","pubDate":"2022-09-26 11:18:00","image_url":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1220926/thumb-122092600790.jpg","source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan watched the 3rd T20 match between IND vs AUS.","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/governor-tamilisai-soundararajan-watched-the-3rd-t20-match-between-ind-vs-aus/","keywords":["Sports","Australia","Cricket","game","India","tamilisai soundararajan"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Hyderabad: Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has witnessed the third T20 match between India and Australia.

The dismissal reignited an intense debate over the 'spirit of the game'. \"Woh plan tha hum logon ka, kyunki woh baar baar... Hum warn bhi kar chuke the usko. Jo rules mein hain, jo guidelines hain, uske according hi humne kiya (We had planned this as she was not paying heed to our repeated warnings. We acted according to the rules and the guidelines),\" Deepti told reporters upon her arrival here. Reduced to 118 for nine in their pursuit of 170 in the third ODI, England's chase was led by their No 9 batter Dean who revived their hopes with her last wicket partnership with Freya Davies. With 17 needed to win, Dean was run out for 47 with the veteran Indian off-spinner deciding to clip the bails during her delivery stride to put an end to their 35-run partnership that gave India 3-0 sweep. It was also Jhulan Goswami's swansong game. The run-out is currently listed in the 'Unfair Play' section of the laws but is set to be moved to the 'Run Out' section at the start of next month when an update in the ICC Playing Conditions comes into effect. Deepti further pointed out that they had informed the umpires before running out Dean. \"Umpires ko bola tha hum logon ne, but still woh wahin par thi. Hum log kuchh nahin kar sakte the. (We did inform the umpires, but she continued to do it. There was nothing we could do),\" the 25-year-old added. The 39-year-old Jhulan, who has a record 355 wickets across formats, retired from international cricket in the final ODI as India secured their first-ever 3-0 sweep on English soil to give the legendary Indian pacer a fitting farewell. Having made her debut in 2002, Jhulan ended up playing 12 Tests, 204 ODIs and 68 T20Is. \"Har team ko jeetna hota hai, aur last match mein hum chahte the ki hum jitke unko (Jhulan) acha farewell de, toh uske hisaab se, as a team, jo effort daal sakte the woh humne diya.
