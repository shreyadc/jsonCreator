The Queensland Academy was producing top notch cricketers at a rate and Amarasuriya had ambitious plans. A keen sports enthusiast who loved both rugby and cricket, Amarasuriya wasn’t just interested in producing fine cricketers, but giving a professional outlook on them as well. The academy that he introduced taught players essentials of life such as managing finances, cricket history, etiquette and English among many other things. Sadly, once Amarasuriya left office, the academy stationed at RPS ceased to exist. His visionary thinking should have been carried forward. Along with the academy came the program called Pace Ace, a unit headed by Rumesh Ratnayake and supported by Champaka Ramanayake. Those days Sri Lanka were solely depending on Chaminda Vaas and the need to have more fast-bowling resources was felt. Not only did the two coaches work with the next crop of quicks, but they also went headhunting for promising talents and were able to spot the likes of Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekara, just to name a few. Similarly, you see several young fast bowlers coming up in recent years and it seems that Sri Lanka’s fast bowling strengths are better than spin options. Usually, it is the other way around. You have got to give credit to SLC’s District and Provincial coaches who have done an excellent job over the years in grooming rare talents. Hambantota district where just a handful of schools play the game of cricket has produced the cream of the nation’s fast bowlers in recent years. There is Kasun Rajitha, Dilshan Madushanka and Pramod Madushan. Of course, there is also workhorse Suranga Lakmal, whose journey from Debarawewa to Derbyshire has been quite sensational. The only captain to have won a Test match in Barbados, the fortress of West Indies cricket, is not Imran Khan, not Kapil Dev, not Arjuna Ranatunga but Lakmal. It is the return of Dushmantha Chameera lead up to the World Cup Qualifiers that has enabled Sri Lanka to breathe easy. The quickest man in Sri Lankan colours is going to knock over the associate nations. He returned to international cricket this month after a seven-month layoff due to surgery and was quite a handful troubling the Afghans with his pace and not too often a Sri Lankan quick ends up as Player of the Series at home. There maybe not much cricket left in Chameera as he has been constantly injured and rarely fulfilled his promise. The team management has carefully looked after his workload but even then he struggled with fitness and Sri Lanka will be hoping that he won’t break down this year which is very crucial with the Asia Cup and World Cup coming up. Lahiru Kumara is capable of challenging Chameera when it comes to pace. Kumara at times struggles with his control whereas Chameera is on the money and tempts batters to take risks with his tight bowling. The most improved bowler of them all is Kasun Rajitha, who has taken over Lakmal’s role since the tall quick retired last year. It is Rajitha’s discipline and his ability to move the ball that has proved to be handy and often he provides a breakthrough earlier on. All the talk is about left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka, who became the highest paid player in LPL with teams bidding for his services fiercely. He will take home a cool US$ 92,000 for just two week’s work. But the left-arm seamer who doesn’t get much attention is Binura Fernando. Standing at six feet and six inches, the former D.S. Senanayake College cricketer generates a steep bounce thanks to his height. Matheesha Pathirana provides raw pace and his slingy action has not only earned him the nickname ‘podi Malinga’ but also has given Chennai Super Kings a quality death bowling option as they went onto win the IPL this season. The former Trinity player is yet to convert his success in franchise cricket into international cricket and questions remain whether he will be effective in the 50 over format. The fact is Pathirana is just 20 and he will learn as he goes along and will win Sri Lanka lots of games in years to come. Gradually, Sri Lanka’s attack has become pace oriented than spin. Wonder whether the curators should prepare pitches accordingly for home games. Not many pacemen barring Vaas and Malinga have had a major impact for Sri Lanka for a long period of time. You just get the feeling that all that is set to change.

Published on By Bangladesh will host the Indian women’s team for a white-ball series in July. Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, Bangladesh Cricket Board’s women’s wing chairman, confirmed the development to Cricbuzz. “Yes, we will be playing a white-ball series against India women’s national cricket team in July and all the matches will be played in Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium,” said Nadel. It will be the first time in 11 years the SBNS will host a women’s international game. The last time the Bangladesh women’s team played at this venue was in 2012 against South Africa. All the matches will be day-affairs as per the draft itinerary prepared for the series and obtained by Cricbuzz. The Indian team will arrive in Dhaka on July 6 to play three ODIs and as many T20Is. The T20Is are scheduled on July 9, 11 and 13 while the three ODIs will be played on July 16, 19 and 22. Published on By Ace fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been named in Pakistan’s Test squad for the forthcoming series in and against Sri Lanka, marking his return to the longest form of the game at the very country he played the last of his 25 Tests so far. The national selectors have also handed maiden call-ups to batter Mohammad Hurraira and all-rounder Aamir Jamal in the 16-member squad. Afridi suffered a knee injury in the first Test at Galle last year. It subsequently left him requiring a lengthy recovery and rehabilitation program that forced him out of the Asia Cup. Another injury suffered at the T20 World Cup in Australia meant the 23-year-old didn’t feature in any of the Tests of the home season. He is one short of the 100-wicket mark in the format and has taken his wickets at a very impressive average of 24.85. “I am very excited to be returning to the Pakistan Test side after a year. I dearly missed Test cricket and it was tough for me to be away from this format,” Shaheen was quoted as saying in a PCB media release. “After missing our entire home season because of the injury I suffered in Sri Lanka, I am eager to make an impactful comeback in the same country and complete a century of wickets in Test cricket. I want to thank my fans who have provided me support in tough times and I am ready for the challenges ahead.” Meanwhile, the call-up for Hurraira, the 21-year-old batter from Sialkot, had seemed imminent after an impressive run in the domestic circuit, where he topped the batting charts in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for two seasons in a row. In 11 matches last season, Hurraira hit 1024 at 73.14 including four centuries and two half-centuries. Hurraira will be joined by his Northern teammate Jamal. The 26-year-old from Mianwali topped the bowling charts last season, finishing with 31 wickets at 29.71 including two five-fers. Jamal played two T20Is for the national team against England late last year. “I want to congratulate all the players who have been selected in the side, especially Mohammad Huraira and Aamir Jamal who have pushed their case through impressive performances over a period of time,” chief selector Haroon Rashid said. “The conditions in Sri Lanka largely favour finger spinners – something that we have seen over the years and during Pakistan’s last visit to the island – so we have three such bowlers to go with the mystery spin of Abrar Ahmed. At the same time, we cannot overlook the need for fast bowlers and, as such, we have included four pacers so the captain and team management have ample resources on the tour. We boast a strong batting line-up, which I am confident will do well in the two matches.” Meanwhile, PCB have confirmed the appointment of former South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel as the teams’ bowling coach. Morkel will join the squad on July 3 for a pre-series camp in Karachi before the team’s departure for Sri Lanka on July 9. The tour itinerary will be subsequently released.

The national selectors have also handed maiden call-ups to batter Mohammad Hurraira and all-rounder Aamir Jamal in the 16-member squad. Afridi suffered a knee injury in the first Test at Galle last year. It subsequently left him requiring a lengthy recovery and rehabilitation program that forced him out of the Asia Cup. Another injury suffered at the T20 World Cup in Australia meant the 23-year-old didn’t feature in any of the Tests of the home season. He is one short of the 100-wicket mark in the format and has taken his wickets at a very impressive average of 24.85. “I am very excited to be returning to the Pakistan Test side after a year. I dearly missed Test cricket and it was tough for me to be away from this format,” Shaheen was quoted as saying in a PCB media release. “After missing our entire home season because of the injury I suffered in Sri Lanka, I am eager to make an impactful comeback in the same country and complete a century of wickets in Test cricket. I want to thank my fans who have provided me support in tough times and I am ready for the challenges ahead.” Meanwhile, the call-up for Hurraira, the 21-year-old batter from Sialkot, had seemed imminent after an impressive run in the domestic circuit, where he topped the batting charts in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for two seasons in a row. In 11 matches last season, Hurraira hit 1024 at 73.14 including four centuries and two half-centuries. Hurraira will be joined by his Northern teammate Jamal. The 26-year-old from Mianwali topped the bowling charts last season, finishing with 31 wickets at 29.71 including two five-fers. Jamal played two T20Is for the national team against England late last year. “I want to congratulate all the players who have been selected in the side, especially Mohammad Huraira and Aamir Jamal who have pushed their case through impressive performances over a period of time,” chief selector Haroon Rashid said. “The conditions in Sri Lanka largely favour finger spinners – something that we have seen over the years and during Pakistan’s last visit to the island – so we have three such bowlers to go with the mystery spin of Abrar Ahmed. At the same time, we cannot overlook the need for fast bowlers and, as such, we have included four pacers so the captain and team management have ample resources on the tour. We boast a strong batting line-up, which I am confident will do well in the two matches.” Meanwhile, PCB have confirmed the appointment of former South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel as the teams’ bowling coach. Morkel will join the squad on July 3 for a pre-series camp in Karachi before the team’s departure for Sri Lanka on July 9. The tour itinerary will be subsequently released. Squad: Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (vc & wk), Aamir Jamal, Abdullah Shafique, Abrar Ahmed, Hasan Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Huraira, Mohammad Nawaz, Naseem Shah, Noman Ali, Salman Ali Agha, Sarfaraz Ahmed (wk), Saud Shakeel, Shaheen Afridi and Shan Masood Published on By Usman Khawaja’s century, backed up by fifties from Travis Head and Alex Carey, has allowed Australia to stage a fightback on Day 2 of the first Ashes Test in Edgbaston, on Saturday. Khawaja, who stroked his maiden ton in England, went to stumps unbeaten on 124 – having batted through the day. He had the company of Carey, who was unbeaten on 52, and had added a 91-run stand before the end of the day’s play. For much of the day though, England were on the front foot after Stuart Broad had struck twice in the seventh over of the morning. First, he dismissed David Warner (14th time in the Ashes) when the southpaw dragged a length delivery outside the off on to his stumps. And then, had Marnus Labuschagne caught behind with an outswinger. England were on the offensive, with Ben Stokes being unconventional and proactive with his field changes. Steve Smith and Khawaja nullified the attack for an hour with a dour 38-run partnership before the former was trapped leg-before with a Stokes delivery that jagged back in – in what was only his second over of the innings. Smith took a review but to no avail. With three wickets down, for only 64 runs, England had owned the morning session and seized control of the contest. However, after Tea, the momentum started to shift. The in-form Travis Head took charge of the counter-attack, of which Moeen Ali was largely at the receiving end. It had started out with Khawaja, who danced down the track and hit the offspinner for a six in only the third over of the post-lunch session. However, Khawaja was kept in control by England’s short-ball tactic, which had the opener in a bit of an uncomfortable space. Head, however, didn’t hold back on the cuts and the pulls. He departed soon after bringing up his 14th Test fifty, chipping Moeen Ali’s flattish delivery to midwicket, handing the offspinner his maiden scalp on Test comeback. Moeen could’ve had another wicket to his name only two deliveries later when Cameron Green stepped out and attempted a big shot, only to be deceived by the turn. However, Jonny Bairstow missed a regulation stumping opportunity. Green was subdued thereafter and helped Australia head to Tea without any further damage. His only attack came against Joe Root in the last over before Tea when he hit the part-timer for two boundaries through the offside. However, soon after the Tea break, Moeen eventually had his man – beating him in flight, with drift, dip and turn to knock over his stumps. Green, by then, had scored 38 runs and stitched a valuable 72-run partnership with Khawaja. Nonetheless, that happened to be the only dismissal of the last session. England could’ve had another when Stuart Broad knocked over Khawaja’s stumps only two balls after the second new ball was taken. However, the third umpire noted that he had overstepped, offering Khawaja a life when he was batting on 112. The opener shut shop and went on to add only 12 runs thereafter in the last hour of play when Carey had taken the mantle of attacking the English bowlers. The ‘keeper-batter was always on a lookout for scoring opportunities, hitting on the up, over the in-field and at times, even just short of fielders. He brought up his fifty with a lucky boundary after getting an outside edge for a boundary while looking to attack Moeen Ali, only to be deceived by the spinner. England used seven bowling options on the day, but the bulk of the work was handed to Moeen, who got some assistance from the wicket but was also on the line of attack of the Australian batters. He picked two wickets in 29 overs, but ended up conceding 124 runs. Brief scores: England 393/8 decl. (Joe Root 112*, Jonny Bairstow 78, Zak Crawley 61; Nathan Lyon 4-149, Josh Hazlewood 2-61) Australia 311/5 (Usman Khawaja 124*, Alex Carey 52*, Travis Head 50; Stuart Broad 2-49, Moeen Ali 2-124) by 82 runs Published on By ( Nearly 40 pupils have been killed at a school in western Uganda by rebels linked to the Islamic State group (IS). Five militants attacked the Lhubiriha secondary school in Mpondwe at around 23:30 (20:30 GMT) on Friday. They entered dormitories, setting fire and using machetes to kill and maim the pupils, officials said. The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) – based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – have been blamed and a manhunt is under way. More than 60 people are educated at the school, most of whom live there. Uganda’s information minister said 37 students were confirmed to have been killed, but did not give their ages. Twenty of them were attacked with machetes and 17 of them burned to death, Chris Baryomunsi told the BBC. Survivors said the rebels threw a bomb into the dormitory after the machete attack. It is not clear if this resulted in a fire in the building which was reported earlier. Six students were also abducted to carry food that the rebels stole from the school’s stores, he added. The militants then returned across the border into the DRC. Some of the bodies are said to have been badly burnt and DNA tests will need to be carried out to identify them. Eight people remain in a critical condition after the attack. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the “appalling act” and called for those behind it to be brought to justice.

The Queenslander rescued Australia on day two of the Edgbaston Test with an unbeaten 126, batting through the entire day and guiding the visitors towards 5-311 at stumps, still trailing England by 82 runs. It was his 15th Test century, putting him ahead of Michael Slater and Ian Chappell on the all-time tally, but also his first in the United Kingdom — he received support from Cameron Green (38) along with South Australian duo Travis Head (50) and Alex Carey (52 not out). ASHES MATCH CENTRE: Edgbaston Test scorecard, stats BROAD GETS WARNER AGAIN in double strike | 00:57 Khawaja’s rearguard came after England seamer Stuart Broad tore through Australia’s top order in the morning session, with recalled spinner Moeen Ali also striking twice in the afternoon. However, the hosts were left to rue three missed chances in the evening session, including a dropped catch, a missed stumping and a front-foot no-ball, which left the Ashes opener on a knife-edge ahead of day three. Khawaja had averaged 17.78 in England before this week’s Edgbaston Test, passing fifty just once in 14 innings. The left-hander was dropped from Australia’s Test side on previous tours to the United Kingdom in 2013 and 2019, recently confessing he thought England was “the toughest place in the world to bat” . But the 36-year-old has finally gotten the monkey off his back, adding another chapter to his remarkable Test resurgence. “I think it was a culmination of three Ashes tours to England, and being dropped on two of them,” Khawaja said of his emotional celebration. “I don’t read the media, but when I’m getting sprayed in the nets and getting sprayed when I’m walking out there that I can’t bat in England, I guess it was just a bit more emotional than normal.” Get all the latest cricket news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail.

Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: Getty Images The start of day two was delayed by five minutes due to light showers in Birmingham, and Australia started the morning session with three consecutive maidens, eclipsing the total number of maidens from England’s first innings. Khawaja broke the shackles in the ninth over with an elegant pull shot, his first of many on Saturday. Australia’s openers put together 29 before Broad claimed back-to-back wickets in the eleventh over, including his 15th dismissal of David Warner in Tests. The left-hander attempted a reckless swipe without any footwork, chopping back onto his stumps and departing for 9. Marnus Labuschagne, the world’s No. 1 Test batter, fell for a golden duck the following ball after fending outside off stump, edging behind to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow, who claimed a one-handed grab low to his right. Moeen produces moment of magic! | 00:27 Khawaja and Steve Smith steadied the ship, combining for a 38-run partnership for the third wicket before England captain Ben Stokes intervened. The Durham all-rounder, who has been nursing a long-term knee injury, nipped a length delivery past Smith’s inside edge, trapping him on the pads LBW. A perplexed Smith quickly called for a review, but the Australian vice-captain trudged back to the sheds after three red lights appeared on Hawkeye, prompting wild scenes from the stands. Smith, who had dominated England’s bowlers four years ago with twin centuries at the same venue, was gone for 16. “Let’s face it, the Aussies were bullied … Bazball is bullying the Aussies at the moment,” former Test spinner Steve O’Keefe said on Channel 9. “It just looks like negative cricket, an un-Australian way of playing. “Australia is on the back foot, tentative with their footwork, and it’s not working for them at the moment. “They’re doing the complete contrast to what England did in their first innings.” Khawaja continued about his business at the other end, bringing up his half-century in 106 deliveries early in the afternoon session. Smith GONE as England take 3rd wicket | 00:38 England’s pace bowlers troubled Head with a bouncer barrage after the lunch break, but the South Australian wasn’t afraid to counter-attack, regularly slapping off-spinner Ali over mid-on. Head raced towards a half-century in just 60 deliveries but fell victim to Ali moments later, chipping a catch towards mid-wicket to give the tweaker his first Test wicket since 2021. Ali should have had a second scalp later that over when Green charged at a delivery that turned and beat his inside edge — but Bairstow missed the regulation stumping. The error proved costly, with Green and Khawaja combining for a 72-run partnership for the fifth wicket to slowly chip away at the deficit. Once again, Ali came to England’s rescue, bowling Green with an absolute peach that drifted away from the right-hander and spun sharply out of the rough, crashing into middle stump. Khawaja brought up his exquisitely crafted hundred after tea with a delicate late cut through third man, roaring with delight after reaching the milestone. The emotional Queenslander pumped his fists and tossed his bat away in celebration before removing his helmet and looking to the skies. “He’s given us the dab, the shuffle, now the bat throw,” Head said of Khawaja’s celebration on Sky Sports . “It’s a huge weight off his shoulders. I guess as an international cricketer, everyone talks about hundreds overseas and he hasn’t had the greatest of times leading into this series. “I know he is determined and once he got through that new ball on that wicket, he played beautifully.” Bairstow’s day went from bad to worse after dropping a chance off Joe Root’s bowling in the 80th over, gifting rival wicketkeeper Carey a second life on 26. England took the second new ball and Broad immediately broke through Khawaja’s defences, bowling the Australian opener with a gem — but the centurion, on 112 at the time, was called back after replays showed that Broad had overstepped. It was the 36-year-old sixth no-ball of the day. “It was a great ball, I felt like I had slid,” Broad told Sky Sports at stumps. “Today I probably bowled more no-balls than I did in my career.” Carey’s good fortune continued in the 92nd over when an outside edge off Ali’s bowling bisected the wicketkeeper and first slip, also bringing up his fifth Test half-century. Khawaja and Carey (52 not out) made the most of their reprieves, combining for an unbeaten 91-run partnership for the sixth wicket to put Australia in arguably the preferred position at stumps. “I think it was a pretty good day actually,” Broad continued. “It has been a slow, turgid pitch so to be still 82 runs ahead of Australia with Pat Cummins and the tail next, we are pretty happy. “Things could happen pretty quickly for us in the first hour tomorrow and there wasn’t a lot in that pitch today. “Ultimately, our aim is for Australia to bat last on that and for us to bowl last on that and hopefully it keeps deteriorating.”","pubDate":"2023-06-17 22:53:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stuart Broad’s scheme pays off before Ben Stokes’ captaincy masterstroke: Day 2 Talking Points","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/the-ashes/stuart-broads-scheme-pays-off-before-ben-stokes-captaincy-masterstroke-day-2-talking-points/news-story/8b173dfcd8d49ca0e56f626392139701","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Usman Khawaja was the hero for Australia on day two of the Edgbaston Test, scoring a 15th Test century and guiding the visitors towards 5-311 at stumps, still trailing England by 82 runs.","content":"Usman Khawaja was the hero for Australia on day two of the Edgbaston Test , scoring a 15th Test century and guiding the visitors towards 5-311 at stumps, still trailing England by 82 runs. England was seemingly on top after claiming three wickets in the morning session, including the crucial scalps of Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith, but Khawaja’s rearguard ensured the Test match was delicately poised ahead of day three. Stuart Broad and Moeen Ali each snared two wickets, while South Australians Travis Head (50) and Alex Carey (52 not out) provided valuable contributions with the bat. Smith GONE as England take 3rd wicket | 00:38 ‘INCREDIBLE’: BROAD’S SCHEME PAYS OFF Stuart Broad had never dismissed Marnus Labuschagne in red-ball Test cricket before this year’s Ashes series, and the England quick only needed one delivery at Edgbaston to rectify that. Having just knocked over Australian opener David Warner for 9 on Saturday morning, Broad revved up the Birmingham crowd before charging in and removing the world’s No. 1 Test cricketer for a golden duck. Broad’s outswinger kissed the outside edge of Labuschagne’s bat, with England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow taking a one-handed catch low to his right. The Australian No. 3 sheepishly trudged back to the sheds having fished at a delivery he should have left alone. “That was the perfect ball,” Broad told Sky Sports at stumps. “I’ve been looking to bowl that to Marnus by design … it was a plan I wanted to do, so to do it was really nice.” Get all the latest cricket news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail. Sign up now! Stuart Broad of England celebrates taking the wicket of Marcus Labuschagne. Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Earlier this year, Broad revealed he had been developing his outswinger with Nottinghamshire bowling coach Kevin Shine in the County Championship, and the changes were specifically designed to trouble Labuschagne and Steve Smith. “It’s the reason I wanted to change something, to try and bring their outside edge in more,” Broad said back in April. “My stock delivery will always be wobble seam trying to nip back on off stump, because I think that’s the most dangerous ball. But to (Labuschagne and Smith), I think dragging them across with away swing is quite important. So this action tweak is pretty much designed at those two, and it was good to see it really swinging away today. “You always have to be looking for something to improve … I’m constantly working on things in training to see if something can work to implement in games.” ‘THIS IS BAZBALL’: STOKES’ CAPTAINCY MASTERSTROKE Ben Stokes’ dismissal of Steve Smith was one of the decisive moments at Edgbaston on Saturday, but the Durham all-rounder’s aggressive captaincy also accounted for the dangerous Travis Head later in the afternoon session. Moeen Ali, playing his first Test match since August 2021, opened the bowling after lunch on day two, and Head immediately targeted the off-spinner, smacking seven boundaries including a belligerent six that sailed over long-off. Most captains would have pulled Ali out of the attack after he conceded 45 runs from his first six overs following the lunch break — but not Stokes. The England captain brought the mid-on and mid-off up, luring Head into once again attacking down the ground — and the South Australian took the bait. Head miscued the lofted drive and chipped a catch towards mid-wicket, departing for 50 and giving Ali his first Test wicket in almost two years. “It’s brilliant captaincy, it’s aggressive captaincy,” former England batter Kevin Pietersen said on Sky Sports commentary. Moeen produces moment of magic! | 00:27 As part of England’s ‘Bazball’ philosophy, Stokes was willing to leak runs to take wickets, sticking with aggressive field settings regardless of the match situation. “One of the most important things of that dismissal was the brave captaincy with Ben Stokes,” former Australian spinner Steve O’Keefe said on Channel 9. “What does Stokes do with Mooen Ali, who’d gone for 45 runs from six overs? He puts a second slip in and keeps a catching mid-wicket. “It’s just the bravery of this English team, playing Bazball and maintaining their consistency to pick up wickets.” The innovative Stokes called upon seven bowlers in the morning session, including part-timer Harry Brook. “What is going on here?” Australian legend Ricky Ponting said in commentary. Former England captain Mike Atherton responded: “This is Bazball.” ‘NEGATIVE CRICKET’: AUSTRALIA’S ‘TIMID’ BATTING Australia’s defensive field placement ruffled some feathers on Friday , but the visitors’ “timid” batting was what raised eyebrows early on day two of the Edgbaston Test. Runs were hard to come by for the Australians on Saturday morning, getting the action underway with a trio of maidens. After facing 12 consecutive dot balls, a frustrated David Warner threw his wicket away by playing a reckless shot outside off stump, departing cheaply for 9. “England have made it really hard for Australia to score,” Ponting said on Sky Sports . “You could argue that led to Warner’s dismissal. The scoreboard was going nowhere, the pressure built and Warner played a shot he probably wouldn’t have.” Australia was in dire straits at 2-29 when Marnus Labuschagne departed the following delivery — in response, Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith immediately stamped on the brakes, scoring at 2.37 runs per over throughout the morning session. It was a stark contrast to England’s aggressive approach the previous day, when they scored at 4.65 runs per overs in the morning session despite losing a handful of early wickets. “The intent probably hasn’t been quite where you would want it to be, but that’s the way they play,” Ponting continued. “I don’t think they have done anything different.” Steve Smith of Australia. Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Australia only scored 13 singles before lunch on day two, while England mustered 54 singles during Friday’s morning session, partly because of the defensive field settings. “It just looks like negative cricket, an un-Australian way of playing,” former Australian spinner Steve O’Keefe said on Channel 9. ”Australia is on the back foot, tentative with their footwork, and it’s not working for them at the moment. “They’re barely going at two runs an over and are doing … the complete contrast of what England did in their first innings when they had the chance to bat.” ENGLAND’S KEEPING GAMBLE BACKFIRES England’s decision to drop wicketkeeper Ben Foakes ahead of the Ashes came back to haunt them on day two of the Edgbaston Test. Australia was 4-148 in the 46th over when all-rounder Cameron Green, who was yet to score, skipped down the pitch and looked to attack England spinner Moeen Ali — but the all-rounder was beaten on the inside edge. However, England gloveman Jonny Bairstow missed the regulation stumping chance, handing Green an early reprieve. It proved a costly error — Green combined with Usman Khawaja for a 72-run partnership for the fifth wicket to revive Australia’s innings. “He’s very square on … that left hip’s not really opening or riding the bounce,” former Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara explained on Sky Sports commentary. “He also didn’t expect it to turn, and sometimes you have to anticipate it, know that it’s going to come at you through the gate — make that adjustment, take a step to your left, and if it beats the outside edge, you’ll still have a good sighter.” Former England captain Nasser Hussain continued: “He gets a good sighter of it. He sees the ball all the way, there’s no batter in the way or anything. “He’s got that ball in his vision absolutely perfectly, and then because it spins a long way he’s in the wrong place.” Jonny Bairstow of England. Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Bairstow’s day went from bad to worse when he dropped a catch off Joe Root’s bowling in the 80th over, gifting rival wicketkeeper Alex Carey a second life on 26. Earlier on day two, the Yorkshireman had taken a smart one-handed catch to remove Marnus Labuschagne for a golden duck, also plundering an entertaining 78 (78) in England’s first innings. Foakes, widely considered to be England’s best wicketkeeper, was axed ahead of the recent Lord’s Test against Ireland after Bairstow returned from his horrific leg injury. England couldn’t fit Bairstow, Foakes and Harry Brook in the same starting XI, and the Surrey wicketkeeper was the unlucky player forced to make way. Bairstow, who had not donned the gloves in a Test match since September 2021, was backed as England’s first-choice wicketkeeper for the Ashes in his absence, but the gamble backfired on Saturday afternoon. ‘SCARED EYES’: WARNER FALLS TO NEMESIS YET AGAIN It was almost inevitable. When David Warner hopped off the Australian team bus on Friday morning, an England fan yelled at the veteran opener: “Broady’s gonna get ya!” The prophecy came true just over 24 hours later. Stuart Broad dismissed his bunny for a 15th time on day two of the Edgbaston Test, removing Warner for 9 to continue his stranglehold over the Australian . The left-hander chopped back onto his stumps after slashing at a wide delivery in the eleventh over, sending the Birmingham crowd into a frenzy. His lack of footwork remains a glaring concern. BROAD GETS WARNER AGAIN in double strike | 00:57 Warner has now been dismissed by right-armed seamers from around the wicket in 11 consecutive Ashes innings in England, averaging 9.45 during that period. Broad utterly embarrassed Warner during the 2019 Ashes, dismissing him seven times while conceding just 35 runs across the series. The 36-year-old vowed to be more aggressive when facing Broad in England this year — and he certainly lived up to that promise. “When I’m at my best, I’m taking the bowlers on,” Warner told reporters in December. “I can probably be a bit more aggressive and go back to the older me, take them on a little bit more. “It’s about just having that comfort of backing yourself, and I always do that, but I felt a sense of responsibility to actually adapt to the wicket and conditions that were in front of me, but now it’s just going back to looking to score and then my defence will take care of itself.”","pubDate":"2023-06-17 22:52:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Khawaja, middle-order turn the tables on England","link":"http://island.lk/khawaja-middle-order-turn-the-tables-on-england/","keywords":["Latest News","Sports","Australia tour of England 2023","England vs Australia","Joe Root","The Ases Test","The Ashes","Usman Khawaja"],"creator":["Priyan"],"video_url":null,"description":"Usman Khawaja’s century, backed up by fifties from Travis Head and Alex Carey, has allowed Australia to stage a fightback on Day 2 of the first Ashes Test in Edgbaston, on Saturday.

He picked two wickets in 29 overs, but ended up conceding 124 runs. Brief scores: England 393/8 decl. (Joe Root 112*, Jonny Bairstow 78, Zak Crawley 61; Nathan Lyon 4-149, Josh Hazlewood 2-61) Australia 311/5 (Usman Khawaja 124*, Alex Carey 52*, Travis Head 50; Stuart Broad 2-49, Moeen Ali 2-124) by 82 runs Published on By Ace fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been named in Pakistan’s Test squad for the forthcoming series in and against Sri Lanka, marking his return to the longest form of the game at the very country he played the last of his 25 Tests so far. The national selectors have also handed maiden call-ups to batter Mohammad Hurraira and all-rounder Aamir Jamal in the 16-member squad. Afridi suffered a knee injury in the first Test at Galle last year. It subsequently left him requiring a lengthy recovery and rehabilitation program that forced him out of the Asia Cup. Another injury suffered at the T20 World Cup in Australia meant the 23-year-old didn’t feature in any of the Tests of the home season. He is one short of the 100-wicket mark in the format and has taken his wickets at a very impressive average of 24.85. “I am very excited to be returning to the Pakistan Test side after a year. I dearly missed Test cricket and it was tough for me to be away from this format,” Shaheen was quoted as saying in a PCB media release. “After missing our entire home season because of the injury I suffered in Sri Lanka, I am eager to make an impactful comeback in the same country and complete a century of wickets in Test cricket. I want to thank my fans who have provided me support in tough times and I am ready for the challenges ahead.” Meanwhile, the call-up for Hurraira, the 21-year-old batter from Sialkot, had seemed imminent after an impressive run in the domestic circuit, where he topped the batting charts in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for two seasons in a row. In 11 matches last season, Hurraira hit 1024 at 73.14 including four centuries and two half-centuries. Hurraira will be joined by his Northern teammate Jamal. The 26-year-old from Mianwali topped the bowling charts last season, finishing with 31 wickets at 29.71 including two five-fers. Jamal played two T20Is for the national team against England late last year. “I want to congratulate all the players who have been selected in the side, especially Mohammad Huraira and Aamir Jamal who have pushed their case through impressive performances over a period of time,” chief selector Haroon Rashid said. “The conditions in Sri Lanka largely favour finger spinners – something that we have seen over the years and during Pakistan’s last visit to the island – so we have three such bowlers to go with the mystery spin of Abrar Ahmed. At the same time, we cannot overlook the need for fast bowlers and, as such, we have included four pacers so the captain and team management have ample resources on the tour. We boast a strong batting line-up, which I am confident will do well in the two matches.” Meanwhile, PCB have confirmed the appointment of former South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel as the teams’ bowling coach. Morkel will join the squad on July 3 for a pre-series camp in Karachi before the team’s departure for Sri Lanka on July 9. The tour itinerary will be subsequently released. Squad: Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (vc & wk), Aamir Jamal, Abdullah Shafique, Abrar Ahmed, Hasan Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Huraira, Mohammad Nawaz, Naseem Shah, Noman Ali, Salman Ali Agha, Sarfaraz Ahmed (wk), Saud Shakeel, Shaheen Afridi and Shan Masood Published on By ( Nearly 40 pupils have been killed at a school in western Uganda by rebels linked to the Islamic State group (IS). Five militants attacked the Lhubiriha secondary school in Mpondwe at around 23:30 (20:30 GMT) on Friday. They entered dormitories, setting fire and using machetes to kill and maim the pupils, officials said. The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) – based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – have been blamed and a manhunt is under way. More than 60 people are educated at the school, most of whom live there. Uganda’s information minister said 37 students were confirmed to have been killed, but did not give their ages. Twenty of them were attacked with machetes and 17 of them burned to death, Chris Baryomunsi told the BBC. Survivors said the rebels threw a bomb into the dormitory after the machete attack. It is not clear if this resulted in a fire in the building which was reported earlier. Six students were also abducted to carry food that the rebels stole from the school’s stores, he added. The militants then returned across the border into the DRC. Some of the bodies are said to have been badly burnt and DNA tests will need to be carried out to identify them. Eight people remain in a critical condition after the attack. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the “appalling act” and called for those behind it to be brought to justice.

Rwanda won the toss and decided to bat first, they amassed 99 runs for the loss of 10 wickets in 20 overs. Kenya had 100 runs, losing three wickets in 17.2 overs. Once again, Lucas Oluoch emerged the man of the match for the second time in the tournament after notching three wickets in 18 runs in the four overs. \"Positivity helped us to bounce back after losing to Botswana on Thursday,\" team captain Rakep Patel told Standard Sports. \"The boys came up, bowled really well and comfortably restricted Rwanda to 99 runs.\" While giving hint to their low scoring, Rakep blamed the pitch for playing slow which he said is contributed by the many games that have been in the tournament. However, Rakep praised the six Kenyan bowlers who he said are performing impressively in the contest among them Viraj Patel, Vishil Patel and Oluoch. On Viraj's meteoric rise in the national team which he joined last year, Rakep said: \"Viraj is a crucial player for us right now. He is now a senior left hand bowler even though he just came recently to the squad. He's growing with confidence, he knows his role well and he is facing his challenges with brevity.\" Kenya is poised to meet Uganda today in a crucial third matchup and Rakep says they are going to stick to the basics of the game. \"We are going to try to be consistent, we are going to restrict them to under 140 which is a manageable score,\" Rakep highlighted. Rwanda captain Clinton Rubagumya termed their loss to Kenya as a training opportunity ahead of their ICC World Cup Qualifiers in November. \"We don't focus on the loss, we are using the tournament to know which areas to rectify and our batting department is one of them,\" said Rubagumya. \"So far we have two games left, if we can get to 140 mark in both, then we are good to go. \"When we came to this tournament we were the lowest ranked side but already we pulled a victory by beating Botswana that is ranked 18 places above us.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-17 22:43:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"standardmedia","category":["sports"],"country":["kenya"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ashes boost as Litchfield states opener case in warm-up","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/ashes-boost-as-litchfield-states-opener-case-in-warm-up-c-11013521","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Phoebe Litchfield has hit 78 for Australia in the last day of their warm-up game against England A, all but ensuring she will debut as an Ashes Test opener.","content":"Rising star Phoebe Litchfield is confident she got enough out of Australia's tour-game draw with England A to be ready to make her Test debut as an opener at Trent Bridge. Litchfield scored 78 at the top of the order for Australia on Saturday at Leicester, as the tourists finished the three-day game at 7-361 in their second innings. Australia were largely outplayed by the hosts; all out for 221 on a flat wicket on the opening day before England A hit 562. But they remained adamant there were enough positives in the game before Thursday's Ashes Test kicks off the multi-format series. Annabel Sutherland hit 116 for Australia, while Beth Mooney scored 35 not out to back up her first-innings 107. The other positive for the tourists was Litchfield, who impressed in one of the first red-ball games of her career. The 20-year-old is now all but certain to open with Mooney in the Test. \"To score some runs today has definitely helped,\" Litchfield said. \"I have realised (long-form cricket) is a mind game. \"It's decision making, temperament. You have to have a good technique, but if you drive balls that aren't there it's dangerous. \"It's just about playing smart shots. Leaving balls early, playing high percentage shots and hopefully building some big partnerships.\" Litchfield's debut at the top of the order will allow Alyssa Healy to slot down to No.5 or No.6, taking some of the workload off the stand-in captain and wicketkeeper. Elsewhere, Jess Jonassen hit 173no for Australia A in their drawn three-day game against England at Derby, after being sent to captain the second XI side.","pubDate":"2023-06-17 21:57:08","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11013521/2660ee3a57b1e53066ee31a4da9bd1291e1c81df-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ashes 2023: ओह्ह स्टुअर्ट ब्रॉड ये नहीं करना था, इंग्लैंड को अब नहीं छोड़ेंगे उस्मान ख्वाजा","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/cricket-news/eng-vs-aus-ashes-2023-stuart-broad-no-ball-usman-khawaja-survive-dismissal/articleshow/101076046.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ashes 2023: इंग्लैंड के हार की बड़ी वजह बन सकता है स्टुअर्ट ब्रॉड की चूक, कहर बनकर टूटेंगे अब उस्मान ख्वाजा","content":"एशेज सीरीज 2023 अपने पहले ही मैच से रोमांच के चरम पर पहुंच चुका है। मैच में इंग्लैंड की टीम ने पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए खेल के पहले दिन 8 विकेट पर 398 रन बनाकर अपनी पारी को घोषित कर दिया था। हालांकि जिस उम्मीद के साथ बेन स्टोक्स ने यह फैसला किया वह अब पूरी तरह से टूटता हुआ नजर आ रहा है। दरअसल ऑस्ट्रेलिया की टीम ने भी पलटवार करते हुए खेल के दूसरे दिन धमाकेदार शुरुआत की। हालांकि डेविड वॉर्नर फिर से अपना कमाल नहीं दिखा सके लेकिन इस बीच उस्मान ख्वाजा ने अपना खूंटा गाड़े रखा। उस्मान ख्वाजा दूसरे दिन के खेल समाप्त होने तक नाबाद 126 रन बनाकर पवेलियन लौटे और उनका साथ दे रहे हैं एलेक्स कैरी जो 52 रन बनाकर खेल रहे हैं। मैच में उस्मान ख्वाजा ने जबरदस्त बल्लेबाजी की। इस बीच इंग्लैंड के पास अपनी गलती सुधारने का एक भी मौका भी जब ख्वाजा 112 रन के स्कोर पर खेल रहे थे लेकिन दुर्भाग्य से स्टुअर्ट ब्रॉड से एक ऐसी चूक हो गई जिसके कारण अब इंग्लैंड पर वह बहुत भारी पड़ सकती है। दअरसल जब उस्मान ख्वाजा 112 रन के स्कोर पर थे तो स्टुअर्ट ब्रॉड ने उन्हें बोल्ड कर दिया लेकिन ख्वाजा की किस्मत ही कहे कि ब्रॉड की वह गेंद नो बॉल हो गई। इस कारण वह फिर से बल्लेबाजी के लिए वापस लौट आए। इसके बाद से वह अपने स्कोर में 14 रनों का इजाफा करते हुए नाबाद पवेलियन लौटे। इंग्लैंड की पहली पारी के आधार पर ऑस्ट्रेलिया की टीम अब सिर्फ 82 रन पीछे है। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने खेल के दूसरे की समाप्ति तक 5 विकेट के नुकसान पर 311 रन बना लिए। वहीं सेट बल्लेबाज ख्वाजा और कैरी क्रीज पर हैं। ऐसे में अब ड्राइविंग सीट पर ऑस्ट्रेलिया की टीम नजर आ रही है। यहां से अगर ऑस्ट्रेलिया तीसरे दिन के खेल में 150 रन से अधिक का बढ़त हासिल करती है तो इंग्लैंड के लिए मैच को बचाना काफी मुश्किल हो जाएगा। ऑस्ट्रेलिया के लिए बल्लेबाजी में उस्मान ख्वाजा के अलावा ऑस्ट्रेलिया के लिए ट्रेविस हेड ने 50 और कैमरून ग्रीन ने 38 रनों की शानदार पारी खेली जिससे की इंग्लैंड की टीम और अधिक दबाव में आ गया है। ऑस्ट्रेलिया के खिलाफ इस मुकाबले में इंग्लैंड के पूर्व कप्तान जो रूट ने शतकीय पारी खेली थी। जो रूट 152 गेंद में 118 रन बनाकर नाबाद रहे थे। रूट का टेस्ट क्रिकेट में यह 30वां शतक था। इस शतक के साथ ही वह ऑस्ट्रेलिया के महान बल्लेबाज डॉन ब्रैडमैन से आगे हो गए हैं। जो रूट के अलावा इंग्लैंड के लिए जैक क्राउले ने 61 और जॉनी बेयरस्टो ने 78 गेंद में 78 रनों की पारी खेली।","pubDate":"2023-06-18 00:21:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Pace dominates spin in Sri Lankan attack","link":"http://island.lk/pace-dominates-spin-in-sri-lankan-attack/","keywords":["Sports","Asia Cup and World Cup","Cricket","Featured","Imran khan","Sri Lankan attack"],"creator":["Thilina Walpola"],"video_url":null,"description":"by Rex Clementine When Singer boss Hemaka Amarasuriya headed the cricket board some 20 years ago, one of his keen interests was to build up a cricket academy at RPS like the one in Brisbane, Australia.

The Queensland Academy was producing top notch cricketers at a rate and Amarasuriya had ambitious plans. A keen sports enthusiast who loved both rugby and cricket, Amarasuriya wasn’t just interested in producing fine cricketers, but giving a professional outlook on them as well. The academy that he introduced taught players essentials of life such as managing finances, cricket history, etiquette and English among many other things. Sadly, once Amarasuriya left office, the academy stationed at RPS ceased to exist. His visionary thinking should have been carried forward. Along with the academy came the program called Pace Ace, a unit headed by Rumesh Ratnayake and supported by Champaka Ramanayake. Those days Sri Lanka were solely depending on Chaminda Vaas and the need to have more fast-bowling resources was felt. Not only did the two coaches work with the next crop of quicks, but they also went headhunting for promising talents and were able to spot the likes of Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekara, just to name a few. Similarly, you see several young fast bowlers coming up in recent years and it seems that Sri Lanka’s fast bowling strengths are better than spin options. Usually, it is the other way around. You have got to give credit to SLC’s District and Provincial coaches who have done an excellent job over the years in grooming rare talents. Hambantota district where just a handful of schools play the game of cricket has produced the cream of the nation’s fast bowlers in recent years. There is Kasun Rajitha, Dilshan Madushanka and Pramod Madushan. Of course, there is also workhorse Suranga Lakmal, whose journey from Debarawewa to Derbyshire has been quite sensational. The only captain to have won a Test match in Barbados, the fortress of West Indies cricket, is not Imran Khan, not Kapil Dev, not Arjuna Ranatunga but Lakmal. It is the return of Dushmantha Chameera lead up to the World Cup Qualifiers that has enabled Sri Lanka to breathe easy. The quickest man in Sri Lankan colours is going to knock over the associate nations. He returned to international cricket this month after a seven-month layoff due to surgery and was quite a handful troubling the Afghans with his pace and not too often a Sri Lankan quick ends up as Player of the Series at home. There maybe not much cricket left in Chameera as he has been constantly injured and rarely fulfilled his promise. The team management has carefully looked after his workload but even then he struggled with fitness and Sri Lanka will be hoping that he won’t break down this year which is very crucial with the Asia Cup and World Cup coming up. Lahiru Kumara is capable of challenging Chameera when it comes to pace. Kumara at times struggles with his control whereas Chameera is on the money and tempts batters to take risks with his tight bowling. The most improved bowler of them all is Kasun Rajitha, who has taken over Lakmal’s role since the tall quick retired last year. It is Rajitha’s discipline and his ability to move the ball that has proved to be handy and often he provides a breakthrough earlier on. All the talk is about left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka, who became the highest paid player in LPL with teams bidding for his services fiercely. He will take home a cool US$ 92,000 for just two week’s work. But the left-arm seamer who doesn’t get much attention is Binura Fernando. Standing at six feet and six inches, the former D.S. Senanayake College cricketer generates a steep bounce thanks to his height. Matheesha Pathirana provides raw pace and his slingy action has not only earned him the nickname ‘podi Malinga’ but also has given Chennai Super Kings a quality death bowling option as they went onto win the IPL this season. The former Trinity player is yet to convert his success in franchise cricket into international cricket and questions remain whether he will be effective in the 50 over format. The fact is Pathirana is just 20 and he will learn as he goes along and will win Sri Lanka lots of games in years to come. Gradually, Sri Lanka’s attack has become pace oriented than spin. Wonder whether the curators should prepare pitches accordingly for home games. Not many pacemen barring Vaas and Malinga have had a major impact for Sri Lanka for a long period of time.

Jamal played two T20Is for the national team against England late last year. “I want to congratulate all the players who have been selected in the side, especially Mohammad Huraira and Aamir Jamal who have pushed their case through impressive performances over a period of time,” chief selector Haroon Rashid said. “The conditions in Sri Lanka largely favour finger spinners – something that we have seen over the years and during Pakistan’s last visit to the island – so we have three such bowlers to go with the mystery spin of Abrar Ahmed. At the same time, we cannot overlook the need for fast bowlers and, as such, we have included four pacers so the captain and team management have ample resources on the tour. We boast a strong batting line-up, which I am confident will do well in the two matches.” Meanwhile, PCB have confirmed the appointment of former South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel as the teams’ bowling coach. Morkel will join the squad on July 3 for a pre-series camp in Karachi before the team’s departure for Sri Lanka on July 9. The tour itinerary will be subsequently released.

Published on By When Singer boss Hemaka Amarasuriya headed the cricket board some 20 years ago, one of his keen interests was to build up a cricket academy at RPS like the one in Brisbane, Australia. The Queensland Academy was producing top notch cricketers at a rate and Amarasuriya had ambitious plans. A keen sports enthusiast who loved both rugby and cricket, Amarasuriya wasn’t just interested in producing fine cricketers, but giving a professional outlook on them as well. The academy that he introduced taught players essentials of life such as managing finances, cricket history, etiquette and English among many other things. Sadly, once Amarasuriya left office, the academy stationed at RPS ceased to exist. His visionary thinking should have been carried forward. Along with the academy came the program called Pace Ace, a unit headed by Rumesh Ratnayake and supported by Champaka Ramanayake. Those days Sri Lanka were solely depending on Chaminda Vaas and the need to have more fast-bowling resources was felt. Not only did the two coaches work with the next crop of quicks, but they also went headhunting for promising talents and were able to spot the likes of Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekara, just to name a few. Similarly, you see several young fast bowlers coming up in recent years and it seems that Sri Lanka’s fast bowling strengths are better than spin options. Usually, it is the other way around. You have got to give credit to SLC’s District and Provincial coaches who have done an excellent job over the years in grooming rare talents. Hambantota district where just a handful of schools play the game of cricket has produced the cream of the nation’s fast bowlers in recent years. There is Kasun Rajitha, Dilshan Madushanka and Pramod Madushan. Of course, there is also workhorse Suranga Lakmal, whose journey from Debarawewa to Derbyshire has been quite sensational. The only captain to have won a Test match in Barbados, the fortress of West Indies cricket, is not Imran Khan, not Kapil Dev, not Arjuna Ranatunga but Lakmal. It is the return of Dushmantha Chameera lead up to the World Cup Qualifiers that has enabled Sri Lanka to breathe easy. The quickest man in Sri Lankan colours is going to knock over the associate nations. He returned to international cricket this month after a seven-month layoff due to surgery and was quite a handful troubling the Afghans with his pace and not too often a Sri Lankan quick ends up as Player of the Series at home. There maybe not much cricket left in Chameera as he has been constantly injured and rarely fulfilled his promise. The team management has carefully looked after his workload but even then he struggled with fitness and Sri Lanka will be hoping that he won’t break down this year which is very crucial with the Asia Cup and World Cup coming up. Lahiru Kumara is capable of challenging Chameera when it comes to pace. Kumara at times struggles with his control whereas Chameera is on the money and tempts batters to take risks with his tight bowling. The most improved bowler of them all is Kasun Rajitha, who has taken over Lakmal’s role since the tall quick retired last year. It is Rajitha’s discipline and his ability to move the ball that has proved to be handy and often he provides a breakthrough earlier on. All the talk is about left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka, who became the highest paid player in LPL with teams bidding for his services fiercely. He will take home a cool US$ 92,000 for just two week’s work. But the left-arm seamer who doesn’t get much attention is Binura Fernando. Standing at six feet and six inches, the former D.S. Senanayake College cricketer generates a steep bounce thanks to his height. Matheesha Pathirana provides raw pace and his slingy action has not only earned him the nickname ‘podi Malinga’ but also has given Chennai Super Kings a quality death bowling option as they went onto win the IPL this season. The former Trinity player is yet to convert his success in franchise cricket into international cricket and questions remain whether he will be effective in the 50 over format. The fact is Pathirana is just 20 and he will learn as he goes along and will win Sri Lanka lots of games in years to come. Gradually, Sri Lanka’s attack has become pace oriented than spin. Wonder whether the curators should prepare pitches accordingly for home games. Not many pacemen barring Vaas and Malinga have had a major impact for Sri Lanka for a long period of time. You just get the feeling that all that is set to change.

Published on By Ace fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been named in Pakistan’s Test squad for the forthcoming series in and against Sri Lanka, marking his return to the longest form of the game at the very country he played the last of his 25 Tests so far. The national selectors have also handed maiden call-ups to batter Mohammad Hurraira and all-rounder Aamir Jamal in the 16-member squad. Afridi suffered a knee injury in the first Test at Galle last year. It subsequently left him requiring a lengthy recovery and rehabilitation program that forced him out of the Asia Cup. Another injury suffered at the T20 World Cup in Australia meant the 23-year-old didn’t feature in any of the Tests of the home season. He is one short of the 100-wicket mark in the format and has taken his wickets at a very impressive average of 24.85. “I am very excited to be returning to the Pakistan Test side after a year. I dearly missed Test cricket and it was tough for me to be away from this format,” Shaheen was quoted as saying in a PCB media release. “After missing our entire home season because of the injury I suffered in Sri Lanka, I am eager to make an impactful comeback in the same country and complete a century of wickets in Test cricket. I want to thank my fans who have provided me support in tough times and I am ready for the challenges ahead.” Meanwhile, the call-up for Hurraira, the 21-year-old batter from Sialkot, had seemed imminent after an impressive run in the domestic circuit, where he topped the batting charts in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for two seasons in a row.

Khawaja, who stroked his maiden ton in England, went to stumps unbeaten on 124 – having batted through the day. He had the company of Carey, who was unbeaten on 52, and had added a 91-run stand before the end of the day’s play. For much of the day though, England were on the front foot after Stuart Broad had struck twice in the seventh over of the morning. First, he dismissed David Warner (14th time in the Ashes) when the southpaw dragged a length delivery outside the off on to his stumps. And then, had Marnus Labuschagne caught behind with an outswinger. England were on the offensive, with Ben Stokes being unconventional and proactive with his field changes. Steve Smith and Khawaja nullified the attack for an hour with a dour 38-run partnership before the former was trapped leg-before with a Stokes delivery that jagged back in – in what was only his second over of the innings. Smith took a review but to no avail. With three wickets down, for only 64 runs, England had owned the morning session and seized control of the contest. However, after Tea, the momentum started to shift. The in-form Travis Head took charge of the counter-attack, of which Moeen Ali was largely at the receiving end. It had started out with Khawaja, who danced down the track and hit the offspinner for a six in only the third over of the post-lunch session. However, Khawaja was kept in control by England’s short-ball tactic, which had the opener in a bit of an uncomfortable space. Head, however, didn’t hold back on the cuts and the pulls. He departed soon after bringing up his 14th Test fifty, chipping Moeen Ali’s flattish delivery to midwicket, handing the offspinner his maiden scalp on Test comeback. Moeen could’ve had another wicket to his name only two deliveries later when Cameron Green stepped out and attempted a big shot, only to be deceived by the turn. However, Jonny Bairstow missed a regulation stumping opportunity. Green was subdued thereafter and helped Australia head to Tea without any further damage. His only attack came against Joe Root in the last over before Tea when he hit the part-timer for two boundaries through the offside. However, soon after the Tea break, Moeen eventually had his man – beating him in flight, with drift, dip and turn to knock over his stumps. Green, by then, had scored 38 runs and stitched a valuable 72-run partnership with Khawaja. Nonetheless, that happened to be the only dismissal of the last session. England could’ve had another when Stuart Broad knocked over Khawaja’s stumps only two balls after the second new ball was taken. However, the third umpire noted that he had overstepped, offering Khawaja a life when he was batting on 112. The opener shut shop and went on to add only 12 runs thereafter in the last hour of play when Carey had taken the mantle of attacking the English bowlers. The ‘keeper-batter was always on a lookout for scoring opportunities, hitting on the up, over the in-field and at times, even just short of fielders. He brought up his fifty with a lucky boundary after getting an outside edge for a boundary while looking to attack Moeen Ali, only to be deceived by the spinner. England used seven bowling options on the day, but the bulk of the work was handed to Moeen, who got some assistance from the wicket but was also on the line of attack of the Australian batters. He picked two wickets in 29 overs, but ended up conceding 124 runs. Brief scores: England 393/8 decl. (Joe Root 112*, Jonny Bairstow 78, Zak Crawley 61; Nathan Lyon 4-149, Josh Hazlewood 2-61) Australia 311/5 (Usman Khawaja 124*, Alex Carey 52*, Travis Head 50; Stuart Broad 2-49, Moeen Ali 2-124) by 82 runs Published on By ( Nearly 40 pupils have been killed at a school in western Uganda by rebels linked to the Islamic State group (IS). Five militants attacked the Lhubiriha secondary school in Mpondwe at around 23:30 (20:30 GMT) on Friday. They entered dormitories, setting fire and using machetes to kill and maim the pupils, officials said. The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) – based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – have been blamed and a manhunt is under way. More than 60 people are educated at the school, most of whom live there. Uganda’s information minister said 37 students were confirmed to have been killed, but did not give their ages. Twenty of them were attacked with machetes and 17 of them burned to death, Chris Baryomunsi told the BBC. Survivors said the rebels threw a bomb into the dormitory after the machete attack. It is not clear if this resulted in a fire in the building which was reported earlier. Six students were also abducted to carry food that the rebels stole from the school’s stores, he added. The militants then returned across the border into the DRC. Some of the bodies are said to have been badly burnt and DNA tests will need to be carried out to identify them. Eight people remain in a critical condition after the attack. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the “appalling act” and called for those behind it to be brought to justice.

The Queenslander rescued Australia on day two of the Edgbaston Test with an unbeaten 126, batting through the entire day and guiding the visitors towards 5-311 at stumps, still trailing England by 82 runs. It was his 15th Test century, putting him ahead of Michael Slater and Ian Chappell on the all-time tally, but also his first in the United Kingdom — he received support from Cameron Green (38) along with South Australian duo Travis Head (50) and Alex Carey (52 not out). ASHES MATCH CENTRE: Edgbaston Test scorecard, stats BROAD GETS WARNER AGAIN in double strike | 00:57 Khawaja’s rearguard came after England seamer Stuart Broad tore through Australia’s top order in the morning session, with recalled spinner Moeen Ali also striking twice in the afternoon. However, the hosts were left to rue three missed chances in the evening session, including a dropped catch, a missed stumping and a front-foot no-ball, which left the Ashes opener on a knife-edge ahead of day three. Khawaja had averaged 17.78 in England before this week’s Edgbaston Test, passing fifty just once in 14 innings. The left-hander was dropped from Australia’s Test side on previous tours to the United Kingdom in 2013 and 2019, recently confessing he thought England was “the toughest place in the world to bat” . But the 36-year-old has finally gotten the monkey off his back, adding another chapter to his remarkable Test resurgence. “I think it was a culmination of three Ashes tours to England, and being dropped on two of them,” Khawaja said of his emotional celebration. “I don’t read the media, but when I’m getting sprayed in the nets and getting sprayed when I’m walking out there that I can’t bat in England, I guess it was just a bit more emotional than normal.” Get all the latest cricket news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail.

Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: Getty Images The start of day two was delayed by five minutes due to light showers in Birmingham, and Australia started the morning session with three consecutive maidens, eclipsing the total number of maidens from England’s first innings. Khawaja broke the shackles in the ninth over with an elegant pull shot, his first of many on Saturday. Australia’s openers put together 29 before Broad claimed back-to-back wickets in the eleventh over, including his 15th dismissal of David Warner in Tests. The left-hander attempted a reckless swipe without any footwork, chopping back onto his stumps and departing for 9. Marnus Labuschagne, the world’s No. 1 Test batter, fell for a golden duck the following ball after fending outside off stump, edging behind to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow, who claimed a one-handed grab low to his right. Moeen produces moment of magic! | 00:27 Khawaja and Steve Smith steadied the ship, combining for a 38-run partnership for the third wicket before England captain Ben Stokes intervened. The Durham all-rounder, who has been nursing a long-term knee injury, nipped a length delivery past Smith’s inside edge, trapping him on the pads LBW. A perplexed Smith quickly called for a review, but the Australian vice-captain trudged back to the sheds after three red lights appeared on Hawkeye, prompting wild scenes from the stands. Smith, who had dominated England’s bowlers four years ago with twin centuries at the same venue, was gone for 16. “Let’s face it, the Aussies were bullied … Bazball is bullying the Aussies at the moment,” former Test spinner Steve O’Keefe said on Channel 9. “It just looks like negative cricket, an un-Australian way of playing. “Australia is on the back foot, tentative with their footwork, and it’s not working for them at the moment. “They’re doing the complete contrast to what England did in their first innings.” Khawaja continued about his business at the other end, bringing up his half-century in 106 deliveries early in the afternoon session. Smith GONE as England take 3rd wicket | 00:38 England’s pace bowlers troubled Head with a bouncer barrage after the lunch break, but the South Australian wasn’t afraid to counter-attack, regularly slapping off-spinner Ali over mid-on. Head raced towards a half-century in just 60 deliveries but fell victim to Ali moments later, chipping a catch towards mid-wicket to give the tweaker his first Test wicket since 2021. Ali should have had a second scalp later that over when Green charged at a delivery that turned and beat his inside edge — but Bairstow missed the regulation stumping. The error proved costly, with Green and Khawaja combining for a 72-run partnership for the fifth wicket to slowly chip away at the deficit. Once again, Ali came to England’s rescue, bowling Green with an absolute peach that drifted away from the right-hander and spun sharply out of the rough, crashing into middle stump. Khawaja brought up his exquisitely crafted hundred after tea with a delicate late cut through third man, roaring with delight after reaching the milestone. The emotional Queenslander pumped his fists and tossed his bat away in celebration before removing his helmet and looking to the skies. “He’s given us the dab, the shuffle, now the bat throw,” Head said of Khawaja’s celebration on Sky Sports . “It’s a huge weight off his shoulders. I guess as an international cricketer, everyone talks about hundreds overseas and he hasn’t had the greatest of times leading into this series. “I know he is determined and once he got through that new ball on that wicket, he played beautifully.” Bairstow’s day went from bad to worse after dropping a chance off Joe Root’s bowling in the 80th over, gifting rival wicketkeeper Carey a second life on 26. England took the second new ball and Broad immediately broke through Khawaja’s defences, bowling the Australian opener with a gem — but the centurion, on 112 at the time, was called back after replays showed that Broad had overstepped. It was the 36-year-old sixth no-ball of the day. “It was a great ball, I felt like I had slid,” Broad told Sky Sports at stumps. “Today I probably bowled more no-balls than I did in my career.” Carey’s good fortune continued in the 92nd over when an outside edge off Ali’s bowling bisected the wicketkeeper and first slip, also bringing up his fifth Test half-century. Khawaja and Carey (52 not out) made the most of their reprieves, combining for an unbeaten 91-run partnership for the sixth wicket to put Australia in arguably the preferred position at stumps. “I think it was a pretty good day actually,” Broad continued. “It has been a slow, turgid pitch so to be still 82 runs ahead of Australia with Pat Cummins and the tail next, we are pretty happy. “Things could happen pretty quickly for us in the first hour tomorrow and there wasn’t a lot in that pitch today. “Ultimately, our aim is for Australia to bat last on that and for us to bowl last on that and hopefully it keeps deteriorating.”","pubDate":"2023-06-17 22:53:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stuart Broad’s scheme pays off before Ben Stokes’ captaincy masterstroke: Day 2 Talking Points","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/the-ashes/stuart-broads-scheme-pays-off-before-ben-stokes-captaincy-masterstroke-day-2-talking-points/news-story/8b173dfcd8d49ca0e56f626392139701","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Usman Khawaja was the hero for Australia on day two of the Edgbaston Test, scoring a 15th Test century and guiding the visitors towards 5-311 at stumps, still trailing England by 82 runs.","content":"Usman Khawaja was the hero for Australia on day two of the Edgbaston Test , scoring a 15th Test century and guiding the visitors towards 5-311 at stumps, still trailing England by 82 runs.

Having just knocked over Australian opener David Warner for 9 on Saturday morning, Broad revved up the Birmingham crowd before charging in and removing the world’s No. 1 Test cricketer for a golden duck. Broad’s outswinger kissed the outside edge of Labuschagne’s bat, with England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow taking a one-handed catch low to his right. The Australian No. 3 sheepishly trudged back to the sheds having fished at a delivery he should have left alone. “That was the perfect ball,” Broad told Sky Sports at stumps. “I’ve been looking to bowl that to Marnus by design … it was a plan I wanted to do, so to do it was really nice.” Get all the latest cricket news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail. Sign up now! Stuart Broad of England celebrates taking the wicket of Marcus Labuschagne. Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Earlier this year, Broad revealed he had been developing his outswinger with Nottinghamshire bowling coach Kevin Shine in the County Championship, and the changes were specifically designed to trouble Labuschagne and Steve Smith. “It’s the reason I wanted to change something, to try and bring their outside edge in more,” Broad said back in April. “My stock delivery will always be wobble seam trying to nip back on off stump, because I think that’s the most dangerous ball. But to (Labuschagne and Smith), I think dragging them across with away swing is quite important. So this action tweak is pretty much designed at those two, and it was good to see it really swinging away today. “You always have to be looking for something to improve … I’m constantly working on things in training to see if something can work to implement in games.” ‘THIS IS BAZBALL’: STOKES’ CAPTAINCY MASTERSTROKE Ben Stokes’ dismissal of Steve Smith was one of the decisive moments at Edgbaston on Saturday, but the Durham all-rounder’s aggressive captaincy also accounted for the dangerous Travis Head later in the afternoon session. Moeen Ali, playing his first Test match since August 2021, opened the bowling after lunch on day two, and Head immediately targeted the off-spinner, smacking seven boundaries including a belligerent six that sailed over long-off. Most captains would have pulled Ali out of the attack after he conceded 45 runs from his first six overs following the lunch break — but not Stokes. The England captain brought the mid-on and mid-off up, luring Head into once again attacking down the ground — and the South Australian took the bait. Head miscued the lofted drive and chipped a catch towards mid-wicket, departing for 50 and giving Ali his first Test wicket in almost two years. “It’s brilliant captaincy, it’s aggressive captaincy,” former England batter Kevin Pietersen said on Sky Sports commentary. Moeen produces moment of magic! | 00:27 As part of England’s ‘Bazball’ philosophy, Stokes was willing to leak runs to take wickets, sticking with aggressive field settings regardless of the match situation. “One of the most important things of that dismissal was the brave captaincy with Ben Stokes,” former Australian spinner Steve O’Keefe said on Channel 9. “What does Stokes do with Mooen Ali, who’d gone for 45 runs from six overs? He puts a second slip in and keeps a catching mid-wicket. “It’s just the bravery of this English team, playing Bazball and maintaining their consistency to pick up wickets.” The innovative Stokes called upon seven bowlers in the morning session, including part-timer Harry Brook. “What is going on here?” Australian legend Ricky Ponting said in commentary. Former England captain Mike Atherton responded: “This is Bazball.” ‘NEGATIVE CRICKET’: AUSTRALIA’S ‘TIMID’ BATTING Australia’s defensive field placement ruffled some feathers on Friday , but the visitors’ “timid” batting was what raised eyebrows early on day two of the Edgbaston Test. Runs were hard to come by for the Australians on Saturday morning, getting the action underway with a trio of maidens. After facing 12 consecutive dot balls, a frustrated David Warner threw his wicket away by playing a reckless shot outside off stump, departing cheaply for 9. “England have made it really hard for Australia to score,” Ponting said on Sky Sports . “You could argue that led to Warner’s dismissal. The scoreboard was going nowhere, the pressure built and Warner played a shot he probably wouldn’t have.” Australia was in dire straits at 2-29 when Marnus Labuschagne departed the following delivery — in response, Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith immediately stamped on the brakes, scoring at 2.37 runs per over throughout the morning session. It was a stark contrast to England’s aggressive approach the previous day, when they scored at 4.65 runs per overs in the morning session despite losing a handful of early wickets. “The intent probably hasn’t been quite where you would want it to be, but that’s the way they play,” Ponting continued. “I don’t think they have done anything different.” Steve Smith of Australia. Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Australia only scored 13 singles before lunch on day two, while England mustered 54 singles during Friday’s morning session, partly because of the defensive field settings. “It just looks like negative cricket, an un-Australian way of playing,” former Australian spinner Steve O’Keefe said on Channel 9. ”Australia is on the back foot, tentative with their footwork, and it’s not working for them at the moment. “They’re barely going at two runs an over and are doing … the complete contrast of what England did in their first innings when they had the chance to bat.” ENGLAND’S KEEPING GAMBLE BACKFIRES England’s decision to drop wicketkeeper Ben Foakes ahead of the Ashes came back to haunt them on day two of the Edgbaston Test. Australia was 4-148 in the 46th over when all-rounder Cameron Green, who was yet to score, skipped down the pitch and looked to attack England spinner Moeen Ali — but the all-rounder was beaten on the inside edge. However, England gloveman Jonny Bairstow missed the regulation stumping chance, handing Green an early reprieve. It proved a costly error — Green combined with Usman Khawaja for a 72-run partnership for the fifth wicket to revive Australia’s innings. “He’s very square on … that left hip’s not really opening or riding the bounce,” former Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara explained on Sky Sports commentary. “He also didn’t expect it to turn, and sometimes you have to anticipate it, know that it’s going to come at you through the gate — make that adjustment, take a step to your left, and if it beats the outside edge, you’ll still have a good sighter.” Former England captain Nasser Hussain continued: “He gets a good sighter of it. He sees the ball all the way, there’s no batter in the way or anything. “He’s got that ball in his vision absolutely perfectly, and then because it spins a long way he’s in the wrong place.” Jonny Bairstow of England. Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Bairstow’s day went from bad to worse when he dropped a catch off Joe Root’s bowling in the 80th over, gifting rival wicketkeeper Alex Carey a second life on 26. Earlier on day two, the Yorkshireman had taken a smart one-handed catch to remove Marnus Labuschagne for a golden duck, also plundering an entertaining 78 (78) in England’s first innings. Foakes, widely considered to be England’s best wicketkeeper, was axed ahead of the recent Lord’s Test against Ireland after Bairstow returned from his horrific leg injury. England couldn’t fit Bairstow, Foakes and Harry Brook in the same starting XI, and the Surrey wicketkeeper was the unlucky player forced to make way. Bairstow, who had not donned the gloves in a Test match since September 2021, was backed as England’s first-choice wicketkeeper for the Ashes in his absence, but the gamble backfired on Saturday afternoon. ‘SCARED EYES’: WARNER FALLS TO NEMESIS YET AGAIN It was almost inevitable. When David Warner hopped off the Australian team bus on Friday morning, an England fan yelled at the veteran opener: “Broady’s gonna get ya!” The prophecy came true just over 24 hours later. Stuart Broad dismissed his bunny for a 15th time on day two of the Edgbaston Test, removing Warner for 9 to continue his stranglehold over the Australian . The left-hander chopped back onto his stumps after slashing at a wide delivery in the eleventh over, sending the Birmingham crowd into a frenzy. His lack of footwork remains a glaring concern. BROAD GETS WARNER AGAIN in double strike | 00:57 Warner has now been dismissed by right-armed seamers from around the wicket in 11 consecutive Ashes innings in England, averaging 9.45 during that period. Broad utterly embarrassed Warner during the 2019 Ashes, dismissing him seven times while conceding just 35 runs across the series. The 36-year-old vowed to be more aggressive when facing Broad in England this year — and he certainly lived up to that promise. “When I’m at my best, I’m taking the bowlers on,” Warner told reporters in December. “I can probably be a bit more aggressive and go back to the older me, take them on a little bit more. “It’s about just having that comfort of backing yourself, and I always do that, but I felt a sense of responsibility to actually adapt to the wicket and conditions that were in front of me, but now it’s just going back to looking to score and then my defence will take care of itself.”","pubDate":"2023-06-17 22:52:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Khawaja, middle-order turn the tables on England","link":"http://island.lk/khawaja-middle-order-turn-the-tables-on-england/","keywords":["Latest News","Sports","Australia tour of England 2023","England vs Australia","Joe Root","The Ases Test","The Ashes","Usman Khawaja"],"creator":["Priyan"],"video_url":null,"description":"Usman Khawaja’s century, backed up by fifties from Travis Head and Alex Carey, has allowed Australia to stage a fightback on Day 2 of the first Ashes Test in Edgbaston, on Saturday.

Khawaja, who stroked his maiden ton in England, went to stumps unbeaten on 124 – having batted through the day. He had the company of Carey, who was unbeaten on 52, and had added a 91-run stand before the end of the day’s play. For much of the day though, England were on the front foot after Stuart Broad had struck twice in the seventh over of the morning. First, he dismissed David Warner (14th time in the Ashes) when the southpaw dragged a length delivery outside the off on to his stumps. And then, had Marnus Labuschagne caught behind with an outswinger. England were on the offensive, with Ben Stokes being unconventional and proactive with his field changes. Steve Smith and Khawaja nullified the attack for an hour with a dour 38-run partnership before the former was trapped leg-before with a Stokes delivery that jagged back in – in what was only his second over of the innings. Smith took a review but to no avail. With three wickets down, for only 64 runs, England had owned the morning session and seized control of the contest. However, after Tea, the momentum started to shift. The in-form Travis Head took charge of the counter-attack, of which Moeen Ali was largely at the receiving end. It had started out with Khawaja, who danced down the track and hit the offspinner for a six in only the third over of the post-lunch session. However, Khawaja was kept in control by England’s short-ball tactic, which had the opener in a bit of an uncomfortable space. Head, however, didn’t hold back on the cuts and the pulls. He departed soon after bringing up his 14th Test fifty, chipping Moeen Ali’s flattish delivery to midwicket, handing the offspinner his maiden scalp on Test comeback. Moeen could’ve had another wicket to his name only two deliveries later when Cameron Green stepped out and attempted a big shot, only to be deceived by the turn. However, Jonny Bairstow missed a regulation stumping opportunity. Green was subdued thereafter and helped Australia head to Tea without any further damage. His only attack came against Joe Root in the last over before Tea when he hit the part-timer for two boundaries through the offside. However, soon after the Tea break, Moeen eventually had his man – beating him in flight, with drift, dip and turn to knock over his stumps. Green, by then, had scored 38 runs and stitched a valuable 72-run partnership with Khawaja. Nonetheless, that happened to be the only dismissal of the last session. England could’ve had another when Stuart Broad knocked over Khawaja’s stumps only two balls after the second new ball was taken. However, the third umpire noted that he had overstepped, offering Khawaja a life when he was batting on 112. The opener shut shop and went on to add only 12 runs thereafter in the last hour of play when Carey had taken the mantle of attacking the English bowlers. The ‘keeper-batter was always on a lookout for scoring opportunities, hitting on the up, over the in-field and at times, even just short of fielders. He brought up his fifty with a lucky boundary after getting an outside edge for a boundary while looking to attack Moeen Ali, only to be deceived by the spinner. England used seven bowling options on the day, but the bulk of the work was handed to Moeen, who got some assistance from the wicket but was also on the line of attack of the Australian batters. He picked two wickets in 29 overs, but ended up conceding 124 runs. Brief scores: England 393/8 decl. (Joe Root 112*, Jonny Bairstow 78, Zak Crawley 61; Nathan Lyon 4-149, Josh Hazlewood 2-61) Australia 311/5 (Usman Khawaja 124*, Alex Carey 52*, Travis Head 50; Stuart Broad 2-49, Moeen Ali 2-124) by 82 runs Published on By Ace fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been named in Pakistan’s Test squad for the forthcoming series in and against Sri Lanka, marking his return to the longest form of the game at the very country he played the last of his 25 Tests so far. The national selectors have also handed maiden call-ups to batter Mohammad Hurraira and all-rounder Aamir Jamal in the 16-member squad. Afridi suffered a knee injury in the first Test at Galle last year. It subsequently left him requiring a lengthy recovery and rehabilitation program that forced him out of the Asia Cup. Another injury suffered at the T20 World Cup in Australia meant the 23-year-old didn’t feature in any of the Tests of the home season. He is one short of the 100-wicket mark in the format and has taken his wickets at a very impressive average of 24.85. “I am very excited to be returning to the Pakistan Test side after a year. I dearly missed Test cricket and it was tough for me to be away from this format,” Shaheen was quoted as saying in a PCB media release. “After missing our entire home season because of the injury I suffered in Sri Lanka, I am eager to make an impactful comeback in the same country and complete a century of wickets in Test cricket. I want to thank my fans who have provided me support in tough times and I am ready for the challenges ahead.” Meanwhile, the call-up for Hurraira, the 21-year-old batter from Sialkot, had seemed imminent after an impressive run in the domestic circuit, where he topped the batting charts in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for two seasons in a row. In 11 matches last season, Hurraira hit 1024 at 73.14 including four centuries and two half-centuries. Hurraira will be joined by his Northern teammate Jamal. The 26-year-old from Mianwali topped the bowling charts last season, finishing with 31 wickets at 29.71 including two five-fers. Jamal played two T20Is for the national team against England late last year. “I want to congratulate all the players who have been selected in the side, especially Mohammad Huraira and Aamir Jamal who have pushed their case through impressive performances over a period of time,” chief selector Haroon Rashid said. “The conditions in Sri Lanka largely favour finger spinners – something that we have seen over the years and during Pakistan’s last visit to the island – so we have three such bowlers to go with the mystery spin of Abrar Ahmed. At the same time, we cannot overlook the need for fast bowlers and, as such, we have included four pacers so the captain and team management have ample resources on the tour. We boast a strong batting line-up, which I am confident will do well in the two matches.” Meanwhile, PCB have confirmed the appointment of former South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel as the teams’ bowling coach. Morkel will join the squad on July 3 for a pre-series camp in Karachi before the team’s departure for Sri Lanka on July 9. The tour itinerary will be subsequently released. Squad: Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (vc & wk), Aamir Jamal, Abdullah Shafique, Abrar Ahmed, Hasan Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Huraira, Mohammad Nawaz, Naseem Shah, Noman Ali, Salman Ali Agha, Sarfaraz Ahmed (wk), Saud Shakeel, Shaheen Afridi and Shan Masood Published on By ( Nearly 40 pupils have been killed at a school in western Uganda by rebels linked to the Islamic State group (IS). Five militants attacked the Lhubiriha secondary school in Mpondwe at around 23:30 (20:30 GMT) on Friday. They entered dormitories, setting fire and using machetes to kill and maim the pupils, officials said. The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) – based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – have been blamed and a manhunt is under way. More than 60 people are educated at the school, most of whom live there. Uganda’s information minister said 37 students were confirmed to have been killed, but did not give their ages. Twenty of them were attacked with machetes and 17 of them burned to death, Chris Baryomunsi told the BBC. Survivors said the rebels threw a bomb into the dormitory after the machete attack. It is not clear if this resulted in a fire in the building which was reported earlier. Six students were also abducted to carry food that the rebels stole from the school’s stores, he added. The militants then returned across the border into the DRC. Some of the bodies are said to have been badly burnt and DNA tests will need to be carried out to identify them. Eight people remain in a critical condition after the attack. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the “appalling act” and called for those behind it to be brought to justice.

Once again, Lucas Oluoch emerged the man of the match for the second time in the tournament after notching three wickets in 18 runs in the four overs. \"Positivity helped us to bounce back after losing to Botswana on Thursday,\" team captain Rakep Patel told Standard Sports. \"The boys came up, bowled really well and comfortably restricted Rwanda to 99 runs.\" While giving hint to their low scoring, Rakep blamed the pitch for playing slow which he said is contributed by the many games that have been in the tournament. However, Rakep praised the six Kenyan bowlers who he said are performing impressively in the contest among them Viraj Patel, Vishil Patel and Oluoch. On Viraj's meteoric rise in the national team which he joined last year, Rakep said: \"Viraj is a crucial player for us right now. He is now a senior left hand bowler even though he just came recently to the squad. He's growing with confidence, he knows his role well and he is facing his challenges with brevity.\" Kenya is poised to meet Uganda today in a crucial third matchup and Rakep says they are going to stick to the basics of the game. \"We are going to try to be consistent, we are going to restrict them to under 140 which is a manageable score,\" Rakep highlighted.

The Queensland Academy was producing top notch cricketers at a rate and Amarasuriya had ambitious plans. A keen sports enthusiast who loved both rugby and cricket, Amarasuriya wasn’t just interested in producing fine cricketers, but giving a professional outlook on them as well. The academy that he introduced taught players essentials of life such as managing finances, cricket history, etiquette and English among many other things. Sadly, once Amarasuriya left office, the academy stationed at RPS ceased to exist. His visionary thinking should have been carried forward. Along with the academy came the program called Pace Ace, a unit headed by Rumesh Ratnayake and supported by Champaka Ramanayake. Those days Sri Lanka were solely depending on Chaminda Vaas and the need to have more fast-bowling resources was felt. Not only did the two coaches work with the next crop of quicks, but they also went headhunting for promising talents and were able to spot the likes of Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekara, just to name a few. Similarly, you see several young fast bowlers coming up in recent years and it seems that Sri Lanka’s fast bowling strengths are better than spin options. Usually, it is the other way around. You have got to give credit to SLC’s District and Provincial coaches who have done an excellent job over the years in grooming rare talents. Hambantota district where just a handful of schools play the game of cricket has produced the cream of the nation’s fast bowlers in recent years. There is Kasun Rajitha, Dilshan Madushanka and Pramod Madushan. Of course, there is also workhorse Suranga Lakmal, whose journey from Debarawewa to Derbyshire has been quite sensational. The only captain to have won a Test match in Barbados, the fortress of West Indies cricket, is not Imran Khan, not Kapil Dev, not Arjuna Ranatunga but Lakmal. It is the return of Dushmantha Chameera lead up to the World Cup Qualifiers that has enabled Sri Lanka to breathe easy. The quickest man in Sri Lankan colours is going to knock over the associate nations. He returned to international cricket this month after a seven-month layoff due to surgery and was quite a handful troubling the Afghans with his pace and not too often a Sri Lankan quick ends up as Player of the Series at home. There maybe not much cricket left in Chameera as he has been constantly injured and rarely fulfilled his promise. The team management has carefully looked after his workload but even then he struggled with fitness and Sri Lanka will be hoping that he won’t break down this year which is very crucial with the Asia Cup and World Cup coming up. Lahiru Kumara is capable of challenging Chameera when it comes to pace. Kumara at times struggles with his control whereas Chameera is on the money and tempts batters to take risks with his tight bowling. The most improved bowler of them all is Kasun Rajitha, who has taken over Lakmal’s role since the tall quick retired last year. It is Rajitha’s discipline and his ability to move the ball that has proved to be handy and often he provides a breakthrough earlier on. All the talk is about left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka, who became the highest paid player in LPL with teams bidding for his services fiercely. He will take home a cool US$ 92,000 for just two week’s work. But the left-arm seamer who doesn’t get much attention is Binura Fernando. Standing at six feet and six inches, the former D.S. Senanayake College cricketer generates a steep bounce thanks to his height. Matheesha Pathirana provides raw pace and his slingy action has not only earned him the nickname ‘podi Malinga’ but also has given Chennai Super Kings a quality death bowling option as they went onto win the IPL this season. The former Trinity player is yet to convert his success in franchise cricket into international cricket and questions remain whether he will be effective in the 50 over format. The fact is Pathirana is just 20 and he will learn as he goes along and will win Sri Lanka lots of games in years to come. Gradually, Sri Lanka’s attack has become pace oriented than spin. Wonder whether the curators should prepare pitches accordingly for home games. Not many pacemen barring Vaas and Malinga have had a major impact for Sri Lanka for a long period of time. You just get the feeling that all that is set to change.

Another injury suffered at the T20 World Cup in Australia meant the 23-year-old didn’t feature in any of the Tests of the home season. He is one short of the 100-wicket mark in the format and has taken his wickets at a very impressive average of 24.85. “I am very excited to be returning to the Pakistan Test side after a year. I dearly missed Test cricket and it was tough for me to be away from this format,” Shaheen was quoted as saying in a PCB media release. “After missing our entire home season because of the injury I suffered in Sri Lanka, I am eager to make an impactful comeback in the same country and complete a century of wickets in Test cricket. I want to thank my fans who have provided me support in tough times and I am ready for the challenges ahead.” Meanwhile, the call-up for Hurraira, the 21-year-old batter from Sialkot, had seemed imminent after an impressive run in the domestic circuit, where he topped the batting charts in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for two seasons in a row. In 11 matches last season, Hurraira hit 1024 at 73.14 including four centuries and two half-centuries. Hurraira will be joined by his Northern teammate Jamal. The 26-year-old from Mianwali topped the bowling charts last season, finishing with 31 wickets at 29.71 including two five-fers. Jamal played two T20Is for the national team against England late last year. “I want to congratulate all the players who have been selected in the side, especially Mohammad Huraira and Aamir Jamal who have pushed their case through impressive performances over a period of time,” chief selector Haroon Rashid said. “The conditions in Sri Lanka largely favour finger spinners – something that we have seen over the years and during Pakistan’s last visit to the island – so we have three such bowlers to go with the mystery spin of Abrar Ahmed. At the same time, we cannot overlook the need for fast bowlers and, as such, we have included four pacers so the captain and team management have ample resources on the tour. We boast a strong batting line-up, which I am confident will do well in the two matches.” Meanwhile, PCB have confirmed the appointment of former South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel as the teams’ bowling coach. Morkel will join the squad on July 3 for a pre-series camp in Karachi before the team’s departure for Sri Lanka on July 9. The tour itinerary will be subsequently released.

Published on By When Singer boss Hemaka Amarasuriya headed the cricket board some 20 years ago, one of his keen interests was to build up a cricket academy at RPS like the one in Brisbane, Australia. The Queensland Academy was producing top notch cricketers at a rate and Amarasuriya had ambitious plans. A keen sports enthusiast who loved both rugby and cricket, Amarasuriya wasn’t just interested in producing fine cricketers, but giving a professional outlook on them as well. The academy that he introduced taught players essentials of life such as managing finances, cricket history, etiquette and English among many other things. Sadly, once Amarasuriya left office, the academy stationed at RPS ceased to exist. His visionary thinking should have been carried forward. Along with the academy came the program called Pace Ace, a unit headed by Rumesh Ratnayake and supported by Champaka Ramanayake. Those days Sri Lanka were solely depending on Chaminda Vaas and the need to have more fast-bowling resources was felt. Not only did the two coaches work with the next crop of quicks, but they also went headhunting for promising talents and were able to spot the likes of Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekara, just to name a few. Similarly, you see several young fast bowlers coming up in recent years and it seems that Sri Lanka’s fast bowling strengths are better than spin options. Usually, it is the other way around. You have got to give credit to SLC’s District and Provincial coaches who have done an excellent job over the years in grooming rare talents. Hambantota district where just a handful of schools play the game of cricket has produced the cream of the nation’s fast bowlers in recent years. There is Kasun Rajitha, Dilshan Madushanka and Pramod Madushan. Of course, there is also workhorse Suranga Lakmal, whose journey from Debarawewa to Derbyshire has been quite sensational. The only captain to have won a Test match in Barbados, the fortress of West Indies cricket, is not Imran Khan, not Kapil Dev, not Arjuna Ranatunga but Lakmal. It is the return of Dushmantha Chameera lead up to the World Cup Qualifiers that has enabled Sri Lanka to breathe easy. The quickest man in Sri Lankan colours is going to knock over the associate nations. He returned to international cricket this month after a seven-month layoff due to surgery and was quite a handful troubling the Afghans with his pace and not too often a Sri Lankan quick ends up as Player of the Series at home. There maybe not much cricket left in Chameera as he has been constantly injured and rarely fulfilled his promise. The team management has carefully looked after his workload but even then he struggled with fitness and Sri Lanka will be hoping that he won’t break down this year which is very crucial with the Asia Cup and World Cup coming up. Lahiru Kumara is capable of challenging Chameera when it comes to pace. Kumara at times struggles with his control whereas Chameera is on the money and tempts batters to take risks with his tight bowling. The most improved bowler of them all is Kasun Rajitha, who has taken over Lakmal’s role since the tall quick retired last year. It is Rajitha’s discipline and his ability to move the ball that has proved to be handy and often he provides a breakthrough earlier on. All the talk is about left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka, who became the highest paid player in LPL with teams bidding for his services fiercely. He will take home a cool US$ 92,000 for just two week’s work. But the left-arm seamer who doesn’t get much attention is Binura Fernando. Standing at six feet and six inches, the former D.S. Senanayake College cricketer generates a steep bounce thanks to his height. Matheesha Pathirana provides raw pace and his slingy action has not only earned him the nickname ‘podi Malinga’ but also has given Chennai Super Kings a quality death bowling option as they went onto win the IPL this season. The former Trinity player is yet to convert his success in franchise cricket into international cricket and questions remain whether he will be effective in the 50 over format. The fact is Pathirana is just 20 and he will learn as he goes along and will win Sri Lanka lots of games in years to come. Gradually, Sri Lanka’s attack has become pace oriented than spin. Wonder whether the curators should prepare pitches accordingly for home games. Not many pacemen barring Vaas and Malinga have had a major impact for Sri Lanka for a long period of time. You just get the feeling that all that is set to change. Published on By Bangladesh will host the Indian women’s team for a white-ball series in July. Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, Bangladesh Cricket Board’s women’s wing chairman, confirmed the development to Cricbuzz. “Yes, we will be playing a white-ball series against India women’s national cricket team in July and all the matches will be played in Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium,” said Nadel. It will be the first time in 11 years the SBNS will host a women’s international game. The last time the Bangladesh women’s team played at this venue was in 2012 against South Africa. All the matches will be day-affairs as per the draft itinerary prepared for the series and obtained by Cricbuzz. The Indian team will arrive in Dhaka on July 6 to play three ODIs and as many T20Is.

Khawaja, who stroked his maiden ton in England, went to stumps unbeaten on 124 – having batted through the day. He had the company of Carey, who was unbeaten on 52, and had added a 91-run stand before the end of the day’s play. For much of the day though, England were on the front foot after Stuart Broad had struck twice in the seventh over of the morning. First, he dismissed David Warner (14th time in the Ashes) when the southpaw dragged a length delivery outside the off on to his stumps. And then, had Marnus Labuschagne caught behind with an outswinger. England were on the offensive, with Ben Stokes being unconventional and proactive with his field changes. Steve Smith and Khawaja nullified the attack for an hour with a dour 38-run partnership before the former was trapped leg-before with a Stokes delivery that jagged back in – in what was only his second over of the innings. Smith took a review but to no avail. With three wickets down, for only 64 runs, England had owned the morning session and seized control of the contest. However, after Tea, the momentum started to shift. The in-form Travis Head took charge of the counter-attack, of which Moeen Ali was largely at the receiving end. It had started out with Khawaja, who danced down the track and hit the offspinner for a six in only the third over of the post-lunch session. However, Khawaja was kept in control by England’s short-ball tactic, which had the opener in a bit of an uncomfortable space. Head, however, didn’t hold back on the cuts and the pulls. He departed soon after bringing up his 14th Test fifty, chipping Moeen Ali’s flattish delivery to midwicket, handing the offspinner his maiden scalp on Test comeback. Moeen could’ve had another wicket to his name only two deliveries later when Cameron Green stepped out and attempted a big shot, only to be deceived by the turn. However, Jonny Bairstow missed a regulation stumping opportunity. Green was subdued thereafter and helped Australia head to Tea without any further damage. His only attack came against Joe Root in the last over before Tea when he hit the part-timer for two boundaries through the offside. However, soon after the Tea break, Moeen eventually had his man – beating him in flight, with drift, dip and turn to knock over his stumps. Green, by then, had scored 38 runs and stitched a valuable 72-run partnership with Khawaja. Nonetheless, that happened to be the only dismissal of the last session. England could’ve had another when Stuart Broad knocked over Khawaja’s stumps only two balls after the second new ball was taken. However, the third umpire noted that he had overstepped, offering Khawaja a life when he was batting on 112. The opener shut shop and went on to add only 12 runs thereafter in the last hour of play when Carey had taken the mantle of attacking the English bowlers. The ‘keeper-batter was always on a lookout for scoring opportunities, hitting on the up, over the in-field and at times, even just short of fielders. He brought up his fifty with a lucky boundary after getting an outside edge for a boundary while looking to attack Moeen Ali, only to be deceived by the spinner. England used seven bowling options on the day, but the bulk of the work was handed to Moeen, who got some assistance from the wicket but was also on the line of attack of the Australian batters. He picked two wickets in 29 overs, but ended up conceding 124 runs. Brief scores: England 393/8 decl. (Joe Root 112*, Jonny Bairstow 78, Zak Crawley 61; Nathan Lyon 4-149, Josh Hazlewood 2-61) Australia 311/5 (Usman Khawaja 124*, Alex Carey 52*, Travis Head 50; Stuart Broad 2-49, Moeen Ali 2-124) by 82 runs Published on By ( Nearly 40 pupils have been killed at a school in western Uganda by rebels linked to the Islamic State group (IS). Five militants attacked the Lhubiriha secondary school in Mpondwe at around 23:30 (20:30 GMT) on Friday. They entered dormitories, setting fire and using machetes to kill and maim the pupils, officials said. The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) – based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – have been blamed and a manhunt is under way. More than 60 people are educated at the school, most of whom live there. Uganda’s information minister said 37 students were confirmed to have been killed, but did not give their ages. Twenty of them were attacked with machetes and 17 of them burned to death, Chris Baryomunsi told the BBC. Survivors said the rebels threw a bomb into the dormitory after the machete attack. It is not clear if this resulted in a fire in the building which was reported earlier. Six students were also abducted to carry food that the rebels stole from the school’s stores, he added. The militants then returned across the border into the DRC. Some of the bodies are said to have been badly burnt and DNA tests will need to be carried out to identify them. Eight people remain in a critical condition after the attack. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the “appalling act” and called for those behind it to be brought to justice.

ASHES MATCH CENTRE: Edgbaston Test scorecard, stats BROAD GETS WARNER AGAIN in double strike | 00:57 Khawaja’s rearguard came after England seamer Stuart Broad tore through Australia’s top order in the morning session, with recalled spinner Moeen Ali also striking twice in the afternoon. However, the hosts were left to rue three missed chances in the evening session, including a dropped catch, a missed stumping and a front-foot no-ball, which left the Ashes opener on a knife-edge ahead of day three. Khawaja had averaged 17.78 in England before this week’s Edgbaston Test, passing fifty just once in 14 innings. The left-hander was dropped from Australia’s Test side on previous tours to the United Kingdom in 2013 and 2019, recently confessing he thought England was “the toughest place in the world to bat” . But the 36-year-old has finally gotten the monkey off his back, adding another chapter to his remarkable Test resurgence. “I think it was a culmination of three Ashes tours to England, and being dropped on two of them,” Khawaja said of his emotional celebration. “I don’t read the media, but when I’m getting sprayed in the nets and getting sprayed when I’m walking out there that I can’t bat in England, I guess it was just a bit more emotional than normal.” Get all the latest cricket news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail.

Khawaja broke the shackles in the ninth over with an elegant pull shot, his first of many on Saturday. Australia’s openers put together 29 before Broad claimed back-to-back wickets in the eleventh over, including his 15th dismissal of David Warner in Tests. The left-hander attempted a reckless swipe without any footwork, chopping back onto his stumps and departing for 9. Marnus Labuschagne, the world’s No. 1 Test batter, fell for a golden duck the following ball after fending outside off stump, edging behind to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow, who claimed a one-handed grab low to his right. Moeen produces moment of magic! | 00:27 Khawaja and Steve Smith steadied the ship, combining for a 38-run partnership for the third wicket before England captain Ben Stokes intervened. The Durham all-rounder, who has been nursing a long-term knee injury, nipped a length delivery past Smith’s inside edge, trapping him on the pads LBW. A perplexed Smith quickly called for a review, but the Australian vice-captain trudged back to the sheds after three red lights appeared on Hawkeye, prompting wild scenes from the stands. Smith, who had dominated England’s bowlers four years ago with twin centuries at the same venue, was gone for 16. “Let’s face it, the Aussies were bullied … Bazball is bullying the Aussies at the moment,” former Test spinner Steve O’Keefe said on Channel 9. “It just looks like negative cricket, an un-Australian way of playing. “Australia is on the back foot, tentative with their footwork, and it’s not working for them at the moment. “They’re doing the complete contrast to what England did in their first innings.” Khawaja continued about his business at the other end, bringing up his half-century in 106 deliveries early in the afternoon session. Smith GONE as England take 3rd wicket | 00:38 England’s pace bowlers troubled Head with a bouncer barrage after the lunch break, but the South Australian wasn’t afraid to counter-attack, regularly slapping off-spinner Ali over mid-on. Head raced towards a half-century in just 60 deliveries but fell victim to Ali moments later, chipping a catch towards mid-wicket to give the tweaker his first Test wicket since 2021. Ali should have had a second scalp later that over when Green charged at a delivery that turned and beat his inside edge — but Bairstow missed the regulation stumping. The error proved costly, with Green and Khawaja combining for a 72-run partnership for the fifth wicket to slowly chip away at the deficit. Once again, Ali came to England’s rescue, bowling Green with an absolute peach that drifted away from the right-hander and spun sharply out of the rough, crashing into middle stump. Khawaja brought up his exquisitely crafted hundred after tea with a delicate late cut through third man, roaring with delight after reaching the milestone. The emotional Queenslander pumped his fists and tossed his bat away in celebration before removing his helmet and looking to the skies. “He’s given us the dab, the shuffle, now the bat throw,” Head said of Khawaja’s celebration on Sky Sports . “It’s a huge weight off his shoulders. I guess as an international cricketer, everyone talks about hundreds overseas and he hasn’t had the greatest of times leading into this series. “I know he is determined and once he got through that new ball on that wicket, he played beautifully.” Bairstow’s day went from bad to worse after dropping a chance off Joe Root’s bowling in the 80th over, gifting rival wicketkeeper Carey a second life on 26. England took the second new ball and Broad immediately broke through Khawaja’s defences, bowling the Australian opener with a gem — but the centurion, on 112 at the time, was called back after replays showed that Broad had overstepped. It was the 36-year-old sixth no-ball of the day. “It was a great ball, I felt like I had slid,” Broad told Sky Sports at stumps. “Today I probably bowled more no-balls than I did in my career.” Carey’s good fortune continued in the 92nd over when an outside edge off Ali’s bowling bisected the wicketkeeper and first slip, also bringing up his fifth Test half-century. Khawaja and Carey (52 not out) made the most of their reprieves, combining for an unbeaten 91-run partnership for the sixth wicket to put Australia in arguably the preferred position at stumps. “I think it was a pretty good day actually,” Broad continued. “It has been a slow, turgid pitch so to be still 82 runs ahead of Australia with Pat Cummins and the tail next, we are pretty happy. “Things could happen pretty quickly for us in the first hour tomorrow and there wasn’t a lot in that pitch today. “Ultimately, our aim is for Australia to bat last on that and for us to bowl last on that and hopefully it keeps deteriorating.”","pubDate":"2023-06-17 22:53:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stuart Broad’s scheme pays off before Ben Stokes’ captaincy masterstroke: Day 2 Talking Points","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/the-ashes/stuart-broads-scheme-pays-off-before-ben-stokes-captaincy-masterstroke-day-2-talking-points/news-story/8b173dfcd8d49ca0e56f626392139701","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Usman Khawaja was the hero for Australia on day two of the Edgbaston Test, scoring a 15th Test century and guiding the visitors towards 5-311 at stumps, still trailing England by 82 runs.","content":"Usman Khawaja was the hero for Australia on day two of the Edgbaston Test , scoring a 15th Test century and guiding the visitors towards 5-311 at stumps, still trailing England by 82 runs. England was seemingly on top after claiming three wickets in the morning session, including the crucial scalps of Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith, but Khawaja’s rearguard ensured the Test match was delicately poised ahead of day three. Stuart Broad and Moeen Ali each snared two wickets, while South Australians Travis Head (50) and Alex Carey (52 not out) provided valuable contributions with the bat. Smith GONE as England take 3rd wicket | 00:38 ‘INCREDIBLE’: BROAD’S SCHEME PAYS OFF Stuart Broad had never dismissed Marnus Labuschagne in red-ball Test cricket before this year’s Ashes series, and the England quick only needed one delivery at Edgbaston to rectify that. Having just knocked over Australian opener David Warner for 9 on Saturday morning, Broad revved up the Birmingham crowd before charging in and removing the world’s No. 1 Test cricketer for a golden duck. Broad’s outswinger kissed the outside edge of Labuschagne’s bat, with England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow taking a one-handed catch low to his right. The Australian No. 3 sheepishly trudged back to the sheds having fished at a delivery he should have left alone. “That was the perfect ball,” Broad told Sky Sports at stumps. “I’ve been looking to bowl that to Marnus by design … it was a plan I wanted to do, so to do it was really nice.” Get all the latest cricket news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail. Sign up now! Stuart Broad of England celebrates taking the wicket of Marcus Labuschagne. Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Earlier this year, Broad revealed he had been developing his outswinger with Nottinghamshire bowling coach Kevin Shine in the County Championship, and the changes were specifically designed to trouble Labuschagne and Steve Smith. “It’s the reason I wanted to change something, to try and bring their outside edge in more,” Broad said back in April. “My stock delivery will always be wobble seam trying to nip back on off stump, because I think that’s the most dangerous ball. But to (Labuschagne and Smith), I think dragging them across with away swing is quite important. So this action tweak is pretty much designed at those two, and it was good to see it really swinging away today. “You always have to be looking for something to improve … I’m constantly working on things in training to see if something can work to implement in games.” ‘THIS IS BAZBALL’: STOKES’ CAPTAINCY MASTERSTROKE Ben Stokes’ dismissal of Steve Smith was one of the decisive moments at Edgbaston on Saturday, but the Durham all-rounder’s aggressive captaincy also accounted for the dangerous Travis Head later in the afternoon session. Moeen Ali, playing his first Test match since August 2021, opened the bowling after lunch on day two, and Head immediately targeted the off-spinner, smacking seven boundaries including a belligerent six that sailed over long-off. Most captains would have pulled Ali out of the attack after he conceded 45 runs from his first six overs following the lunch break — but not Stokes. The England captain brought the mid-on and mid-off up, luring Head into once again attacking down the ground — and the South Australian took the bait. Head miscued the lofted drive and chipped a catch towards mid-wicket, departing for 50 and giving Ali his first Test wicket in almost two years. “It’s brilliant captaincy, it’s aggressive captaincy,” former England batter Kevin Pietersen said on Sky Sports commentary. Moeen produces moment of magic! | 00:27 As part of England’s ‘Bazball’ philosophy, Stokes was willing to leak runs to take wickets, sticking with aggressive field settings regardless of the match situation. “One of the most important things of that dismissal was the brave captaincy with Ben Stokes,” former Australian spinner Steve O’Keefe said on Channel 9. “What does Stokes do with Mooen Ali, who’d gone for 45 runs from six overs? He puts a second slip in and keeps a catching mid-wicket. “It’s just the bravery of this English team, playing Bazball and maintaining their consistency to pick up wickets.” The innovative Stokes called upon seven bowlers in the morning session, including part-timer Harry Brook. “What is going on here?” Australian legend Ricky Ponting said in commentary. Former England captain Mike Atherton responded: “This is Bazball.” ‘NEGATIVE CRICKET’: AUSTRALIA’S ‘TIMID’ BATTING Australia’s defensive field placement ruffled some feathers on Friday , but the visitors’ “timid” batting was what raised eyebrows early on day two of the Edgbaston Test. Runs were hard to come by for the Australians on Saturday morning, getting the action underway with a trio of maidens. After facing 12 consecutive dot balls, a frustrated David Warner threw his wicket away by playing a reckless shot outside off stump, departing cheaply for 9. “England have made it really hard for Australia to score,” Ponting said on Sky Sports . “You could argue that led to Warner’s dismissal. The scoreboard was going nowhere, the pressure built and Warner played a shot he probably wouldn’t have.” Australia was in dire straits at 2-29 when Marnus Labuschagne departed the following delivery — in response, Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith immediately stamped on the brakes, scoring at 2.37 runs per over throughout the morning session. It was a stark contrast to England’s aggressive approach the previous day, when they scored at 4.65 runs per overs in the morning session despite losing a handful of early wickets. “The intent probably hasn’t been quite where you would want it to be, but that’s the way they play,” Ponting continued. “I don’t think they have done anything different.” Steve Smith of Australia. Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Australia only scored 13 singles before lunch on day two, while England mustered 54 singles during Friday’s morning session, partly because of the defensive field settings. “It just looks like negative cricket, an un-Australian way of playing,” former Australian spinner Steve O’Keefe said on Channel 9. ”Australia is on the back foot, tentative with their footwork, and it’s not working for them at the moment. “They’re barely going at two runs an over and are doing … the complete contrast of what England did in their first innings when they had the chance to bat.” ENGLAND’S KEEPING GAMBLE BACKFIRES England’s decision to drop wicketkeeper Ben Foakes ahead of the Ashes came back to haunt them on day two of the Edgbaston Test. Australia was 4-148 in the 46th over when all-rounder Cameron Green, who was yet to score, skipped down the pitch and looked to attack England spinner Moeen Ali — but the all-rounder was beaten on the inside edge. However, England gloveman Jonny Bairstow missed the regulation stumping chance, handing Green an early reprieve. It proved a costly error — Green combined with Usman Khawaja for a 72-run partnership for the fifth wicket to revive Australia’s innings. “He’s very square on … that left hip’s not really opening or riding the bounce,” former Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara explained on Sky Sports commentary. “He also didn’t expect it to turn, and sometimes you have to anticipate it, know that it’s going to come at you through the gate — make that adjustment, take a step to your left, and if it beats the outside edge, you’ll still have a good sighter.” Former England captain Nasser Hussain continued: “He gets a good sighter of it. He sees the ball all the way, there’s no batter in the way or anything. “He’s got that ball in his vision absolutely perfectly, and then because it spins a long way he’s in the wrong place.” Jonny Bairstow of England. Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Bairstow’s day went from bad to worse when he dropped a catch off Joe Root’s bowling in the 80th over, gifting rival wicketkeeper Alex Carey a second life on 26. Earlier on day two, the Yorkshireman had taken a smart one-handed catch to remove Marnus Labuschagne for a golden duck, also plundering an entertaining 78 (78) in England’s first innings. Foakes, widely considered to be England’s best wicketkeeper, was axed ahead of the recent Lord’s Test against Ireland after Bairstow returned from his horrific leg injury. England couldn’t fit Bairstow, Foakes and Harry Brook in the same starting XI, and the Surrey wicketkeeper was the unlucky player forced to make way. Bairstow, who had not donned the gloves in a Test match since September 2021, was backed as England’s first-choice wicketkeeper for the Ashes in his absence, but the gamble backfired on Saturday afternoon. ‘SCARED EYES’: WARNER FALLS TO NEMESIS YET AGAIN It was almost inevitable. When David Warner hopped off the Australian team bus on Friday morning, an England fan yelled at the veteran opener: “Broady’s gonna get ya!” The prophecy came true just over 24 hours later. Stuart Broad dismissed his bunny for a 15th time on day two of the Edgbaston Test, removing Warner for 9 to continue his stranglehold over the Australian . The left-hander chopped back onto his stumps after slashing at a wide delivery in the eleventh over, sending the Birmingham crowd into a frenzy. His lack of footwork remains a glaring concern. BROAD GETS WARNER AGAIN in double strike | 00:57 Warner has now been dismissed by right-armed seamers from around the wicket in 11 consecutive Ashes innings in England, averaging 9.45 during that period. Broad utterly embarrassed Warner during the 2019 Ashes, dismissing him seven times while conceding just 35 runs across the series. The 36-year-old vowed to be more aggressive when facing Broad in England this year — and he certainly lived up to that promise. “When I’m at my best, I’m taking the bowlers on,” Warner told reporters in December. “I can probably be a bit more aggressive and go back to the older me, take them on a little bit more. “It’s about just having that comfort of backing yourself, and I always do that, but I felt a sense of responsibility to actually adapt to the wicket and conditions that were in front of me, but now it’s just going back to looking to score and then my defence will take care of itself.”","pubDate":"2023-06-17 22:52:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Khawaja, middle-order turn the tables on England","link":"http://island.lk/khawaja-middle-order-turn-the-tables-on-england/","keywords":["Latest News","Sports","Australia tour of England 2023","England vs Australia","Joe Root","The Ases Test","The Ashes","Usman Khawaja"],"creator":["Priyan"],"video_url":null,"description":"Usman Khawaja’s century, backed up by fifties from Travis Head and Alex Carey, has allowed Australia to stage a fightback on Day 2 of the first Ashes Test in Edgbaston, on Saturday.

Khawaja, who stroked his maiden ton in England, went to stumps unbeaten on 124 – having batted through the day. He had the company of Carey, who was unbeaten on 52, and had added a 91-run stand before the end of the day’s play. For much of the day though, England were on the front foot after Stuart Broad had struck twice in the seventh over of the morning. First, he dismissed David Warner (14th time in the Ashes) when the southpaw dragged a length delivery outside the off on to his stumps. And then, had Marnus Labuschagne caught behind with an outswinger. England were on the offensive, with Ben Stokes being unconventional and proactive with his field changes. Steve Smith and Khawaja nullified the attack for an hour with a dour 38-run partnership before the former was trapped leg-before with a Stokes delivery that jagged back in – in what was only his second over of the innings. Smith took a review but to no avail. With three wickets down, for only 64 runs, England had owned the morning session and seized control of the contest. However, after Tea, the momentum started to shift. The in-form Travis Head took charge of the counter-attack, of which Moeen Ali was largely at the receiving end. It had started out with Khawaja, who danced down the track and hit the offspinner for a six in only the third over of the post-lunch session. However, Khawaja was kept in control by England’s short-ball tactic, which had the opener in a bit of an uncomfortable space. Head, however, didn’t hold back on the cuts and the pulls. He departed soon after bringing up his 14th Test fifty, chipping Moeen Ali’s flattish delivery to midwicket, handing the offspinner his maiden scalp on Test comeback. Moeen could’ve had another wicket to his name only two deliveries later when Cameron Green stepped out and attempted a big shot, only to be deceived by the turn. However, Jonny Bairstow missed a regulation stumping opportunity. Green was subdued thereafter and helped Australia head to Tea without any further damage. His only attack came against Joe Root in the last over before Tea when he hit the part-timer for two boundaries through the offside. However, soon after the Tea break, Moeen eventually had his man – beating him in flight, with drift, dip and turn to knock over his stumps. Green, by then, had scored 38 runs and stitched a valuable 72-run partnership with Khawaja. Nonetheless, that happened to be the only dismissal of the last session. England could’ve had another when Stuart Broad knocked over Khawaja’s stumps only two balls after the second new ball was taken. However, the third umpire noted that he had overstepped, offering Khawaja a life when he was batting on 112. The opener shut shop and went on to add only 12 runs thereafter in the last hour of play when Carey had taken the mantle of attacking the English bowlers. The ‘keeper-batter was always on a lookout for scoring opportunities, hitting on the up, over the in-field and at times, even just short of fielders. He brought up his fifty with a lucky boundary after getting an outside edge for a boundary while looking to attack Moeen Ali, only to be deceived by the spinner. England used seven bowling options on the day, but the bulk of the work was handed to Moeen, who got some assistance from the wicket but was also on the line of attack of the Australian batters. He picked two wickets in 29 overs, but ended up conceding 124 runs. Brief scores: England 393/8 decl. (Joe Root 112*, Jonny Bairstow 78, Zak Crawley 61; Nathan Lyon 4-149, Josh Hazlewood 2-61) Australia 311/5 (Usman Khawaja 124*, Alex Carey 52*, Travis Head 50; Stuart Broad 2-49, Moeen Ali 2-124) by 82 runs Published on By Ace fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been named in Pakistan’s Test squad for the forthcoming series in and against Sri Lanka, marking his return to the longest form of the game at the very country he played the last of his 25 Tests so far. The national selectors have also handed maiden call-ups to batter Mohammad Hurraira and all-rounder Aamir Jamal in the 16-member squad. Afridi suffered a knee injury in the first Test at Galle last year. It subsequently left him requiring a lengthy recovery and rehabilitation program that forced him out of the Asia Cup. Another injury suffered at the T20 World Cup in Australia meant the 23-year-old didn’t feature in any of the Tests of the home season. He is one short of the 100-wicket mark in the format and has taken his wickets at a very impressive average of 24.85. “I am very excited to be returning to the Pakistan Test side after a year. I dearly missed Test cricket and it was tough for me to be away from this format,” Shaheen was quoted as saying in a PCB media release. “After missing our entire home season because of the injury I suffered in Sri Lanka, I am eager to make an impactful comeback in the same country and complete a century of wickets in Test cricket. I want to thank my fans who have provided me support in tough times and I am ready for the challenges ahead.” Meanwhile, the call-up for Hurraira, the 21-year-old batter from Sialkot, had seemed imminent after an impressive run in the domestic circuit, where he topped the batting charts in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for two seasons in a row. In 11 matches last season, Hurraira hit 1024 at 73.14 including four centuries and two half-centuries. Hurraira will be joined by his Northern teammate Jamal. The 26-year-old from Mianwali topped the bowling charts last season, finishing with 31 wickets at 29.71 including two five-fers. Jamal played two T20Is for the national team against England late last year. “I want to congratulate all the players who have been selected in the side, especially Mohammad Huraira and Aamir Jamal who have pushed their case through impressive performances over a period of time,” chief selector Haroon Rashid said. “The conditions in Sri Lanka largely favour finger spinners – something that we have seen over the years and during Pakistan’s last visit to the island – so we have three such bowlers to go with the mystery spin of Abrar Ahmed. At the same time, we cannot overlook the need for fast bowlers and, as such, we have included four pacers so the captain and team management have ample resources on the tour. We boast a strong batting line-up, which I am confident will do well in the two matches.” Meanwhile, PCB have confirmed the appointment of former South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel as the teams’ bowling coach. Morkel will join the squad on July 3 for a pre-series camp in Karachi before the team’s departure for Sri Lanka on July 9. The tour itinerary will be subsequently released.

Five militants attacked the Lhubiriha secondary school in Mpondwe at around 23:30 (20:30 GMT) on Friday. They entered dormitories, setting fire and using machetes to kill and maim the pupils, officials said. The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) – based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – have been blamed and a manhunt is under way. More than 60 people are educated at the school, most of whom live there. Uganda’s information minister said 37 students were confirmed to have been killed, but did not give their ages. Twenty of them were attacked with machetes and 17 of them burned to death, Chris Baryomunsi told the BBC. Survivors said the rebels threw a bomb into the dormitory after the machete attack. It is not clear if this resulted in a fire in the building which was reported earlier. Six students were also abducted to carry food that the rebels stole from the school’s stores, he added. The militants then returned across the border into the DRC. Some of the bodies are said to have been badly burnt and DNA tests will need to be carried out to identify them. Eight people remain in a critical condition after the attack. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the “appalling act” and called for those behind it to be brought to justice.

However, Rakep praised the six Kenyan bowlers who he said are performing impressively in the contest among them Viraj Patel, Vishil Patel and Oluoch. On Viraj's meteoric rise in the national team which he joined last year, Rakep said: \"Viraj is a crucial player for us right now.
