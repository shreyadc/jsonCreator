A trio of England’s biggest sporting administrators – the Football Association, the England and Wales Cricket Board, and the Rugby Football Union – failed to even take part. The inaugural Race Representation Index, commissioned by the sport monitoring advisory panel via charity Sporting Equals, was motivated by the Black Lives Matter movement following the death of George Floyd. It aimed to provide a baseline on racial diversity across the sector, allowing progress to be tracked year on year, and was initially delivered to 52 national governing bodies on a voluntary basis. Two, the FA and the RFU, declined to participate. The final report, released on Monday, also indicates that the ECB along with the British Basketball Federation, British Swimming and Volleyball England did not even confirm receipt of the RRI paperwork. The deadline for replies had been extended from mid-December until 6 January. The ECB’s position is particularly notable given its November commitment to “a wide-ranging action plan to tackle racism and promote inclusion and diversity at all levels of the game” amid the fallout from allegations of racism at Yorkshire CCC. It is understood its non-involvement in the RRI was not deliberate and that it will be contacting Sporting Equals regarding future cooperation. The governing bodies who participated in the RRI saw scores delivered on basis of hiring practices at board, senior management, senior coaching and playing or athletic level before a final grade is produced. A similar approach is already used to track matters of equality in college and professional sport in the US. Ten out of 35 national governing bodies were awarded an A, B or C grade with 15 in the domain of D, E or F. Incomplete returns were received from British Rowing, England Golf, Badminton England and British Cycling. The three bodies to receive an overall A mark were England Handball, Basketball England and GB Taekwondo. An F was given to British Canoeing and Snowsport England. Ama Agbeze, who captained England’s netball team to Commonwealth Games gold in 2018, sits on the sport monitoring advisory panel. She said: “While there are successes which should be acknowledged and applauded for best practice there is, as a whole, a long way to go for sport before true racial equality will be felt and achieved.” The RFU did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. A spokesperson for the FA said: “The FA supports the objectives of the Race Representation Index and believes transparency is key to achieving positive change. We have published ethnicity and gender data for our general workforce, leadership team and the national coaching population each year since 2018, with targets and progress outlined within our equality, diversity and inclusion plan, A Game For All. “We also launched the Football Leadership Diversity Code in 2020, which measures recruitment across the FA, other footballing stakeholders including the Premier League and EFL, and club signatories. This aims to focus on what we currently see on the pitch being reflected off the pitch, with an initial focus on gender and ethnic diversity, and progress reported annually. As we are already providing clarity and transparency about our work in this area, we opted to not additionally take part in this survey.” Professor Kevin Hylton, a special adviser to the project, said: “The sport monitoring advisory panel and Sporting Equals feel that while the baseline has been established there is still much work needed from the UK sport sector before we can tangibly feel and see a more actively anti-racist and inclusive sector. “Through the work of the Race Representation Index the tracking of that journey will become transparent for all to see, in addition to allowing for best practice to be shared widely to allow for the cultivation of an inclusive approach to sport and physical activity.”","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9925a67ac04716f29258a4ea4c24b509ece366d0/0_216_4501_2701/master/4501.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7d8f2c6127fcc7550a74d4bc82d78cf","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Paul Collingwood ‘amazed’ by questioning of Joe Root’s captaincy","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/28/paul-collingwood-amazed-by-questioning-of-joe-roots-captaincy","keywords":["England in West Indies 2022","England cricket team","Paul Collingwood","Joe Root","West Indies cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Ali Martin in Grenada"],"video_url":null,"description":"Root ‘has backing of players and management’Interim head coach says England have ‘bottomed out’Paul Collingwood has been around the block long enough to know international cricket is a results game but is equally amazed that Joe Root’s position as England captain is being questioned given his impact in the dressing room.The tour of the Caribbean was intended to be a fresh start for the Test team after the Ashes debacle but a galling 1-0 defeat to West Indies – sealed by a 10-wicket blowout in Grenada – means England have failed to win their past five series and led to widespread calls for Root to step down. Continue reading...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-28 18:41:36","full_description":"Paul Collingwood has been around the block long enough to know international cricket is a results game but is equally amazed that Joe Root’s position as England captain is being questioned given his impact in the dressing room. The tour of the Caribbean was intended to be a fresh start for the Test team after the Ashes debacle but a galling 1-0 defeat to West Indies – sealed by a 10-wicket blowout in Grenada – means England have failed to win their past five series and led to widespread calls for Root to step down . Collingwood understands this reaction on one level and accepts that the Test team, sitting in last position in the World Test Championship, has possibly “bottomed out” during this winless winter. But, as the interim head coach for the month-long trip, he believes Root’s input behind the scenes is not being taken into account and will begin to bear fruit if patience is shown. “Sometimes it amazes me that he gets questioned, because of how it feels within the dressing room,” Collingwood said. “It’s the first time I’ve experienced him as a head coach and you can see the passion, the drive. There’s a hunger to get it right. These aren’t just words coming out of his mouth. “He’s desperate to get the team back to winning. I can’t say anything but positivity in terms of what he’s done leadership-wise. You have to understand how it feels in the dressing room and how strong a leader he is. He has the full backing from all the players and the management as well. It feels like he is still very much our No 1 to take this team forward.” Root’s apparent determination to plough on means the new managing director of the men’s team – likely to be appointed towards the end of April, with Marcus North, Rob Key and Mark Nicholas in the running – will have to make a call, in conjunction with the head coach they hire. There is, however, a lack of alternatives beyond Ben Stokes, a vice-captain who is already burdened by his dual role as an all-rounder and needed time out of the game last summer to address his mental health . To this end, Collingwood tried to develop a more collaborative approach on the Caribbean tour to “grow these boys into leaders”, but stressed this was not a soft environment either. The 45-year-old’s diagnosis for the loss was a case of a “monumental effort” trying to force wins during the first two Tests, only to then “break” on the third morning of the decider in Grenada. Joshua da Silva’s unbeaten century scrambled minds in the middle – including Root’s, it must be said – and England were then bowled out for a meagre 120 by the medium-pace of Kyle Mayers. Collingwood said: “The frustration about not being able to take those last two wickets quickly on the third morning filtered into the batting in the afternoon. Our decision-making wasn’t good enough. It’s something we’ve got to improve upon in pressure situations. We realise that. “We said when we came on this tour that we weren’t going to be the finished article. But we want to get the right attitude and the right things in the dressing room to progress the team. I think we’ve done a hell of a lot of good things, which is why it’s even more gutting not to get the result in the end.” Collingwood also remained unrepentant about the decision to leave Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad at home , claiming a player such Saqib Mahmood would not have got his chance had they been selected. Though debatable, given the back-to-back nature of the series was likely to require a degree of rotation, Mahmood certainly impressed with his skills and composure. Ollie Robinson, however, failed to get on the park after an early back spasm on tour led to concerns he might repeat his most recent outing in Hobart and break down mid-Test match . A return to Sussex, with a goal of getting in prime physical shape for the three-Test series against New Zealand, the world champions, in June, is now the plan. Collingwood’s own future is uncertain given the leadership vacuum in English cricket, something that goes right to the top with the role of ECB chair still vacant. Still technically an assistant coach in the set-up, this month-long project, though unsuccessful, has whetted his appetite. “It’s stressful,” he said. “You wake up so many times in the night. But it’s very rewarding, I promise you. I can imagine if you start winning and turn the corner, the satisfaction you’d get from that would be incredible. “It was always my challenge to leave this team in a better place than when I first got it and I feel as though it’s a lot stronger now. I’ve thrown my hat into the ring [for head coach] and if they want us, they know where I am.”","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98598ed1ba21130fd1f24a5ccee499bdc68b2c26/0_120_5274_3165/master/5274.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=829c6fcddffc5bb7d7aee72c008357b8","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Don't point fingers at Joe Root, says Kevin Pietersen","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/dont-point-fingers-at-joe-root-says-kevin-pietersen-735495","keywords":["Sports,Today NewsPaper,Cricket"],"creator":["The Hans India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former England captain Kevin Pietersen has lashed out over people pointing fingers at Joe Root's future as Test captain after the 1-0 series loss to West Indies, saying that the cricketing setup in the country 'stinks'.","content":"Former players like Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan, Michael Atherton and Steve Harmison have called for Root to be sacked as Test captain as England lost the third Test against West Indies by ten wickets at Grenada on Sunday and lost the series 1-0.Former players like Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan, Michael Atherton and Steve Harmison have called for Root to be sacked as Test captain as England lost the third Test against West Indies by ten wickets at Grenada on Sunday and lost the series 1-0.London: Former England captain Kevin Pietersen has lashed out over people pointing fingers at Joe Root's future as Test captain after the 1-0 series loss to West Indies, saying that the cricketing setup in the country 'stinks'.He added that the current state of England's Test cricket is down to the quality of players in the side. \"As a captain you are only as good as your players.

Rahul Tewatia is up for a quick chat. He says that the wicket was very good. Mentions that he and Miller had a chat to take the game deep. Tells that they needed on good over and they got it in the 16th over. Says that Abhinav Manohar is a clean striker and they have practiced a lot so he knew that Abhinav is capable of hitting a few big shots. Adds that he believed in Abhinav and he showed the world what he can do. Tells that the atmosphere within the camp is light and they enjoy their practice sessions. Lucknow started with a bang with the ball and it was Dushmantha Chameera who set the tone upfront by picking up a couple of wickets in his first two overs. Although, they gave away their momentum in the middle overs. Krunal Pandya came into the attack and he kept the batters on their toes. He picked the crucial wicket of his younger brother, Hardik Pandya and he also was the standout performer with the ball for Lucknow. The other bowlers leaked a lot of runs and it was the 17th over which was bowled by Ravi Bishnoi that took the game away from Lucknow. Gujarat was chasing an under-par score but they lost a couple of wickets early on. It was their skipper, Hardik Pandya who steadied the ship along with Matthew Wade and they stitched together a crucial stand of 57 runs, before Pandya perished. Wade followed suit and Gujarat was in a spot of bother at 78/4 but the partnership between Rahul Tewatia and David Miller bailed them out of trouble. Both of them started scoring freely and it was Tewatia who was the aggressor. In the end, it was Abhinav Manohar who played a handy knock to see his side over the line. The new team, Gujarat has arrived in style in the Indian T20 League! Rahul Tewatia has held his nerve when his side was under the pump and he continues to impress. Not to forget the debutant, Abhinav Manohar who showed great composure and ensured that they start the season on a winning note. Lucknow's bowlers tried hard but they had no answers to Rahul Tewatia's juggernaut. 19.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! And fittingly,Tewatia hits the winning runs! What a chase from Gujarat! Rahul Tewatia taking the limelight with him. Punches the air in delight and taps the batch on his chest to show he's right here! Avesh Khan bowls it in the slot, outside off. Rahul Tewatia gets forward and slices it over covers. Brilliant timing and there's no stopping that. Gujarat hold their nerves and they win by 5 wickets! 19.3 overs (1 Run) Short ball, on leg. Abhinav Manohar gets into a tangle but gets bat on his pull over fine leg. A single! 2 needed off 3! 19.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Absolutely creamed! This should be Gujarat's game now! Abhinav Manohar is putting up a show! On a good length, outside off. Abhinav picks the bones out of it and smears it with all his might.

Abhinav Manohar gets a boundary off the first ball of this over. Short ball, on middle. Abhinav Manohar rocks back and pounds it to deep mid-wicket. It almost cleared the ropes.

That was some kind of a comeback from Lucknow and now Gujarat have 159 in front of their noses. The Wankhede pitch is a great one to bat generally so their batters won't feel much pressure. But will they rise to the occasion and chase it down? The answer lies on the other side of the story. Stay tuned to see how the chase unfolds. Ayush Badoni is up for a chat. He says that he wasn't looking at the scoreboard and wanted to bat deep. Tells that he wasn't aware that he had got to his fifty. Mentions that he was nervous at the start of the innings but once he got his first boundary, he felt that he belonged here and that gave him a lot of confidence. Gujarat's strength lies in its bowling attack and boy, Mohammed Shami just spit fire right from the word go and was all over Lucknow. So much that he provided his side with 3 of the 4 wickets inside the Powerplay. They were right on track in the first ten overs but then a few massive overs including Hardik Pandya's figures took a dent. Rashid Khan did get rid of Hooda but they leaked plenty of runs at the death. They allowed their opponents to recover and that would hurt them. A tale of two halves! Lucknow's star-studded top order was rocked hard and how! The side were teetering at 32/4 in the Powerplay and then the onus fell on Hooda and Badoni to get them out of the rut. The duo managed to keep their wickets and did a terrific rescue job. Hooda turned the game on its head and Badoni then also joined the party. They added 87 runs for the fifth wicket before Hooda got out. But Badoni had other plans. He smashed boundaries for fun and played an excellent knock and Krunal Pandya played a good second fiddle. Lucknow have done well to put 158 on the board and would be pleased with it. Lucknow have done really well to get to this total after they were languishing in the abyss and they have Hooda and Badoni to thank for it. Hooda played a gem of a knock and then Badoni played a knock to remember for a long time. The knocks from Hooda and Badoni will definitely reignite hopes in their camp and would be happy with this total. Gujarat meanwhile were unstoppable at the start but lost their way later. They would still feel it's a total in their range and would fancy their chances here. 19.6 overs (1 Run) Aaron hits the deck hard, around middle. Krunal Pandya drags it to deep mid-wicket and manages only a single. Lucknow end with 158/6. 19.5 overs (1 Run) Banged into the deck, around off.

During the fourth match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants at the Wankhede Stadium, Gujarat Titans fast bowler Mohammed Shami made early inroads into Lucknow Super Giants’ batting lineup. Opening the bowling in their debut match, all Shami needed to pick a wicket was his first ball. Bowling to opposition captain Lokesh Rahul (0), Shami bowled an absolute peach of a delivery to the right-hand batter. A delivery which appeared to be coming into the batter initially, it left him after pitching as a clueless Rahul edged the ball to Gujarat wicket-keeper Matthew Wade. Readers must note that it was on Wade’s insistence that captain Hardik Pandya decided to challenger the umpire’s decision which worked in their favour. In his second over, Shami went through Quinton de Kock’s (7) defense to put on display another jaffa. In no position to play a defensive stroke, de Kock had to walk back to the pavilion for a single-digit score. Pandya’s decision to persist with Shami for a third over reaped fruits for Titans as the latter bowled Manish Pandey (6) to make him look oblivious in the middle. Shami’s bowling figures of 3-0-10-3 invited affirmative reactions across social media platforms for all the right reasons. Having reduced Super Giants to 29/4 in the fifth over, Shami registered a potentially match-winning performance tonight.

Aaron bowled a pacey short delivery outside the off-stump, to which Lewis decides to hook off his back foot towards the mid-wicket region.

Hardik Pandya there moves across to his right and bends low to stop the ball but the ball goes past him for a boundary. 3.4 overs (1 Run) This is a full ball, angling in from middle. Hooda sits back and tickles it to fine leg for a single. He is off the mark. Deepak Hooda walks out to bat. 3.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Has Shubman Gill pulled off the catch of the tournament already? What a stunner. This is the kind of catch that lifts the whole team even more. Why did you bowl a slower ball Varun Aaron when it's the quick one that has produced a wicket. Varun Aaron now bags his first wicket and Gujarat are all over Lucknow. Short ball, outside off. Evin Lewis goes for the pull shot but gets a top edge. The ball goes up high in the air, looping over mid-wicket. Shubman Gill runs back and keeps his eyes on the ball till the last minute and plucks the ball out of thin air. Not at all an easy catch but he made it look so easy. A blinder from him and Lucknow are crumbling at the moment. 3.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Slower ball from Varun Aaron and he gets punished. Full and outside off, was a knuckle ball at 113 clicks. Evin Lewis drives it and beats the point fielder. A boundary! 3.1 overs (1 Run) Well fielded! Back of a length, outside off. Manish Pandey steps out and cuts it towards cover-point. Vijay Shankar there does well to stop the ball and keeps it down to just a single. 3.1 overs (1 Run) WIDE! A little wayward from Aaron! Fires this length ball down the leg side. Manish Pandey leaves it alone. Matthew Wade does well to dive to his left and collect the ball. Wided. 2.6 overs (0 Run) Fuller length, on off, nipping away a tad. Evin Lewis covers the line and looks to defend. But the ball goes off the outer half to cover. Mohammed Shami is on fire. Another excellent over from him. 2.5 overs (0 Run) Length ball, outside off. Evin Lewis gets behind the ball and knocks it back to the bowler. 2.4 overs (1 Run) Back of a length, on middle. Manish Pandey hops and tucks it to square leg for a single. Manish Pandey walks out to bat. 2.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! TIMBER! First KL Rahul and now Quinton de Kock. Mohammed Shami with a dream spell here. He is elated and Lucknow have lost both their openers early. Good-length ball from Shami, swinging in from outside off. Quinton de Kock is completely beaten by that and the ball goes through his defences to shatter the stumps. The last one nipped away and this nipped in and Quinton de Kock had no answers. 2.2 overs (0 Run) Good-length ball, outside off, shaping away. Quinton de Kock looks to smack it over mid off but fails to connect. 2.1 overs (4 Runs) MISFIELD AND FOUR! Length ball, outside off. Quinton de Kock looks to drive it on the up. The ball goes off the outside edge to third man. Lockie Ferguson there lets the ball go through his hands and allows a boundary. That would hurt Mohammed Shami. Should have been just a single! 1.6 overs (1 Run) Back of a length, on off. Quinton de Kock looks to punch. The ball goes off the inside edge past the stumps to short fine leg for a single. 1.5 overs (0 Run) On a good length, on off, at 141.5 kph. Quinton de Kock defends it towards covers with an angled bat. Slight halt in play. There seems to be some problem near the bowler's landing area. The groundsman is out with some sawdust. 1.4 overs (1 Run) On a length, on middle. Evin Lewis looks to hammer it once again. This time though he drags it to deep mid-wicket only for a single. 1.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! First boundary of the innings for Lucknow! Length ball drifting on the pads, Evin Lewis swivel-pulls it to fine leg and finds the boundary. A well-controlled shot from the southpaw! 1.2 overs (1 Run) On the fuller side again, at 132 clicks, on middle. Quinton de Kock flicks it through mid-wicket for a single. 1.1 overs (0 Run) Fuller in length, wide outside off. Quinton de Kock goes for the drive but drags it back to the bowler off the inner half. Varun Aaron to bowl from the other end. 0.6 over (0 Run) Short of a length, on off. Evin Lewis goes for the pull shot but does not time it well at all. He was a bit early on that and gets hit on the body. A terrific first over from Mohammed Shami. A wicket of KL Rahul and just 2 runs off it. 0.5 over (0 Run) In the channel outside off, fuller. Evin Lewis prods and defends. 0.4 over (1 Run) Hits the good length, on off. Quinton de Kock taps it to cover and sets off for a single. The fielder there has a shy at the striker's end but misses. Lucknow would not want to lose another wicket here. 0.3 over (0 Run) Good-length ball, angling in on middle. Quinton de Kock defends it off the front foot towards covers. 0.2 over (1 Run) Length ball, on off. Evin Lewis works it to backward square leg and gets off the mark with a single. Evin Lewis walks in at number 3. 0.1 over (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT BEHIND! What a start from Mohammed Shami! Good-length ball, on the fourth stump channel. The ball moves away late and sharply from KL Rahul. He covers the line and tries to block it with a dead bat but gets beaten by the swing. The ball goes past the outside edge and carries through to Matthew Wade. The Gujarat team is very excited and appeal for catch but the umpire is unmoved. Mohammed Shami was very adamant that he has got his man and convinces Hardik Pandya to opt for the review. Replay rolls in and UltraEdge catches a spike indeed. Clear deflection there and KL Rahul has to depart for a golden duck. A dream start for Gujarat. Review! Hardik Pandya has opted for a review for caught behind! Some movement early on for Mohammed Shami and Gujarat think that KL Rahul has nicked it. The UltraEdge rolls in and it shows that there is a clear spike as the ball passes the bat. The on-field decision needs to be overturned! We are all set for the game to begin! The match officials have made their way out to the middle and they are followed by the players of Gujarat. Out comes the opening pair of Lucknow. Quinton de Kock and KL Rahul are at the crease. Mohammed Shami has the new ball in his hand. Let's play says the umpire. Rashid Khan is up for a quick chat. He says that he is excited for new challenges, new team and a new captain. Tells that he always enjoys new things and he is looking forward to it. Mentions that he just have the same mind but new jersey, team and skills and is so happy to be back here in India and the tournament is happening here. Says that most importantly some crowd is here too so it's great to see and he is looking forward to the competition and enjoy the skills and talent. Tells that it's always great to have the Purple Cap but more than that he will just have in mind that the team needs his effort. Says definitely it's been a long time since he had that cap on his head, it was in 2017 in his second game but since then he never had that cap. Says it will be a great feeling to have that. PITCH REPORT - Graeme Swann and Matthew Hayden are near the pitch. Swann says that it's a brand new pitch and two brand new franchises making their debut. Informs that the pitch has moved two strips across from game one, so on one side the square boundary is only 59 meters and on the other side is 70 meters. Matthew Hayden tells that there is a slight difference from Match 1 - it looks very dry and has a lot of grass from that first game. Rashid Khan will come into play since it is quite dry and it has lost its tack. Mentions that there are a few cracks opening up too. Dew is a huge factor so both the captains would love to chase. KL Rahul, the skipper of Lucknow, says that they would have bowled first well as dew plays a crucial part at Wankhede. Adds that it will be important that they enjoy their first game and express themselves on the field. Tells that they are very excited to get going and the new franchise gives them a good opportunity to enjoy the tournament. Mentions that the three overseas players are Quinton de Kock, Evin Lewis and Dushmantha Chameera. Hardik Pandya, the skipper of Gujarat, says that they will bowl first. Mentions that they want to see how the wicket is playing and check if there is any dew. Tells that it is special to play at Wankhede and says he has played a lot of matches there. Mentions that the boys will play with full freedom and informs there is no pressure on them. Says that it's a different role, different team but the feeling is same. Informs that Lockie Ferguson, Matthew Wade, Rashid Khan and David Miller are their four overseas players. Lucknow (Playing XI) - KL Rahul (C), Manish Pandey, Krunal Pandya, Quinton de Kock (WK), Evin Lewis, Dushmantha Chameera, Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Avesh Khan, Mohsin Khan, Ravi Bishnoi. Gujarat (Playing XI) - Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade (WK), Vijay Shankar, David Miller, Hardik Pandya (C), Rahul Tewatia, Abhinav Manohar, Lockie Ferguson, Rashid Khan, Mohammed Shami, Varun Aaron. TOSS - Gujarat has won the toss and they have elected to BOWL first. Both franchises would be happy to start their campaign against a new outfit but they would be aware that they can't take too much time to find their feet. It's going to be a cracking encounter and it will give us the first real indication of what a 10-team league is going to be like. Can Gujarat get a 'shubh aarambh'? Or will Lucknow come out as giants over them? We shall find out. Stick around for the toss and team news. The KL Rahul-led Lucknow side has fared well at the auction. They have got Quinton de Kock to partner Rahul at the top while they have a well-rounded and flexible set of all-rounders in Marcus Stoinis, Krunal Pandya, Deepak Hooda, Krishnappa Gowtham and Jason Holder. However, Stoinis and Holder won't be available in this match. They still have plenty of options to fill those places. Playing their first match, they would want to put their best foot forward and start their season with a win. All eyes will be on Hardik Pandya who will be making his captaincy debut with Gujarat. Rashid Khan, the vice-captain and Shubman Gill are his trump cards. Their strength lies in their bowling attack which boasts the likes of Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Shami and Dominic Drakes to name a few. They have a powerful squad and good all-round options as well. With a lot of fresh hopes, they will be keen to start their campaign with a win Hello, hello, hello! It's time for the game of debuts as two newbies, Gujarat and Lucknow will go face to face in match 4 of the Indian T20 League. It's KLassy Rahul vs Kung Fu Pandya. Plenty will be on the line for the two as they aim to outline an early impression in this league. The teams might be new but the players would be aware of the standards having been associated with the cash-rich league in some form or the other in the yesteryears. Despite being given the tag as the newcomers, both teams have the capacity to light up the stage on any given day and we promise you, a thrilling game beckons at the Wankhede Stadium. ...

Much like Pandya, Lucknow Super Giants captain Lokesh Rahul also wanted to field first. Asked to bat first in their first-ever match, Rahul laid emphasis on putting a “good total” on the board in the first innings. “I think it is pretty straightforward when you play at Wankhede [Stadium], everyone wants to bowl first. The dew plays a big part in the second innings but the wicket remains the same throughout 40 overs. It is our first game and it is important to go out there and enjoy ourselves, put a good total on the board,” Rahul told Star Sports at the toss. Severely affected by the absence of their overseas players, Super Giants will be taking the field without their trio of all-rounders in Australia’s Marcus Stoinis and West Indies’ Jason Holder and Kyle Mayers. While Stoinis is in Pakistan for a white-ball tour beginning from tomorrow, Holder and Mayers have just finished a three-match Test series against England at home. Readers must note that Lucknow have handed IPL debuts to a couple of lesser known youngsters namely Ayush Badoni and Mohsin Khan (ahead of the likes of Manan Vohra, Krishnappa Gowtham and Ankit Rajpoot). A top-order batter, Badoni represents Delhi in domestic cricket. Khan, on the other hand, is a fast bowler from Uttar Pradesh.

Marsh picked up a hip flexor injury and has been ruled out of the three-match ODI series and one-off Twenty20 International (T20I), Australia skipper Aaron Finch confirmed on Monday, the eve of the first ODI. The Western Australia player suffered the injury during a training drill and he has been sent for scans. Finch also said that Cameron Green will come in for Marsh. The timing of Marsh's injury isn't very great as star players such as Pat Cummins, Mitchell Star, Josh Hazlewood, and David Warner are all being rested from the white-ball series in their ongoing tour of Pakistan. While Steve Smith was ruled out at the weekend due to an elbow injury, Glenn Maxwell is another big name that is missing. \"I don't think he'll [Marsh] be available for this series based on how he was feeling yesterday.He sustained that yesterday in a fielding drill. It was a high intensity, lateral movement drill. He bent down to pick it up one-handed and went to throw and felt a twinge in his hip flexor,\" Finch was quoted by cricket.com.au, as saying in a pre-match conference. While there was no mention about the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), Marsh's franchise Delhi Capitals (DC) could certainly be sweating at the moment over the all-rounder's fitness. DC spent INR 6.5 crore for Marsh despite the player's injury history during the tournament over the years. Last season, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) replaced Marsh with Jason Roy after the former pulled out of the tournament due to 'personal reasons.' A year before that, SRH were forced to sign Jason Holder as a replacement for Marsh in the middle of the season after the player was injured while bowling in a game. Nevertheless, he has been one of the best limited-overs players in the Australian camp. He played a crucial role in Australia's T20 World Cup win last year in the UAE. Marsh was also the Player of the Match in the final, where Australia comprehensively defeated New Zealand to claim their maiden World T20 title. Marsh then went on to win the 2021-22 Big Bash League title with Perth Scorchers. Aaron Finch on Cameron Green: He'll probably bat in the middle order Marsh's injury has only opened doors for Green to showcase his talent. Marsh's fellow Western Australian, Green, has impressed in the whites, having scored 619 runs at 36.41 in 12 Tests, along with picking up 16 wickets as well. His only ODI appearance for Australia came in December 2020 when he scored 21 off 27 balls and finished with 0 for 27 in four overs in a 13-run defeat to India. Speaking about the 22-year-old Green, Finch said, \"He will probably bat in that middle-order. We're seeing that he's a super talented cricketer. He's someone who has been quite consistent in his Test career so far. His impact with the bat and ball can't be underestimated. I'm really excited for Cam to get that opportunity.\" Meanwhile, Warner's absence means, Ben McDermott could be offered another opportunity in the ODIs, while Smith's absence could see Marnus Labuschagne play his first ODI series since 2020. \"Marnus is someone who brings a lot to the team, particularly in these conditions with his leg breaks, and his batting speaks for itself. He's a wonderful player and continues to get better in ODI cricket and T20 cricket in particular. The fact he's bowling more and more is impressive. \"I don't know if anyone has seen the footage of our training yesterday, but Marnus bowled a lot and carried on like an idiot every time he got a wicket, which was quite good fun. He's someone who is so dynamic around the group, brilliant in the group.
