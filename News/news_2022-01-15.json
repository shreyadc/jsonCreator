Day one of the historic pink-ball Ashes Test in Hobart ended in “pathetic” circumstances, with a light sprinkle of rain robbing Tasmanian cricket fans of 30.3 overs of action. Light rain started falling early the evening session at Blundstone Arena, and umpires Rod Tucker and Paul Wilson decided to pause play after a brief consultation.

The covers were dragged onto the pitch and players returned to the sheds, much to the frustration of fans and broadcasters. But in farcical scenes, the Test match did not resume despite the rain dimming to what can only be described as light drizzle. Spectators on the hill did not bother searching for cover, with only one umbrella raised in the entire venue - that of fourth umpire Donovan Koch. Even the rain radar was bone dry, with only a couple of small blotches visible on the map. Weather stations in the Hobart CBD and airport registered a grand total of 0.0 mm of rain on Friday evening. Needless to say, the cricket community was unimpressed. Cricket reporter George Dobell tweeted: “Pathetic. You can hardly feel it. Might as well just punch spectators in the face and have done with it. You know, sometimes I‘m not sure Test cricket deserves to survive. The match officials - genuinely the only people at the ground using an umbrella - are bringing the game into disrepute here. We’re fools to put up with it.” Triple M commentator and former Middlesex captain Isabelle Westbury posted: “The only umbrella up around the ground is the fourth umpire‘s out in the middle. This isn‘t an exaggeration, I actually can’t see a single other one. Cricket doesn’t help itself.” Former Australian paceman Dirk Nannes tweeted: “Another example of cricket shooting itself in the foot. The game should not be off for this drizzle, if we can even call it that. The gutters are still dry. It could be the first rain delay when not a single drop of water goes down the gutters.” Journalist Ebony Abblitt posted: “Just stepped outside my house in Hobart… if that’s enough rain for a game delay then we were absolutely ripped off in play time at primary school.” Cricket broadcaster Adam Collins tweeted: “There have been some frustrating rain delays during this series but this takes the cake. Can‘t understand how they arrived at the conclusion that it was heavy enough to take them off.” Itâs barely even spitting at Bellerive Oval, and only one person has an umbrella up. Yes, itâs one of the umpires. pic.twitter.com/pZBr8TUZZN This rain has gone under the radar. #Ashes pic.twitter.com/KtS5gtjrQD The #Ashes making an absolute mockery of rain delays when there is no rain. I thought rain was a prerequisite for a rain delay. #Ashes Of course, safety of the players is paramount - Marnus Labuschagne, Stuart Broad and Mark Wood had each slipped onto the Hobart pitch on the opening day. Last week’s New Year’s Test in Sydney also experienced weather problems, with several rain delays disrupting the opening two days of action at the SCG. Seven overs were lost on day five due to a rain interruption after the lunch break, which ultimately proved critical - England secured a gritty draw after Australia’s bowlers could only manage nine wickets in the fourth innings. Australia was 6/241 at stumps on day one of the Hobart Test, with wicketkeeper Alex Carey unbeaten on 10 and Mitchell Starc yet to score at the other end. All of Australia had a chuckle at Marnus Labuschagne’s expense after his ugly dismissal on Day 1 in Hobart. But one legend wasn’t laughing. The fifth Ashes Test got underway in Hobart on Friday afternoon, but proud Tasmanian Tim Paine was not at the venue. Travis Head entered the Ashes with a question mark beside his name, but he made it an exclamation in a stunning statement ton.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Karnaghan eyes Green Shield quarter-finals","link":"https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7580994/karnaghan-eyes-green-shield-quarter-finals/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":["Josh Callinan"],"video_url":null,"description":"\"It definitely helps, that experience of playing high-level cricket.\"","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-15 01:30:00","full_description":"MORE GALLERIES NEWCASTLE junior representative Thomas Karnaghan is eyeing off a quarter-final spot in Sydney's Green Shield competition at the end of what's been a confidence-boosting campaign. Karnaghan is one of at least half-a-dozen cricketers from the district playing under 16s in the state capital with Hawkesbury on the verge of a top-eight position. The Jesmond 16-year-old, aligned with Newcastle club Wests, feels likes he's improved throughout the 2021-22 season. IN THE NEWS: \"It definitely helps, that experience of playing high-level cricket,\" Karnaghan said. \"Coming back to Newcastle grade or even Bradman Cup [last week], you notice the difference. \"It's challenging because you're up against the best people for your age, but that's what makes it fun at the same time. \"All the teams are really competitive and you just want to do your best.\" Wicketkeeper-batsman Karnaghan has a last-round clash for Hawkesbury against Campbelltown-Camden at Owen Earle Oval on Sunday. Only one point separates the upcoming opponents on the ladder after the opening six rounds. It leaves them either side of the top eight and, essentially, whoever wins the 50-over affair this weekend advances to this month's play-offs. Hawkesbury, who were washed out Thursday, arrive following three straight wins. This included Tuesday's narrow victory against Mosman, which doubled as a personal \"one up\" for Karnaghan over Charlestown's Kel Wilson and Cardiff-Boolaroo's Austen Hiskens. Northern Districts, featuring City's Harry Campbell, sit second overall. UTS North Sydney, including Belmont's Thor Harradine, are 12 th and need results to go their way.

Terry Farley’s venture into refereeing began back in 1952 and is still going to this day, with his final game coming at the end of January. Farley has been officiating for seven decades@JoeStephenson96 Refereeing at the highest level only gets more difficult But now is as good a time as any to get started, according to FarleyGetty Talking to Hawksbee and Jacobs, the officiating legend spoke about a career that has spanned seven decades and countries across Europe. The veteran also explained why now is as good a time as any to become a referee, and how he still maintains peak fitness to this day. “On January 4, 1952 was when I first passed my referees’ examination at the headquarters of the Durham Football Association,” Farley explained. “So on January 4, 2022 I had completed 70 years as a Durham county referee, so I thought, ‘Well, at 88 it’s time to hang up the whistle after 70 years of a career which has given me an awful lot of pleasure.’ Liverpool vs Manchester United is one of the world’s biggest and fiercest games “[The game has] changed immensely, I started off in the grassroots and made my way up the progress ladder and in 1965 I received an invitation from the Football League, in those days, to become a linesman.  “Again I progressed until I got on the referees list in the Football League which saw me refereeing Manchester, Liverpool, et cetera. Farley even officiated the man many believe to be the greatest of all timegetty “I ran the line twice at Hampden Park when Scotland played Peru and Scotland played Argentina and that’s when the name Maradona first hit the headlines and we realised what a wonderful player he was. “I ran the line at Wembley in the Charity Shield, I ran the line at Barcelona and Juventus.” After a frankly incredible career in the game, Farley is as well positioned as anyone to judge the current state of affairs in the game. The video assistant referee (VAR) had changed refereeing irreversibly, with the International Football Association Board writing the change into the rules of the game in 2018, before the Premier League signed up for the 2019/20 season. Football will never be the same again since VAR was introducedAFP Farley remembers back in his day when highlights were televised, there was far less scrutiny. “In those days when I was refereeing in the Football League we had Match of the Day and ITV did a spot as well, but of course now every game in the Premier League is analysed, VAR takes over on occasions so it’s evolved over the years.” Farley also believes that abuse directed at referees has only got worse since he started. “It’s a big issue,” he said. “Again going back to when I refereed in junior football which was quite strong in those days, generally speaking respect from the touchlines and respect from the players was good. Managers lose their minds again and again at refereesGetty And players love to jump in on the abuse “But the amount of abuse referees get these days really is unacceptable, both on and off the field I’m afraid, that’s at grassroots level as well.” Many will wonder how the octogenarian is still going, and he’s revealed he tries to maintain his fitness just as much as when he started out.  “I’ve always been fit, I played football for the school, I was a fairly good cross country runner, I played squash, cricket, et cetera,” he said. “I’m in the gym four times a week now, I’m pretty fit, I really am. “I wasn’t one for standing in the centre circle, I took pride in my fitness, obviously at 88 years of age you’re not as fit as you were.  Referees like Anthony Taylor have to keep at peak fitness at all timesGetty Images - Getty “I’ve got a game coming up a week on Sunday at Durham University which will be the final one, and Tyne Tees Television are coming out too to cover me and will be the last game.” Many are put off by the abuse and scrutiny that referees are put under in the modern game, but Farley has a clear message for anyone looking to start a career. “In my view there’s never been a better time to be a referee because in my day you were pretty much on your own,” he said. “Now you’ve got coaches and mentors and observers so if you want to be a referee then now’s the time.” Get The EDGE talkSPORT EDGE is the free football app that keeps you one step ahead of your mates with short, sharp and shareable content.

Head had come into the Ashes series with a question mark next to his name as he was one of the last players to cement his place in the team. Catch every moment of The Ashes live and ad-break free during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Try 14-days free now. But his second century of the series in a brisk innings on a green top with near English conditions has almost certainly penned his name into the number five spot in permanent marker. Head came to the crease at 3/12 and had to rebuild the innings alongside Marnus Labuschagne. But rather than take his time on what had proven a tricky wicket as Australia struggled in the opening 10 overs, Head appeared to treat the English bowlers with disdain. He flew to a near run a ball 50, before only slowing down slightly in the 90s to bring up his fourth Test century in style. Although he was out the very next ball after bringing up the milestone, it was a tremendous knock from Head, who appeared at ease from ball one in the middle. So dominant was Head, that England tried some odd fields which failed to shut him down. Of his 101 runs, 35 were scored through the cover region according to ESPNcricinfo, while he scored eight of his 12 fours between point and cover. It saw Cricbuzz reporter Bharat Sundaresan pointing out one of the more interesting field as five fielders tried to cut off his free scoring on the off-side. Thatâs the off-side field that Travis Head is managing to pierce repeatedly for the record #Ashes pic.twitter.com/IVDNnk3Gm3 Head has been one of the standouts of the 2021/22 Ashes series, leading all run scorers despite having missed the Sydney Test after contracting Covid . He’s smashed two centuries and a fifty, hitting 349 runs at an average of 69.8 and an unbelievable strike rate of 87.46. The next best of players to have played more than one match is Mitchell Starc, who strikes at 67.11 runs per 100 balls. And despite thrashing 152 in just 148 balls at the Gabba in the first Test, Fox Cricket’s Mike Hussey has declared Head’s Hobart innings was “better”. “We can compare, he made a brilliant 150 up at the Gabba and he’s made a magnificent 101 here, which was the better innings,” Hussey asked. “In my mind, this is the better innings than the one at the Gabba and the reason why I say that is he came in up at the Gabba after Labuschagne and Warner had done a lot of hard work and he could come later when the bowlers were tired and the pitch had flattened out a bit and he could play in that aggressive nature. “But today, Australia were 3-12, the ball was nipping around everywhere and he still had the courage to come out and play with such an aggressive mindset.” Social media also heaped praise on the star — even the Barmy Army had to give it up. Wow, that is some innings from Travis Head ð¯ #Ashes One of the great #Ashes hundreds by Travis Head. He's had a magnificent series, and remember it's been interrupted by Covid! That was a real pleasure to watch, thank you Travis Head!! #Ashes2021 Travis Head is in insane touch That is a truly brilliant hundred by Travis Head. He came in at 12-3 and reached three figures from just 112 balls But the modest 28-year-old said he was happy with how he has played this series. “I think I’ve read the conditions well, and some of the conditions well and some of the conditions up and situation of the game well – and that’s what was asked of me at the start of the series,” Head said. “I’m under no illusions that the boys at the top of the order have done a fantastic job to bat behind. Those boys have set an amazing platform over the first three Tests and I was able to capitalise on that over a few times. “I knew from Adelaide it was going to be tough going to Melbourne and Sydney and I was bracing myself for an opportunity would arise that I needed to play a different way and that may be in Hobart. I know the opportunity will rise in the near future where I have to play a different way, but I’ve been happy with the way I’ve moved, the positive nature that I’ve played and when the game’s dictated what’s been needed, I’ve been able to sum it up well. “It’s nice summing it up well, but also going out there and doing, I’ve been able to do it but I’ve been lucky enough to be in some nice positions to bat.” Travis Head tore the heart out of England once again but he was far from the only one in scenes that resembled an English countryside. Marnus Labuschagne is always entertaining at the crease but batter delivered one of the most bizarre dismissals you’ll ever see. Tim Paine will be far away when the fourth Ashes Test kicks off in Tasmania after leaving his home state before the historic fixture.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"IPL says Tata bye bye to Vivo","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/ipl-says-tata-bye-bye-to-vivo-724736","keywords":["Sports,Telangana,Today NewsPaper,Cricket,News,State"],"creator":["Y V Vijay Kumar"],"video_url":null,"description":"The new ad featuring Tata on the IPL pitch as title sponsor, replacing the smartphone maker Vivo, has taken the social media by storm.","content":"IPL says Tata bye bye to VivoIPL says Tata bye bye to VivoHyderabad: The new ad featuring Tata on the IPL pitch as title sponsor, replacing the smartphone maker Vivo, has taken the social media by storm. The first in a series of IPL ad campaigns hits Vivo for a six and establishes Tata in its logo is notable. In a way, it embodies the concept of \"Make in India.\"A homegrown company, which has a deep industrial history, transformed the economy of the country along with the public sector units, has replaced the Chinese brand of mobile phones in the cash-rich cricket league, IPL.  It will now be called the Tata IPL. This gives a sense of satisfaction to the cricket fans who treat this game as a religion. With the growing anti-China sentiments, Vivo had earlier pulled out of the IPL sponsorship in 2020. The phone-maker's association with the cricket league is set to end prematurely, as Tata has taken over the sponsorship for 2022 and 2023, after which the rights will be up for grabs again. The smartphone maker had agreed to a record-breaking Rs 440 crore deal with the BCCI for title sponsorship rights of the IPL from 2018 to 2023. However, following a heavy backlash from Indians following the Galwan Valley military clash between India and China in 2020, Vivo decided to take a break last year. The new Tata IPL video of 16 seconds is giving a touch of competition to the Makar Sankranti forwards on social media platforms. Taking the festive mood forward, Outcry Entertainment, which has released the ad, posted an interesting poster too, which screams: Kai Po Che, a victory cry used across Gujarat by kite-flying enthusiasts. Here the Tata appears to cut the string of the Vivo. In Hyderabadi parlance, \"Haffaaaa!\" Guess which brand of car from Tata Motors will be listed as the trophy for the Man of the Series. It's just a matter of time when this announcement too creates a big buzz for the cricket league and car-maker.","pubDate":"2022-01-14 19:05:18","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/01/14/500x300_1194971-ipl.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia"},{"title":"“We openly disliked each other”: Greame Swann brazenly reveals his dislike for Kevin Pietersen when duo played for England","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-we-openly-disliked-each-other-greame-swann-brazenly-reveals-his-dislike-for-kevin-pietersen-when-duo-played-for-england/","keywords":["Cricket","England","Graeme Swann","kevin pietersen"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Greame Swann brazenly reveals his dislike for Kevin Pietersen while the latter got involved in a series of controversies as England player.

While former England star batter Kevin Pietersen undoubtedly had a stellar career as an England cricketer, it was also one marred by way too many controversies. It all started with his rather short captaincy stint, which led to his sacking as well as that of then coach Peter Moores. Things never went back into a state of normalcy, as his feud with fellow English teammates came to light one after the other. While some were allegedly jealous of his rise as an IPL player, the others had issues with him leaking private information about Andrew Strauss with South African players, which eventually led to cancellation of his contract with ECB as well for a brief period. Pietersen also let the world know about the alleged formation of a clique within the dressing room, which led to him subtly threatening the ECB with his Test retirement. Ultimately, after many such aforementioned events, his glorious Cricketing career came to end following the 2013/14 Ashes series, which England lost 0-5.

I wanted a Kevin Pietersen who was scoring runs because he was simply one of the best in the world.” Reminiscing Pietersen’s leaked conversation with South African players regarding Andrew Strauss, Swann said, “There were times when there were exterior things like the texting with Andrew Strauss. “When you’re getting to the point that you’re having team meetings to discuss, ‘What are we going to do about these text messages that have been sent?’, and the player is saying, ‘I did not send these, it’s complete lies’, and then subsequently, you know he’s sent them and he’s saying ‘Well I did send them because they’re my mates’, that doesn’t help things.” Pietersen had publicly apologised to his teammates, including Strauss, when he got his central contract revived by the EBC for a temporary phase of four months. Swann, however, went on to state that both Pietersen and him were similar on many fronts, which helped them get along professionally, but denied the existence of certain cliques that Pietersen had always mentioned existed in the dressing room. “There weren’t discernible cliques,” he said. “We’re a team who got to No.1 in the world, and within a team there are always going to be individuals… 99 per cent of that team were very much in it for the team as well. What we ended up having with Kevin was a situation where he’d been captain before, and he definitely didn’t like the establishment and rules, much like me. We were actually very similar in many ways, me and Kev,” Swann exclaimed.           The post “We openly disliked each other”: Greame Swann brazenly reveals his dislike for Kevin Pietersen when duo played for England appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-14 19:02:49","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Cricket-England&#039;s Robinson needs to be fitter, says bowling coach","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/01/15/cricket-england039s-robinson-needs-to-be-fitter-says-bowling-coach","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - England fast bowler Ollie Robinson must improve his fitness to deal with the demands of test cricket, bowling coach Jon Lewis said after the 28-year-old suffered a back spasm on the opening day of the final Ashes test against Australia on Friday.

Trailing 0-1 after losing the Boxing Day opening Test at Centurion, the -led side showed immense resilience to win back-to-back matches at the Wanderers and Newlands to upset the firm favourites. \"To put it into perspective we have lost three tosses. A lot of people, including some of the media, had written us off after day one of the first Test of the series,\" Boucher said at the post-match media interaction. \"So, to come back after losing the first Test badly and then to win the second Test and now win the third Test is pretty incredible. It will rank up there -- in top five must be. Where we've come from, the on-field and off-field stuff... It's good to get some good results. The way the whole Test series was played was hard fought, some good cricket, it must be up there with some of the best Test series to have played in South Africa.\" Going into the series, the hosts were short on experience as they played their first Test in six months at Centurion. They played just six Tests under new captain Elgar as Australia opted not to travel for a four-match series last March. Elgar started his journey with a 2-0 win over the West Indies before losing to India in the Boxing Day Test. \"It's certainly something that we can take a lot of confidence from. This team is on a mission, really. We've been through some tough times of late and they have driven in a way that is pretty special. I'm incredibly proud of where they come from in a short period of time and the results are starting to come through now which is fantastic. Our feet are firmly on the ground. We know that we're not the finished product. We've got goals ahead of us. So we will enjoy this win,\" Boucher said. Going into the fourth day's play, South Africa started from 101 for two and finished the task with as many as seven wickets in hand. \"These guys deserve it. They've been through a lot together as a unit. So it's just nice to see that. It's a close knit group of guys. The World Cup was a massive disappointment, although we played some good cricket throughout. It is just something that was really needed in our dressing room to put the hard work in.\" In both the Tests, the inexperienced side under Elgar were set tricky targets of over 200 in bouncy conditions. Elgar showed the way in Johannesburg, helping the side chase down 240 in a seven-wicket win. Here, Keegan Petersen top-scored with 82 -- his third successive Test fifty -- as the hosts chased down the 212-run target. \"It doesn't surprise me because you got Dean as well who's that sort of character who leads from the front. You've got Temba (Bavuma) as the vice-captain who is the same fighter with that spirit in him, so you've got two leaders like that who the guys are going to follow. The guys stood up with regards to their own games as well.\" Boucher added, \"To put these things into perspective about where this team is and where the Indian team is... They are probably the best team in world cricket Test-wise at the moment. They've gone over to England, beat England, beat Australia in Australia. So this is something that our boys won't take for granted.\" For South Africa, Petersen and 21-year-old lanky left-arm pacer Marco Jansen were the finds of the series. Heaping praise on the duo, Boucher said: \"You get two youngsters who have just come into the side. Both of them deserve their little spotlights.\" Petersen, who was playing only his second series after a lacklustre debut against the West Indies in June, impressed with his solidity and composure at No. 3. The 28-year-old scored three fifties in four innings and each time bettered his score to be adjudged Man of the Series. He was also the Man of the Match in their series-clinching win here. \"Keegan probably didn't start off as well in the West Indies as he would have liked. Then he didn't start off too well at the Supersport Park. But he's always shown signs of the player that we are seeing right now. He just stuck to his guns. He's in a good position to have a guy like Dean next to him. He (Dean) really backs him. He's a tough nut and batting at No. 3 in Test cricket, you have got to be tough, you got to know your game, technically you got to be sound as well. Hopefully he just gets better, better and better. It's a very tough position to play in South Africa in our conditions, batting at No. 3. The way that he's come through the series, I'm at a loss for words. In a big series, against big players and to get the Man of the Series, he fully deserved it,\" Boucher said of Petersen. Uncapped left-arm seamer Jansen was a revelation and grew from strength to strength after an unimpressive debut in the Boxing Day Test. \"When you lose out a guy like Andre Nortje (hip injury), it was a big loss for us but then you get Marco coming to the side. We are really in a good space at the moment. A lot of people questioned his selection in the first Test. He didn't start off too well and the media jumped on him a bit, which I thought was quite unfair,\" he said of Jansen. \"But we saw what he had in Pakistan. He was with us in the West Indies, and it was just a matter of time before he came through because we can see the skillset that he's got and the variation. Now when we look at him and probably everyone's looking the same, what a find we've got, another addition to our bowling attack. He has a lot of cricket to learn. We find a superstar in him as well. He's only going to get better,\" he said. Averaging a superb 16.47, Jansen finished with 19 wickets, behind their top wicket taker (20). The head coach further went on to say that they have turned the corner after some forgettable performances in the recent past including a group-stage exit in the 2021 T20 World Cup. \"I believe that we've turned the corner quite a while ago. Our results have been pretty solid over the last six months to a year. We had the chance to try a few players. I think that's starting to come good now because we started to get a depth of cricketers that we can turn to,\" he signed off.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"“The lowest point in my life was the 2005 Ashes series”: Shane Warne admits divorce with wife Simone Callahan as one of the toughest period of his life","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-the-lowest-point-in-my-life-was-the-2005-ashes-series-shane-warne-admits-divorce-with-wife-simone-callahan-as-one-of-the-toughest-period-of-his-life/","keywords":["Cricket","Miscellaneous","Shane Warne","Shane Warne divorce"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Shane Warne admits divorce with wife Simone Callahan was one of the toughest phases in his life as an Australian cricketer.

One of the most decorated Cricketers in Australian Cricketing history, Shane Warne had a career marred with many unfortunate incidents and controversies. Be it his fallout with other cricketers, or receiving bribes from an Indian bookie, or a failed drug Test during the 2003 World Cup, the legendary leg-spinner had always dominated news and headlines during his playing days. One such incident also occurred a few days before the famous 2005 Ashes series, when Warne’s split with his then wife Simone Callahan, had become a highly publicized event. Warne’s marriage with Callahan, a Yoga instructor, lasted for ten years before the duo split in 2005. Shane spoke candidly about his divorce while commentating for Foxtel at the Australia versus England Ashes Test on Sunday, describing that period of his life as ‘really tough’. Taking the blame upon himself for the ugly fallout, Warne didn’t hold himself back to admit how tough it was for him to compete in the Ashes series of 2015.

So I have to live with that for the rest of my life, it wasn’t easy.” “[We divorced] a week before the [2005] Ashes series [and so] I’d have to drag myself off the canvas to get out there and play in against a quality England side,” he further continued. He further reminisced how he had to constantly endure the jibes from the English Cricket fans regarding his divorce. “[They chanted] for six hours a day, not just ten minutes, singing songs [like] “Where’s your missus gone?”‘, he stated. The divorce meant that the 52-year-old had to bade farewell to his children just a week later after them having arrived to meet him during their school holidays. “It’s not easy when your personal life is always in the papers and it has been for 30 years. I wasn’t going to pull out of an Ashes series. The kids wanted me to play, so I did. But that was a really tough time. “It was the only Ashes I played in that we lost and it was probably one of the greatest series of all time. I did pretty well with the bat and ball. I was pretty proud of my own achievement given the personal hardship and tough personal situation I was in,” Warne stated. Warne shares three children with his ex-wife Simone Callahan – Brooke, 23, Jackson, 22, and Summer, 20.               The post “The lowest point in my life was the 2005 Ashes series”: Shane Warne admits divorce with wife Simone Callahan as one of the toughest period of his life appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-14 17:07:12","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Lot of people had written us off after day one of the Test series: Boucher | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz - Cricbuzz","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcmljYnV6ei5jb20vY3JpY2tldC1uZXdzLzEyMDY5My9sb3Qtb2YtcGVvcGxlLWhhZC13cml0dGVuLXVzLW9mZi1hZnRlci1kYXktb25lLW9mLXRoZS10ZXN0LXNlcmllcy1ib3VjaGVyLWNyaWNidXp6Y29t0gGDAWh0dHA6Ly9tLmNyaWNidXp6LmNvbS9hbXAvY3JpY2tldC1uZXdzLzEyMDY5My9sb3Qtb2YtcGVvcGxlLWhhZC13cml0dGVuLXVzLW9mZi1hZnRlci1kYXktb25lLW9mLXRoZS10ZXN0LXNlcmllcy1ib3VjaGVyLWNyaWNidXp6Y29t?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Lot of people had written us off after day one of the Test series: Boucher | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  Cricbuzz'I am lost for words' - Mark Boucher on 'tough nut' Keegan Petersen's showing against India  ESPNcricinfoSouth Africa Was Written Off After Day One Of The First Test - Mark Boucher Savors Sweet Series Win Over India  Cricket AddictorElgar happy with South Africa response after 'hard chats'  Times of IndiaElgar: 'We were thrown under the sword and the guys responded brilliantly'  ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-14 16:54:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Despite limited preparation, Canada cricketers says they are ready for U-19 World Cup","link":"https://www.sootoday.com/national-sports/despite-limited-preparation-canada-cricketers-says-they-are-ready-for-u-19-world-cup-4955846","keywords":null,"creator":["Canadian Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"Winter and the pandemic complicated Canadian preparations for the ICC Under-19 Men's Cricket World Cup in the West Indies.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-14 16:52:02","full_description":"Winter and the pandemic complicated Canadian preparations for the ICC Under-19 Men's Cricket World Cup in the West Indies. But captain Mihir Patel says spirits are high as the Canadians prepare for their opening match Saturday against the United Arab Emirates in Basseterre, the St. Kitts and Nevis capital. \"The mood is great in the team,\" said Patel. \"Everyone's really excited and ready to go. We've had a few good practice sessions and a couple of useful practice games.\" The 19-year-old from Markham, Ont., admits it was a different story in Canada. \"Leading up to the tournament, It wasn't ideal for us with our COVID situation back home. We weren't able to practise for the two, three weeks leading up to our departure from Canada,\" he said. \"But that's not an excuse. We've been playing cricket our whole lives.\" The Canadians held a domestic camp for close to 10 weeks that was halted \"probably when we need it the most, the last two or three weeks.\" The team arrived in the Caribbean on Jan. 3, serving a three-day quarantine before being able to train in small groups. Canada is making its fifth straight appearance — eighth overall — at the tournament. It has yet to make it past the first round with an 11th-place finish in 2010 its best showing. Canada was beaten by the Emirates in the group stage at the 2020 tournament in South Africa but avenged that defeat in the 13th-place playoff. Patel scored 90 runs off 105 balls in the eight-wicket loss to the Emirates. The 16 teams have been split into four groups with the top two in each advancing to the Super League and the remaining sides moving on to the Plate playoffs. The competition runs through Feb. 5 across four Caribbean countries. The Canadians, who beat out Argentina, Bermuda and the U.S. to get to the tournament, face stiff competition with defending champion Bangladesh and England also in Group A. Patel, who says Canada's strength is its depth, both batting and bowling, says the 2020 tournament was a valuable learning experience. \"I realized we're not too far off from the actual cricket-playing countries who have full (ICC) status and who are able to play all year-round,\" he said. \"I just think whenever we're put under the pump, whenever the pressure's on, we tend to crumble. And I think that's what's cost us a lot of games in the past.\" \"So I just told them to enjoy themselves and to understand whatever the situation is, try to raise the best of your ability,\" he added. \"And understand that different skills are required at different times. You don't always need to play a certain way.\" Canada will be looking to fast bowler Parmveer Kharoud to do some damage. A second-year finance student at York University, Patel says he will be combining school work and play during the tournament. Bangladesh defeated India to win the 2020 tournament. Left-arm spinner Rakibul Hasan, part of that winning team, is back as captain. England, making its 14th tournament appearance, won the title in 1998 and finished third in 2014. It placed ninth last time out after facing a tough group that also featured Australia and the West Indies. English spin bowler Archie Lenham played for Sussex in 2021 at the age of just 17. The Emirates features two returning players: all-rounder Alishan Sharafu, a full international who captains the side, and 17-year-old wicket-keeper Kai Smith, who was just 15 when he played in the South Africa tournament. Group B features India, Ireland, South Africa and Uganda while Group C comprises Afghanistan, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Zimbabwe. Group D is made up of Australia, Scotland, Sri Lanka and host West Indies. New Zealand withdrew from the competition, citing domestic quarantine requirements. That opened the door for Scotland to join the field. Four Four Zimbabwe cricketers tested positive last week and were self-isolating in the West Indies. The virus has also ruled out Pakistan batsman Abdul Bangalzai. Afghanistan's group schedule had to be revamped after the side was late arriving due to visa issues.

Trailing 0-1 after losing the Boxing Day opening Test at Centurion, the Dean Elgar-led side showed immense resilience to win back-to-back matches at the Wanderers and Newlands to upset the firm favourites. \"To put it into perspective we have lost three tosses. A lot of people, including some of the media, had written us off after day one of the first Test of the series,\" Boucher said at the post-match media interaction. \"So, to come back after losing the first Test badly and then to win the second Test and now win the third Test is pretty incredible. \"It will rank up there -- in top five must be. Where we've come from, the on-field and off-field stuff... It's good to get some good results. \"The way the whole Test series was played was hard fought, some good cricket, it must be up there with some of the best Test series to have played in South Africa. \" Will take a lot of confidence from this triumph ============================= Going into the series, the hosts were short on experience as they played their first Test in six months at Centurion. They played just six Tests under new captain Elgar as Australia opted not to travel for a four-match series last March. Elgar started his journey with a 2-0 win over the West Indies before losing to India in the Boxing Day Test. \"It's certainly something that we can take a lot of confidence from. This team is on a mission, really. We've been through some tough times of late and they have driven in a way that is pretty special. \"I'm incredibly proud of where they come from in a short period of time and the results are starting to come through now which is fantastic. \"Our feet are firmly on the ground. We know that we're not the finished product. We've got goals ahead of us. So we will enjoy this win,\" Boucher said. Going into the fourth day's play, South Africa started from 101 for two and finished the task with as many as seven wickets in hand. \"These guys deserve it. They've been through a lot together as a unit. So it's just nice to see that. \"It's a close knit group of guys. The World Cup was a massive disappointment, although we played some good cricket throughout. \"It is just something that was really needed in our dressing room to put the hard work in.\" Not surprised with the character shown ======================== In both the Tests, the inexperienced side under Elgar were set tricky targets of over 200 in bouncy conditions. Elgar showed the way in Johannesburg, helping the side chase down 240 in a seven-wicket win. Here, Keegan Petersen top-scored with 82 -- his third successive Test fifty -- as the hosts chased down the 212-run target. \"It doesn't surprise me because you got Dean as well who's that sort of character who leads from the front. \"You've got Temba (Bavuma) as the vice-captain who is the same fighter with that spirit in him, so you've got two leaders like that who the guys are going to follow. \"The guys stood up with regards to their own games as well.\" Boucher added, \"To put these things into perspective about where this team is and where the Indian team is... They are probably the best team in world cricket Test-wise at the moment. \"They've gone over to England, beat England, beat Australia in Australia. So this is something that our boys won't take for granted.\" Loss for words for Keegan ================= For South Africa, Petersen and 21-year-old lanky left-arm pacer Marco Jansen were the finds of the series. Heaping praise on the duo, Boucher said: \"You get two youngsters who have just come into the side. Both of them deserve their little spotlights.\" Petersen, who was playing only his second series after a lacklustre debut against the West Indies in June, impressed with his solidity and composure at No. 3. The 28-year-old scored three fifties in four innings and each time bettered his score to be adjudged Man of the Series. He was also the Man of the Match in their series-clinching win here. \"Keegan probably didn't start off as well in the West Indies as he would have liked. Then he didn't start off too well at the Supersport Park. \"But he's always shown signs of the player that we are seeing right now. He just stuck to his guns. He's in a good position to have a guy like Dean next to him. He (Dean) really backs him. \"He's a tough nut and batting at No. 3 in Test cricket, you have got to be tough, you got to know your game, technically you got to be sound as well. Hopefully he just gets better, better and better. \"It's a very tough position to play in South Africa in our conditions, batting at No. 3. The way that he's come through the series, I'm at a loss for words. In a big series, against big players and to get the Man of the Series, he fully deserved it,\" Boucher said of Petersen. Found a superstar in Jansen ================== Uncapped left-arm seamer Jansen was a revelation and grew from strength to strength after an unimpressive debut in the Boxing Day Test. \"When you lose out a guy like Andre Nortje (hip injury), it was a big loss for us but then you get Marco coming to the side. We are really in a good space at the moment.\" \"A lot of people questioned his selection in the first Test. He didn't start off too well and the media jumped on him a bit, which I thought was quite unfair,\" he said of Jansen. \"But we saw what he had in Pakistan. He was with us in the West Indies, and it was just a matter of time before he came through because we can see the skillset that he's got and the variation.\" Averaging a superb 16.47, Jansen finished with 19 wickets, behind their top wicket taker Kagiso Rabada (20). \"Now when we look at him and probably everyone's looking the same, what a find we've got, another addition to our bowling attack. He has a lot of cricket to learn. We find a superstar in him as well. He's only going to get better,\" he said. We've turned the corner quite a while ago ========================== The head coach further went on to say that they have turned the corner after some forgettable performances in the recent past including a group-stage exit in the 2021 T20 World Cup. \"I believe that we've turned the corner quite a while ago. Our results have been pretty solid over the last six months to a year. \"We had the chance to try a few players. I think that's starting to come good now because we started to get a depth of cricketers that we can turn to,\" he signed off.
