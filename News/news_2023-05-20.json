The 62nd Annual General Meeting of SLC takes place at the Hilton Colombo Residences, Union Place, Colombo 2 at 10 a.m. today with the incumbent office-bearers due to be elected uncontested for another two-year term. Reflecting on the past two years former SLC President and current Secretary Mohan de Silva said: “We are quite happy the way things have worked out despite many challenges. Since last September we have been going through a lot of unwanted harassment. Soon after the T20 World Cup and incidents that took place in Australia we were confronted with various challenges, unnecessary interference, ridiculing and vilifying SLC. Even the captain was subject to harassment, but we were always confident that we had not done anything wrong.” “There were individuals who were unable to come through the democratic process pushing the Sports Minister to dissolve SLC and appoint an interim committee. We had no option but to officially complain to the ICC in writing. The ICC appointed a three-member committee to look into our grievances. We are happy that the ICC representatives were able to come when we complained about unwarranted interferences. They gave us a hearing and sent the Vice Chairman Imran Khawaja and another responsible employee on a fact finding mission. We can fearlessly say that we are prepared to face any consequences for any misappropriation of funds or irregularities that can be proved.

But these false accusations and trying to ruin our reputation will not do any good for the game, the Institution or the country as there will be long term ramifications where the cricket loving public will look at us with crooked eyes. It is very bad for the reputation of the institution and also for our sponsors.” “We are happy that there is some sanity prevailing and the Sports Minister has a better understanding of the situation now. We have been working with Sports Ministers in the past and SLC has never undergone this sort of harassment before, not to this extent. This is despite assisting the Sports Ministry by giving them large sums of money. But I am happy to state that going into another term in office we are confident the way things have worked out so far despite the obstacles that have been put in our path to progress. We are looking forward to working independently with the Sports Minister. We should have the right to make decisions independently. We take them in the interest of the game and the country.” Creating a pathway for young cricketers De Silva had a word of praise for the incumbent President Shammi Silva whom he said provided good leadership and maintained excellent rapport with the Asian counterparts particularly, India. “You’ve got to go with India; they actually generate 85 percent of the revenue of the ICC. All of us benefit because of that. We gained a lot through the dollar appreciation. It was one of the contributing factors for SLC recording a record surplus of Rs. 6.3 billion. We are very happy with what we have achieved. We have a long term strategic plan and we have created a pathway for our young cricketers to elevate to the national level and have engaged Tim McCaskill who was the former High Performance Manager, Cricket Victoria, to head our High Performance Centre. He is the one preparing the pyramid and the pathway in consultation with the administration from school to reach national level. We have also given a lot of opportunities during the last two years to develop the skills of Emerging and ‘A’ team players to advance to national status.” Lack of professionalism “The national team has not been consistent due to various reasons. We have been concentrating on building up a young team in the last three years. We have succeeded to some extent but we are not happy with their performance up to now as they have not been able to play to their true potential. The fact remains that we won the Asia Cup beating some of the strongest teams both India and Pakistan, but unfortunately since then we failed to get into the next round in the T20 World Cup. We’ve had several discussions of how we can further enhance the performance of the national team. Enhancing the national team players’ mental strength and introducing more professionalism and also guiding them in their careers. They have the skills but the real professionalism and the overall refinement to compete at the highest level with the rest of the world is lacking. In 50-over cricket we have not fared well and not played to our true potential. It’s not that we don’t have the players but we lack the temperament, professionalism and the intelligence to understand game situations and to adapt to such situations. We are taking new steps like strengthening the academy at Khettarama and getting responsible people to make them accountable if the players don’t perform and the team fails. We have also been getting better coaching staff from time to time. Mahela (Jayawardene) has contributed a lot not only to the national team but from under-19 level upwards. With his experience and vast knowledge of the game, he has been an asset to us contributing a lot and we appreciate his contribution.” Reducing the number of votes De Silva stated that SLC is conscious of the necessity to introduce reforms to its constitution to reduce the number of votes which at present stands at a staggering 145. “There is a lot of accusation on SLC for having such a large number of votes but unfortunately our constitution has provided the membership to attain that status over a period of time. There are so many controlling clubs who do not play cricket at a higher level, but enjoy two votes. We are also not happy with these disparities. That is why we are also trying to introduce reforms in a democratic and acceptable manner without trying to hijack the rights and privileges of the membership. Since the year 2000 I can very responsibly say that we have never given new membership to anyone. Even where the SLC constitution provides for clubs winning championships could elevate to a higher level and enjoy a higher status with an additional vote etc., we have refrained from these status changes for quite some time now. We have also appointed a 10-member committee and have requested them to come up with a viable and acceptable proposal. In consultation with the Sports Ministry we are thinking of arriving at an acceptable solution on how to reduce the number of votes. We also have to get two-thirds majority from the membership and we have to convince them of the importance of doing the same for the sake of the game.","pubDate":"2023-05-19 23:02:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket Board Request Proposals For Services","link":"https://bernews.com/2023/05/bermuda-cricket-board-request-proposal/","keywords":["All","Sports","#BermudaCricket"],"creator":["Bernews5"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Bermuda Cricket Board [BCB] is requesting proposals for a variety of services for two events sent to be held in September and October.

Last year's beaten finalists St Elizabeth Technical...","content":"Last year's beaten finalists St Elizabeth Technical High School (STETHS) and Manchester High School are the two remaining rural teams, and they are gunning to exit this year's schoolboy season with another feather in their cap. The unbeaten STETHS will face defending champions Wolmer's Boys' School in the opening fixture at Sabina Park at 10 a.m. They are keen to get things right this time, to turn their fortunes around, and cap off a season that has been nothing short of excellent so far, having won the Headley Cup, the all-island Spalding Cup and the rural T20 championship. \"We have been dominating schoolboy cricket for some time, and all we need to do is to go out and play without any tension on our backs and play to our ability and not play the opponents,\" said Clive Ledgister, coach of STETHS. Last season, STETHS had it to win the final against Wolmer's after looking to chase down a paltry 88, but the St Elizabeth-based STETHS folded for 83 runs, and coach Ledgister said they learnt a lot from last season's capitulation. \"The match last year, we were more self-destructive than beaten, and this year will be a lot different as all the players are more mature.\" Manchester are a couple of miles east of STETHS, and they have something to say about lifting the final schoolboy cricket trophy on offer, as they have been in imperious form, heading into the penultimate round of the championship. Last Saturday, they brushed aside a hapless St George's College to top their zone and book their place in the final four. Having not got to the other finals, the talented Manchester feel this is their best chance to lift a title this season, and their captain Sanjay Walker is keen to get things right come Saturday at 2 p.m. against urban area outfit Excelsior High. \"We didn't get to play in the Headley Cup final, and we want to make sure that we make this final and give ourselves a chance to win a trophy. We went back to the drawing board and put in some hard work, and right now, it is all about executing,\" Walker said.","pubDate":"2023-05-19 18:50:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicastar","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PBKS vs RR: राजस्थान रॉयल्स ने पंजाब किंग्स को 4 विकेट से हराया","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/hindi/cricket/pbks-vs-rr-live-score-ipl-2023-today-66th-match-punjab-kings-vs-rajasthan-royals-live-score-updates-4049015#publisher=newsstand","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PBKS vs RR, IPL 2023: रियान पराग (20) ने भी कोशिश की, लेकिन खाली जाती गेंदों के बीच दबाव इतना बढ़ा कि बेहतर रन-रेट की आस खत्म हो गयी. इसके लिए राजस्थान को जीत का लक्ष्य 18.3 ओवरों में हासिल करना था, लेकिन उसने इसे सात गेंद देरी से 19.4 ओवरों में हासिल किया.","content":"PBKS vs RR: अपने हालात बेहतर से बदतर करने के लिए खुद राजस्थान जिम्मेदार है जारी आईपीएल के तहत शुक्रवार को धर्मशाला में खेले गए दिन के इकलौते मुकाबले में राजस्थान रॉयल्स ने पंजाब किंग्स को 4 विकेट से हरा दिया, लेकिन जीत के बाजूद राजस्थानी नेट रन-रेट के मामले में आरसीबी से पिछड़ गए हैं. राजस्थान के सामने जीत से बड़ा चैलेंज आरसीबी से बेहतर नेट रन करना था, लेकिन उसे शुरुआत में ही झटका लगा, जब आतिशी जोस बटलर (00) खाता भी नहीं खोल सके, लेकिन युवा यशस्वी जयसवाल (50) और देवदत्त पडिक्कल (51) ने दूसरे विकेट के लिए 84 रन जोड़कर राजस्थान के लिए आरसीबी से बेहतर नेट रन-रेट की उम्मीदें जगाए रखीं. संजू सैमसन (2) इस मौके पर टीम का जल्द ही साथ छोड़ गए, लेकिन जब जयसवाल आउट हुए, तो यहां से राजस्थान की मु्श्किलें बढ़नी शुरू हो गयीं. एक छोर पर शिमरोन हेटायर (46) ने कुछ प्रहार लगाते हुए उम्मीद जगायी, तो रियान पराग (20) ने भी कोशिश की, लेकिन खाली जाती गेंदों के बीच दबाव इतना बढ़ा कि बेहतर रन-रेट की आस खत्म हो गयी. इसके लिए राजस्थान को जीत का लक्ष्य 18.3 ओवरों में हासिल करना था, लेकिन उसने इसे सात गेंद देरी से 19.4 ओवरों में हासिल किया. पहली पाली में पंजाब किंग्स ने बहुत ही अहम मुकाबले में राजस्थान के सामने जीत के लिए 188 रनों का लक्ष्य रखा. बल्लेबाजी की पहले दावत मिलने के बाद पंजाब की शुरुआत खराब रही. उसके शीर्ष क्रम के बल्लेबाज प्रभसिमरन (2), शिखर धवन (17), अथर्व ताइडे (19) और लिविंगस्टोन (9) जल्द ही आउट हो गए. पंजाब के चार विकेट 50 रन पर ही गिर गए थे. लेकिन यहां से सैम कुरैन (नाबाद 49 रन) और विकेटकीपर जितेश शर्मा (44) ने उम्दा बल्लेबाजी की, तो शाहरुख खान (नाबाद 41) ने भी जरूरत के मौके पर उम्दा बल्लेबाजी की. इससे पंजाब किंग्स कोटे के 20 ओवरों में 5 विकेट पर 187 का आंकड़ा छूने में सफल रहे. नवदीप सैनी ने सबसे ज्यादा 3 विकेट लिए. राजस्थान ने टॉस जीतकर पहले बॉलिंग करने का फैसला किया. मैच में खेलीं दोनों टीमों की फाइनल XI इस प्रकार रहीं: 1. संजू सैमसन (कप्तान) 2. यशस्वी जयसवाल 3. जोस बटर 4. देवदत्त पडिक्कल 5. सिमरोन हेटमायर 6. ट्रेंट बोल्ट 7. रियान पराग 8. एडम जंपा 9. युजवेंद्र चहल 10. संदीप शर्मा 11. नवदीप सैनी 1. शिखर धवन (कप्तान) 2. प्रभसिमरन सिंह 3. अथर्व ताइडे 4. लियम लिविंगस्टोन 5. जितेश शर्मा 6. शाहरुख खान 7. सैम कुरैन 8. हरप्रीत बरार 9. राहुल चाहर 10. कैगिसो रबाडा 11. अर्शदीप सिंह पढ़ें ,राजनीति,खेल समाचार, और की ताजा समाचार अब हिंदी में ( ) लाइव खबर देखें: फॉलो करे:","pubDate":"2023-05-19 18:23:38","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-05/k4duu8fo_rajasthan_625x300_19_May_23.jpg","source_id":"ndtv_in","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"अगले 5 साल तक और गरजेगा माही का बल्ला, बैटिंग कोच ने बताया धोनी कब लेंगे संन्यास","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/iplt20/news/ms-dhoni-knee-not-fit-but-wants-to-come-down-to-bat-and-finish-macth-says-mike-hussey/articleshow/100363395.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"MS Dhoni: इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग में सबसे सफल टीम के कप्तान महेंद्र सिंह धोनी अब अपने करियर के अंतिम पड़ाव पर हैं। आईपीएल 2023 सीएसके के आखिरी होम मैच के बाद यह कहा जा रहा है कि वह इस लीग से अब संन्यास ले लेंगे लेकिन टीम के बैटिंग कोच का कहना है कि वह अगले पांच साल तक और खेल सकते हैं।","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-19 17:16:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"जोस बटलर की शर्मनाक हैट्रिक!

With this year’s extravaganza just a few months away, former all-rounder Abdul Razzaq came up with a suggestion regarding the all-rounder spot for Pakistan. While speaking to a local TV channel, Abdul Razzaq was asked to pick between Faheem Ashraf and Mohammad Wasim Jr as to who should be selected to represent the country in this year’s world cup. The legendary all-rounder threw his weight behind Faheem Ashraf; citing the latter’s experience. “If we judge experience-wise, then Faheem Ashraf should go for World Cup,” said Razzaq. Meanwhile, Abdul Razzaq also questioned Wasim Jr’s selection and development in the national team as the former all-rounder believes that the latter was promoted to the international circuit without sufficient exposure in the domestic structure. “If we talk about Mohammad Wasim Jr, we brought him from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. I think he was selected for the Pakistan team too early,” Abdul Razzaq said. “Wasim Jr should have played more domestic cricket and bowled longer spells over there before getting selected. Now, he plays few matches for Pakistan and then sits out in the rest of the matches. You can never groom a player like that,” he added. However, Pakistan’s participation in the upcoming World Cup has been in jeopardy after the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) refused to travel to Pakistan for Asia Cup on political grounds and has since been pushing to shift the tournament to a neutral venue. The BCCI maintained its stance of not touring Pakistan for the Asia Cup , while the PCB was adamant that if they do not, then Pakistan might not travel to India for the World Cup in October-November. As per the latest development, however, the BCCI has reportedly accepted PCB’s hybrid model which meant that Pakistan will host the first four matches of the tournament while India’s group stage matches and Super 4s matches will be contested on a neutral venue.

With this year’s extravaganza just a few months away, former all-rounder Abdul Razzaq came up with a suggestion regarding the all-rounder spot for Pakistan. While speaking to a local TV channel, Abdul Razzaq was asked to pick between Faheem Ashraf and Mohammad Wasim Jr as to who should be selected to represent the country in this year’s world cup. The legendary all-rounder threw his weight behind Faheem Ashraf; citing the latter’s experience. “If we judge experience-wise, then Faheem Ashraf should go for World Cup,” said Razzaq. Meanwhile, Abdul Razzaq also questioned Wasim Jr’s selection and development in the national team as the former all-rounder believes that the latter was promoted to the international circuit without sufficient exposure in the domestic structure. “If we talk about Mohammad Wasim Jr, we brought him from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. I think he was selected for the Pakistan team too early,” Abdul Razzaq said. “Wasim Jr should have played more domestic cricket and bowled longer spells over there before getting selected. Now, he plays few matches for Pakistan and then sits out in the rest of the matches. You can never groom a player like that,” he added. However, Pakistan’s participation in the upcoming World Cup has been in jeopardy after the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) refused to travel to Pakistan for Asia Cup on political grounds and has since been pushing to shift the tournament to a neutral venue. The BCCI maintained its stance of not touring Pakistan for the Asia Cup , while the PCB was adamant that if they do not, then Pakistan might not travel to India for the World Cup in October-November. As per the latest development, however, the BCCI has reportedly accepted PCB’s hybrid model which meant that Pakistan will host the first four matches of the tournament while India’s group stage matches and Super 4s matches will be contested on a neutral venue.

The 62nd Annual General Meeting of SLC takes place at the Hilton Colombo Residences, Union Place, Colombo 2 at 10 a.m. today with the incumbent office-bearers due to be elected uncontested for another two-year term. Reflecting on the past two years former SLC President and current Secretary Mohan de Silva said: “We are quite happy the way things have worked out despite many challenges. Since last September we have been going through a lot of unwanted harassment. Soon after the T20 World Cup and incidents that took place in Australia we were confronted with various challenges, unnecessary interference, ridiculing and vilifying SLC. Even the captain was subject to harassment, but we were always confident that we had not done anything wrong.” “There were individuals who were unable to come through the democratic process pushing the Sports Minister to dissolve SLC and appoint an interim committee. We had no option but to officially complain to the ICC in writing. The ICC appointed a three-member committee to look into our grievances. We are happy that the ICC representatives were able to come when we complained about unwarranted interferences. They gave us a hearing and sent the Vice Chairman Imran Khawaja and another responsible employee on a fact finding mission. We can fearlessly say that we are prepared to face any consequences for any misappropriation of funds or irregularities that can be proved. We must first see what they are and given an opportunity to answer them, they can take the process from there onwards, even for legal action. But these false accusations and trying to ruin our reputation will not do any good for the game, the Institution or the country as there will be long term ramifications where the cricket loving public will look at us with crooked eyes. It is very bad for the reputation of the institution and also for our sponsors.” “We are happy that there is some sanity prevailing and the Sports Minister has a better understanding of the situation now. We have been working with Sports Ministers in the past and SLC has never undergone this sort of harassment before, not to this extent. This is despite assisting the Sports Ministry by giving them large sums of money. But I am happy to state that going into another term in office we are confident the way things have worked out so far despite the obstacles that have been put in our path to progress. We are looking forward to working independently with the Sports Minister. We should have the right to make decisions independently. We take them in the interest of the game and the country.” Creating a pathway for young cricketers De Silva had a word of praise for the incumbent President Shammi Silva whom he said provided good leadership and maintained excellent rapport with the Asian counterparts particularly, India. “You’ve got to go with India; they actually generate 85 percent of the revenue of the ICC. All of us benefit because of that. We gained a lot through the dollar appreciation. It was one of the contributing factors for SLC recording a record surplus of Rs. 6.3 billion. We are very happy with what we have achieved. We have a long term strategic plan and we have created a pathway for our young cricketers to elevate to the national level and have engaged Tim McCaskill who was the former High Performance Manager, Cricket Victoria, to head our High Performance Centre. He is the one preparing the pyramid and the pathway in consultation with the administration from school to reach national level. We have also given a lot of opportunities during the last two years to develop the skills of Emerging and ‘A’ team players to advance to national status.” Lack of professionalism “The national team has not been consistent due to various reasons. We have been concentrating on building up a young team in the last three years. We have succeeded to some extent but we are not happy with their performance up to now as they have not been able to play to their true potential. The fact remains that we won the Asia Cup beating some of the strongest teams both India and Pakistan, but unfortunately since then we failed to get into the next round in the T20 World Cup. We’ve had several discussions of how we can further enhance the performance of the national team. Enhancing the national team players’ mental strength and introducing more professionalism and also guiding them in their careers. They have the skills but the real professionalism and the overall refinement to compete at the highest level with the rest of the world is lacking. In 50-over cricket we have not fared well and not played to our true potential. It’s not that we don’t have the players but we lack the temperament, professionalism and the intelligence to understand game situations and to adapt to such situations. We are taking new steps like strengthening the academy at Khettarama and getting responsible people to make them accountable if the players don’t perform and the team fails. We have also been getting better coaching staff from time to time. Mahela (Jayawardene) has contributed a lot not only to the national team but from under-19 level upwards. With his experience and vast knowledge of the game, he has been an asset to us contributing a lot and we appreciate his contribution.” Reducing the number of votes De Silva stated that SLC is conscious of the necessity to introduce reforms to its constitution to reduce the number of votes which at present stands at a staggering 145. “There is a lot of accusation on SLC for having such a large number of votes but unfortunately our constitution has provided the membership to attain that status over a period of time. There are so many controlling clubs who do not play cricket at a higher level, but enjoy two votes. We are also not happy with these disparities. That is why we are also trying to introduce reforms in a democratic and acceptable manner without trying to hijack the rights and privileges of the membership. Since the year 2000 I can very responsibly say that we have never given new membership to anyone. Even where the SLC constitution provides for clubs winning championships could elevate to a higher level and enjoy a higher status with an additional vote etc., we have refrained from these status changes for quite some time now. We have also appointed a 10-member committee and have requested them to come up with a viable and acceptable proposal.

We went back to the drawing board and put in some hard work, and right now, it is all about executing,\" Walker said.","pubDate":"2023-05-19 18:50:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicastar","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PBKS vs RR: राजस्थान रॉयल्स ने पंजाब किंग्स को 4 विकेट से हराया","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/hindi/cricket/pbks-vs-rr-live-score-ipl-2023-today-66th-match-punjab-kings-vs-rajasthan-royals-live-score-updates-4049015#publisher=newsstand","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PBKS vs RR, IPL 2023: रियान पराग (20) ने भी कोशिश की, लेकिन खाली जाती गेंदों के बीच दबाव इतना बढ़ा कि बेहतर रन-रेट की आस खत्म हो गयी. इसके लिए राजस्थान को जीत का लक्ष्य 18.3 ओवरों में हासिल करना था, लेकिन उसने इसे सात गेंद देरी से 19.4 ओवरों में हासिल किया.","content":"PBKS vs RR: अपने हालात बेहतर से बदतर करने के लिए खुद राजस्थान जिम्मेदार है जारी आईपीएल के तहत शुक्रवार को धर्मशाला में खेले गए दिन के इकलौते मुकाबले में राजस्थान रॉयल्स ने पंजाब किंग्स को 4 विकेट से हरा दिया, लेकिन जीत के बाजूद राजस्थानी नेट रन-रेट के मामले में आरसीबी से पिछड़ गए हैं. राजस्थान के सामने जीत से बड़ा चैलेंज आरसीबी से बेहतर नेट रन करना था, लेकिन उसे शुरुआत में ही झटका लगा, जब आतिशी जोस बटलर (00) खाता भी नहीं खोल सके, लेकिन युवा यशस्वी जयसवाल (50) और देवदत्त पडिक्कल (51) ने दूसरे विकेट के लिए 84 रन जोड़कर राजस्थान के लिए आरसीबी से बेहतर नेट रन-रेट की उम्मीदें जगाए रखीं. संजू सैमसन (2) इस मौके पर टीम का जल्द ही साथ छोड़ गए, लेकिन जब जयसवाल आउट हुए, तो यहां से राजस्थान की मु्श्किलें बढ़नी शुरू हो गयीं. एक छोर पर शिमरोन हेटायर (46) ने कुछ प्रहार लगाते हुए उम्मीद जगायी, तो रियान पराग (20) ने भी कोशिश की, लेकिन खाली जाती गेंदों के बीच दबाव इतना बढ़ा कि बेहतर रन-रेट की आस खत्म हो गयी. इसके लिए राजस्थान को जीत का लक्ष्य 18.3 ओवरों में हासिल करना था, लेकिन उसने इसे सात गेंद देरी से 19.4 ओवरों में हासिल किया. पहली पाली में पंजाब किंग्स ने बहुत ही अहम मुकाबले में राजस्थान के सामने जीत के लिए 188 रनों का लक्ष्य रखा. बल्लेबाजी की पहले दावत मिलने के बाद पंजाब की शुरुआत खराब रही. उसके शीर्ष क्रम के बल्लेबाज प्रभसिमरन (2), शिखर धवन (17), अथर्व ताइडे (19) और लिविंगस्टोन (9) जल्द ही आउट हो गए. पंजाब के चार विकेट 50 रन पर ही गिर गए थे. लेकिन यहां से सैम कुरैन (नाबाद 49 रन) और विकेटकीपर जितेश शर्मा (44) ने उम्दा बल्लेबाजी की, तो शाहरुख खान (नाबाद 41) ने भी जरूरत के मौके पर उम्दा बल्लेबाजी की. इससे पंजाब किंग्स कोटे के 20 ओवरों में 5 विकेट पर 187 का आंकड़ा छूने में सफल रहे. नवदीप सैनी ने सबसे ज्यादा 3 विकेट लिए. राजस्थान ने टॉस जीतकर पहले बॉलिंग करने का फैसला किया. मैच में खेलीं दोनों टीमों की फाइनल XI इस प्रकार रहीं: 1. संजू सैमसन (कप्तान) 2. यशस्वी जयसवाल 3. जोस बटर 4. देवदत्त पडिक्कल 5. सिमरोन हेटमायर 6. ट्रेंट बोल्ट 7. रियान पराग 8. एडम जंपा 9. युजवेंद्र चहल 10. संदीप शर्मा 11. नवदीप सैनी 1. शिखर धवन (कप्तान) 2. प्रभसिमरन सिंह 3. अथर्व ताइडे 4. लियम लिविंगस्टोन 5. जितेश शर्मा 6. शाहरुख खान 7. सैम कुरैन 8. हरप्रीत बरार 9. राहुल चाहर 10. कैगिसो रबाडा 11. अर्शदीप सिंह पढ़ें ,राजनीति,खेल समाचार, और की ताजा समाचार अब हिंदी में ( ) लाइव खबर देखें: फॉलो करे:","pubDate":"2023-05-19 18:23:38","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-05/k4duu8fo_rajasthan_625x300_19_May_23.jpg","source_id":"ndtv_in","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"अगले 5 साल तक और गरजेगा माही का बल्ला, बैटिंग कोच ने बताया धोनी कब लेंगे संन्यास","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/iplt20/news/ms-dhoni-knee-not-fit-but-wants-to-come-down-to-bat-and-finish-macth-says-mike-hussey/articleshow/100363395.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"MS Dhoni: इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग में सबसे सफल टीम के कप्तान महेंद्र सिंह धोनी अब अपने करियर के अंतिम पड़ाव पर हैं। आईपीएल 2023 सीएसके के आखिरी होम मैच के बाद यह कहा जा रहा है कि वह इस लीग से अब संन्यास ले लेंगे लेकिन टीम के बैटिंग कोच का कहना है कि वह अगले पांच साल तक और खेल सकते हैं।","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-19 17:16:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"जोस बटलर की शर्मनाक हैट्रिक!

With this year’s extravaganza just a few months away, former all-rounder Abdul Razzaq came up with a suggestion regarding the all-rounder spot for Pakistan. While speaking to a local TV channel, Abdul Razzaq was asked to pick between Faheem Ashraf and Mohammad Wasim Jr as to who should be selected to represent the country in this year’s world cup. The legendary all-rounder threw his weight behind Faheem Ashraf; citing the latter’s experience. “If we judge experience-wise, then Faheem Ashraf should go for World Cup,” said Razzaq. Meanwhile, Abdul Razzaq also questioned Wasim Jr’s selection and development in the national team as the former all-rounder believes that the latter was promoted to the international circuit without sufficient exposure in the domestic structure. “If we talk about Mohammad Wasim Jr, we brought him from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. I think he was selected for the Pakistan team too early,” Abdul Razzaq said. “Wasim Jr should have played more domestic cricket and bowled longer spells over there before getting selected. Now, he plays few matches for Pakistan and then sits out in the rest of the matches. You can never groom a player like that,” he added. However, Pakistan’s participation in the upcoming World Cup has been in jeopardy after the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) refused to travel to Pakistan for Asia Cup on political grounds and has since been pushing to shift the tournament to a neutral venue. The BCCI maintained its stance of not touring Pakistan for the Asia Cup , while the PCB was adamant that if they do not, then Pakistan might not travel to India for the World Cup in October-November. As per the latest development, however, the BCCI has reportedly accepted PCB’s hybrid model which meant that Pakistan will host the first four matches of the tournament while India’s group stage matches and Super 4s matches will be contested on a neutral venue.
