Hobart's Bellerive Oval, which was scheduled to host a test against Afghanistan in November before it was postponed in the wake of the Taliban takeover of the country, will host its first Ashes clash from Jan. 14-18. Melbourne, which will stage the third test in the series, and Sydney, which will be the venue for the fourth, had both offered to replace Perth - options that would have provided much greater revenue for Cricket Australia (CA). \"I would like to thank all the States and Territories who took part in this process,\" CA boss Nick Hockley said in a statement. \"The submissions we received were outstanding and we had no doubt that each of the venues that took part would have hosted a wonderful event. \"We also acknowledge the postponement of the Australia and Afghanistan Test due to take place in Hobart earlier in the year played a part in the decision.‚Äù The picturesque Bellerive ground holds 19,500 but has attracted far fewer fans than that for previous test matches with one journalist famously counting the crowd one-by-one during the series against Sri Lanka in 2012. Hobart last hosted a test when South Africa toured in 2016-17. Western Australia's requirement for travellers from New South Wales to quarantine for 14 days made it impossible for the teams to complete the fourth test in Sydney on Jan. 9 and be free to start the fifth match on Jan. 14. The state has largely managed to keep COVID-19 out for the duration of the pandemic by cutting itself off from the rest of Australia and the world. Given that success, the government was not prepared to compromise on its protocols even to ensure that the Ashes test went ahead. That means the 60,000-seater Perth Stadium, built at a cost of AUS$1.6 billion (US$1.14 billion) and completed in 2018, will miss out on test cricket for the second year in a row. The stadium, which replaced the WACA ground as Western Australia's test venue, hosted tests against India in 2018 and New Zealand in 2019.","image_url":null,"source_id":"channelnewsasia"},{"title":"Hobart to host fifth men's Ashes Test","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/hobart-to-host-fifth-mens-ashes-test-c-4906485","keywords":null,"creator":["Rob Forsaith"],"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket Australia has confirmed the fifth men's Ashes Test will be a pink-ball match in Hobart.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-10 23:09:56","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-4906485/b5086157df27bf193c01f7e519d0047736bdee33-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest"},{"title":"Hobart to host fifth men's Ashes Test","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/hobart-to-host-fifth-mens-ashes-test-c-4906482","keywords":null,"creator":["Rob Forsaith"],"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket Australia has confirmed the fifth men's Ashes Test will be a pink-ball match in Hobart.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-10 23:09:45","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-4906482/b5086157df27bf193c01f7e519d0047736bdee33-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow"},{"title":"Hobart awarded fifth Ashes Test ahead of MCG, SCG","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/hobart-awarded-fifth-ashes-test-ahead-of-mcg-scg-20211211-p59gqo.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket Australia has confirmed that the fifth Ashes Test, removed from Perth due to COVID-19 border issues and difficulties, will officially be played in Hobart.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-10 23:00:33","full_description":"Cricket Australia has confirmed that the fifth Ashes Test, removed from Perth due to COVID-19 border issues and difficulties, will officially be played in Hobart.

The BBC called England's first innings performance \"woeful\" while the referred to it as \"England's horror show\". The settled for \"batting nightmare\". A good start for England was essential to give them confidence, but just the opposite happened with opening bat Rory Burns clean bowled by Mitchell Starc in the very first ball of the series. Hardly an auspicious omen. It wasn't long before the score was 11-3 with England captain Joe Root already back in the pavilion, out for a duck. That is not how Test matches are won, let alone Ashes matches. Eventually, England made it to 147 which might be a good score in snooker but is disaster in Test cricket. They only reached that figure thanks to some gritty performances from Jos Butler, Ollie Pope and Haseeb Hameed. Australia incidentally overhauled that score with just one wicket down thanks to a fine partnership between David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne. To be fair, the Aussie bowlers were top class led by their new captain Pat Cummins who took five wickets. When it came to England's turn in the field, there was already a psychological blow the visitors had to cope with. It was the first time in 15 years that England have gone into an Ashes Test without either Jimmy Anderson or Stuart Broad in the bowling attack. The English selectors must have quickly regretted that decision. Although the seam attack of Ollie Robinson, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood bowled quite tidily, spinner Jack Leach conceded a massive 95 runs from 11 overs, taking just one wicket. Making the most of Leach's friendly offerings were Warner and then Travis Head with a magnificent quick-fire century, eventually finishing on 152. An injury to Ben Stokes did not help the England bowling cause. Robinson briefly gave England some hope taking two wickets in consecutive balls but that was the extent of their joy as Head continued on his merry way. There are admittedly extenuating circumstances that led to England's poor battling display. All their warm-up games were washed out and they came into the first Test without any of the normal preparations, and it looked like it. As BBC commentator and former England player Jonathan Agnew wrote \"England's batsmen were like rabbits caught in headlights.\" While England have performed well at home in the Ashes, when they embark on their tours of Australia there has always been a sense of trepidation, and not without reason. Finishing \"On Top Down Under\" has only happened twice in the past 39 years. Owing to Covid restrictions, there was only a smattering of England fans at the Gabba but those who were there would not have been happy that the Barmy Army trumpet was already launching into the Great Escape after just one over of the series. Over the years the Gabba has not been a happy hunting ground for England. Six of their last eight visits to Brisbane have ended in defeat and the last time they won there was in the days of Mike Gatting back in the 1986/87 series. No wonder it is nicknamed the \"Gabbatoir.\" England's last success in Australia came in the 2010/11 series spearheaded by a superb batting display from England skipper Alastair Cook which saw him finish the series with an amazing average of 127. Over to you Captain Root.","image_url":null,"source_id":"bangkokpost"},{"title":"NSD vs SPT Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for Bengal Inter District T20 2021, Semi Final 1","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/nsd-vs-spt-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-bengal-inter-district-t20-2021-semi-final-1?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Anjishnu Roy"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-10 19:15:44","full_description":"The Nadia Super Dazzlers will take on the South 24-PGS Tigers in the first Semi-Final of the Bengal Inter District T20 2021 on Saturday, December 11.

While the New Zealand camp pulled out in the eleventh hour of the start of the first ODI in September citing a possible security threat, England followed suit by postponing the series (both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs) due to concerns over ‚Äúmental and physical wellbeing‚Äù of its players. While New Zealand had quit their first tour to the country in 18 years, it would have been the first tour of Pakistan by an England women‚Äôs team in its history and the first by their male counterparts since 2005. Coming back to the upcoming series, team Pakistan are high on confidence ever since their successful T20 World Cup campaign, followed by a clean sweep against Bangladesh in the recently concluded T2oI and Test series.

Former skipper Jason Holder is being rested, while Fabian Allen and Obed McCoy are out because of injuries. Last week captain Kieron Pollard also withdrew through a hamstring injury, leaving the Twenty20 leadership to Nicholas Pooran and ODIs to Shai Hope. Pakistan thus, under the leadership of Babar Azam would certainly start as favourites.

Former Indian team coach Ravi Shastri, whose tenure ended after the 2021 T20 World Cup has finally come up with his candid views regarding his days as the head coach of the team. Shastri was appointed head coach in 2017 after India‚Äôs loss in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy against Pakistan and stayed in the position till his term came to an end in November 2021. The 59-year-old had an illustrious career, bidding adieu with a number of unprecedented success, especially on foreign soil, something that he has been vocal about since he relinquished his post. He, however does not have an ICC Trophy to boast of. Team India played the 2019 World Cup in England, the 2019 ICC Test Championship, and the 2021 T20 World Cup under his coaching stint. Speaking about India‚Äôs 2019 World Cup campaign, where they lost to New Zealand in the semis, Shastri has expressed his displeasure regarding the team selection before and during the World Cup. Ravi Shastri reckons Shreyas Iyer or Ambati Rayudu should‚Äôve made it to the squad The former team India batter, turned back the clock, during an interview with the Times of India, and jogged down the memory lane to reminisce how he was dissatisfied with the selection committee opting for three wicketkeeper batters in the side. He was of the view back then, that either one of Ambati Rayadu or Shreyas Iyer should have been picked, although he had no say in the matter and as a coach was expected to bring out the best amongst the selected lot. ‚ÄúI had no say in that (team selection). But I wasn‚Äôt okay with three wicketkeepers being picked for the World Cup. Either Ambati or Shreyas could‚Äôve come in. ‚ÄúWhat was the logic in having MS Dhoni, Rishabh [Pant] and Dinesh [Karthik] all together?‚Äù, remarked Shastri. The former head coach further said, ‚ÄúBut I never interfered with the selectors‚Äô work, except when I was asked for feedback or as part of a general discussion.‚Äù Ravi Shastri tells TOI he had no say in non-selection of Ambati Rayudu for 2019 World Cup. But what he can‚Äôt understand is, how could selectors pick 3 wicket-keepers? ‚ÄúThey might as well have included Ambati or Shreyas.‚Äù Was one of the biggest WC selection blunders, no doubt. ‚Äî KSR (@KShriniwasRao) December 10, 2021 It is worth mentioning that Ambati Rayudu was excluded from Team India‚Äôs squad for the 2019 World Cup despite averaging around 50 at number 4 for India.

After a dominating display of batting by the Aussies on Day 2 of the first Ashes Test at The Gabba in Brisbane, the English batters, taking full advantage of a beautiful batting deck, turned the tables to claw their way back handsomely on Day 3. Earlier in the day, Australia managed to stretch their lead from 196 at the end of Day 2, to 278 after batting for just under two hours to end their first innings at 425/10. Travis Head (152 off 148), was the last batter to be dismissed after putting on a stellar display of batsmanship in the first innings. England in reply, having lost Rory Burns (13 off 27) and Haseeb Hamed (27 off 58) with mere 61 runs on the board were in some spot of bother, but skipper Joe Root (86* off 158) and Southpaw David Malan (80 off 177) rose on to the occasion and continued to bat defiantly till stumps on Day 3 adding together a total of 159* runs to take the English total to 220/2 with just a 58 run deficit before they set a target. Joe Root raises the bat, England‚Äôs first fifty of the #Ashes series pic.twitter.com/yBj8s6gUaB ‚Äî cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) December 10, 2021 To add to the Aussie woes, their opening batter David Warner was not seen on the field the entirety of Day 3 after going through an injury scare. David Warner injury update: Has David Warner been ruled out of The Gabba Test? Warner did not take to the field at all on Friday (Day 3) having suffered severe bruising to his ribs after being struck two nasty blows while batting on day 2 when he made an important 94 in Australia‚Äôs first innings. A short ball from Ben Stokes at an individual score of 26 targeted at the ribs, followed by yet another blow at the similar spot by speedster Mark Wood later in his innings meant Warner had to be sent for scans later in the day. The fact that he did not take the field for the entirety of Day 3, did raise some suspicions, but the good news for him and his fans is that those scans showed no break of ribs. There is no official word on his present condition, apart that the Australian camp expect him bat in their second innings despite the clear discomfort. Cameras spotted him resting in the rooms with what appeared to be an ice pack on his right ribcage. With England batting the way they are at the moment, the 35-year-old might well have to make another contribution with the bat, and it remains to be seen if he is sent to open or not. Former Aussie skipper Ricky Ponting expressed his concern after noticing Warner‚Äôs state on Day 3. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a worry that he‚Äôs not out there at all,‚Äù Ponting told cricket.com.au on Friday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have a better idea when he bats or if he bats at all in the second innings. ‚ÄúI noticed that after he got hit, he came out after one of the breaks and you could see that he had a little (chest) guard over that area. ‚ÄúI got a bit worried about it then because I‚Äôve never seen him with a chest guard on before. ‚ÄúEven if it‚Äôs just bruising, I would think that he‚Äôd be out there fielding so there might be a bit more to it than what we‚Äôre hearing,‚Äù Ponting further remarked. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† The post David Warner injury update: Has David Warner been ruled out of Gabba Test match in Brisbane? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2021-12-10 15:21:38","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Raj Angad and Harnoor, carrying the family legacy forward in style","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/raj-angad-bawa-tarlochan-hockey-cricket-u-19-asia-cup-squad-harnoor-singh/article37926857.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Shayan Acharya"],"video_url":null,"description":"Raj Angad is the grandson of hockey legend Tarlochan Bawa, while Harnoor's grandfather Rajinder Singh and father Birinder Singh were involved with cricket in Punjab.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-10 14:24:37","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar"},{"title":"England‚Äôs Dawid Malan provides the run support that Joe Root has missed all year | Andy Bull","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/10/cricket-england-dawid-malan-provides-the-support-joe-root-has-missed-all-year","keywords":["England cricket team","Australia cricket team","Australia sport","The Ashes","Ashes 2021-22","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Andy Bull"],"video_url":null,"description":"While Root has had a brilliant 2021 at the crease, his teammates have let him down but Malan has come good at the right timeAnd on the third day, some hope.

This time around, no one has. In fact, while everyone‚Äôs been watching Root close in on one record, his teammates have been threatening another. This year the next-best batsman is Rory Burns, who has scored 492 runs. The last time England‚Äôs second-leading run scorer made so few was back in 1999, when England lost to New Zealand at home, and slipped to the bottom of the world rankings. In the long history of English cricket, it‚Äôs never happened that their leading batsman has scored more than 1,000 runs while the next best of his teammates has scored fewer than 500. The closest comparison is 1963, when Ken Barrington made 1,015, and Ted Dexter 583. All of which is another way of saying that the man who may be England‚Äôs greatest-ever batsman is playing in what is likely England‚Äôs weakest-ever batting line-up. They have put on 32 fifty-run partnerships this year, Root has been involved in 20 of them. They‚Äôve put on 10 hundred-run partnerships, and Root has been involved in eight of those. He has scored six centuries, his 24 teammates have managed one. The business of captaincy, selecting teams, switching bowlers, picking out fields, managing people and handling the press is enough of a burden without the back-breaking load of carrying such a deadweight batting unit. The men around him owe him more. Which is why Malan‚Äôs innings mattered. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, he said himself ‚ÄúI did get away with it a bit‚Äù. There was a miscued pull that landed in front of Marcus Harris at square leg, an edge off Josh Hazlewood that flew over the slips, another off Pat Cummins that fell just short of Alex Carey, and an unsuccessful review for a catch behind which, he said later, he didn‚Äôt hit. He was beaten inside and out, played-and-missed almost 20 deliveries. And in among it, he hit some glorious cricket shots, crisp drives, swishy pulls, stylish glances. As the afternoon wore on, it got easier for him, then, as the bowlers changed and he started to cramp, it became harder again. But he persisted. That was what England needed. The irony is when England started planning for this series a year ago, Malan wasn‚Äôt part of their thinking. He‚Äôs only here because Zak Crawley‚Äôs form was so poor the selectors were compelled to look elsewhere. And here he was, a guy who had put together scores of 56, 140, 54, and 62 against these very same bowlers, on these very same grounds, on tour four years previously. England, in the meantime, had apparently decided they were so flush with batting talent they could do without him. The decision to drop him didn‚Äôt make that much sense at the time. ‚ÄúIt may be that his game is better suited to overseas conditions,‚Äù said Ed Smith, who was chair of selectors. Malan, 34, comes across as a little insecure. He has spoken openly about how he was convinced that none of his teammates thought he was good enough to be playing Test cricket even after he scored that century in Perth in December 2017, and you can imagine how Smith‚Äôs words compounded that. Now here he was, making the most of his second chance he had long since given up on getting. After stumps he spoke about a moment midway through the afternoon: ‚ÄúI actually said to Rooty when we were both on 40 or 50, or similar scores, and the Barmy Army were singing, I said to him, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve really missed this, someone trying to blow my head off, and the adrenaline going playing against the best bowlers‚Äô.‚Äù Anyone who can go through that and come out laughing and smiling about it has a dash of what England need right now.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b74d87c7ac4b766fb36f871698e7f3eb28cd40ac/0_47_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0114c4174ca1b48ab364de98dc8893d","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Dilip Vengsarkar addresses Rohit replacing Kohli as ODI captain; whether split captaincy will work in Indian cricket - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9kaWxpcC12ZW5nc2Fya2FyLWFkZHJlc3Nlcy1yb2hpdC1zaGFybWEtcmVwbGFjaW5nLXZpcmF0LWtvaGxpLWFzLW9kaS1jYXB0YWluLXdoZXRoZXItc3BsaXQtY2FwdGFpbmN5LXdpbGwtd29yay1pbi1pbmRpYW4tY3JpY2tldC0xMDE2MzkxNDEwNjc4MzMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Dilip Vengsarkar addresses Rohit replacing Kohli as ODI captain; whether split captaincy will work in Indian cricket¬†¬†Hindustan Times\"It Was Bound To Happen\": Aakash Chopra On Virat Kohli Being Sacked As ODI Captain¬†¬†NDTVSports.comDifferent captains for different formats a wise move.

Bundled out for a meagre 147 in their first innings, England produced a vastly improved batting display in the second to finish day three on 220-2, still 58 runs behind at the Gabba. The visitors were in a precarious spot at 61/2 but captain Root and Malan went on to add 159 runs for the third wicket. \"It's Test cricket, you never expect any Test nation, especially when you're playing England in the Ashes, to come in and roll over and you're going to knock them over,\" Labuschagne, who contributed 74 to Australia's first innings total of 425, told reporters. \"Test cricket is a grind, it's meant to be hard, otherwise it wouldn't mean so much to both countries. So for us, it's just a day at the office and we make sure we come back tomorrow, review our plans how we bowled today, and come up with some ideas and get those last eight weeks.\" Root and Malan will start Saturday with overnight scores of 86 and 80 respectively and will be looking to get England as far as ahead of Australia's first innings total as possible. Australia, on the other hand, are looking at the new ball too skittle England out as quickly as possible and possibly get a low target to chase or even record an unlikely innings win. \"The new ball is crucial. There can be long partnerships and then all of a sudden you can lose bang-bang-bang quick wickets,\" Labuschagne said. \"If we can put that new ball in the right areas and get a couple of wickets with that new ball, it can really turn quickly.\" Labuschagne also said that he was not aware of opener David Warner's status. Warner, who scored 94, was hit by Mark Wood and Ben Stokes on Thursday and while scans showed no break, the 35-year-old has suffered severe bruising. \"Those two blows to the rib, that's why he was not fielding today. I don't really know too much about that apart from that,\" he said.
