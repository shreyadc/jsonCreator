The five-time champions are now anxiously waiting on the fitness of young all-rounder Prashant Veer, who was sidelined after picking up an injury during a Ranji Trophy match.CSK’s Rs 14.20 crore recruit Prashant Veer sustained a serious shoulder injury while fielding for Uttar Pradesh on Day 1 of their Ranji Trophy clash against Jharkhand. The 20-year-old was injured before lunch and was subsequently replaced by Shivam Sharma as a Serious Injury Replacement, in line with the new domestic cricket rules introduced by the BCCI.While the exact severity of the injury is yet to be officially confirmed, a report by ESPNcricinfo suggests that Veer is likely to be ruled out of action for at least three weeks.Also Read: MS Dhoni gears up for IPL 2026 as CSK icon’s training clip in Jharkhand goes viralBig Investment, Bigger ConcernCSK had gone all out to secure Veer at the IPL 2026 mini-auction, making him one of the joint highest-paid uncapped players in IPL auction history, alongside Kartik Sharma. He was signed as a like-for-like replacement for Ravindra Jadeja, who was traded to Rajasthan Royals ahead of the new season, underlining the franchise’s faith in the young all-rounder.A Rapidly Rising StarPrashant Veer has been one of the most exciting prospects in domestic cricket. Playing for Uttar Pradesh and the Noida Super Kings in the UP T20 League, he impressed with impactful performances in both batting and bowling. In the 2025 UP T20 League, he scored 320 runs at a strike rate of around 155, including three half-centuries.His standout showing came in the Men’s U-23 State A Trophy 2025–26, where he scored 376 runs in seven matches at an average of 94 and picked up 18 wickets, earning the Player of the Tournament award.Waiting on RecoveryWith the IPL season approaching, CSK will be hoping Veer recovers in time, as his availability could play a crucial role in shaping their campaign.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["news","cricket","sports"],"creator":["bibhu prasad
