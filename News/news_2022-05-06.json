Cook occupied the crease doggedly for his 107 from 268 balls on Thursday, guiding Essex to 3-234 in their County Championship division one clash at Chelmsford. Another of Cook's captaincy successors, Joe Root, featured for the first time since resigning the England role and was deployed as one of seven bowlers as Yorkshire toiled in the field. Surrey captain Rory Burns, dropped as England's Test opener after a miserable time during the heavy Ashes series defeat in Australia, returned to form after a lean spell with 107 as Surrey reached 6-261 against Northamptonshire at the Oval. A fifth-wicket partnership of 95 with England allrounder Sam Curran, unbeaten on 71 at the close, rescued Surrey from 4-133. Dominic Sibley, another opener discarded by England, made a century for Warwickshire against Lancashire at Old Trafford. His unbeaten 118 from 278 balls was his first ton since being dropped by England last summer and steered the Bears to 7-273. At Cardiff, Australian Test star Marnus Labuschagne took on an unfamiliar role to help Glamorgan turn things around against Leicestershire. Leicestershire were reduced to 8-285 after losing six wickets for 116 runs following the tea break, with Labuschagne, the No.1-ranked batter in men's Test cricket, showing his leg-breaks could be pretty useful too as he returned figures of 3-65 from 17 overs. Sydney-born Felix Organ celebrated his return to the top of the order with his second county championship century as Hampshire enjoyed the better of day one against Gloucestershire at Southampton, finishing on 8-310. Organ scored a simple, chanceless 107, while putting on 161 with James Vince, who scored an uncomplicated 78. Organ, who's been forging a career as a spinner, had previously opened in nine first-class matches in the 2019 and 2020 seasons but managed a meagre average of 23. Organ, who moved to the UK from Australia when young, appeared unfussed and immovable in his impressive knock. In division two, Durham included Stokes in their eleven at New Road and then reached stumps against Worcestershire on 3-339, with the new England captain due to bat at No.6. Watching on from the visitors' dressing room balcony, Stokes watched South African opener Sean Dickson continue his prolific form with a third championship century of the season.","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-6697262/7f368433be6294a24d47a4703ac525b627f51ea8-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket Australia risks new states fight with cash cut request","link":"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-australia-risks-new-states-fight-with-cash-cut-request-20220505-p5aiup.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Daniel Brettig and Malcolm Conn"],"video_url":null,"description":"Cash-conscious Cricket Australia has asked its state association owners for a multimillion dollar cut for the third year in a row.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-05 19:00:00","full_description":"Cash-conscious Cricket Australia has asked its state association owners for a multimillion dollar cut to their distributions for the third year in a row, after the governing body concluded it needed to drastically increase reserves following COVID-19. Sources with knowledge of the plans told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the request by CA’s chief executive Nick Hockley and chair Lachlan Henderson has state association chiefs eagerly awaiting further explanation for their reasoning at a meeting in Melbourne next week, where the game’s finances and strategy are to be discussed. Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley. Credit: Getty Images Hockley and Henderson are acutely aware that financial battles with the states and the Australian Cricketers Association were at the heart of acrimony that saw CA’s previous chief executive, Kevin Roberts, moved on in 2020, and previous chair, Earl Eddings, forced to resign last year. After securing a 12.5% cut to distributions in 2020, and another 7% cut the following year, CA’s leaders are now seeking a 10% reduction to assist in belt-tightening. Each reduction has been to standard distributions and they are not cumulative. CA distributed more than $120 million to the states in 2020-21 according to its annual report. The move was brought on partly by a 2021 Boston Consulting Group report that suggested CA faced a $90 million revenue hole over the closing years of its current broadcast rights cycle without significant cutbacks. CA’s strategic plan for the next five years is being built largely around returning the game to strong financial health after COVID. CA still has access to a $50 million credit facility with the Commonwealth Bank procured in 2020, but the governing body does not wish to delve into it unless another emergency were to crop up before reserves can be replenished. At the same time, CA’s broader goal is a greatly increased pot of reserves, certainly up from the $70 million level at which the governing body rested before COVID-19, to be prepared for unforeseen events like a global pandemic. Other major not for profit sporting bodies, such as the United Kingdom’s Lawn Tennis Association which oversees the Championships at Wimbledon, have enough cash in reserve to be able to withstand the cancellation of an entire tournament. Hockley, who used his expertise in staging major events to help guide CA through the past two COVID-affected seasons, generated some anxiety when explaining cricket’s finances at an all-staff forum to end the season. The organisation had to return to core cricket activity and prepare for a tough couple of years in trying to save money ahead of the next set of broadcast deals to follow the $1.2 billion agreement with Foxtel and Seven in 2018. Essentially, that core cricket activity boils down to three things: a sharp focus on driving up junior participation across the country after COVID-19 cut into playing rates, rebuilding attendances at grounds - something broadcasters deem essential to raising TV and streaming numbers - and maintaining the upward performance trajectory of the national teams. While no-one in the Australian cricket system would deny the importance of these three pillars, a fresh call for the states to give up money they also reinvest into the game at local levels is likely to stir up familiar agitation. State chairs have discussed possible changes to the game’s governance model - namely to allow associations to have direct representation on the CA board after a decade of independent directors - while also questioning how cricket’s finances are arrayed. In 2011-12, the game’s financial model was dramatically redrawn, whereby CA took responsibility for any risk of downside in match and broadcast revenue while guaranteeing minimum distributions to states. If that appeared to safeguard the states against fluctuations, they looked on as the revenue-sharing percentage model preferred by the ACA and the players spun off rich upside via successive record broadcast deals in 2013 and 2018. The players can again expect to be richly rewarded with lump sum cash from the “adjustment ledger”, which disburses cash accrued above CA’s conservative revenue projections, when the MoU is renewed in 2023. A one-year extension was added to the 2017 deal to help Hockley’s executive and board recover from the COVID shock. News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

Essex chairman John Faragher resigned from his role in November 2021 after the allegation that he used racist language, although he strongly denied the incident. The England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which announced the decision on Thursday, said Essex had also been cautioned about further conduct and issued with a reprimand. It added that 15,000 pounds of the fine was suspended for two years. \"The charge was in two parts -- relating to the comment made at the meeting, and the subsequent failure by Essex CCC to conduct an appropriate, or any, subsequent investigation,\" a statement by the ECB said. Faragher's decision to quit Essex came a day after fellow county side Yorkshire's former chief executive Mark Arthur resigned in the fallout from the allegations of institutional racism made by their former player Azeem Rafiq.

A lifelong cricket fan, Fry was only the second non-cricketing personality after the late archbishop Desmond Tutu to give the prestigious Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture in which he denounced the \"shameful scandals that regularly seem to engulf the game we love\". Speaking in November last year, his address followed Azeem Rafiq's allegations that he had been a victim of institutional racism at Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Yorkshire were banned form hosting international cricket at Headingley but England's cricket board lifted the ban in February after the club approved structural changes to the board. Fry will replace former England captain Clare Connor, who nominated the 64-year-old comedian and author to the role that is a 12-month term. An MCC member since 2011, Fry said he was \"honoured and proud\" at the nomination. \"It is a club that is known throughout the world for what it represents in the game and to be gifted the opportunity to perform this role is truly humbling,\" he said in a statement. \"I thank Clare for this incredible opportunity and I look forward to supporting her as president designate over the summer before commencing my own innings in the autumn.\" (Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru; editing by Barbara Lewis)","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/05/05/1575009.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my","country":["malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Delhi Capitals vs Sunrisers Hyderabad: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/delhi-capitals-vs-sunrisers-hyderabad-live-score-over-match-50-t20-1-5-updates-2949098","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Delhi Capitals vs Sunrisers Hyderabad from Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai.

Had he got some bat on that one, would have been a boundary! Down the leg side, Warner looks to flick but misses. Pooran stops it well. 4.3 overs (1 Run) That was a big chance of a run out! A yes-no situation but no harm done in the end! Length and on off, Pant pushes it towards cover, he takes off initially but then sees the cover fielder run to his left and dive, sends Warner back who is halfway down the wicket. The cover fielder though does not collect it and Williamson at mid off picks it up and has a shy but misses. No backing up so the single is eventually taken. Rishabh Pant, the skipper of Delhi, walks out to bat at number 4. 4.2 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! That is an outstanding delivery. The ball though seemed like it held in the surface! On a length and around middle, this one holds in the surface a touch as it was the slower one. Marsh does not pick it, he looks to go hard after it, however, the ball goes off the splice and it ends up being an easy catch for the bowler who leaps and takes it. Much-needed wicket as these two were really starting to look good. Marsh just has not got going in this tournament so far. 4.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Shot! That is a very difficult shot to play and Marsh has played it with ease! Shorter and on off, Marsh stands tall, gets on top of the bounce and creams it through covers. This one races away to the fence. Change of ends for Sean Abbott! 3.6 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Over the fence! Malik is just not learning here. End of a very big over and just the kind of one Delhi needed. Malik goes short again, Warner is waiting for it, he pulls it hard and over the fine leg fence for a biggie. It was flat buut carries all the way. 3.5 overs (0 Run) Gets it right this time, on a length and around middle, at 154 KPH. Defended. 3.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Timed wonderfully! Not the best of starts for Umran Malik! This is on a length and around off, Warner shows the full face of the bat and times it through covers, this one races away. 3.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Warner will have no problems with the short ones. For someone who comes from a place where the pitches tend to have good bounce and pace, this won't trouble him. This is short and on the body, Warner pulls it through square leg for a boundary. 3.2 overs (1 Run) That has gone off the toe-end! Marsh swung way too early! He was waiting for the short ball and it came, seems to have come a little slow off the surface. Marsh looks to pull but it goes off the toe-end through covers for one. 3.1 overs (1 Run) Shorter and on the body, this is pulled through square leg for one. 3.1 overs (5 Runs) FIVE WIDES! Not the best of starts by Malik! Not seen him bowl with the new ball a lot so this is a new challenge for him! He begins with one down the leg side, swings away further. Pooran should have taken it but it sneaks under his glove and down to the fine leg fence. Umran Malik comes into the attack. 2.6 overs (1 Run) Not a maiden as a single is taken on the last ball! Outside off, this is guided through point for one. 2.5 overs (0 Run) Can this now be two maidens in a row for Kumar? He goes fuller and on middle, this is pushed to mid on. 2.4 overs (0 Run) Another leave! Outside off, Warner watches the ball closely and leaves it alone. 2.3 overs (0 Run) Brilliant stuff! He is moving the ball both the ways and causing a lot of problems! The line though is a little too straight, Warner misses the flick and gets hit on the pads. 2.2 overs (0 Run) BEATEN! That is another beauty! Gets it to shape away from a length and after landing it on off. Warner looks to push at it but is beaten. 2.1 overs (0 Run) Warner was watchful there! This is an away swinger, outside off, Warner lets it go to the keeper. 1.6 overs (0 Run) A dot to end but an expensive start by Abbott! Angled into the pads, Marsh looks to flick but misses to get hit high on the pads. There is an appeal from the bowler but it is a rather optimistic one as it is clearly going down leg. 1.5 overs (1 Run) A little too straight, gets away with it, Warner only manages to work it towards fine leg for one. 1.4 overs (1 Run) Fuller this time and on middle, Marsh pushes it towards mid off for one. 1.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! That is smacked away! Trademark Marsh! This is slightly short, he just picks the length early on such deliveries, hammers it through square leg for a boundary. 1.2 overs (1 Run) Now follows it with a run as he pushes this fuller one towards mid off. 1.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Almost another wicket! That is a really good attempt in the cover region. This is wide outside off, fuller, Warner looks to hit it on the up, it goes uppishly but just wide of the diving cover fielder and into the fence. Off the mark with a boundary are Delhi and Warner. Sean Abbott will bowl from the other end. 0.6 over (0 Run) End of a brilliant first over by Kumar. A wicket maiden! On off, this is defended. Mitchell Marsh walks out to bat at number 3. 0.5 over (0 Run) OUT! EDGED AND TAKEN! There is the early wicket Hyderabad wanted. Mandeep Singh had no clue about which way the ball was moving, he was struggling on the previous deliveries and finally falls. Not a good return back into the team for him. This is now the away swinger, shapes away after landing on off. Singh lunges out to defend but it goes off the outside edge and it is taken by the keeper, Nicholas Pooran safely. 0.4 over (0 Run) Good swing again but this is a little too down the leg side. This one tails back in from middle, hits the pad of Mandeep as he tries to flick. 0.3 over (0 Run) Really good bowling! Got the last two to go away, this time gets it back in from outside off. Singh looks to flick but is late on the shot. Misses to get hit high on the pads. 0.2 over (0 Run) Yet again not the right line, well outside off, shaping away. Left alone. 0.1 over (0 Run) Nice away swing for Kumar to begin with! Length and around off, this shapes away. Easy leave. We are ready for action! The players are out in the middle. David Warner and Mandeep Singh will open the batting for Delhi. Bhuvneshwar Kumar will begin the proceedings with the ball. Here we go... Mitchell Marsh is down for a chat. He says that it was good to get a few off the middle in the last game but getting a win will be important. Mentions that they have a great team but it's just about clicking as a team and they have had close games, also it will be good if one of our top-four go big. Mentions that he has loved batting at number 3 and Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson's support have been helpful. Informs that bowling is coming along well, and if Rishabh is listening to this, he is ready to go! Rishabh Pant, the skipper of Delhi, says that they have no problem with batting first. Informs that they have made four changes in their team. Tells that some changes are forced as Axar got injured and few changes are tactical changes because of the wicket. Mentions that they can learn from their mistakes and keep improving. Kane Williamson, the skipper of Hyderabad, says that he will bowl first, maybe the dew will play a factor and they are looking forward to chase. Mentions that their losses in the previous games have been different, but still a few positives. Informs that they have three changes, three debutants will play tonight, and Marco Jansen, T Natarajan and Sundar are the players who will miss out. Adds that the new players are excited and pumped for today's game. Concludes by saying that they need to keep moving forward and execute their plans. Delhi (Playing XI) - Mandeep Singh (In place of Prithvi Shaw), David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Rishabh Pant (C) (WK), Rovman Powell, Lalit Yadav, Ripal Patel (In place of Axar Patel), Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav, Khaleel Ahmed (In place of Chetan Sakariya), Anrich Nortje (In place of Mustafizur Rahman). Hyderabad (Playing XI) - Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Kane Williamson (C), Rahul Tripathi, Nicholas Pooran (WK), Shashank Singh, Sean Abbott (In place of Marco Jansen), Shreyas Gopal (In place of Washington Sundar), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Kartik Tyagi (In place of T Natarajan), Umran Malik. TOSS - The coin goes up and lands in favour of Hyderabad. They have elected to BOWL first. Kevin Pietersen is down near the pitch. He says that the outfield is like a carpet here, one side is short while the other side is long. Adds that Kuldeep Yadav has had some success here, and he has bowled slower on this wicket. Tells that batters will enjoy on this pitch. Further adds that there are chances of dew which means the captain winning the toss will bowl first. Sean Abbott, Shreyas Gopal and Kartik Tyagi are seen getting their caps in the Hyderabad huddle. So expect at least three changes in the Hyderabad XI. UPDATE - Prithvi Shaw has not made it to the ground due to some illness and he will miss the game tonight. Who will open alongside David Warner? David Warner is up against his former team, the team that he has captained to the title win in 2016. He surely knows a lot about this Hyderabad team and its management and it was quite a bitter end to his stay in the Hyderabad camp last year. Will all those things bring any impact on Warner's performance and the overall result of this game? Warner will surely be eager to go out there in the field and make a statement. Let's see how things pan out. Toss and team sheets coming up. Games are moving along quickly as we welcome you to the coverage of the 50th game of this year's Indian T20 League and it is a clash between two sides in desperate need of a win, Hyderabad and Delhi. The former began brilliantly but now are on a losing run. Delhi on the other hand, have lacked consistency so far in this tournament.

Durham have travelled down from Winterfell, with the new England Test captain among them as they warm-up in front of the rickety old press box. This will be a first County Championship appearance for Ben Stokes since he played two days last summer and then answered England’s SOS call to captain the ODI team against Pakistan. Before that he made solitary outings in 2018 and 2017.

Indian Premier League has provided them with a stage to stand in front of the internationally acclaimed bowlers on the same field. Players like Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devdutt Padikkal and many more have earned fame through their stint in the Indian Premier League. We believe these young batters coming out of IPL have the skill-set to succeed at the highest level in cricket. Here are 5 Indian batters who will dominate in future: 1- Ayush Badoni Ayush Badoni is the find of Tata IPL 2022. The batsman with a small physique can hit the balls a few miles. His ability to soak in pressure and remain calm and cool-headed is second to none. He has done a great job for Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League and fans are expecting him to soon become a pillar of the Indian middle-order in future. 2- Suyash Prabhudessai Ab explosive batter and a gun fielder, Suyash Prabhudessai is one of RCB’s best young picks in the history of the Indian Premier League. The right-handed batter is a fearless middle-order batter who can tonk the ball high. His single-mindedness to play his shots even in adverse situations can become a great tool for the Indian national cricket team in future. 3- Rinku Singh Rinku Singh has finally attained the much-deserved limelight in his career. His batting keeps the scoreboard ticking. Even when it’s not his day he will continue to find the ones and twos so that the pressure doesn’t mound up on the other end. He is also a great fielder like Prabhudessai. 4- Yashasvi Jaiswal Yashasvi Jaiswal represents Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. In 2021 he became one of their most reliable openers with his fierce and sensible batting approach. Currently, he is being sidelined but we are sure he will make a grand comeback in the IPL to create his path for the India cricket team. 5- Tilak Varma The left-hander batter for Mumbai Indians is the top scorer for the uncapped players in IPL 2022. He has both the attacking and defensive abilities that make him a prospect for India in all three formats. Varma will soon play for the national side with the way he is currently going on for the Mumbai Indians.

Shane Warne was arguably one of the greatest players to ever play the game. When Shane Warne passed away in March this year, it was a shocking news for all. Shane Warne ended his test career with 708 test wickets and 293 ODI wickets. He was the first one to breach the mark of 700 test wickets. Apart from his on-field records, Warne has had a lot of controversies throughout his career. He failed the drug test ahead of the 2003 World Cup. Warne even passed on the critical information to a bookmaker about the game. Rajasthan Royals surprised everyone by winning the Indian Premier League 2008. They spent the least in the auction, they were a team of underdog players. However, the captaincy of Shane Warne played a huge part in the tournament. Many of the members of the squad have shared their Shane Warne stories. Mohammad Kaif shares an interesting captaincy decision of Shane Warne Former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif, who was a part of Rajasthan Royals in 2008 also revealed an incident about Shane Warne’s captaincy. He gave an interview to Sportskeeda, where he talked about the incident in Deccan Chargers vs Rajasthan Royals game in 2008. Mohammad Kaif revealed that he was shocked when Shane Warne decided to bowl Yusuf Pathan in front of Adam Gilchrist with the new ball. He asked the captain about the same, but Warne knew what he was doing with Pathan. “When we went to play the Deccan Chargers, he gave the new ball to Yusuf Pathan to bowl against Gilchrist,” Mohammad Kaif revealed. This one’s for you Warnie Rajasthan Royals also pay tribute here to late Australian spinner Shane Warne by wearing a special ‘SW23’ jersey pic.twitter.com/8rSuxh4ftu — Sky Sports Cricket (@SkyCricket) April 30, 2022 “I was shocked that, ‘Boss, how is Yusuf Pathan bowling?’ But he knew Gilchrist very well, he knew Gilchrist liked the fastball but might struggle against off-spin. And Yusuf got him out in that game.” “He was very clever, very shrewd, very attacking, chirpy, talkative – he would not relax even for a single ball.” Mohammad Kaif, who has worked for different franchises in the IPL revealed that Warne was the one who always used to target the wickets, instead of bowling dot balls. “I have worked with IPL teams, and in the bowling meetings, the talk is always about bowling short or wide outside off stump and conceding a single. But he would always ask his bowlers to get the best batter out,” Mohammad Kaif said.

Both Hrithik and Kartikeya, who made his IPL debut at DY Patil Stadium after coming in as a replacement player, played an important role in stemming the run-flow of Rajasthan Royals in middle overs, thereby restricting them to 158. Hrithik returned with figures of 2/47 while Kartikeya bagged 1/19 in his four overs. In reply, Mumbai managed to chase down the total with four balls to spare, registering their first win of IPL 2022. “Hrithik went for runs (when Jos Buttler hit him for four sixes) but the attitude he showed to come back (and take his wicket) was great. KK (Kumar Kartikeya) has been great, it’s a great story. He’s been with our support bowling group for four-five weeks working on his skills,” said Jayawardene in the virtual press conference ahead of their match against table toppers Gujarat Titans on Friday. “When we had the opportunity to bring him (Kartikeya) in, we knew that he had the skills, it was about understanding his temperament out there in the big stage, and he looked like a pro. It’s great to see these kids coming through, and at the same time have that composure out there, against a very good batting line-up. He held his own and bowled brilliantly to execute the game-plan that he had, which he discussed with us,” added Jayawardene. Jayawardene was also pleased with how Mumbai got the little things right against Rajasthan to get their first win on board. “It was good to see that we managed to execute skills and at the same time finish the game off. The bowling was pretty goodÂ… with the bat as well we were able to cross the line.” “We had the same opportunities through this season with the ball and the bat too, to try and finish games off, which we were not able to. So, to get points on the table, cross the line, brings a very positive outlook to the entire group.” With Mumbai now virtually out of contention for playoffs, Jayawardene wants his players to focus on becoming more confident, getting the execution right and win their remaining matches of the tournament. “We just need to win matches, play some good cricket. It’s all about confidence. As players, as a group it’s been tough for us, there’s nothing to hide. We were not satisfied with our execution; we were not satisfied with the way we played.” “But everyone stuck together and worked harder. I can’t complain about the work ethic of the group. We’ve stayed together and believed in our ability. The rest of the season is going to be the same. Stick to our processes that we’ve always worked on, and make sure we win matches and go out and enjoy our cricket.” “Unfortunately, we had to wait for another four days before we could play another game. The focus has been good, we’ve had a couple of good chats. Looking forward to the next game (against Gujarat), which is a tough one. Probably the in-form best team in the competition, and looking forward to that.” Now you can get handpicked stories from Telangana Today on Telegram everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

England’s Jofra Archer is one of the most lethal bowlers around, but the injuries have been his nemesis. Archer last played an international game in March 2021 against India in the T20I series. He missed the IPL 2021 due to an elbow injury, but he made a brief comeback for Sussex in the T20 Blast 2021. Archer has undergone two operations on his elbow, the latest one in December 2021. He missed the T20 World Cup and Ashes 2021 for the English cricket team. Archer, who is currently doing his rehab, gave his name in the IPL 2022 auction despite not being available for this season. Mumbai Indians went all in for Jofra Archer in the auction, and they bought the English pacer for a price of INR 8 crores. This proves the importance of Jofra Archer in the shortest format of the game. Jofra Archer targets T20 Blast 2022 Jofra Archer has written a column in the “Daily Mail”, where he has talked about his return plans. Archer said that he was doubtful about whether he will play the game again or not, but the ECB gave him confidence and assured him that his English contract won’t be taken away. “In a situation like this, when you are forced to have operations, you do think about whether you are going to play cricket again, whether you’re going to play all formats even,” Archer wrote in his Daily Mail column. “But the ECB gave me the assurance and peace of mind that they wanted me around for a long time.” Happy birthday to Jofra Archer, who has done many special things on a cricket field, but perhaps none more so than delivering a ball which travelled all the way for six off the top of off-stump.pic.twitter.com/u8dqtJYJwv — Wisden (@WisdenCricket) April 1, 2022 Jofra Archer has said that he is aiming to make his return in the T20 Blast 2022 for Sussex.

Even Kevin De Bruyne cops it – but Pep Guardiola bears the brunt. Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com in time for the afternoon mailbox…   KDB overrated, City bottled it For many a mail over many a year, I have been making the case that Kevin De Bruyne is an overrated, luxury player who persistently underperforms on the biggest stage. And now you are starting to hear the pundits whisper it ever so gently. Viewpoints that were considered fringe madness are actually coming to pass. You hear them question the prince with “ he doesn’t have those standout moments” and “he doesn’t dominant big games BUT he is still a top player”. You can convince yourself that assists against the fodder in an overwhelmingly superior team are evidence of greatness, or you can look at the reality that this guy just isn’t in the same conversation of your Modric and Kroos types. Manchester City have bottled this season. It’s a massive capitulation. Forget magic of football. This is the cold, hard reality of a bottle job. Jamie, Eire   No City swagger So having just watched another man city collapse in the champions League again something struck me. They had a 1 goal advantage which became a 2 goal advantage but city didn’t have that confidence and swagger that they have in the premier League. In the premier League most teams capitulate to city before the game even begins, and city know it. But in Europe city always look nervy and unsure. Like the new kid in school. And I think that’s part of the problem. In the premier League they’re the biggest fish in a smaller pond taking into account recent success, finances, playing staff. In Europe though, they’re an average fish up against much older, more experienced and more confident sharks. Even with a two goal deficit Madrid still looked like a team who believed they would go through. Even though they’d been awful for 90 mins. If guardiola wants a champs league trophy with city he’s gonna have to give them that confidence and swagger that they have in the premier League, because this is three years in a row when City should have tasted success in Europe and went home early. And every year that city don’t win it cements the idea that maybe guardiola only ever won it because he just happened to be in charge of one of the greatest teams in history, with one of the greatest players in history and they already had one under their belt from rijkaard prior. Was pep just lucky enough to land in that Barca team? Certainly looks that way. Lee Guardiola and Manchester City succumb to their most ludicrous Champions League exit yet   …How in the name of s**t did this game happen. It was literally so ludicrously boring for about 89 minutes. It was like a textbook game where Pep exerted full control over the game and then next thing you know the world collapsed in a black hole of absolute f**king chaos. I don’t watch a whole lot of Spanish football but am struggling to understand why Camavinga doesn’t start for Madrid. He is so fast and sexy I really liked the look of him. I feel like he did the job i’d like Naby Keita to do. He was the best midfielder on the pitch tonight and I felt he looked great in his short cameo against Chelsea too. Let’s be Frank for a second. This Real Madrid team is no joke and I’m definitely going to be nervous about playing them in the final. I don’t think they ever know when they’re dead and I don’t think there’s a scoreline you can achieve against them that would make you feel safe. In addition they’ve already won the league so they have 3 weeks to do nothing but to prepare for the final. Perhaps it’s the gift and the curse but for a manager like Ancelotti I bet he can do a lot with that time. Did anyone else think De Bruyne had another poor showing in another big game? He’s not at the level of Ozil but he does often seem to disappear in big games. Benzema and Vinicius were both well marshalled but City didn’t really show a great deal going forward to kill off the tie. Even the Mahrez goal looked more like awful footwork from Courtois rather than a good goal. The bigger question though is when the chips were down who in that team had the balls to stand up and be counted? Did Man City actually have a shot on target in extra time? I think they totally collapsed under the pressure which is pretty underwhelming for a £1bn football team. Where do Man City go from here? I’m sure another £100m will be spent to try and complete the sportswashing project but questions need to be asked of the transfer policy in general. Why was Grealish the priority when he’s added so little and why is Fernandinho still being relied on in so many key games. Why did City spend the summer trying to bin Bernardo Silva when he’s been their best midfielder all season. It feels a bit like they’re making weird decisions Year after year but the sheer amount of money they have to keep throwing at the problem ensures some level of continued success. Minty, LFC   Sympathy for City Never thought I would be ushering these words but City have been hard done by. Don’t get me wrong, my preferred opponent before the game kicked off was definitely Real Madrid because I am tired of the sight of Guardiola and City but over two games, City were the better team, Madrid just had the better individuals. Ref had me yelling at the TV as well mind you, not even remotely consistent. I don’t know what this Real Madrid team is made of but holy shit they can score from anywhere at any time. 24 days for Klopp to prepare his team for this Real yet i feel like nothing can prepare you for what they will throw at Liverpool. I cannot wait for the Final. a lot of alcohol will be consumed before, during and after. Nik (city to collapse in the league now? probably not…), Munich   No sympathy for Pep I can’t believe what I’m seeing tonight. No part of my brain can comprehend how Pep thought bringing off KDB in a semi final of the champions league in the bernebeu for anything other than a broken limb was a good idea. Utter madness again from Pep on Europe’s biggest stage. David   …I would give my right arm for Guardiola to be the manager of my club (Villa). I think we all would. He would greatly improve any team he manages. This loss though, has to go down as me of the greatest defeats for him and his ego. To have spent £100m on Jack Grealish, a player he didn’t need and ignore the blatant requirement for a striker is damning of arrogance of the highest order. Pundits on TV were praising a style of football where a striker wasn’t necessary. A decent striker and this match would have been settled a week ago. Paul Ps – don’t take anything away from Madrid. That is a legendary comeback of the highest order.   …He’s still never won it without Messi. Just saying Johnno   …Great semi final! You have to give City some credit though, for Pep to get them to another CL semi on a shoestring budget is commendable, the owners need to back the poor man! Paul, Luton   Difference between Klopp and Pep From a Liverpool fan here: I believe this Manchester city collapses time and time again in the champions league because their manager does not empower them to make critical decisions. He doesn’t trust them. That’s evident in their mentality. Jack Grealish is a player who has taken responsibility his whole career to deliever a result and run at the defenses. Not once in extra time when the whole Madrid team is gassed did he challenge carvajal. He doesn’t believe in himself, he doesn’t believe he’s capable of taking responsibility, and it’s because the manager has them all by the balls. Say what you want about Klopp and mentality monsters, but that comes down to players believing in themselves because their manager believes they are capable of solving their own problems. Adarsh   Two legs good, one leg bad Yes UEFA. We definitely need to get rid of 2 legged semi finals. Good call. Mike, LFC, London   …Whoever is proposing to get rid of two legged champions league ties needs to be fired into the sun. Dan, Plastic LFC Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters   Celebrate good times Watching the crazy celebrations at the full-time whistle, I’m guessing Madrid won away at West Ham? Stewie Griffin (seriously Pep, sign a number 9 because this is getting ridiculous now)   Clueless Kev At work the other day one of my colleagues stated that rugby was the greatest sport ever. In your face Kevin… Robbie DFC (Just heading into extra time but hoping for a penalty shootout)   Rewrite365 Dear Editor, would you mind publishing whatever draft of F365 Says had been written as of the 89th minute of Real Madrid – Manchester City? Blessings, Danny, Austin Spurs   Whatever happens now, this is success Mignolet, Clyne, Skrtel, Sakho, Moreno, Lucas, Can, Coutinho, Lallana, Origi, Milner. On the bench: Bogdan, Toure, Allen, Sinclair, Texiera and Randall. It’s sometimes easy to forget how far Liverpool have come from Jurgen Klopp’s first Liverpool game. When discussing the fantastic job he’s done, Klopp is sometimes a victim of his own success. He’s been criticised (admittedly by idiots) for “only” winning one league title and one Champions league title as if the expectation was greater than that when he took over. Just look again at that first line up. Look at the bench! Did anyone seriously believe that this is where Liverpool would be now? A rebuild of that nature would be impressive even if they had outspent their rivals. United and Everton have proved money doesn’t buy success. It takes skill. Liverpool are the 6th highest spenders in England and 15th highest in Europe (gross, not net) during Klopp’s reign. It’s genuinely astonishing that he has managed to turn Liverpool into the side they are today. He has just steered Liverpool to their 3rd Champions League final (and 4th European final) under his management. That is absolutely remarkable. Only a handful of coaches have taken the same club to 3 European cup finals. In the Champions League era, I think Ferguson and Zidane are the only other coaches to do this. To produce that level of consistency is incredibly hard to do. Success is easy to get used to so you have to think back and remember the before times. Prior to Klopp taking over we finished 7th, 6th, 8th, 7th, 2nd & 6th. Just to play in the Champions League was an ambition at that point. To make 3 finals in 5 years is success beyond even the wildest expectation. There was discussion yesterday in the mailbox yesterday about what success looks like and whether only a league cup this season would be a failure. Of course, now, at this point, to be in 2 finals and a point off the Premier League summit, it would be very disappointing. But it wouldn’t take away from how thrilling it is to be a Liverpool fan right now. Yes, as a fan you want to win things, but you also want to play matches that matter. To take part in the big occasions and be involved. Klopp and this Liverpool team have given us that. So whatever happens between now and the end of May, this is a season we will never forget. Mike, LFC, London   A full season This may sound a bit pedantic, but with all the coverage about how Liverpool are now going to play all the games possible in a season, surely this is not quite true. To play all the games possible in a season, it would surely have to include playing in the Charity Shield, the European Super Cup, and the World Club Championship as well. Just sayin like. Pedro’s Moustache   Emery at it again I only watched the second half of the wonderful second leg between Villareal and Liverpool (Seriously UEFA, focus on corrupt sources of funding rather than the idea of removing the two legged semi tie). I must admit, when I saw Villareal 2-0 up, I felt a certain sense of joy at the idea that Liverpool fans would be birthing kittens as Aidan eloquently put it. However, as an Arsenal fan (and I am sure I was not the only one), I knew what was coming. Emery was going to let go of the initiative, park the bus, and hope to win in the last fifteen or take it to pens. Even if my assessment of his objectives are wrong, there was little doubt that he was going to stop his team from attacking. It is the kind of mentality and method that has cost him so many big leads or leads to outcomes where even a team like Watford could post 30 shots at goal. Emery seems like a lovely bloke and I do think his communication methods or language got a lot of unnecessary grief in England. He is also a fantastic manager who understands opponents well. Just that he will tailor EVERY game to the opponent instead of playing to his team’s strengths and imposing their style. Quite the opposite of Wenger who would never tailor his team to the opponent except on extremely rare occasions. But point being, he often lacks the fortitude to take big risks and not tamper with the flow of the game when it is working for him. Could he have done better at Arsenal or maybe even a Madrid if given time? I think he could, if he had shown more (for the lack of better word) balls or is able to do that in the future. AP   Optimistic Gunner Another important win for Arsenal over the weekend has seen some sort of redemption for Arteta and his team. The team was solid and these 3 wins have shifted the momentum onto us after the 3 losses. We have also secured European competition for next season which if it was achieved at the end of the season would have been a good season by us. It is testament to the progress that we have made that we want more and being in a position to be able to achieve more is huge credit to Arteta and the coaching crew. What this means for Arsenal is that we can buy better players for the campaign for next year. And with the success of the transfers at the club this season, we would be looking with optimism for the future transfers lined up by the club. Arteta has everyone pulling in the right direction with the culling of players like Auba, Özil, Guendouzi and Co. The impact of the squad players like Holding, Nketiah and Elneny in particular have also been very impressive. Elneny came into the team and may be undroppable even when Partey returns at least till the season ends. He may not need to be rushed. Based on this evidence, he and Nketiah should be given new contracts because we would need a bigger squad to compete for next season. One more thing that Arteta needs to learn is the ability to use more of the squad and not just a selected few. He also needs to learn to be ruthless when senior players are not performing. Willian was allowed to play for so long when it was obvious he wasn’t playing very well and now Laca was playing poorly for so long with Nketiah sitting on the bench. We also didn’t see more of the Hale end products get some playing rime although when the main squad is overall young as well. These are exciting fans to be Arsenal fans and the journey has been a roller coaster which the whole Arsenal team would benefit from. That Amazon documentary would be real fun to watch. Francis (Fully Arteta In) Redheart Lagos. Nigeria   Game’s gone First off, I’m an Arsenal fan so I have no skin in the game. Nor am I likely to even if we get 4th. From my point of view, the problem is the current format of what I still call the European Cup. I long for the days when the only teams in it were the ones that had actually won something. You know, their domestic league. It meant something. Now, finishing 4th in one of the top European leagues gets you a seat at the top table. You’re not even the 3rd best team in your country mate, what are you doing here??? You’re champions of what? I know it’s about money, money and probably a bit more money for UEFA and FIFA, but the romance is dead. I know in the old days of the European Cup the bigger teams still ended up victorious, but at least you got to see some of the so-called lesser teams (well, hear the game on the radio) compete in a meaningful knock-out game over two legs. It had some meaning. And jeopardy for the ‘bigger’ teams. Now all we have is a bullsh*t group stage where finishing 3rd means you still get to play in the Europa League. Like Arsenal will if we finish 4th. I’ve come full circle. ‘The game has gone’ as someone said. Stu, Gooner in France (too sad for something clever here)   Commentator’s delight Sunday afternoon, Leeds will be at Arsenal, any commentator seeking notoriety will be desperate for an opportunity to emulate the classic Brian Johnston cricket quote with … “The Arsenal player’s Holding, the Leeds man’s Koch”.

I think they totally collapsed under the pressure which is pretty underwhelming for a £1bn football team. Where do Man City go from here? I’m sure another £100m will be spent to try and complete the sportswashing project but questions need to be asked of the transfer policy in general. Why was Grealish the priority when he’s added so little and why is Fernandinho still being relied on in so many key games. Why did City spend the summer trying to bin Bernardo Silva when he’s been their best midfielder all season. It feels a bit like they’re making weird decisions Year after year but the sheer amount of money they have to keep throwing at the problem ensures some level of continued success. Minty, LFC Sympathy for City Never thought I would be ushering these words but City have been hard done by. Don’t get me wrong, my preferred opponent before the game kicked off was definitely Real Madrid because I am tired of the sight of Guardiola and City but over two games, City were the better team, Madrid just had the better individuals. Ref had me yelling at the TV as well mind you, not even remotely consistent. I don’t know what this Real Madrid team is made of but holy shit they can score from anywhere at any time. 24 days for Klopp to prepare his team for this Real yet i feel like nothing can prepare you for what they will throw at Liverpool. I cannot wait for the Final. a lot of alcohol will be consumed before, during and after. Nik (city to collapse in the league now? probably not…), Munich No sympathy for Pep I can’t believe what I’m seeing tonight. No part of my brain can comprehend how Pep thought bringing off KDB in a semi final of the champions league in the bernebeu for anything other than a broken limb was a good idea. Utter madness again from Pep on Europe’s biggest stage. David …I would give my right arm for Guardiola to be the manager of my club (Villa). I think we all would. He would greatly improve any team he manages. This loss though, has to go down as me of the greatest defeats for him and his ego. To have spent £100m on Jack Grealish, a player he didn’t need and ignore the blatant requirement for a striker is damning of arrogance of the highest order. Pundits on TV were praising a style of football where a striker wasn’t necessary. A decent striker and this match would have been settled a week ago. Paul Ps – don’t take anything away from Madrid. That is a legendary comeback of the highest order. …He’s still never won it without Messi. Just saying Johnno …Great semi final! You have to give City some credit though, for Pep to get them to another CL semi on a shoestring budget is commendable, the owners need to back the poor man! Paul, Luton Difference between Klopp and Pep From a Liverpool fan here: I believe this Manchester city collapses time and time again in the champions league because their manager does not empower them to make critical decisions. He doesn’t trust them. That’s evident in their mentality. Jack Grealish is a player who has taken responsibility his whole career to deliever a result and run at the defenses. Not once in extra time when the whole Madrid team is gassed did he challenge carvajal. He doesn’t believe in himself, he doesn’t believe he’s capable of taking responsibility, and it’s because the manager has them all by the balls. Say what you want about Klopp and mentality monsters, but that comes down to players believing in themselves because their manager believes they are capable of solving their own problems. Adarsh Two legs good, one leg bad Yes UEFA. We definitely need to get rid of 2 legged semi finals. Good call. Mike, LFC, London …Whoever is proposing to get rid of two legged champions league ties needs to be fired into the sun. Dan, Plastic LFC Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Celebrate good times Watching the crazy celebrations at the full-time whistle, I’m guessing Madrid won away at West Ham? 😉 Stewie Griffin (seriously Pep, sign a number 9 because this is getting ridiculous now) Clueless Kev At work the other day one of my colleagues stated that rugby was the greatest sport ever. In your face Kevin… Robbie DFC (Just heading into extra time but hoping for a penalty shootout) Rewrite365 Dear Editor, would you mind publishing whatever draft of F365 Says had been written as of the 89th minute of Real Madrid – Manchester City? Blessings, Danny, Austin Spurs Whatever happens now, this is success Mignolet, Clyne, Skrtel, Sakho, Moreno, Lucas, Can, Coutinho, Lallana, Origi, Milner. On the bench: Bogdan, Toure, Allen, Sinclair, Texiera and Randall. It’s sometimes easy to forget how far Liverpool have come from Jurgen Klopp’s first Liverpool game. When discussing the fantastic job he’s done, Klopp is sometimes a victim of his own success. He’s been criticised (admittedly by idiots) for “only” winning one league title and one Champions league title as if the expectation was greater than that when he took over. Just look again at that first line up. Look at the bench! Did anyone seriously believe that this is where Liverpool would be now? A rebuild of that nature would be impressive even if they had outspent their rivals. United and Everton have proved money doesn’t buy success. It takes skill. Liverpool are the 6th highest spenders in England and 15th highest in Europe (gross, not net) during Klopp’s reign. It’s genuinely astonishing that he has managed to turn Liverpool into the side they are today. He has just steered Liverpool to their 3rd Champions League final (and 4th European final) under his management. That is absolutely remarkable. Only a handful of coaches have taken the same club to 3 European cup finals. In the Champions League era, I think Ferguson and Zidane are the only other coaches to do this. To produce that level of consistency is incredibly hard to do. Success is easy to get used to so you have to think back and remember the before times. Prior to Klopp taking over we finished 7th, 6th, 8th, 7th, 2nd & 6th. Just to play in the Champions League was an ambition at that point. To make 3 finals in 5 years is success beyond even the wildest expectation. There was discussion yesterday in the mailbox yesterday about what success looks like and whether only a league cup this season would be a failure. Of course, now, at this point, to be in 2 finals and a point off the Premier League summit, it would be very disappointing. But it wouldn’t take away from how thrilling it is to be a Liverpool fan right now. Yes, as a fan you want to win things, but you also want to play matches that matter. To take part in the big occasions and be involved. Klopp and this Liverpool team have given us that. So whatever happens between now and the end of May, this is a season we will never forget. Mike, LFC, London A full season This may sound a bit pedantic, but with all the coverage about how Liverpool are now going to play all the games possible in a season, surely this is not quite true. To play all the games possible in a season, it would surely have to include playing in the Charity Shield, the European Super Cup, and the World Club Championship as well. Just sayin like. Pedro’s Moustache Emery at it again I only watched the second half of the wonderful second leg between Villareal and Liverpool (Seriously UEFA, focus on corrupt sources of funding rather than the idea of removing the two legged semi tie). I must admit, when I saw Villareal 2-0 up, I felt a certain sense of joy at the idea that Liverpool fans would be birthing kittens as Aidan eloquently put it. However, as an Arsenal fan (and I am sure I was not the only one), I knew what was coming. Emery was going to let go of the initiative, park the bus, and hope to win in the last fifteen or take it to pens. Even if my assessment of his objectives are wrong, there was little doubt that he was going to stop his team from attacking. It is the kind of mentality and method that has cost him so many big leads or leads to outcomes where even a team like Watford could post 30 shots at goal. Emery seems like a lovely bloke and I do think his communication methods or language got a lot of unnecessary grief in England. He is also a fantastic manager who understands opponents well. Just that he will tailor EVERY game to the opponent instead of playing to his team’s strengths and imposing their style. Quite the opposite of Wenger who would never tailor his team to the opponent except on extremely rare occasions. But point being, he often lacks the fortitude to take big risks and not tamper with the flow of the game when it is working for him. Could he have done better at Arsenal or maybe even a Madrid if given time? I think he could, if he had shown more (for the lack of better word) balls or is able to do that in the future. AP Optimistic Gunner Another important win for Arsenal over the weekend has seen some sort of redemption for Arteta and his team. The team was solid and these 3 wins have shifted the momentum onto us after the 3 losses. We have also secured European competition for next season which if it was achieved at the end of the season would have been a good season by us. It is testament to the progress that we have made that we want more and being in a position to be able to achieve more is huge credit to Arteta and the coaching crew. What this means for Arsenal is that we can buy better players for the campaign for next year. And with the success of the transfers at the club this season, we would be looking with optimism for the future transfers lined up by the club. Arteta has everyone pulling in the right direction with the culling of players like Auba, Özil, Guendouzi and Co. The impact of the squad players like Holding, Nketiah and Elneny in particular have also been very impressive. Elneny came into the team and may be undroppable even when Partey returns at least till the season ends. He may not need to be rushed. Based on this evidence, he and Nketiah should be given new contracts because we would need a bigger squad to compete for next season. One more thing that Arteta needs to learn is the ability to use more of the squad and not just a selected few. He also needs to learn to be ruthless when senior players are not performing. Willian was allowed to play for so long when it was obvious he wasn’t playing very well and now Laca was playing poorly for so long with Nketiah sitting on the bench. We also didn’t see more of the Hale end products get some playing rime although when the main squad is overall young as well. These are exciting fans to be Arsenal fans and the journey has been a roller coaster which the whole Arsenal team would benefit from. That Amazon documentary would be real fun to watch. Francis (Fully Arteta In) Redheart Lagos. Nigeria Game’s gone First off, I’m an Arsenal fan so I have no skin in the game. Nor am I likely to even if we get 4th. From my point of view, the problem is the current format of what I still call the European Cup. I long for the days when the only teams in it were the ones that had actually won something. You know, their domestic league. It meant something. Now, finishing 4th in one of the top European leagues gets you a seat at the top table. You’re not even the 3rd best team in your country mate, what are you doing here??? You’re champions of what? I know it’s about money, money and probably a bit more money for UEFA and FIFA, but the romance is dead. I know in the old days of the European Cup the bigger teams still ended up victorious, but at least you got to see some of the so-called lesser teams (well, hear the game on the radio) compete in a meaningful knock-out game over two legs. It had some meaning. And jeopardy for the ‘bigger’ teams. Now all we have is a bullsh*t group stage where finishing 3rd means you still get to play in the Europa League. Like Arsenal will if we finish 4th. I’ve come full circle. ‘The game has gone’ as someone said. Stu, Gooner in France (too sad for something clever here) Commentator’s delight Sunday afternoon, Leeds will be at Arsenal, any commentator seeking notoriety will be desperate for an opportunity to emulate the classic Brian Johnston cricket quote with … “The Arsenal player’s Holding, the Leeds man’s Koch”.

But, no I am not concerned about his form.\" Terribly out of form, Jadeja had last week handed back captaincy to Mahendra Singh Dhoni to focus on his own game.With just six points from 10 games, CSK are virtually out of the tournament and Fleming admitted they \"have been off in all departments.\" \"Our fielding at times, the catches we dropped is of concern. We are not far away, in lot of games you can say we were really close in winning them.\"We had the games taken away or we were not good enough to get across the line. But that's usually the story of the competition if you are just off. All three departments have been below par,\" he said.\"We lost some bowlers also, you have to acknowledge that but yeah, we have been just off.\" Injuries to key players have also affected CSK with Deepak Chahar being the most prominent member to miss the entire season due to a back injury which he sustained while recovering from the quadricep tear.Moeen Ali also missed a few games after injuring his ankle during a training session.\"We had a couple of players we had in our plans whom we lost early on, so we looked at bringing young players in, probably, little bit ahead of their times. Mukesh Choudhury has developed well, Simranjit is getting an opportunity here,\" Fleming said.\"But we just have been off our balance and competition as tight as this, that can be the difference. We have some very good spin options.\" Most important victory of the tournament: HazlewoodRCB pacer Josh Hazlewood described their 13-run win over CSK as the most important victory for the team so far in the tournament as it kept them in the hunt for the play-offs.The win snapped RCB's three-match losing streak and helped them to move to the fourth position in points table.\"It is probably the most important victory of the tournament so far. We are sort of at that point where we have to win all games to make the play-off, that's what I feel, and today was the first step in doing that,\" he said.\"We have been flat last three games, we have things to work on bowling, batting and on fielding to be honest. We put it all together and held our chances, so its most important victory so far.\" On his T20 form, Hazlewood said: \"It is mostly playing continuous T20 cricket for last three years and learning things along the way on differently conditions, against different players.\"Talking to lot of voices in this camp, there is lot of experience which is handy, it accelerates the learning process for me who has played just 60-70 T20 games.\"","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-05 07:35:45","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/5/2022_5$largeimg_708233721.JPG","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kane Williamson to make Test return against England","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports-news/kane-williamson-to-make-test-return-against-england-590685","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand captain Kane Williamson is set to return to Test cricket for the first time since November after being included in their initial 20-man squad for next","content":"LONDON: New Zealand captain Kane Williamson is set to return to Test cricket for the first time since November after being included in their initial 20-man squad for next month's tour of England.New Zealand Cricket (NZC) named an extended squad for the three-Test series on Tuesday to include cover for players likely to miss two warm-up games at the end of this month due to their involvement in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL).
