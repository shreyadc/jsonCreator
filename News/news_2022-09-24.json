A clinical victory for the visitors saw them shining across departments to put on display a pretty much one-sided victory. Having won by 63 runs, England have registered their sixth-biggest T20I victory (by runs). Speaking to host broadcaster during the post-match presentation ceremony, captain Moeen Ali hailed rookie batters for standing tall on their potential and bringing their Pakistan Super League experience into play. ‚ÄúBrooky [Harry Brook], hopefully, he grows and becomes one of those top, top players. All got a bit of experience from the PSL. [Will] Jacks took it to the bowlers, the future for England cricket is amazing,‚Äù Ali said. While Ben Duckett and Brook scored individual half-centuries in a winning cause, debutant Jacks had scored a stroke-filled 40 (22) at the top of the order. Readers must note that both Duckett and Jacks represent Islamabad United in the PSL. Brooks, on the other hand, is a Lahore Qalandars product even getting involved in a with his Qalandars teammate Haris Rauf on Friday. An opening batter by default, Pakistan‚Äôs Shan Masood grabbed an opportunity of batting in the middle-order with both hands to be a lone positive among the hosts in this match. Been playing international cricket for almost nine years now, Masood had made his T20I debut earlier this week. It was only his second innings in the shortest format that Masood brought up a maiden half-century to somehow steer Pakistan past the 150-run mark. Known for his work ethic and stupendous run-scoring ability in domestic cricket, Masood has literally earned a T20I debut on the back of consistent performances for Multan Sultans and Derbyshire Falcons in the recent years. Masood‚Äôs one-man show for Pakistan caught the attention of former fast bowler Mohammad Amir, who took to social media platform Twitter to highlight how the 32-year old player has proved a point by contributing in the middle-order. wining or losing its a part of game but good player can bat on any number today proved that üëç üëå. ‚Äî Mohammad Amir (@iamamirofficial) Masood, who scored 65*(40) with the help of three fours and four sixes, has hardly batted in the middle-order in his 11-year old T20 career.

With the win, India made it 1-1 with the third and final game remaining. Finch acknowledged that the two overs bowled by Indian spinner Axar Patel made the difference in the end. Axar gave away just 13 runs and picked up two wickets in his quota of two overs. The Australian skipper also praised his Indian counterpart Rohit Sharma, who was named the Player of the Match for his unbeaten knock of 46 off 20 deliveries during India's successful chase of 91.

Australia managed to reach 90 in the first innings, thanks to Matthew Wade's 20-ball 43. He struck three sixes and four fours as he scored the runs at a great strike rate of 215. Finch heaped praise on Wade, saying the wicketkeeper-batsman has \"grown into a finisher's role.\" \"Wade is such a calm customer at the back end of the innings and he has grown into that finisher's role. He did a wonderful job for us. We got close. Zampa was good too,\" added Finch. Adam Zampa, who dismissed KL Rahul, brought Australia back into the game for a brief time by taking removing Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav on two successive deliveries. Zampa dismissed Kohli for the eighth time in 29 matches in international cricket. It's the most times an Australian bowler has dismissed the former India captain at the highest level. The victory in the second T20I against Australia also saw Team India equal Pakistan's record of most T20I wins in a calendar year ‚Äì 20 wins. Babar Azam and his men achieved the feat in 2021. Rohit's team India has a chance to break the record ahead of the third T20I against Australia, which is scheduled to be played on Sunday (Sept. 25).

With 1,929 runs together, the Azam-Rizwan partnership has become the most prolific in T20Is, beating Indian stars Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma‚Äôs record of 1,743 in 51 matches. Azam and Rizwan have achieved the record in just 36 games. The win levelled the seven-match series at 1-1 after England won the first game by six wickets, also in Karachi on Tuesday. Azam, who endured a miserable Asia Cup earlier this month with just 68 runs in six matches, smashed five sixes and 11 fours off 66 balls, while Rizwan struck four sixes and five boundaries in his 51-ball innings. Azam‚Äôs hundred came off 62 balls, adding to his 122 against South Africa at Centurion last year. The pair reached 100 in just 11.2 overs ‚Äî their seventh century stand together in T20I cricket. Rizwan, dropped on 23 by Alex Hales off Liam Dawson, completed his fifty off 30 balls while Azam took 39 deliveries for his half-century. It was Pakistan‚Äôs second 10-wicket win in the format following their first against India in last year‚Äôs T20 World Cup. The pair also improved on their 197-run opening stand they set against South Africa last year. ‚ÄúWe had done it in the past so we had the belief that we can do it again,‚Äù said Azam whose team have now successfully chased down three 200-plus targets. ‚ÄúIt was easier batting second under lights and Rizwan was superb so we did it together and that is a very confidence-boosting win.‚Äù England captain Moeen Ali said a dropped catch was crucial. ‚ÄúIt was a really good wicket in the end, thought we batted well, but we dropped a big catch,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRizwan and Babar (Azam) were brilliant.‚Äù Earlier, Moeen struck a rapid half-century to lead his team to 199-5 after they won the toss and batted first. Moeen smashed four sixes and as many fours in his 23-ball 55 not out. Ben Duckett (43), Harry Brook (31) and Hales (30) also contributed as England plundered 119 in the last 10 overs. Moeen hit two towering sixes off pacer Mohammad Hasnain‚Äôs last two deliveries of the innings. Fast bowlers Haris Rauf (2-30) and Shahnawaz Dahani (2-37) were the pick of Pakistan bowlers.

Set a mammoth 222 for victory, Pakistan were rocked early by the searing pace of Wood (3-24), who missed the entire English summer due to an elbow injury, when he removed Babar Azam (8) and Haider Ali (3) to leave the hosts wobbling on 28-4. Shan Masood (65 not out) briefly resurrected the chase with a fighting half-century but the total proved well out of reach for Pakistan, who had demolished England by 10 wickets 24 hours earlier. After England were put in to bat, Brook (81) and Duckett (70) smashed their maiden T20 fifties and shared an unbeaten 139-run stand for the fourth wicket to help England post 221-3 after debutant Will Jacks (40) had given them a fine start. Leg-spinner Usman Qadir (2-48) removed Jacks and Dawid Malan (14) in quick succession before Duckett and Brook made full use of a flat batting wicket and tore into the Pakistan attack with some sublime strokeplay. Brook was especially impressive as he hit five sixes while Duckett used the sweep shot to devastating effect, helping himself to eight fours and a six during his 42-ball knock.

Chasing 91 after the match was reduced to eight overs a side due to a wet outfield, Rohit finished with a 20-ball unbeaten 46 while Dinesh Karthik scored the winning runs with four balls to spare after Axar Patel (2-13) did the damage earlier. India were cruising at 51-1 at the halfway stage, with Adam Zampa briefly halting their momentum by taking out opener KL Rahul (10) before turning the game on its head by dismissing Virat Kohli (11) and Suryakumar Yadav (0) in successive balls. The hosts never lost control of the chase, despite Zampa's outstanding 3-16 spell, thanks to captain Rohit leading the charge before Karthik hit a four and a six off the only two balls he faced to wrap up the victory. Overnight rain had rendered the outfield waterlogged and although the weather had been clear on Friday, the start of play was postponed by 2-1/2 hours after several pitch inspections. India elected to bowl first and reduced Australia to 31-3 in 3.1 overs after Cameron Green was run out and Glenn Maxwell fell for a golden duck to Axar, who bowled Tim David in his next over. Jasprit Bumrah, playing his first match in over two months, marked his return with a searing yorker to dismiss Aaron Finch (31) before Matthew Wade's unbeaten 43 off 20 carried Australia to 90-5 as Harshal Patel conceded 19 runs in the final over. Australia clinched a four-wicket victory in the series opener in Mohali on Tuesday after chasing down 208 runs with four balls to spare. The teams will meet in Hyderabad on Sunday for the series decider.

It‚Äôs the most times an Australian bowler has dismissed the Delhi-born Kohli at the highest level. Out of them, Kohli got out ‚Äòcaught by fielders‚Äô five times while he got out bowled twice. In the second T20I between India and Australia at VCA Stadium in Mohali, Zampa cleaned up the 33-year-old Virat with an absolute peach. Kohli tried to shimmy down the track and play the ball on the leg side. However, he was beaten in flight and he missed the ball altogether. The ball went and hit the stumps and Kohli had to go back after scoring 11 runs off six balls with two fours. It was also the third time Zampa got the better of Kohli in T20Is. Kohli‚Äôs troubles against leg-spinners in T20Is are also evident from the fact that Kohli has got out to New Zealand leggie Ish Sodhi. As far as Zampa is concerned, he went past the Australian fast bowler Pat Cummins , who had dismissed Kohli in seven out of 28 innings. Kohli earlier returned to form after he scored his maiden T20I century against Mohammad Nabi‚Äôs Afghanistan in a Super Four match of Asia Cup 202 at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. However, after failing in two innings against Australia, Kohli will be looking to make amends in the third and final T20I. In the meantime, India beat Australia by six wickets in the second T20I to draw level in the three-match series.

During the second T20I of Australia‚Äôs tour of India 2022 in Nagpur, India beat Australia by 6 wickets to remain alive in the series ahead of a series-decider in Hyderabad on Sunday. Chasing a 91-run target in a eight-over contest, India sealed the chase with four balls remaining in the match as veteran batter Dinesh Karthik (10*) hit a six and four off Australia all-rounder Daniel Sams to once again justify his reputation of being a designated ‚Äúfinisher‚Äù. Captain Rohit Sharma (46*) led from the front by playing some eye-catching boundaries. Having hit four fours and as many sixes during his 20-ball stay, Sharma batted at a strike rate of 230 to always keep his team in the match in spite of others not contributing as much as he would‚Äôve expected. IND vs AUS Man of the Match today Much like Sharma, his Australian counterpart in Aaron Finch (31) also caught the attention of the fans with his four fours and a six. Australia wicket-keeper batter Matthew Wade (43*) generated impact for the second time in a row hitting four fours and three sixes at the Vidharbha Cricket Association Stadium tonight. With all other Indian bowlers leaking runs at an economy rate in excess of 10, all-rounder Axar Patel emerged as a game-changer with bowling figures of 2-0-13-2. Having opened the bowling with Hardik Pandya (0/10 and 9), Patel bowled at an economy rate of 6.5 despite bowling a powerplay over. Patel, whose disciplined and simplistic lines and lengths earned him wickets of hard-hitting batters namely Glenn Maxwell (0) and Tim David (2), was adjudged the Player of the Match for the fourth time in his T20I career.

England captain Moeen Ali had hinted at the toss about needing to post a big score in third T20I against Pakistan in Karachi earlier in the evening. Ali would have been a happy skipper after the first innings as his team put on board 221/3 in 20 overs without even requiring him in the batting department. Playing only their fourth and seventh T20I respectively, England batters Ben Duckett and Harry Brook put together a 69-ball 139-run fourth-wicket partnership to outdo their batting performance from last night. In what is the fourth-highest fourth-wicket partnership in T20Is, it is the highest among England batters for this wicket and sixth-highest for any wicket. While Duckett scored 70* (42) at a strike rate of 166.66, Brook caused more damage scoring 81* (35) at a strike rate of 231.42 after coming in to bat at No. 5 in the ninth over. The pair hit a total of 16 fours and six sixes between them to not let fall of wickets hamper England‚Äôs progress in the middle overs. Harry Brook hugged by Haris Rauf after catching ball in helmet grille Brook, however, was involved in a bizarre incident at the National Stadium tonight. It all happened on the fourth delivery of the 17th over when Brook completely missed reading a bouncer from Pakistan fast bowler and his Lahore Qalandars teammate Haris Rauf. As a result, what followed was Brook finding himself in an uncomfortable position only to get hit on the grille of his helmet. Having practically caught the ball with his grille, the right-handed batter registered a strange sight but was lucky enough to not get hurt. ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs got caught in the grille. It‚Äôs a dead ball. Hopefully, Harry Brook is alright.

During the third T20I of the ongoing England‚Äôs tour of Pakistan at the National Stadium in Karachi, a couple of innings of the highest order from Harry Brook (81* off 35) and Southpaw Ben Duckett (70* off 42), powered England to a towering total of 221/3 in their 20 Overs. Making a mockery of the Pakistani bowling attack for the second consecutive night, the duo stitched together an unbeaten 139-run stand off mere 69 deliveries for the fourth wicket, to puncture the spirits of the Karachi crowd, who will yet again stare at their opening batting pair of skipper Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan to repeat a miracle of sorts akin the previous T20I. Opting to field first post winning the Toss, and going in with an unchanged squad, Pakistan bowlers had to yet again face the aggressive side of the England batters, with debutant Will Jacks (40 off 22) getting them off to a flier. However, having removed their top-3 batters within nine Overs, the local fans might have sensed a mini comeback of sorts, until Duckett and Brook decided to beat the five Pakistani bowlers black and blue till the very end. James Taylor expresses awe of Harry Brook and Ben Duckett While Brook reached his maiden T20I fifty off 24 balls, Duckett too reached his landmark moment for the first time in the format off mere 31 deliveries. Brook, in particular, was at his absolute best as he tonked five Sixes and eight Fours, and returned back after striking at 231.43 runs per hundred balls. Former England batter and team selector James Taylor, took to his social media handle, to praise the duo for their exceptional knocks. Taylor further added that the two have been rewarded for their domestic performances, and are now showcasing their immense talent at the international stage as well.

RUN CHASE ... India will look to come out all guns blazing and they have strengthened their batting order considerably. They will want the openers to attack the Australian bowlers without worrying about keeping wickets in hand. With just 8 overs to bowl, the visitors will hope to maintain discipline and restrict the scoring. If that brings about wickets it would be a massive bonus for them. An exciting run chase awaits us. Do join us shortly. Australia began with positive intent with the captain Aaron Finch playing the aggressor role. A brilliant piece of fielding from Virat Kohli got rid of last game's half-centurion Cameron Green and the decision to bowl out Axar Patel early proved to be a masterstroke as he claimed the wickets of Glenn Maxwell and Tim David to peg Australia back. Aaron Finch motored along though and made a quickfire 31 before being dismissed by Jasprit Bumrah with a trademark yorker. Matthew Wade continued his good form and played some exquisite strokes en route to his 43 runs as he took Australia to the 90-run mark. Axar Patel was the pick of the bowlers taking two wickets in his 2 overs and conceding just 13 runs. Matthew Wade's sensational form continues! Australia have put up a decent total of 90 on the board but will feel they lost wickets far too frequently early on and are 10-15 runs short of a formidable target. India have done well with the ball but need to work on their death bowling as Harshal Patel conceded 19 runs in the last over. That said, they will know that they have enough firepower in their arsenal to chase down this target. 7.6 overs (0 Run) OUT! RUN OUT! Steven Smith looks to steal a single but gets run out. It is a slower one, full and on off. Wade works it back to the bowler. Meanwhile, Smith is already half way down the track. Patel gathers the ball and sprints to the non-striker's end. Australia have ended their innings at 90/5. 7.5 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Consecutive maximums. This is a slower ball, short and on off. Matthew Wade stands tall and dispatches it over the square leg fence. 19 runs off the over already. 7.4 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Matthew Wade gets the second maximum in the over. A full toss, outside off. Wade stays back and powers it over the deep point fence for a biggie. Matthew Wade is asking the umpire for a no ball, but it looks like the ball is dipping. 7.3 overs (0 Run) Patel goes full, around off. Wade drives it back to the bowler. Harshal Patel gets low in a flash and makes a half-stop. 7.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! High and handsome. There is no stopping Wade at the moment. Back of a length, Matthew Wade picks the length early and smokes it over the mid-wicket fence from outside off for a maximum. 7.1 overs (1 Run) Short ball, wide of off. Smith reaches out and pushes it to deep point for a single. 6.6 overs (1 Run) It is full again, on middle and leg. Smith tucks it to deep square leg. They take a single. 6.5 overs (1 Run) Full length, on the pads, Wade flicks it to mid-wicket for just a single. 6.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Exceptional shot. It is full, outside off. Wade opens the face of the bat late and steers it past backward point. 6.3 overs (1 Run) Steven Smith nearly gets the taste of the pitch. Jasprit Bumrah serves an inswinging yorker, on leg. Steven Smith tries to dig it out but losses his stance while doing so. 6.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Steven Smith gets his first boundary, a fortunate one though. It is full, around off. Smith swings hard, it takes the outside edge and goes down to third man. A couple of bounces over the ropes. 6.1 overs (1 Run) A low full toss, outside off. Wade pushes it through mid off and rotates the strike. 5.6 overs (1 Run) Wade premeditates the scoop but it does not come off as he expected it to. It goes to fine leg off the inner half. They take a single. 5.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Matthew Wade gets the second boundary of the over. Back of a length, outside off. Wade did not have much pace to work with but still manages to cut it through covers for four runs. 5.4 overs (2 Runs) Patel goes for the yorker ends up as a full length. Wade works it to long on and they collect a brace. 5.3 overs (1 Run) Fuller, on the pads, Smith clips it to deep square leg for a single. 5.2 overs (1 Run) Much fuller, around off. Wade inside-edges it on his pads. It rolls out to the off side and they take a single. 5.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Nicely played! A short ball, outside off.

The wet area between wide min-on and deep mid-on is soft and moving underfoot and not safe for the players, the umpires K.N Ananthapadmanabhan and Nitin Menon concluded after a second inspection of the outfield at the Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) Stadium at Jamtha here. The umpires earlier had a chat with the two captains and informed them of their decision. They were hoping that the ground staff could dry that particular area in the next 30-odd minutes and it could be safe for the players. Though the ground was under covers since Wednesday, rainwater seemed to have leaked at one or two places. The match was officially set to start at 7 pm. The ground staff has been working on the wet patches near the boundary rope since the afternoon, running the light roller. They have been seen sprinkling sawdust on some of the patches. Orange City has experienced some heavy spells of rain in the last few days. It had rained very heavily on Wednesday night. Though it has not rained since Thursday afternoon, the ground staff could not take out the covers because of overcast conditions. A spell of rain was predicted for Thursday evening, though it did not rain. Though the sun came out at noon on Friday, it was not potent enough to dry the outfield quickly. With agency inputs","content":"Tribune Web Desk Nagpur, September 23 India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and elected to bowl first against Australia in the T20 International of the three-match series at the Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) Stadium, Jamtha here on Friday. The match, which was delayed by around 2 hours and 30 minutes, will be an 8-overs-a-side affair and a bowler can bowl a maximum of two overs. India made two changes to the side that lost to Australia in the first match at Mohali, bringing in pacer Jasprit Bumrah for Umesh Yadav and Rishabh Pant in place of Bhuvaneshwar Kumar. \"I don't know what to expect from a game like this but it's nice something is happening,\" said Rohit Sharma at the toss, \"So many people have come out to watch us. An eight-over game is challenging, you don't know what to expect. We just had a huddle and I told them (the players) to go express yourselves,\" Rohit said. Australia skipper Aaron Finch said, he too would have bowled first. Australia too made two changes -- with Nathan Ellis, out with an injury, replaced by Daniel Sams while Sean Abbott comes in for Josh Inglis.

With toss delayed by over a couple of hours and having it in it to be further delayed due to a wet outfield, there are chances of the match getting cancelled altogether. Assuming that the same happens, it would be quite a pity for Nagpur fans who had an opportunity of watching an international match after almost three years. What will be all the more disappointing would be the fact that the match would get abandoned without a ball being bowled on a day when it hasn‚Äôt rained at all in the city. IND vs AUS start time Originally scheduled to happen at 06:30 PM (IST), the first delay to the toss which this match faced lasted for 30 minutes. The length of the second delay got doubled as match officials eventually decided to have another ground inspection at 08:00 PM. Still not satisfied with the condition of the ground especially a few patches which fall near the fast bowlers‚Äô run-up, umpires have now decided to conduct an inspection at 08:45 PM. ‚ÄúStill not safe for the players. It‚Äôs wet underneath. We are looking at the safety of the players. Ground staff working their best,‚Äù umpire KN Ananthapadmanabhan told Star Sports about the reason behind such an elongated delay. Honestly, there is a stampede in Hyderabad, police beat up the fans. They cannot start a match even an hour after scheduled time in Nagpur despite there being no rain. This is not the 1980s. BCCI are now the richest, most powerful board. The fans deserve better, honestly. ‚Äî Abhishek Mukherjee (@ovshake42) September 23, 2022 The possibility of a curtailed match, by and large, should be decided during the next inspection. Readers must note that there‚Äôs a 09:45 PM deadline for the first ball to be bowled. If the same doesn‚Äôt happen, the match will have to be cancelled.
