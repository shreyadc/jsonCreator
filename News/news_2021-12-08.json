The fifth Test will not be played in Perth due to Covid quarantine restrictions in Western Australia with a new venue to be announced soon. Share your #Ashes setup... Where are you following from? üåç What are you drinking? ‚òï What are you eating? üçΩ JOHN ETHERIDGE REPORTS: Former Aussie skipper Ricky Ponting, a pundit for Channel 7's coverage in Australia, believes England are covering up a Jimmy Anderson injury. England insist Anderson is 100 per cent fit and does not have a calf problem. But Ponting said: \"I'm not buying that - there's no way England would choose to leave out their best bowler in the First Test of an Ashes series if he didn't have some sort of injury.\" BUILDING BLOCKS England‚Äôs preparation on the field has been far from ideal ‚Äì to say the least. Both warm-up games in Brisbane have been heavily affected by rain, meaning Joe Root‚Äôs men are short on time in the middle headed into this series. And England were further rocked by the news yesterday that Jimmy Anderson is all but out of this Test match with a calf injury. It‚Äôs going to be a tall order without the leader of the attack. But Stokes is back and that Aussie batting line-up can be flaky. TRIBUTE SunSport cricket correspondent John Etheridge is Down Under this winter. He has some sad news about a former England cricketer... \" England will wear black armbands today in memory former England women‚Äôs cricketer Eileen Ash, who sadly passed away earlier this week aged 110. \" She was the world‚Äôs oldest Test cricketer, making her debut in 1937 .\" CRICKET SCANDALS English cricket has been rocked in recent months by the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal at Yorkshire and the reverberations are still being felt. Australia have their own problems as well entering the series after captain Tim Paine stepped down and pulled out over historic texts sent to a female colleague. It‚Äôs been a bumpy ride for the sport and it really needs a riveting contest on the pitch between two bitter rivals for the most coveted of prizes to start to shift the focus. WELCOME It‚Äôs finally time! Good evening everyone, welcome along to our LIVE coverage of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane. The talking is almost over as Joe Root‚Äôs men embark on their quest to wrestle back the coveted Ashes urn from their biggest rivals down under. It‚Äôs been a tough build-up for many reasons, but we‚Äôre almost set to get the five-Test battle underway at The Gabba. Australia have historically been excellent at their Queensland fortress, but their last Test match here ended in a quite remarkable defeat in January. The Gabba walls were breached by India in a brilliant victory to seal the series, and England will be looking to inflict further pain on an ailing Aussie Test team. Play begins at midnight UK time ‚Äì the toss will be coming up at 11.30pm, at which point we‚Äôll see England‚Äôs line-up. Hope you‚Äôve got plenty of coffee and snacks ready because it‚Äôs going to be a longggg night.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun"},{"title":"Jimmy Anderson has hunger to play beyond age of 40‚Ä¶ because he is so GRUMPY, says England team-mate Jos Buttler","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/cricket/16971892/jimmy-anderson-hunger-england-jos-buttler-ashes/","keywords":["Cricket","England Cricket","The Ashes 2021-22"],"creator":["John Etheridge"],"video_url":null,"description":"JOS BUTTLER knows Jimmy Anderson has the hunger to play beyond the age of 40 ‚Äî because he is so grumpy.

It‚Äôs allegedly a sell-out today. The Gabba can take over 40,000. How about the pitch? It looks green, yes. But the Gabba pitch always looks green on day one. It‚Äôs not usually grass that does a whole lot. I‚Äôm willing to bet it will be very decent batting surface, after perhaps a little hard work early. The big question: will we get play? Well, probably. The forecast for Brisbane entire says that rain may be around from exactly 10am local time, which is the first ball. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it will fall here at 10am. There are thunderstorms forecast for the afternoon, but hopefully that means they will rain intensely but briefly and then clear off.

India‚Äôs star with the bat during the second Test match against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai- Mayank Agarwal has joined the elite list of cricketers having scored a century at the iconic venue. His scores of 150 off 311 deliveries and 62 off 108 deliveries in first and second innings respectively at a wicket which had significant purchase for both the pacers and spinners, was instrumental in India winning their record 14th consecutive series victory at home- by defeating New Zealand by 372 runs- their biggest ever in terms of runs. Agarwal hence, on Tuesday, took to his social media handle to share his name inscribed at the Honour‚Äôs board of the Wankhede stadium, which includes some prominent giants of the game like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, and the former England batter Kevin Pietersen.

After being in the headlines for all the non-Cricketing and deplorable issues, the England and Australian Cricket teams are all set to do what they know best, as they lock horns against each other in the first of the five-match Ashes Test series at The Gabba in Brisbane from December 8. Be it the racism scandal or the Tim Paine debacle, the build up to the Ashes 2021-22 was not how it used to be in the past, with plenty of character laundry tasks to care of before talking Cricket. But, finally the fans and experts and perhaps the players as well, are ready to focus on the business- a two-handed firm grab at the coveted Ashes urn. Last time England had won a Test match in Australia was way back in 2011-12 under the then skipper Andrew Strauss. The English side has not won a Test in Brisbane (the venue for the first Test) since 1986-87. But, they would take solace and confidence from the fact that the Gabba-ttoir (as they say it) no longer remains an impenetrable fortress it once was for the visiting teams after India finally broke the 32-year, 29-match drought in January this year. Also, England skipper Joe Root will find himself on the right side of history as he is set to become the first-ever captain to lead England in two away Ashes series. On the other hand, team Australia under a new skipper Pat Cummins would continue with its bid to once again retain the sacred Ashes urn. Talking about their stats in a nutshell, the team hasn‚Äôt played a Test for 11 months, nor won an away tour since 2016, with mere four victories in their last 15 away trips. At home, they had to endure back-to-back unprecedented series losses against India in successive years. Australia and England. It‚Äôs more than just a game. It‚Äôs more than just a series. It‚Äôs the Ashes. pic.twitter.com/ytE8kxoXVB ‚Äî 7Cricket (@7Cricket) December 7, 2021 Ashes 2021-22 venues The venues for the month long event, had to be a point of contention given the omnipresent existence of the Coronavirus across the globe. The emergence of the new COVID-19 variant in Omicron- which is gradually spreading its clan in all parts of the globe, has forced travel restrictions once again in the affected places. While the the Ashes 2021-22 venues for the first four Tests have been confirmed, the venue of the fifth Ashes Test is yet to be confirmed by the Australian Cricket board. Cricket Australia has confirmed the fifth Ashes Test won‚Äôt be staged in Perth as originally scheduled due to Western Australia‚Äôs stringent COVID-19 travel restrictions, but a decision on where the potential series decider will be played is yet to be finalized. The emergence of the virus‚Äô new Omicron variant last month, had further forced Western Australia‚Äôs Premier Mark McGowan to harden the state‚Äôs stance on quarantine rules on arrivals from New South Wales (venue of 4th Test). Under those protocols, players, their families, as well as match and broadcast staff travelling to Perth after completion of the fourth Test in Sydney (January 5-9) would be required to complete 14 days quarantine upon arrival in Western Australia. While the first Test will be played at the Gabba, Brisbane, the second Test would take place at the Adelaide Oval from December 16-20. The third (December 26-30) and the fourth (January 5-9) Test would take place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) respectively. Hobart‚Äôs Blundstone Arena and the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) are the two potential venues, one of which would in all probability host the final Ashes Test from January 14-18. First Test: 8-12 December 2021, The Gabba (Brisbane) Second Test (D/N): 16-20 December 2021, Adelaide Oval (Adelaide) Third Test: 26-30 December 2021, MCG (Melbourne) Fourth Test: 5-9 January 2022, SCG (Sydney) Fifth Test: 16-20 January 2022, TBA. ¬† The post Ashes 2021-22 venues: Full list of venues where Ashes 2021-22 Test will be played appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2021-12-07 17:29:06","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Rahane's vice captaincy, Ishant's place in doubt in team for SA tour - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS1pbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EvcmFoYW5lcy12aWNlLWNhcHRhaW5jeS1pc2hhbnRzLXBsYWNlLWluLWRvdWJ0LWluLXRlYW0tZm9yLXNhLXRvdXIvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgxNTA2NzguY21z0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0L2luZGlhLWluLXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYS9yYWhhbmVzLXZpY2UtY2FwdGFpbmN5LWlzaGFudHMtcGxhY2UtaW4tZG91YnQtaW4tdGVhbS1mb3Itc2EtdG91ci9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgxNTA2NzguY21z?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rahane's vice captaincy, Ishant's place in doubt in team for SA tour¬†¬†Times of IndiaIndia tour of South Africa, 2021-22: Magala, Rickelton earn maiden call-ups for India Tests | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzIND vs SA: South Africa Test Squad For India Announced¬†¬†Cricket AddictorSelection headaches for Team India ahead of South Africa tour¬†¬†Times of IndiaDuanne Olivier returns as South Africa name 21-member squad for India Tests¬†¬†ESPNcricinfo.comView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-07 16:40:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Rahane's vice captaincy, Ishant's place in doubt in team for SA tour - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS1pbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EvcmFoYW5lcy12aWNlLWNhcHRhaW5jeS1pc2hhbnRzLXBsYWNlLWluLWRvdWJ0LWluLXRlYW0tZm9yLXNhLXRvdXIvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgxNTA2NzguY21z0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rahane's vice captaincy, Ishant's place in doubt in team for SA tour¬†¬†Times of IndiaIndia tour of South Africa, 2021-22: Magala, Rickelton earn maiden call-ups for India Tests | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzIND vs SA: South Africa Test Squad For India Announced¬†¬†Cricket AddictorSelection headaches for Team India ahead of South Africa tour¬†¬†Times of IndiaDuanne Olivier returns as South Africa name 21-member squad for India Tests¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-07 16:40:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Australia vs England Ashes 2021 commentators: Full list of Fox Sports commentators for Australia vs England Ashes 2021-22 Tests","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-australia-vs-england-ashes-2021-commentators-full-list-of-fox-sports-commentators-for-australia-vs-england-ashes-2021-22-tests/","keywords":["Cricket","Ashes 2021-22","Fox Sports"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia vs England Ashes 2021 commentators: The SportsRush present before you a list of Fox Sports commentators for Ashes 2021-22.

The 41-year-old Harbhajan, who featured in a few matches during the first phase of last IPL for Kolkata Knight Riders, didn't play a game in the UAE leg of the league. Harbhajan is expected to officially announce his retirement from competitive cricket some time next week and after that he will decide on one the offers he has got to be a part of the support staff of at least a couple of franchises. \"The role could be that of a consultant, mentor or part of the advisory group but the franchise with which he is talking are keen to use his vast experience. He will take active part in also helping the franchise decide on their auction picks,\" an IPL source privy to the development told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Harbhajan has always shown keen interest in grooming players and that was also his role in the later years with Mumbai Indians where he spent a fruitful decade. In fact, in the KKR last year, Harbhajan spent a lot of time guiding Varun Chakravarthy, who has been an integral part of the franchise for last the two seasons. Venkatesh Iyer, the find of last IPL, had earlier revealed that it was Harbhajan who had told him after a few net sessions that he will be a big hit in the league even before he had played a single game. In fact, during the last season, KKR's chief coach Brendon McCullum and skipper Eoin Morgan also paid heed to Harbhajan's advice in team selection matters. Promoted \"Look, Harbhajan wanted to make a formal announcement of his retirement after the season is over. He has had extended talks with one of the franchises which has shown keen interest but he would like to talk about it only when the deal is formally inked,\" the source said.

Shastri talked about the Test series in Australia which was eventually won by Team India 2-1 despite being 1-0 down along with a list of injury setbacks. However, the pain was quite palpable when he spoke about India's sudden collapse in the second innings of the first Test at the Adelaide Oval which saw the visitor's get bowled out for 36 - their lowest total in Test cricket. In the interview with The Week , Shastri told how the entire contingent was \"numb\" and \"in a state of shock\" as the famed Indian batting line-up capitulated in only 21.2 overs. \"See, the coach is in the firing line; there is no choice. That is the quirk of the job. You have to be ready from day one. I knew there would be no escape routes. The 36 all out was the lowest point. We had nine wickets in hand [overnight] and then we were bundled out for 36. All that had to be done was score 80-odd more runs [to be in the game]. We were all numb. We were in a state of shock for days. How could that have happened?\" Shastri said. Shastri, however, seemed unperturbed by the criticism and said that he owed the debacle to himself and asked the Team to buckle up and perform better from then onwards. The results were there to be seen as India ended as the winners of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Promoted \"It was not just me. I would be the first to put my hand up and say I was the one responsible, take the brickbats; there is no place to hide. I told the boys to focus on what they could do. The boys were unbelievable. One month after that 36 all out, on January 19, we had won the series. I am still thinking, how did that happen? I promise, as long as I live, people will talk about that series win,\" added Shastri. Pacer Josh Hazlewood was the wrecker-in-chief with a stupendous five-wicket haul while fellow fast bowler Pat Cummins also bagged four wickets. Australia clinched the first Test by eight wickets.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/jbib196s_india_120x90_07_December_21.jpg","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"Ashes 2021-22 1st Test Day 1 Live Streaming: When and where to Australia vs England watch Live Online, TV","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ashes-2021-22-1st-test-live-streaming-how-and-where-to-watch-australia-vs-england-match-online-tv-aus-vs-eng-live-748512","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ashes 2021-22 1st Test Day 1 Live Streaming: When and where to Australia vs England watch Live Online AUS vs ENG 1st Test Live Pat Cummins is set to lead the home team, putting a fast bowler‚Äôs perspective on Australia‚Äôs Test cricket captaincy for the first time since the 1950s.
