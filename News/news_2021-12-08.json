Where are you following from? 🌍 What are you drinking? ☕ What are you eating? 🍽 JOHN ETHERIDGE REPORTS: Former Aussie skipper Ricky Ponting, a pundit for Channel 7's coverage in Australia, believes England are covering up a Jimmy Anderson injury. England insist Anderson is 100 per cent fit and does not have a calf problem. But Ponting said: \"I'm not buying that - there's no way England would choose to leave out their best bowler in the First Test of an Ashes series if he didn't have some sort of injury.\" BUILDING BLOCKS England’s preparation on the field has been far from ideal – to say the least. Both warm-up games in Brisbane have been heavily affected by rain, meaning Joe Root’s men are short on time in the middle headed into this series. And England were further rocked by the news yesterday that Jimmy Anderson is all but out of this Test match with a calf injury. It’s going to be a tall order without the leader of the attack. But Stokes is back and that Aussie batting line-up can be flaky. TRIBUTE SunSport cricket correspondent John Etheridge is Down Under this winter. He has some sad news about a former England cricketer... \" England will wear black armbands today in memory former England women’s cricketer Eileen Ash, who sadly passed away earlier this week aged 110. \" She was the world’s oldest Test cricketer, making her debut in 1937 .\" CRICKET SCANDALS English cricket has been rocked in recent months by the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal at Yorkshire and the reverberations are still being felt. Australia have their own problems as well entering the series after captain Tim Paine stepped down and pulled out over historic texts sent to a female colleague. It’s been a bumpy ride for the sport and it really needs a riveting contest on the pitch between two bitter rivals for the most coveted of prizes to start to shift the focus. WELCOME It’s finally time! Good evening everyone, welcome along to our LIVE coverage of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane. The talking is almost over as Joe Root’s men embark on their quest to wrestle back the coveted Ashes urn from their biggest rivals down under. It’s been a tough build-up for many reasons, but we’re almost set to get the five-Test battle underway at The Gabba. Australia have historically been excellent at their Queensland fortress, but their last Test match here ended in a quite remarkable defeat in January. The Gabba walls were breached by India in a brilliant victory to seal the series, and England will be looking to inflict further pain on an ailing Aussie Test team. Play begins at midnight UK time – the toss will be coming up at 11.30pm, at which point we’ll see England’s line-up. Hope you’ve got plenty of coffee and snacks ready because it’s going to be a longggg night.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun"},{"title":"Jimmy Anderson has hunger to play beyond age of 40… because he is so GRUMPY, says England team-mate Jos Buttler","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/cricket/16971892/jimmy-anderson-hunger-england-jos-buttler-ashes/","keywords":["Cricket","England Cricket","The Ashes 2021-22"],"creator":["John Etheridge"],"video_url":null,"description":"JOS BUTTLER knows Jimmy Anderson has the hunger to play beyond the age of 40 — because he is so grumpy.

Lovely to see your intro but the stadium is empty. No crowd ? Weird. I’ve gotten used to crowds at the footie again.” Well, the crowd is coming in. Still almost an hour until play. It’s allegedly a sell-out today. The Gabba can take over 40,000. How about the pitch? It looks green, yes. But the Gabba pitch always looks green on day one. It’s not usually grass that does a whole lot. I’m willing to bet it will be very decent batting surface, after perhaps a little hard work early. The big question: will we get play? Well, probably. The forecast for Brisbane entire says that rain may be around from exactly 10am local time, which is the first ball. But that doesn’t mean it will fall here at 10am. There are thunderstorms forecast for the afternoon, but hopefully that means they will rain intensely but briefly and then clear off. The Gabba drains better than any other ground in the world, and we’ve seen the ground staff here perform miracles before. So, be optimistic. Good morning from Brisbane!

There are nets strung up for throw-downs. Eskies full of drinks. Hurdles and medicine balls. A circle of England players are heading a football around. There are strings of orange flags around the centre square. David Warner is standing on the centre wicket about where the stumps will go in, facing up with his bat and visualising.

The former quick took 310 Test wickets and claimed 380 ODI scalps across a successful international career, establishing himself as one of the fastest bowlers world cricket has ever seen. Sport’s greatest rivalry is just around the corner and you can catch the Ashes live and ad-break free during play. New to Kayo? Start your free trial today > While Lee admitted sledging was part of Test cricket and the Barmy Army even wrote a song about him, the best on-field barb he heard during his playing days came from an unlikely source. “I reckon the best sledge I’ve ever heard was at a grade game actually, in Sydney grade cricket,” Lee told news.com.au’s I’ve Got News For You podcast. “It’s one of those days. Rain’s falling, you’re on, you’re off (the field) type of thing. You can’t find any momentum. “So someone in our first grade team said, ‘Let’s come up with what we believe is the ugliest cricketer in Australian cricket currently’, whether it’s first-class cricket or even grade cricket. “So we’re going through what we thought was our ugliest XI. Anyway, we get back on, batsman comes out, takes centre, he’s scratching his crease. “My mate at first slip goes, ‘Hey champ, we’ve just come up with out ugliest XI and mate, looking at you right now through your lid, you are captain of the ugly XI’. “He turned around and said, ‘Oh really? Well I can see your missus on the hill mate and she’s batting three’. “True story. It’s quick, it’s brilliant.” Lee believes the best sledges are spontaneous and always make the person they’re aimed at laugh. “It’s got to be off the cuff,” he said. “Sledging’s got to come from the heart. It’s got to be quick-witted. It’s got to be spur of the moment. “In all honesty, the thing with sledging is that 99.999 per cent of the time, there’s nothing untoward. You don’t racially vilify someone, you don’t swear so the kids at home are listening in. “It’s always funny stuff. You sledge someone to try and put them off their game. It’s got to be fun. “We aren’t robots. You know the line you can’t cross. If you cross it, you have to pay the consequences but most times it’s fun and it actually makes the batsman or the bowler laugh, that’s the whole objective at the end.” Lee also revealed the time he was the butt of a practical joke in the Australian dressing room before his Test debut. “It involved Adam Gilchrist and Glenn McGrath,” he said on I’ve Got News For You . “I’m super nervous, playing my first Test, super anxious to get out there. Gilly is just eyeballing me saying, ‘Just go out there, you’ve done all the hard work. Just enjoy yourself’. “I’m listening going, ‘Yep’, trying to take it all in, not knowing that as he’s keeping eye contact someone was down beside me. McGrath tied my shoelaces together. “I got up and nearly tripped over. It was almost like, ‘Welcome’.

He is also hosting a new podcast in partnership with news.com.au, called The Brett Lee Podcast , with friend and former NSW cricketer Brad McNamara, who he describes as “one of the funniest guys you’ll meet”. “It’s a podcast about the Ashes,” Lee said. “It involves cricket, it’s not all about cricket. We cover the big topics, the news, all the different headlines that are happening in the last 24-48 hours. “We get some musicians on, we get some different talent from around the world. “It’s a combination of cricket, sport in general but also different walks of life. “We both love music, both play in a band together. So we try to have a bit of fun with it as well.” New Australian captain Pat Cummins has spoken about the ugly sledging which has dominated past Ashes series and where he stands on it this time around.

India’s star with the bat during the second Test match against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai- Mayank Agarwal has joined the elite list of cricketers having scored a century at the iconic venue. His scores of 150 off 311 deliveries and 62 off 108 deliveries in first and second innings respectively at a wicket which had significant purchase for both the pacers and spinners, was instrumental in India winning their record 14th consecutive series victory at home- by defeating New Zealand by 372 runs- their biggest ever in terms of runs. Agarwal hence, on Tuesday, took to his social media handle to share his name inscribed at the Honour’s board of the Wankhede stadium, which includes some prominent giants of the game like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, and the former England batter Kevin Pietersen. Kevin Pietersen replies hilariously to Mayank Agarwal Agarwal posted a picture of himself looking at the list of players with which he shares the record with, at his social media handle. “This isn’t just a name on a board. This is all the hardwork culminating into something that goes beyond. Playing Test cricket and contributing to a win for your country is everything for someone who grew up worshipping the game. It’s an honour to be named alongside so many greats,” wrote Mayank as the caption to his picture. The list, which also included Kevin Pietersen’s name was apparently spelled wrong by the authority concerned at the Wankhede. The name read ‘K P Pieterson’ instead of ‘K P Pietersen’. The 41-yeR-old was quick to notice the error on the board, and hilariously replied to Mayank’s post, requesting them to spell his name correctly. This isn’t just a name on a board.

After being in the headlines for all the non-Cricketing and deplorable issues, the England and Australian Cricket teams are all set to do what they know best, as they lock horns against each other in the first of the five-match Ashes Test series at The Gabba in Brisbane from December 8. Be it the racism scandal or the Tim Paine debacle, the build up to the Ashes 2021-22 was not how it used to be in the past, with plenty of character laundry tasks to care of before talking Cricket. But, finally the fans and experts and perhaps the players as well, are ready to focus on the business- a two-handed firm grab at the coveted Ashes urn. Last time England had won a Test match in Australia was way back in 2011-12 under the then skipper Andrew Strauss. The English side has not won a Test in Brisbane (the venue for the first Test) since 1986-87. But, they would take solace and confidence from the fact that the Gabba-ttoir (as they say it) no longer remains an impenetrable fortress it once was for the visiting teams after India finally broke the 32-year, 29-match drought in January this year. Also, England skipper Joe Root will find himself on the right side of history as he is set to become the first-ever captain to lead England in two away Ashes series. On the other hand, team Australia under a new skipper Pat Cummins would continue with its bid to once again retain the sacred Ashes urn. Talking about their stats in a nutshell, the team hasn’t played a Test for 11 months, nor won an away tour since 2016, with mere four victories in their last 15 away trips. At home, they had to endure back-to-back unprecedented series losses against India in successive years. Australia and England. It’s more than just a game. It’s more than just a series. It’s the Ashes. pic.twitter.com/ytE8kxoXVB — 7Cricket (@7Cricket) December 7, 2021 Ashes 2021-22 venues The venues for the month long event, had to be a point of contention given the omnipresent existence of the Coronavirus across the globe. The emergence of the new COVID-19 variant in Omicron- which is gradually spreading its clan in all parts of the globe, has forced travel restrictions once again in the affected places. While the the Ashes 2021-22 venues for the first four Tests have been confirmed, the venue of the fifth Ashes Test is yet to be confirmed by the Australian Cricket board. Cricket Australia has confirmed the fifth Ashes Test won’t be staged in Perth as originally scheduled due to Western Australia’s stringent COVID-19 travel restrictions, but a decision on where the potential series decider will be played is yet to be finalized. The emergence of the virus’ new Omicron variant last month, had further forced Western Australia’s Premier Mark McGowan to harden the state’s stance on quarantine rules on arrivals from New South Wales (venue of 4th Test). Under those protocols, players, their families, as well as match and broadcast staff travelling to Perth after completion of the fourth Test in Sydney (January 5-9) would be required to complete 14 days quarantine upon arrival in Western Australia. While the first Test will be played at the Gabba, Brisbane, the second Test would take place at the Adelaide Oval from December 16-20. The third (December 26-30) and the fourth (January 5-9) Test would take place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) respectively. Hobart’s Blundstone Arena and the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) are the two potential venues, one of which would in all probability host the final Ashes Test from January 14-18. First Test: 8-12 December 2021, The Gabba (Brisbane) Second Test (D/N): 16-20 December 2021, Adelaide Oval (Adelaide) Third Test: 26-30 December 2021, MCG (Melbourne) Fourth Test: 5-9 January 2022, SCG (Sydney) Fifth Test: 16-20 January 2022, TBA.   The post Ashes 2021-22 venues: Full list of venues where Ashes 2021-22 Test will be played appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2021-12-07 17:29:06","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Rahane's vice captaincy, Ishant's place in doubt in team for SA tour - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS1pbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EvcmFoYW5lcy12aWNlLWNhcHRhaW5jeS1pc2hhbnRzLXBsYWNlLWluLWRvdWJ0LWluLXRlYW0tZm9yLXNhLXRvdXIvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgxNTA2NzguY21z0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0L2luZGlhLWluLXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYS9yYWhhbmVzLXZpY2UtY2FwdGFpbmN5LWlzaGFudHMtcGxhY2UtaW4tZG91YnQtaW4tdGVhbS1mb3Itc2EtdG91ci9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgxNTA2NzguY21z?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rahane's vice captaincy, Ishant's place in doubt in team for SA tour  Times of IndiaIndia tour of South Africa, 2021-22: Magala, Rickelton earn maiden call-ups for India Tests | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIND vs SA: South Africa Test Squad For India Announced  Cricket AddictorSelection headaches for Team India ahead of South Africa tour  Times of IndiaDuanne Olivier returns as South Africa name 21-member squad for India Tests  ESPNcricinfo.comView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-07 16:40:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Rahane's vice captaincy, Ishant's place in doubt in team for SA tour - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS1pbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EvcmFoYW5lcy12aWNlLWNhcHRhaW5jeS1pc2hhbnRzLXBsYWNlLWluLWRvdWJ0LWluLXRlYW0tZm9yLXNhLXRvdXIvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgxNTA2NzguY21z0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rahane's vice captaincy, Ishant's place in doubt in team for SA tour  Times of IndiaIndia tour of South Africa, 2021-22: Magala, Rickelton earn maiden call-ups for India Tests | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIND vs SA: South Africa Test Squad For India Announced  Cricket AddictorSelection headaches for Team India ahead of South Africa tour  Times of IndiaDuanne Olivier returns as South Africa name 21-member squad for India Tests  ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-07 16:40:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Australia vs England Ashes 2021 commentators: Full list of Fox Sports commentators for Australia vs England Ashes 2021-22 Tests","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-australia-vs-england-ashes-2021-commentators-full-list-of-fox-sports-commentators-for-australia-vs-england-ashes-2021-22-tests/","keywords":["Cricket","Ashes 2021-22","Fox Sports"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia vs England Ashes 2021 commentators: The SportsRush present before you a list of Fox Sports commentators for Ashes 2021-22.

The 41-year-old Harbhajan, who featured in a few matches during the first phase of last IPL for Kolkata Knight Riders, didn't play a game in the UAE leg of the league. Harbhajan is expected to officially announce his retirement from competitive cricket some time next week and after that he will decide on one the offers he has got to be a part of the support staff of at least a couple of franchises. \"The role could be that of a consultant, mentor or part of the advisory group but the franchise with which he is talking are keen to use his vast experience. He will take active part in also helping the franchise decide on their auction picks,\" an IPL source privy to the development told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Harbhajan has always shown keen interest in grooming players and that was also his role in the later years with Mumbai Indians where he spent a fruitful decade. In fact, in the KKR last year, Harbhajan spent a lot of time guiding Varun Chakravarthy, who has been an integral part of the franchise for last the two seasons. Venkatesh Iyer, the find of last IPL, had earlier revealed that it was Harbhajan who had told him after a few net sessions that he will be a big hit in the league even before he had played a single game. In fact, during the last season, KKR's chief coach Brendon McCullum and skipper Eoin Morgan also paid heed to Harbhajan's advice in team selection matters. Promoted \"Look, Harbhajan wanted to make a formal announcement of his retirement after the season is over. He has had extended talks with one of the franchises which has shown keen interest but he would like to talk about it only when the deal is formally inked,\" the source said.

The former England fast bowler takes over at the helm of the club during an incredibly turbulent time in its history. Goughie is the new managing director of Yorkshire County Cricket ClubGETTY Their handling of Azeem Rafiq’s experiences racism and harassment were widely criticised and led to chairman Roger Hutton and chief executive Mark Arthur standing down. On Friday, 16 members of the coaching and medical staff were dismissed, including first-team coach Andrew Gale and director of cricket Martyn Moxon. Gough was under no illusions of the magnitude of the task before him, with his initial contract until the end of the 2022 season, but laid out what he wants to achieve. Rafiq gave emotional evidence before the DCMS committee about his experiences at Yorkshire The Drivetime host told talkSPORT following his return to Yorkshire: “We have to face these issues, make positive actions. That’s going to be the biggest thing we are looking at. “We will be watched by the sporting world, not just in this country but around the world. We have to make a difference and I think that is obvious.  “We have to take everyone at Yorkshire, no matter where they are from, on a journey, engage them, listen to them and I know this is such a big job because of that. I really, really do.  “We do need to rebuild. We need to rebuild a culture and make Yorkshire County Cricket Club a better, more inclusive place. “That’s what it comes down to. It’s quite obvious and that’s what I see the vision for the club at this moment in time.” One of Goughie’s first tasks will be to appoint a new coach and staff for the first team ahead of the new season. Gough knows he has a tough task ahead of him He added: “I know on social media and in some media that the favourite for the job is someone else at another club. “That said person is a terrific coach, but we have to go through the right process. There will be an interview panel, there will be people interviewed. “There are some magnificent coaches out there who are not in work at this moment in time, some are. “Some will fancy this challenge. For whoever takes it, it will be a difficult challenge. There will be a lot of changes and that’s why I took the job. “It’s such a big rebuilding job. The club have come out and admitted it. You’ve heard me come out on talkSPORT and say that everything that went on with Azeem Rafiq and other members were handled badly. “That was the biggest thing. It was handled badly and the club have recognised that. It’s so important.” Steve Harmison was delighted to see Gough land the job, but admitted he was devastated to see him leave talkSPORT. Harmison was sad to see his friend and talkSPORT colleague goThe Sun He said: “My initial thoughts were ‘are you out of your mind taking that on?’ That will be one of the toughest jobs not only in cricket but sport. “We’ve seen the headlines, but the more I’ve thought about it – he is potentially the only person who could bring that club together.  “The nature of who Darren is, the person he is, the affection he has for people and what people have got for him – the first thing was to get the dressing room back on because a lot of players had run for the hills because of 16 members of staff had been finished. “He’s been given the job until 2022, but this is a five-year job, a 10-year job for Darren. He has to look at it that way. Yorkshire aren’t coming back any time soon. “They can’t, it’s not possible. “I’m devastated he’s leaving talkSPORT because he’s worked 12/13 years to convince everybody not just that he knows a lot about football, but he’s brilliant at the station. I’m devastated he’s not going to be on here, but sometimes your heart leads you in a place you have to go. “That’s where Darren has gone and I’m over the moon for him. I’ll do anything for him if he ever needed a hand. “There were countless numbers of messages to Darren yesterday that said if you ever need a hand, just pick the phone up. That’s what Darren Gough does.”","pubDate":"2021-12-07 14:17:27","full_description":"Darren Gough laid out his vision for Yorkshire County Cricket Club after the talkSPORT legend was named managing director of cricket.

Shastri talked about the Test series in Australia which was eventually won by Team India 2-1 despite being 1-0 down along with a list of injury setbacks. However, the pain was quite palpable when he spoke about India's sudden collapse in the second innings of the first Test at the Adelaide Oval which saw the visitor's get bowled out for 36 - their lowest total in Test cricket. In the interview with The Week , Shastri told how the entire contingent was \"numb\" and \"in a state of shock\" as the famed Indian batting line-up capitulated in only 21.2 overs. \"See, the coach is in the firing line; there is no choice. That is the quirk of the job. You have to be ready from day one. I knew there would be no escape routes. The 36 all out was the lowest point. We had nine wickets in hand [overnight] and then we were bundled out for 36. All that had to be done was score 80-odd more runs [to be in the game]. We were all numb. We were in a state of shock for days. How could that have happened?\" Shastri said. Shastri, however, seemed unperturbed by the criticism and said that he owed the debacle to himself and asked the Team to buckle up and perform better from then onwards. The results were there to be seen as India ended as the winners of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Promoted \"It was not just me. I would be the first to put my hand up and say I was the one responsible, take the brickbats; there is no place to hide. I told the boys to focus on what they could do. The boys were unbelievable. One month after that 36 all out, on January 19, we had won the series. I am still thinking, how did that happen? I promise, as long as I live, people will talk about that series win,\" added Shastri. Pacer Josh Hazlewood was the wrecker-in-chief with a stupendous five-wicket haul while fellow fast bowler Pat Cummins also bagged four wickets. Australia clinched the first Test by eight wickets.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/jbib196s_india_120x90_07_December_21.jpg","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"Ashes 2021-22 1st Test Day 1 Live Streaming: When and where to Australia vs England watch Live Online, TV","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ashes-2021-22-1st-test-live-streaming-how-and-where-to-watch-australia-vs-england-match-online-tv-aus-vs-eng-live-748512","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ashes 2021-22 1st Test Day 1 Live Streaming: When and where to Australia vs England watch Live Online AUS vs ENG 1st Test Live Pat Cummins is set to lead the home team, putting a fast bowler’s perspective on Australia’s Test cricket captaincy for the first time since the 1950s.
