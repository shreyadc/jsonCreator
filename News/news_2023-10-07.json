Here, Mail Sport's Lawrence Booth sets out the five areas where they need to improve. Make full use of the powerplay Jonny Bairstow provided a turbocharged start by taking 12 off Trent Boult’s first over, but England slowed down so much that only 39 came off the next nine: a sluggish 51 for one in the powerplay was put into context by New Zealand’s 81 for one at the same stage. Dawid Malan deserves his place at the top of the order after a strong ODI series against the New Zealanders at home last month, but his 24-ball 14 — including 16 dots — deprived England of early momentum. Dawid Malan's sluggish start against New Zealand put pressure on Jonny Bairstow And that put pressure on Bairstow, who lost the strike and his rhythm. Remember what made you world champions There were flickers of adventure about England’s batting: Joe Root’s reverse-ramp for six off Boult, Harry Brook’s 14 off three balls against Rachin Ravindra, and a pair of straight sixes by Jos Buttler. But the victorious 2019 team did this as a matter of course. And there was something unusually tentative about the dismissals of Bairstow, chipping to long-off, and Buttler, nibbling behind. It’s more than three years since England batted out 50 overs for a lower score than their 282 for nine. Buttler promised they would attack their way to another World Cup succcess. That message seemed lost on Thursday. Don’t rely on Ben Stokes There’s every chance Stokes will miss the Bangladesh game too after suffering soreness in his left hip, though England will know more on Sunday. But they played against New Zealand as if diminished by his absence. Other players will have to fill the void if Ben Stokes (above) fails to recover from injury As Mark Wood put it: ‘He’s not Superman. He’s obviously one of our best players, if not our best player, but all the lads have to stand up as well. It’s not all just about the Messiah Stokesy coming back and him doing everything.’ If Stokes fails to recover in time for Tuesday, others will have to impose themselves on Bangladesh instead and help England get back on track. Stop overthinking The decision not to pick Reece Topley felt wrong when it was announced, and only got worse as Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra destroyed England’s bowlers. Topley has had rotten luck with injuries but he’s raring to go — and England need his height and left-arm angle. Against New Zealand at the Ageas Bowl and The Oval recently, his five wickets included Ravindra and Conway for single figures. The overthinking extended to promoting Moeen Ali to No 5 ahead of Buttler in a bid to keep a left/right-hand combination. Ali has batted there only three times in his nine-year ODI career. Why experiment in the first game of a World Cup? ...and don’t panic! Joe Root called for calm as England bounced back to lift the trophy in 2019 and 2022 There was a sense far too early in the brilliant partnership between Conway and Ravindra that England were powerless to do anything to stop them. But the message conveyed after the game by Root, urging calm, was exactly right. England stumbled during the 2019 World Cup, losing group games to Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia. And they went down to Ireland during the 2022 T20 tournament. But they ended up winning both. ‘A great trait of the group is that resilience and bouncing back and calmness,’ said Wood. ‘I trust every member in there: they’ve been through good and bad times. We know we can do it.’ Share or comment on this article: Don't rely on Ben Stokes, exploit Reece Topley's height and left-arm angle and make a fast start in the powerplay - five areas England must improve to get back on track at the World Cup e-mail Add comment Comments 1 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Indonesia defeated Bangladesh 6-0 to clinch the bronze “Finally, I’m not going home empty-handed. It feels amazing, we fought like warriors and we’re happy with it,” said the seasoned Atanu Das. The 31-year-old three-time Asian Championships medallist denied the archers were nervous going up against the world No.1 team. “Everyone is the same in the field. Everyone has the same capability. You can get tense and sometimes make a little mistake and it will cost you. Or you can make some good shots and you can win the match.” The Indian team beat Bangladesh 4-2 in the semi-finals after going past Mongolia 5-4 in the quarters. On Monday, the Indian trio had blanked Hong Kong 6-0 in the round of 16. India’s high performance director Sanjeeva Singh took heart from the silver and said the team’s chances of qualifying for the Paris Olympics are still on track. “India is currently ranked fourth in the world. So winning silver will keep our ranking up, and we have the chance to directly qualify based on world ranking,” he said. “We have been working hard and now we are touching Korea. Next year, we will topple Korea. That’s the target for Paris 2024.” Speaking about the men’s team campaign, he said, “We did wonderfully well. If you look at Bangladesh (semi-final) and Korea, they were all very close fights. Now we are just at the cusp. I just need to keep on exposing them to tournaments and they will rise. Now they have the confidence to beat Korea.” In women, the team of Ankita Bhakat, Bhajan Kaur and Simranjeet Kaur defeated Vietnam’s Do Thi Anh Nguyet, Nhi Thi Thanh Nguyen and Phuong Thao Hoang 6-2 to win the bronze medal. South Korea bagged gold with a 5-3 win over China in the final. On Saturday, an in-form Jyothi Surekha will be in action in the women’s individual compound gold medal match against South Korea's So Chae-won. The 27-year-old, in her third Asian Games, has won the mixed team and women’s team gold medals and has a good chance of signing off with a golden hat-trick. Among men, world champion Ojas Pravin Deotale will face off against compatriot Abhishek Verma for the gold medal in an all-Indian men's compound individual final. \"Exciting news!

While they present a perfect theatre for athletes to express their craft, they also possess the innate ability to humanise, even humiliate them. In Hangzhou, the contrast played out in all its glory as around the time the Indian men's hockey team celebrated their gold medal at the Gongshu Canal Sports Park Stadium, 70km away in Lin’an Sports Culture & Exhibition Centre, Bajrang Punia walked off defeated and devastated. Bajrang Punia reacts after losing to Japan's Kaiki Yamaguchi in the men's freestyle 65kg category wrestling match for the bronze medal at the 19th Asian Games(PTI) It was not exactly a fairytale redemption that romantics had hoped for, but Punia being tossed around the mat by Japan's Kaiki Yamaguchi did make for an unwanted lasting memory. By the time the final whistle was blown, Punia had buried his head in the mat, perhaps too shocked to comprehend what just hit him. Under the dizzying arc lights and thundering applause for the Japanese, the Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist and the defending Asian Games champion lay helpless and embarrassed, his might being ripped to smithereens, his comeback having turned into a nightmare. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. The scoreboard read 10-0 -- a win by technical superiority to Yamaguchi with 89 seconds left on the clock. It was a boxing equivalent of TKO. A tennis equivalent of a double bagel. A cricketing equivalent of a first-ball duck. In wrestling terms, it is the ultimate statement of superiority or submission, depending on which side you are on. Punia swatted aside the dark curtains and exited the arena, entered the passage where a handful of Indian journalists waited, and walked by without so much as a nonchalant acknowledgment. But the refusal to talk didn't smack of arrogance or dismissiveness. It was Punia in perhaps his weakest moment — tired, frustrated, livid, broken all at once. He struggled to get rid of the wrapping on his right wrist, almost ripping it off in rage. The punishment ended, but the pain will linger. He disappeared into the players' area, coach Sujeet Mann in tow, and by all accounts, broke down. Since 2015 — the year from which UWW maintains Punia's statistics — Friday was only the fifth instance for the four-time World Championships medallist having been beaten on superiority. He had suffered a similar fate in 2016 (10-0), 2017 (10-0, 17-6), and 2022 (10-0), but Hangzhou will hurt differently. This was Punia's first competition in 13 months since winning a Worlds bronze. In between, he had emerged as the face of wrestlers' protest back home, standing up for the women wrestlers who had allegedly faced sexual harassment at the hands of the WFI chief Brijbhushan Sharan Singh. In an earlier interview to HT, Punia had claimed that he would readily forego Asian Games for the larger fight he had at hand. Under intense pressure to call off the protest, Punia had dwelled on the mental toll the protest had taken. In terms of wrestling, he had claimed to have been reduced to the level of a rookie. Against Yamaguchi, his lack of physical and technical preparation unravelled in embarrassing detail. The Japanese jumped to an early 2-0 lead through a brace of push-outs and showed first signs of trouble when he slipped around Punia and effected a two-point takedown. In the second period, Yamaguchi's unrelenting pace had Punia flummoxed. 4-0 became 6-0 in a blink, and when the Japanese pushed an off-balance Punia out of the circle with a powerful takedown, the latter's fate was sealed. Punia dug his head in the mat and covered his face, waiting to be put out of misery. Yamaguchi obliged with another takedown as coach Mann shook his head in dejection. The signs were for all to see in the morning session itself when Punia lost the semi-final to Iran's Rahman Amouzadkhalili 1-8. More than the scoreline, there was a two-point throw at the beginning of the second period when the Iranian swept Punia off his feet and sent his body thudding to the mat. Most knew then that the man who had hitherto not returned empty-handed from a multi-disciplinary event will have to pull off something special to keep that record intact. Against Yamaguchi, the record and the man broke. Meanwhile, Asian Championships gold medallist Aman Sehrawat continued his impressive run in the senior circuit with a maiden Asiad bronze in the 57kg class. Aman opened his campaign with a 6-1 win over South Korea's Kim Sunggwon before beating Iran's Ebrahim Khari 19-8 from being 1-8 down in the first period. In the second period, Aman grappled like a man possessed, reeling off one takedown after another to cruise to a 19-8 win. He lost the semis 12-10 to Japan's 2021 World Championships bronze medallist Toshihiro Hasegawa but won the third-place bout against China's Minghu Liu 11-0. Kiran (76kg) and Sonam (62kg) were the other bronze medallists of the day for India. \"Exciting news!

The Proteas open their World Cup campaign against Sri Lanka on Saturday at Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. The first match of this year's event saw Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra's unbeaten centuries guide New Zealand to a clinical nine-wicket victory and chase a modest 283 against defending champions England. They did it with style, however, winning with 82 balls to spare. If early signs are anything to go by, the Proteas bowling attack will have their work cut out for them. \"I think we're going to see a high-scoring tournament, we're going to see good wickets and I think you just need to have every cog in your machine working well,\" Simons told reporters on Thursday. READ | Proteas can make up for monsoon dampener on World Cup warm-ups, says Simons The Proteas suffered a massive blow when fiery fast bowler Anrich Nortje and seamer Sisanda Magala were ruled out of the tournament last week. Simons told News24 that Nortje's injury would be felt as the Proteas had lost some of their \"intimidation factor\". With Nortje injured, Rabada spearheads the Proteas attack which is also complemented by the young Gerald Coetzee, who can deliver snorters in the region of 140km/h on a regular basis, although Simons has cautioned that there will be the odd tough spell in the tournament. In the experienced Rabada the Proteas have a quick who knows his way around Indian conditions, grabbing the purple cap in the Indian Premier League and boasting 35 wickets (13 in seven ODIs) in 27 appearances in the cricket-obsessed country. \"On a day, [Rabada's] going to maybe go for some runs and there'll be times where somebody else is going to have to step in and vice-versa,\" said Simons. \"One of the things that [Nortje] does bring is the intimidation factor. The more the opposition talks about a certain batsman or a certain bowler, the more you're in their heads and the more you're ahead of them in the game. And someone like Anrich they would've spoken about and likewise with Rabada. So, I think he is one of our key members.\" ALSO READ | SABC dodges World Cup blackout bullet (again), this time for the Cricket World Cup According to Simons, Rabada, who has only played in five of South Africa's 12 ODIs this year, is not far from peak form. \"People like to talk about the leader of an attack. He's just naturally somebody that our opposition respects and comes with a lot of experience,\" said Simons. \"[Once he] gets up to speed and bowling at his best, it is important not only for him, but also for us as a unit. \"Kagiso is a guy that wants to just be the best he can possibly be. So, it's [at] every game, every practice, every time we talk. \"We had a long conversation about tactics to be used in the death in India. So, it's a constant movement and a constant learning process and every day being a little bit better than yesterday.\" Simons believes the bowling attack, including the 22-year-old Coetzee, can deliver in the field on their day. \"One of the things that is going to be important in Indian conditions is pace-off deliveries and he (Coetzee) has got a delivery that is quite effective. In the Australia series, he bowled Alex Carey with a leg-cutter and you could see it surprised everyone. Once you've got opposition talking about it, you're winning a bit of a battle. \"Ultimately, this is a World Cup ... we have to break it down to this moment rather than what happened in the past and what might happen in the future - doing the best. And that's certainly what we will do,\" said Simons. \"It's about constant improvement and it's like that for Kagiso. I wouldn't say specifically around the World Cup, it's more just trying to be the best you possibly can be at any point in time.\" Play on Saturday starts at 10:30 SA time.","pubDate":"2023-10-06 17:28:19","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9518/96aad3bc6fd74fb38f9d6f6235a7ea67.jpg","source_id":"news24","source_priority":1882,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"01a2343d0572215d663e265b7b94c86b","title":"Mark Wood calls on England to 'prove people wrong' and show they still have an aura after their World Cup defence began with crushing defeat by New Zealand","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12603123/Mark-Wood-calls-England-prove-people-wrong-aura-World-Cup-defence-began-crushing-defeat-New-Zealand.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The fact that England's next two opponents are Bangladesh and Afghanistan means they have an immediate chance to put the hammering behind them.","content":"Mark Wood calls on England to 'prove people wrong' and show they still have an aura after their World Cup defence began with crushing defeat by New Zealand England suffered a chastening defeat by New Zealand in World Cup opener Jos Buttler’s side face Bangladesh on Tuesday and then Afghanistan on Sunday Mail Sport's new WhatsApp Channel: Get the breaking news and exclusives here By Lawrence Booth for MailOnline Published: 18:00, 6 October 2023 | Updated: 18:27, 6 October 2023 e-mail 9 View comments Mark Wood has called on England to ‘prove people wrong’ after Thursday’s chastening nine-wicket defeat by New Zealand in Ahmedabad – and played down suggestions that the world champions had started to lose their aura . The result places pressure on Jos Buttler ’s side to avoid another early misstep, with only four sides advancing to the knockouts from a 10-team group stage. The fact that England’s next two opponents are Bangladesh, in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala on Tuesday, and Afghanistan , in Delhi on Sunday, means they have an immediate chance to put the hammering behind them – and to repair some of the damage to their net run-rate inflicted by Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra, who put on 273 in just 35 overs. And Wood, whose five wicketless overs at the Narendra Modi Stadium disappeared for 55, said England had to draw on their experiences at the 2019 50-over World Cup and the 2022 T20 edition, both of which they won after early stumbles. Asked if the New Zealand defeat suggested other teams had shed their apprehension of taking on England’s power game, Wood replied: ‘Nah. I think people still think England’s a good side. We lost the games in other World Cups and still bounced back.’ England's Mark Wood has issued a rallying cry after Thursday’s defeat by New Zealand England were outclassed by an exceptional New Zealand side in their nine-wicket defeat The result, he said, could be used as motivation ‘to prove that we want to keep this trophy, to prove people wrong. There’ll be question marks now. But as a group we believe in each other and it’s another chance for us to show how good a side we are.’ In 2019, England lost their second match to Pakistan, before going down to Sri Lanka and Australia, leaving them needing to win their last four games to lift the trophy. Last year, a rain-affected defeat by Ireland in Melbourne left them in a similar situation before Buttler’s team added the T20 title to their collection. ‘We'll have to draw on that,’ said Wood. ‘A great trait of the group is that resilience and bouncing back and calmness. I trust every member in there. They’ve been through bad times and good times. We know we can do it. I think this result was probably more about New Zealand, who played really well. And we were slightly off.’ Rachin Ravindra (left) and Devon Conway (right) were sensational as they scored hundreds England will do everything they can to recreate the spirit of 2019, though back then they did so as the world’s top-ranked ODI team. This time, they are down at fifth, having in the meantime lost series to India (twice), Australia (twice) and South Africa, and often rested their best players. One of them, Ben Stokes, remains a major doubt for the Bangladesh game after suffering a hip injury that ruled him out against New Zealand, and Wood urged England to stand up in his absence. ‘He’s got strapping round his leg, which is helping. He’ll have to get in the nets and see if the strapping does its job and allows him to move how he wants. It’s not just about batting, it’s in the field. Obviously we want Stokesy back – he’s a huge player. ‘But I don’t want to put too much pressure on him. He’s not Superman. He’s been through tough situations. Other people have to stand up as well. It’s not all just about the Messiah Stokesy coming back and him doing everything. He’s obviously one of our best players, if not our best player, but all the lads have to stand up as well.’ Share or comment on this article: Mark Wood calls on England to 'prove people wrong' and show they still have an aura after their World Cup defence began with crushing defeat by New Zealand e-mail Add comment Comments 9 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Here, Mail Sport's Lawrence Booth sets out the five areas where they need to improve. Make full use of the powerplay Jonny Bairstow provided a turbocharged start by taking 12 off Trent Boult’s first over, but England slowed down so much that only 39 came off the next nine: a sluggish 51 for one in the powerplay was put into context by New Zealand’s 81 for one at the same stage. Dawid Malan deserves his place at the top of the order after a strong ODI series against the New Zealanders at home last month, but his 24-ball 14 — including 16 dots — deprived England of early momentum. Dawid Malan's sluggish start against New Zealand put pressure on Jonny Bairstow And that put pressure on Bairstow, who lost the strike and his rhythm. Remember what made you world champions There were flickers of adventure about England’s batting: Joe Root’s reverse-ramp for six off Boult, Harry Brook’s 14 off three balls against Rachin Ravindra, and a pair of straight sixes by Jos Buttler. But the victorious 2019 team did this as a matter of course. And there was something unusually tentative about the dismissals of Bairstow, chipping to long-off, and Buttler, nibbling behind. It’s more than three years since England batted out 50 overs for a lower score than their 282 for nine. Buttler promised they would attack their way to another World Cup succcess. That message seemed lost on Thursday. Don’t rely on Ben Stokes There’s every chance Stokes will miss the Bangladesh game too after suffering soreness in his left hip, though England will know more on Sunday. But they played against New Zealand as if diminished by his absence. Other players will have to fill the void if Ben Stokes (above) fails to recover from injury As Mark Wood put it: ‘He’s not Superman. He’s obviously one of our best players, if not our best player, but all the lads have to stand up as well. It’s not all just about the Messiah Stokesy coming back and him doing everything.’ If Stokes fails to recover in time for Tuesday, others will have to impose themselves on Bangladesh instead and help England get back on track. Stop overthinking The decision not to pick Reece Topley felt wrong when it was announced, and only got worse as Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra destroyed England’s bowlers. Topley has had rotten luck with injuries but he’s raring to go — and England need his height and left-arm angle. Against New Zealand at the Ageas Bowl and The Oval recently, his five wickets included Ravindra and Conway for single figures. The overthinking extended to promoting Moeen Ali to No 5 ahead of Buttler in a bid to keep a left/right-hand combination. Ali has batted there only three times in his nine-year ODI career. Why experiment in the first game of a World Cup? ...and don’t panic! Joe Root called for calm as England bounced back to lift the trophy in 2019 and 2022 There was a sense far too early in the brilliant partnership between Conway and Ravindra that England were powerless to do anything to stop them. But the message conveyed after the game by Root, urging calm, was exactly right. England stumbled during the 2019 World Cup, losing group games to Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia. And they went down to Ireland during the 2022 T20 tournament. But they ended up winning both. ‘A great trait of the group is that resilience and bouncing back and calmness,’ said Wood. ‘I trust every member in there: they’ve been through good and bad times. We know we can do it.’ Share or comment on this article: Don't rely on Ben Stokes, exploit Reece Topley's height and left-arm angle and make a fast start in the powerplay - five areas England must improve to get back on track at the World Cup e-mail Add comment Comments 1 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Indian men’s recurve team comprising of Atanu Das, Dhiraj Bommadevara and Tushar Shelke with silver medal in the team event (Narendra Modi Twitter) The Indians lost 1-5 to the reigning world champions of South Korea -- Lee Woo-seok, Oh Jin-hyek, and Kim Je-deok. Oh Jin-hyek and Kim Je-deok were also part of Korea’s gold-winning men’s recurve team at the Tokyo Olympics. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Indonesia defeated Bangladesh 6-0 to clinch the bronze “Finally, I’m not going home empty-handed. It feels amazing, we fought like warriors and we’re happy with it,” said the seasoned Atanu Das. The 31-year-old three-time Asian Championships medallist denied the archers were nervous going up against the world No.1 team. “Everyone is the same in the field. Everyone has the same capability. You can get tense and sometimes make a little mistake and it will cost you. Or you can make some good shots and you can win the match.” The Indian team beat Bangladesh 4-2 in the semi-finals after going past Mongolia 5-4 in the quarters. On Monday, the Indian trio had blanked Hong Kong 6-0 in the round of 16. India’s high performance director Sanjeeva Singh took heart from the silver and said the team’s chances of qualifying for the Paris Olympics are still on track. “India is currently ranked fourth in the world. So winning silver will keep our ranking up, and we have the chance to directly qualify based on world ranking,” he said. “We have been working hard and now we are touching Korea. Next year, we will topple Korea. That’s the target for Paris 2024.” Speaking about the men’s team campaign, he said, “We did wonderfully well. If you look at Bangladesh (semi-final) and Korea, they were all very close fights. Now we are just at the cusp. I just need to keep on exposing them to tournaments and they will rise. Now they have the confidence to beat Korea.” In women, the team of Ankita Bhakat, Bhajan Kaur and Simranjeet Kaur defeated Vietnam’s Do Thi Anh Nguyet, Nhi Thi Thanh Nguyen and Phuong Thao Hoang 6-2 to win the bronze medal. South Korea bagged gold with a 5-3 win over China in the final. On Saturday, an in-form Jyothi Surekha will be in action in the women’s individual compound gold medal match against South Korea's So Chae-won. The 27-year-old, in her third Asian Games, has won the mixed team and women’s team gold medals and has a good chance of signing off with a golden hat-trick. Among men, world champion Ojas Pravin Deotale will face off against compatriot Abhishek Verma for the gold medal in an all-Indian men's compound individual final. \"Exciting news!

While they present a perfect theatre for athletes to express their craft, they also possess the innate ability to humanise, even humiliate them. In Hangzhou, the contrast played out in all its glory as around the time the Indian men's hockey team celebrated their gold medal at the Gongshu Canal Sports Park Stadium, 70km away in Lin’an Sports Culture & Exhibition Centre, Bajrang Punia walked off defeated and devastated. Bajrang Punia reacts after losing to Japan's Kaiki Yamaguchi in the men's freestyle 65kg category wrestling match for the bronze medal at the 19th Asian Games(PTI) It was not exactly a fairytale redemption that romantics had hoped for, but Punia being tossed around the mat by Japan's Kaiki Yamaguchi did make for an unwanted lasting memory. By the time the final whistle was blown, Punia had buried his head in the mat, perhaps too shocked to comprehend what just hit him. Under the dizzying arc lights and thundering applause for the Japanese, the Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist and the defending Asian Games champion lay helpless and embarrassed, his might being ripped to smithereens, his comeback having turned into a nightmare. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. The scoreboard read 10-0 -- a win by technical superiority to Yamaguchi with 89 seconds left on the clock. It was a boxing equivalent of TKO. A tennis equivalent of a double bagel. A cricketing equivalent of a first-ball duck. In wrestling terms, it is the ultimate statement of superiority or submission, depending on which side you are on. Punia swatted aside the dark curtains and exited the arena, entered the passage where a handful of Indian journalists waited, and walked by without so much as a nonchalant acknowledgment. But the refusal to talk didn't smack of arrogance or dismissiveness. It was Punia in perhaps his weakest moment — tired, frustrated, livid, broken all at once. He struggled to get rid of the wrapping on his right wrist, almost ripping it off in rage. The punishment ended, but the pain will linger. He disappeared into the players' area, coach Sujeet Mann in tow, and by all accounts, broke down. Since 2015 — the year from which UWW maintains Punia's statistics — Friday was only the fifth instance for the four-time World Championships medallist having been beaten on superiority. He had suffered a similar fate in 2016 (10-0), 2017 (10-0, 17-6), and 2022 (10-0), but Hangzhou will hurt differently. This was Punia's first competition in 13 months since winning a Worlds bronze. In between, he had emerged as the face of wrestlers' protest back home, standing up for the women wrestlers who had allegedly faced sexual harassment at the hands of the WFI chief Brijbhushan Sharan Singh. In an earlier interview to HT, Punia had claimed that he would readily forego Asian Games for the larger fight he had at hand. Under intense pressure to call off the protest, Punia had dwelled on the mental toll the protest had taken. In terms of wrestling, he had claimed to have been reduced to the level of a rookie. Against Yamaguchi, his lack of physical and technical preparation unravelled in embarrassing detail. The Japanese jumped to an early 2-0 lead through a brace of push-outs and showed first signs of trouble when he slipped around Punia and effected a two-point takedown. In the second period, Yamaguchi's unrelenting pace had Punia flummoxed. 4-0 became 6-0 in a blink, and when the Japanese pushed an off-balance Punia out of the circle with a powerful takedown, the latter's fate was sealed. Punia dug his head in the mat and covered his face, waiting to be put out of misery. Yamaguchi obliged with another takedown as coach Mann shook his head in dejection. The signs were for all to see in the morning session itself when Punia lost the semi-final to Iran's Rahman Amouzadkhalili 1-8. More than the scoreline, there was a two-point throw at the beginning of the second period when the Iranian swept Punia off his feet and sent his body thudding to the mat. Most knew then that the man who had hitherto not returned empty-handed from a multi-disciplinary event will have to pull off something special to keep that record intact. Against Yamaguchi, the record and the man broke. Meanwhile, Asian Championships gold medallist Aman Sehrawat continued his impressive run in the senior circuit with a maiden Asiad bronze in the 57kg class. Aman opened his campaign with a 6-1 win over South Korea's Kim Sunggwon before beating Iran's Ebrahim Khari 19-8 from being 1-8 down in the first period. In the second period, Aman grappled like a man possessed, reeling off one takedown after another to cruise to a 19-8 win. He lost the semis 12-10 to Japan's 2021 World Championships bronze medallist Toshihiro Hasegawa but won the third-place bout against China's Minghu Liu 11-0. Kiran (76kg) and Sonam (62kg) were the other bronze medallists of the day for India. \"Exciting news!

The Proteas open their World Cup campaign against Sri Lanka on Saturday at Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. The first match of this year's event saw Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra's unbeaten centuries guide New Zealand to a clinical nine-wicket victory and chase a modest 283 against defending champions England. They did it with style, however, winning with 82 balls to spare. If early signs are anything to go by, the Proteas bowling attack will have their work cut out for them. \"I think we're going to see a high-scoring tournament, we're going to see good wickets and I think you just need to have every cog in your machine working well,\" Simons told reporters on Thursday. READ | Proteas can make up for monsoon dampener on World Cup warm-ups, says Simons The Proteas suffered a massive blow when fiery fast bowler Anrich Nortje and seamer Sisanda Magala were ruled out of the tournament last week. Simons told News24 that Nortje's injury would be felt as the Proteas had lost some of their \"intimidation factor\". With Nortje injured, Rabada spearheads the Proteas attack which is also complemented by the young Gerald Coetzee, who can deliver snorters in the region of 140km/h on a regular basis, although Simons has cautioned that there will be the odd tough spell in the tournament. In the experienced Rabada the Proteas have a quick who knows his way around Indian conditions, grabbing the purple cap in the Indian Premier League and boasting 35 wickets (13 in seven ODIs) in 27 appearances in the cricket-obsessed country. \"On a day, [Rabada's] going to maybe go for some runs and there'll be times where somebody else is going to have to step in and vice-versa,\" said Simons. \"One of the things that [Nortje] does bring is the intimidation factor. The more the opposition talks about a certain batsman or a certain bowler, the more you're in their heads and the more you're ahead of them in the game. And someone like Anrich they would've spoken about and likewise with Rabada. So, I think he is one of our key members.\" ALSO READ | SABC dodges World Cup blackout bullet (again), this time for the Cricket World Cup According to Simons, Rabada, who has only played in five of South Africa's 12 ODIs this year, is not far from peak form. \"People like to talk about the leader of an attack. He's just naturally somebody that our opposition respects and comes with a lot of experience,\" said Simons. \"[Once he] gets up to speed and bowling at his best, it is important not only for him, but also for us as a unit. \"Kagiso is a guy that wants to just be the best he can possibly be. So, it's [at] every game, every practice, every time we talk. \"We had a long conversation about tactics to be used in the death in India. So, it's a constant movement and a constant learning process and every day being a little bit better than yesterday.\" Simons believes the bowling attack, including the 22-year-old Coetzee, can deliver in the field on their day. \"One of the things that is going to be important in Indian conditions is pace-off deliveries and he (Coetzee) has got a delivery that is quite effective. In the Australia series, he bowled Alex Carey with a leg-cutter and you could see it surprised everyone. Once you've got opposition talking about it, you're winning a bit of a battle. \"Ultimately, this is a World Cup ... we have to break it down to this moment rather than what happened in the past and what might happen in the future - doing the best. And that's certainly what we will do,\" said Simons. \"It's about constant improvement and it's like that for Kagiso. I wouldn't say specifically around the World Cup, it's more just trying to be the best you possibly can be at any point in time.\" Play on Saturday starts at 10:30 SA time.","pubDate":"2023-10-06 17:28:19","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9518/96aad3bc6fd74fb38f9d6f6235a7ea67.jpg","source_id":"news24","source_priority":1882,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"01a2343d0572215d663e265b7b94c86b","title":"Mark Wood calls on England to 'prove people wrong' and show they still have an aura after their World Cup defence began with crushing defeat by New Zealand","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12603123/Mark-Wood-calls-England-prove-people-wrong-aura-World-Cup-defence-began-crushing-defeat-New-Zealand.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The fact that England's next two opponents are Bangladesh and Afghanistan means they have an immediate chance to put the hammering behind them.","content":"Mark Wood calls on England to 'prove people wrong' and show they still have an aura after their World Cup defence began with crushing defeat by New Zealand England suffered a chastening defeat by New Zealand in World Cup opener Jos Buttler’s side face Bangladesh on Tuesday and then Afghanistan on Sunday Mail Sport's new WhatsApp Channel: Get the breaking news and exclusives here By Lawrence Booth for MailOnline Published: 18:00, 6 October 2023 | Updated: 18:27, 6 October 2023 e-mail 9 View comments Mark Wood has called on England to ‘prove people wrong’ after Thursday’s chastening nine-wicket defeat by New Zealand in Ahmedabad – and played down suggestions that the world champions had started to lose their aura . The result places pressure on Jos Buttler ’s side to avoid another early misstep, with only four sides advancing to the knockouts from a 10-team group stage. The fact that England’s next two opponents are Bangladesh, in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala on Tuesday, and Afghanistan , in Delhi on Sunday, means they have an immediate chance to put the hammering behind them – and to repair some of the damage to their net run-rate inflicted by Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra, who put on 273 in just 35 overs. And Wood, whose five wicketless overs at the Narendra Modi Stadium disappeared for 55, said England had to draw on their experiences at the 2019 50-over World Cup and the 2022 T20 edition, both of which they won after early stumbles. Asked if the New Zealand defeat suggested other teams had shed their apprehension of taking on England’s power game, Wood replied: ‘Nah. I think people still think England’s a good side. We lost the games in other World Cups and still bounced back.’ England's Mark Wood has issued a rallying cry after Thursday’s defeat by New Zealand England were outclassed by an exceptional New Zealand side in their nine-wicket defeat The result, he said, could be used as motivation ‘to prove that we want to keep this trophy, to prove people wrong. There’ll be question marks now. But as a group we believe in each other and it’s another chance for us to show how good a side we are.’ In 2019, England lost their second match to Pakistan, before going down to Sri Lanka and Australia, leaving them needing to win their last four games to lift the trophy. Last year, a rain-affected defeat by Ireland in Melbourne left them in a similar situation before Buttler’s team added the T20 title to their collection. ‘We'll have to draw on that,’ said Wood. ‘A great trait of the group is that resilience and bouncing back and calmness. I trust every member in there. They’ve been through bad times and good times. We know we can do it. I think this result was probably more about New Zealand, who played really well. And we were slightly off.’ Rachin Ravindra (left) and Devon Conway (right) were sensational as they scored hundreds England will do everything they can to recreate the spirit of 2019, though back then they did so as the world’s top-ranked ODI team. This time, they are down at fifth, having in the meantime lost series to India (twice), Australia (twice) and South Africa, and often rested their best players. One of them, Ben Stokes, remains a major doubt for the Bangladesh game after suffering a hip injury that ruled him out against New Zealand, and Wood urged England to stand up in his absence. ‘He’s got strapping round his leg, which is helping. He’ll have to get in the nets and see if the strapping does its job and allows him to move how he wants. It’s not just about batting, it’s in the field. Obviously we want Stokesy back – he’s a huge player. ‘But I don’t want to put too much pressure on him. He’s not Superman. He’s been through tough situations. Other people have to stand up as well. It’s not all just about the Messiah Stokesy coming back and him doing everything. He’s obviously one of our best players, if not our best player, but all the lads have to stand up as well.’ Share or comment on this article: Mark Wood calls on England to 'prove people wrong' and show they still have an aura after their World Cup defence began with crushing defeat by New Zealand e-mail Add comment Comments 9 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Here, Mail Sport's Lawrence Booth sets out the five areas where they need to improve. Make full use of the powerplay Jonny Bairstow provided a turbocharged start by taking 12 off Trent Boult’s first over, but England slowed down so much that only 39 came off the next nine: a sluggish 51 for one in the powerplay was put into context by New Zealand’s 81 for one at the same stage. Dawid Malan deserves his place at the top of the order after a strong ODI series against the New Zealanders at home last month, but his 24-ball 14 — including 16 dots — deprived England of early momentum. Dawid Malan's sluggish start against New Zealand put pressure on Jonny Bairstow And that put pressure on Bairstow, who lost the strike and his rhythm. Remember what made you world champions There were flickers of adventure about England’s batting: Joe Root’s reverse-ramp for six off Boult, Harry Brook’s 14 off three balls against Rachin Ravindra, and a pair of straight sixes by Jos Buttler. But the victorious 2019 team did this as a matter of course. And there was something unusually tentative about the dismissals of Bairstow, chipping to long-off, and Buttler, nibbling behind. It’s more than three years since England batted out 50 overs for a lower score than their 282 for nine. Buttler promised they would attack their way to another World Cup succcess. That message seemed lost on Thursday. Don’t rely on Ben Stokes There’s every chance Stokes will miss the Bangladesh game too after suffering soreness in his left hip, though England will know more on Sunday. But they played against New Zealand as if diminished by his absence. Other players will have to fill the void if Ben Stokes (above) fails to recover from injury As Mark Wood put it: ‘He’s not Superman. He’s obviously one of our best players, if not our best player, but all the lads have to stand up as well. It’s not all just about the Messiah Stokesy coming back and him doing everything.’ If Stokes fails to recover in time for Tuesday, others will have to impose themselves on Bangladesh instead and help England get back on track. Stop overthinking The decision not to pick Reece Topley felt wrong when it was announced, and only got worse as Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra destroyed England’s bowlers. Topley has had rotten luck with injuries but he’s raring to go — and England need his height and left-arm angle. Against New Zealand at the Ageas Bowl and The Oval recently, his five wickets included Ravindra and Conway for single figures. The overthinking extended to promoting Moeen Ali to No 5 ahead of Buttler in a bid to keep a left/right-hand combination. Ali has batted there only three times in his nine-year ODI career. Why experiment in the first game of a World Cup? ...and don’t panic! Joe Root called for calm as England bounced back to lift the trophy in 2019 and 2022 There was a sense far too early in the brilliant partnership between Conway and Ravindra that England were powerless to do anything to stop them. But the message conveyed after the game by Root, urging calm, was exactly right. England stumbled during the 2019 World Cup, losing group games to Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia. And they went down to Ireland during the 2022 T20 tournament. But they ended up winning both. ‘A great trait of the group is that resilience and bouncing back and calmness,’ said Wood. ‘I trust every member in there: they’ve been through good and bad times. We know we can do it.’ Share or comment on this article: Don't rely on Ben Stokes, exploit Reece Topley's height and left-arm angle and make a fast start in the powerplay - five areas England must improve to get back on track at the World Cup e-mail Add comment Comments 1 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Indonesia defeated Bangladesh 6-0 to clinch the bronze “Finally, I’m not going home empty-handed. It feels amazing, we fought like warriors and we’re happy with it,” said the seasoned Atanu Das. The 31-year-old three-time Asian Championships medallist denied the archers were nervous going up against the world No.1 team. “Everyone is the same in the field. Everyone has the same capability. You can get tense and sometimes make a little mistake and it will cost you. Or you can make some good shots and you can win the match.” The Indian team beat Bangladesh 4-2 in the semi-finals after going past Mongolia 5-4 in the quarters. On Monday, the Indian trio had blanked Hong Kong 6-0 in the round of 16. India’s high performance director Sanjeeva Singh took heart from the silver and said the team’s chances of qualifying for the Paris Olympics are still on track. “India is currently ranked fourth in the world. So winning silver will keep our ranking up, and we have the chance to directly qualify based on world ranking,” he said. “We have been working hard and now we are touching Korea. Next year, we will topple Korea. That’s the target for Paris 2024.” Speaking about the men’s team campaign, he said, “We did wonderfully well. If you look at Bangladesh (semi-final) and Korea, they were all very close fights. Now we are just at the cusp. I just need to keep on exposing them to tournaments and they will rise. Now they have the confidence to beat Korea.” In women, the team of Ankita Bhakat, Bhajan Kaur and Simranjeet Kaur defeated Vietnam’s Do Thi Anh Nguyet, Nhi Thi Thanh Nguyen and Phuong Thao Hoang 6-2 to win the bronze medal. South Korea bagged gold with a 5-3 win over China in the final. On Saturday, an in-form Jyothi Surekha will be in action in the women’s individual compound gold medal match against South Korea's So Chae-won. The 27-year-old, in her third Asian Games, has won the mixed team and women’s team gold medals and has a good chance of signing off with a golden hat-trick. Among men, world champion Ojas Pravin Deotale will face off against compatriot Abhishek Verma for the gold medal in an all-Indian men's compound individual final. \"Exciting news!

While they present a perfect theatre for athletes to express their craft, they also possess the innate ability to humanise, even humiliate them. In Hangzhou, the contrast played out in all its glory as around the time the Indian men's hockey team celebrated their gold medal at the Gongshu Canal Sports Park Stadium, 70km away in Lin’an Sports Culture & Exhibition Centre, Bajrang Punia walked off defeated and devastated. Bajrang Punia reacts after losing to Japan's Kaiki Yamaguchi in the men's freestyle 65kg category wrestling match for the bronze medal at the 19th Asian Games(PTI) It was not exactly a fairytale redemption that romantics had hoped for, but Punia being tossed around the mat by Japan's Kaiki Yamaguchi did make for an unwanted lasting memory. By the time the final whistle was blown, Punia had buried his head in the mat, perhaps too shocked to comprehend what just hit him. Under the dizzying arc lights and thundering applause for the Japanese, the Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist and the defending Asian Games champion lay helpless and embarrassed, his might being ripped to smithereens, his comeback having turned into a nightmare. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. The scoreboard read 10-0 -- a win by technical superiority to Yamaguchi with 89 seconds left on the clock. It was a boxing equivalent of TKO. A tennis equivalent of a double bagel. A cricketing equivalent of a first-ball duck. In wrestling terms, it is the ultimate statement of superiority or submission, depending on which side you are on. Punia swatted aside the dark curtains and exited the arena, entered the passage where a handful of Indian journalists waited, and walked by without so much as a nonchalant acknowledgment. But the refusal to talk didn't smack of arrogance or dismissiveness. It was Punia in perhaps his weakest moment — tired, frustrated, livid, broken all at once. He struggled to get rid of the wrapping on his right wrist, almost ripping it off in rage. The punishment ended, but the pain will linger. He disappeared into the players' area, coach Sujeet Mann in tow, and by all accounts, broke down. Since 2015 — the year from which UWW maintains Punia's statistics — Friday was only the fifth instance for the four-time World Championships medallist having been beaten on superiority. He had suffered a similar fate in 2016 (10-0), 2017 (10-0, 17-6), and 2022 (10-0), but Hangzhou will hurt differently. This was Punia's first competition in 13 months since winning a Worlds bronze. In between, he had emerged as the face of wrestlers' protest back home, standing up for the women wrestlers who had allegedly faced sexual harassment at the hands of the WFI chief Brijbhushan Sharan Singh. In an earlier interview to HT, Punia had claimed that he would readily forego Asian Games for the larger fight he had at hand. Under intense pressure to call off the protest, Punia had dwelled on the mental toll the protest had taken. In terms of wrestling, he had claimed to have been reduced to the level of a rookie. Against Yamaguchi, his lack of physical and technical preparation unravelled in embarrassing detail. The Japanese jumped to an early 2-0 lead through a brace of push-outs and showed first signs of trouble when he slipped around Punia and effected a two-point takedown. In the second period, Yamaguchi's unrelenting pace had Punia flummoxed. 4-0 became 6-0 in a blink, and when the Japanese pushed an off-balance Punia out of the circle with a powerful takedown, the latter's fate was sealed. Punia dug his head in the mat and covered his face, waiting to be put out of misery. Yamaguchi obliged with another takedown as coach Mann shook his head in dejection. The signs were for all to see in the morning session itself when Punia lost the semi-final to Iran's Rahman Amouzadkhalili 1-8. More than the scoreline, there was a two-point throw at the beginning of the second period when the Iranian swept Punia off his feet and sent his body thudding to the mat. Most knew then that the man who had hitherto not returned empty-handed from a multi-disciplinary event will have to pull off something special to keep that record intact. Against Yamaguchi, the record and the man broke. Meanwhile, Asian Championships gold medallist Aman Sehrawat continued his impressive run in the senior circuit with a maiden Asiad bronze in the 57kg class. Aman opened his campaign with a 6-1 win over South Korea's Kim Sunggwon before beating Iran's Ebrahim Khari 19-8 from being 1-8 down in the first period. In the second period, Aman grappled like a man possessed, reeling off one takedown after another to cruise to a 19-8 win. He lost the semis 12-10 to Japan's 2021 World Championships bronze medallist Toshihiro Hasegawa but won the third-place bout against China's Minghu Liu 11-0. Kiran (76kg) and Sonam (62kg) were the other bronze medallists of the day for India. \"Exciting news!

READ | Proteas can make up for monsoon dampener on World Cup warm-ups, says Simons The Proteas suffered a massive blow when fiery fast bowler Anrich Nortje and seamer Sisanda Magala were ruled out of the tournament last week. Simons told News24 that Nortje's injury would be felt as the Proteas had lost some of their \"intimidation factor\". With Nortje injured, Rabada spearheads the Proteas attack which is also complemented by the young Gerald Coetzee, who can deliver snorters in the region of 140km/h on a regular basis, although Simons has cautioned that there will be the odd tough spell in the tournament. In the experienced Rabada the Proteas have a quick who knows his way around Indian conditions, grabbing the purple cap in the Indian Premier League and boasting 35 wickets (13 in seven ODIs) in 27 appearances in the cricket-obsessed country. \"On a day, [Rabada's] going to maybe go for some runs and there'll be times where somebody else is going to have to step in and vice-versa,\" said Simons. \"One of the things that [Nortje] does bring is the intimidation factor. The more the opposition talks about a certain batsman or a certain bowler, the more you're in their heads and the more you're ahead of them in the game. And someone like Anrich they would've spoken about and likewise with Rabada. So, I think he is one of our key members.\" ALSO READ | SABC dodges World Cup blackout bullet (again), this time for the Cricket World Cup According to Simons, Rabada, who has only played in five of South Africa's 12 ODIs this year, is not far from peak form. \"People like to talk about the leader of an attack. He's just naturally somebody that our opposition respects and comes with a lot of experience,\" said Simons. \"[Once he] gets up to speed and bowling at his best, it is important not only for him, but also for us as a unit. \"Kagiso is a guy that wants to just be the best he can possibly be. So, it's [at] every game, every practice, every time we talk. \"We had a long conversation about tactics to be used in the death in India. So, it's a constant movement and a constant learning process and every day being a little bit better than yesterday.\" Simons believes the bowling attack, including the 22-year-old Coetzee, can deliver in the field on their day. \"One of the things that is going to be important in Indian conditions is pace-off deliveries and he (Coetzee) has got a delivery that is quite effective. In the Australia series, he bowled Alex Carey with a leg-cutter and you could see it surprised everyone. Once you've got opposition talking about it, you're winning a bit of a battle. \"Ultimately, this is a World Cup ... we have to break it down to this moment rather than what happened in the past and what might happen in the future - doing the best. And that's certainly what we will do,\" said Simons. \"It's about constant improvement and it's like that for Kagiso. I wouldn't say specifically around the World Cup, it's more just trying to be the best you possibly can be at any point in time.\" Play on Saturday starts at 10:30 SA time.","pubDate":"2023-10-06 17:28:19","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9518/96aad3bc6fd74fb38f9d6f6235a7ea67.jpg","source_id":"news24","source_priority":1882,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"01a2343d0572215d663e265b7b94c86b","title":"Mark Wood calls on England to 'prove people wrong' and show they still have an aura after their World Cup defence began with crushing defeat by New Zealand","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12603123/Mark-Wood-calls-England-prove-people-wrong-aura-World-Cup-defence-began-crushing-defeat-New-Zealand.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The fact that England's next two opponents are Bangladesh and Afghanistan means they have an immediate chance to put the hammering behind them.","content":"Mark Wood calls on England to 'prove people wrong' and show they still have an aura after their World Cup defence began with crushing defeat by New Zealand England suffered a chastening defeat by New Zealand in World Cup opener Jos Buttler’s side face Bangladesh on Tuesday and then Afghanistan on Sunday Mail Sport's new WhatsApp Channel: Get the breaking news and exclusives here By Lawrence Booth for MailOnline Published: 18:00, 6 October 2023 | Updated: 18:27, 6 October 2023 e-mail 9 View comments Mark Wood has called on England to ‘prove people wrong’ after Thursday’s chastening nine-wicket defeat by New Zealand in Ahmedabad – and played down suggestions that the world champions had started to lose their aura . The result places pressure on Jos Buttler ’s side to avoid another early misstep, with only four sides advancing to the knockouts from a 10-team group stage. The fact that England’s next two opponents are Bangladesh, in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala on Tuesday, and Afghanistan , in Delhi on Sunday, means they have an immediate chance to put the hammering behind them – and to repair some of the damage to their net run-rate inflicted by Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra, who put on 273 in just 35 overs. And Wood, whose five wicketless overs at the Narendra Modi Stadium disappeared for 55, said England had to draw on their experiences at the 2019 50-over World Cup and the 2022 T20 edition, both of which they won after early stumbles. Asked if the New Zealand defeat suggested other teams had shed their apprehension of taking on England’s power game, Wood replied: ‘Nah. I think people still think England’s a good side. We lost the games in other World Cups and still bounced back.’ England's Mark Wood has issued a rallying cry after Thursday’s defeat by New Zealand England were outclassed by an exceptional New Zealand side in their nine-wicket defeat The result, he said, could be used as motivation ‘to prove that we want to keep this trophy, to prove people wrong. There’ll be question marks now. But as a group we believe in each other and it’s another chance for us to show how good a side we are.’ In 2019, England lost their second match to Pakistan, before going down to Sri Lanka and Australia, leaving them needing to win their last four games to lift the trophy. Last year, a rain-affected defeat by Ireland in Melbourne left them in a similar situation before Buttler’s team added the T20 title to their collection. ‘We'll have to draw on that,’ said Wood. ‘A great trait of the group is that resilience and bouncing back and calmness. I trust every member in there. They’ve been through bad times and good times. We know we can do it. I think this result was probably more about New Zealand, who played really well. And we were slightly off.’ Rachin Ravindra (left) and Devon Conway (right) were sensational as they scored hundreds England will do everything they can to recreate the spirit of 2019, though back then they did so as the world’s top-ranked ODI team. This time, they are down at fifth, having in the meantime lost series to India (twice), Australia (twice) and South Africa, and often rested their best players. One of them, Ben Stokes, remains a major doubt for the Bangladesh game after suffering a hip injury that ruled him out against New Zealand, and Wood urged England to stand up in his absence. ‘He’s got strapping round his leg, which is helping. He’ll have to get in the nets and see if the strapping does its job and allows him to move how he wants. It’s not just about batting, it’s in the field. Obviously we want Stokesy back – he’s a huge player. ‘But I don’t want to put too much pressure on him. He’s not Superman. He’s been through tough situations. Other people have to stand up as well. It’s not all just about the Messiah Stokesy coming back and him doing everything. He’s obviously one of our best players, if not our best player, but all the lads have to stand up as well.’ Share or comment on this article: Mark Wood calls on England to 'prove people wrong' and show they still have an aura after their World Cup defence began with crushing defeat by New Zealand e-mail Add comment Comments 9 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.
