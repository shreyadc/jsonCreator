For Sri Lanka the nation, a popular revolt removed a tarnished president from power. For Sri Lanka the cricket team, a stunning turnaround swept away the visiting Australians to level a Test series. It would be naff to equate the two, but it would equally be naive to discount the broad as an influence on the narrow. Players are people too. For months, Sri Lankans en masse have sweltered through nightly power cuts, daily shortages of essentials and weekly price spikes. Transport paralysis has caused economic atrophy. The departing prime minister says the country is bankrupt. On the back of the pandemic, there is a national level of exhaustion. Sri Lanka demolish Australia by an innings to draw Test series in Galle Read more In this context, Sri Lanka’s players had to absorb a belting from the visitors in the first Test, bowled out in 22 overs as Australia’s spinners turned supposed home advantage against them to finish the match before its allotted halfway mark. Nobody looked competent against Nathan Lyon. Positive Covid tests started coming in, first removing Angelo Mathews mid-match and then a slew of squad players between Tests. Replacements were drafted in, then replacements for replacements. One vastly inexperienced bowling attack was replaced by another even more so. Of the four spin options eventually picked, three were on debut. And yet, and yet. Those bowlers might have been inexperienced in Tests, but among them was Prabath Jayasuriya, 30 years of age, with a decade of first-class cricket and more than 200 wickets to his credit. National captain Dimuth Karunaratne is also Jayasuriya’s captain at the Sinhalese Sports Club, and saw him as a bowler to trust. Jayasuriya delivered, sending down 52 overs of skilful left-arm spin, drifting the ball in the sea breeze, finding turn when it mattered, and becoming only the fifth player to take 12 or more wickets on debut. For Australia, it was a slip back into a past when spin caused conniptions. The lowest point was the previous visit to Sri Lanka, in 2016. They were smashed three times, with only Steve Smith able to cope as the wonderfully understated left-armer Rangana Herath caused collapse after collapse. A more targeted approach to spin selection and preparation followed, and began to bear fruit. Anti-government protesters demonstrate from the 17th-century Dutch fort during the second day of Sri Lanka’s second Test against Australia in Galle. Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/AP In 2017 in India, Smith was immense but was also supported: Glenn Maxwell made a century, Peter Handscomb and Shaun Marsh batted out a day for a draw. The same year in Bangladesh, David Warner had his only convincing sequence in Asia, while Maxwell and Handscomb continued their growth, only to be discarded from tours under Justin Langer. Usman Khawaja cracked the code in Dubai in 2018, Marnus Labuschagne emerged. By the time they visited Pakistan in 2022, Smith was no longer a one-man show. On this visit to Sri Lanka, then, each player had developed his own plan against spin and had coaching staff feed the relevant preparation. Khawaja played off the back foot to watch the ball off the pitch. Alex Carey swept everything. Steve Smith did the opposite, routinely using a straight bat and small footwork adjustments. Labuschagne swept on length in front of square or made room to play off his stumps. Cameron Green used his huge reach to come down the pitch and eliminate turn. Aside from Travis Head, there was a clarity of approach. Australia notched up 321 on a tricky pitch in the first Test and 364 in the second. Where it fell apart was when Australia got flustered. That 364 was short on a good batting surface, where a start of 238 for 3 was followed by seven wickets for 126. Carey did a job, but there was no lower-order support for Smith on 145 not out. The contrast was clear with Dinesh Chandimal, who added 145 with Sri Lanka’s last four wickets, calmly collecting a century before blasting off. No Sri Lankan had ever made a double ton against Australia before – Chandimal is now the first. Gang caught running fake Indian cricket league to dupe Russian gamblers Read more He took the lead to 190, and consigned Australia to fielding across eight different sessions. The flustering was evident there too, as they used up all three umpire reviews on speculative decisions before the fifth wicket had fallen, then watched Chandimal edge a catch behind that was not given out. By the time he was done the pitch was taking turn and the tourists were exhausted, in no state to play with their earlier sharpness. Old habits crept back. Khawaja prodded forward from the crease and edged to short leg. Warner tried to sweep when it doesn’t suit him. Labuschagne got the length wrong, playing his straight sweep as it crept under the bat. Smith simply refused to believe that he had played back and missed a ball hitting him in front of middle stump. Green overbalanced out of his crease. Head was as dire against spin as ever, bowled past his outside edge for the second time in the match. The tailenders could not read Maheesh Theekshana’s carrom ball. That was that, all out for 151. From the moment that protesters began marching past the ground on the second day, Sri Lanka’s players took control of the Test and never let go. In its context it must go down as one of the great comebacks. Jayasuriya played the perfect two-hander in Asian conditions, working away in the first innings to prise out 6 for 118, striking in the second to grab 6 for 59. Only Herath in 2016 has taken more for Sri Lanka in a match against Australia. Just after that tour in 2016 was the last time Australia suffered an innings defeat. One team this week is looking to the future. The other, at least for a couple of days, slipped back into the past.","pubDate":"2022-07-12 01:58:07","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1f83fbbf4231cb3ca1ca6784678046870b9f9ce/197_0_3819_2292/master/3819.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=12826d9020e80843f4959aa12dfd923c","source_id":"theguardian","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shane Warne’s ‘tragic passing’ saves life of former Labor MP","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/shane-warnes-tragic-passing-saves-life-of-former-labor-mp/video/ec0ba5fc2b76b8aa44a977a4fefb4b89","keywords":["National","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Labor MP Philip Dalidakis says cricket legend Shane Warne’s “tragic passing” has meant he will “still be living” after a cardiologist check-up found the left artery into his heart was 95 per cent blocked.

The \"Indian Premier Cricket League\", which of course has no affiliation to the real thing, was set up on a farm in Gujarat in northern India. It's alleged that labourers were paid a small sum to pose as players, while the matches were broadcast live on a YouTube channel called \"IPL\". READ MORE: The unfortunate casualties in Kyrgios sideshow READ MORE: Concerning theory behind Storm's shock decline READ MORE: Smith drilled over 'appalling' call READ MORE: Club rocked by pregnant star's axing claim A gang took bets via messaging service Telegram from Russian gamblers, and then instructed the 'umpire' via a walkie-talkie to signal for either a four or six, or instruct the batter to get out. Importantly, wide shots of the ground were never shown during play. Inspector Bhavesh Rathod told reporters that boundary lines and halogen lamps had been used to help create the illusion. \"Besides this the accused had set up high-resolution cameras on the ground and used computer generated graphics to display scores on a live streaming screen,\" he said. A man was also paid to impersonate famous cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle, who acknowledged the scam online, with fake crowd noise being pumped into the broadcast. Footage posted online of a match between the 'Chennai Fighters' and \"Gandhinagar Challengers\" shows exactly how much effort was put in to the scam, though it's abundantly clear to anyone with a cricket background how suspicious it all looks. \"The set-up was good enough to trick unsuspecting people into believing it was a genuine cricket league,\" said Meshana police official Achal Tyagi. Four men were arrested, and have been charged with criminal conspiracy and gambling.

The betting scam reminiscent of the Oscar-winning 1973 movie The Sting played out until the quarterfinal stage of the tournament before police busted the racket. According to local reports, the tournament began three weeks after the actual IPL concluded in May, but that proved no hindrance to the gang who police said leased a remote farm in Gujarat and hired umpires and farmers to complete the look.Police inspector Bhavesh Rathod explained the set-up to stunned reporters. “The accused had set up high resolution cameras on the ground and used computer generated graphics to display scores on a live streaming screen,” said, before adding that unemployed youths joined the farmers for 400 rupees a match.Rathod added that during the match the supposed official “would signal the bowler and batsman to hit a six, four or get out”.A “quarterfinal” match was being played “when we got a tip-off and we busted the racket,” he said.It was, up until that point, somehow working. The accused had received a first instalment of more than 300,000 rupees (nearly $4,000) from the punters in Russia, police said.But it couldn’t last. Police have arrested four people so far.

Ben Stokes, Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow all return for the first 50-over international against India at the Kia Oval in the unaccustomed position of needing to bring a bit of red-ball positivity to a white-ball side largely out-gunned in the 2-1 Twenty20 series defeat. ‘They’ll bring some energy into the group and they’re really excited to be here,’ said new white-ball coach Matthew Mott, tasting defeat for the first time in a series as England coach after the frolics in the Netherlands. Ben Stokes will return to England’s white-ball side looking to inject some red-ball positivity Jos Buttler has endured a difficult start as captain, but he welcomes back a trio of Test heroes ‘I don’t think they’ll have to change a hell of a lot from the way they’ve been playing but it is a slightly different format. They come in pretty hot.’ That is an under-statement after the last extraordinary month of Test cricket, with the trio representing something of a returning cavalry for a new white-ball captain in Buttler who saw England beaten at their own game by India, at least in the first two T20 games. Such is the upside down nature of England’s cricket this season that Mott admitted after Sunday’s consolation T20 win at Trent Bridge that the side known for setting dynamic standards under Eoin Morgan were taken aback by the ‘ferocity’ of India. Joe Root (left) and Jonny Bairstow will also be part of the squad for the first clash against India That led to Buttler, with very big shoes to fill as Morgan’s successor in a T20 World Cup year, asking his batters to be ‘braver’ in the third game which England won by 17-runs in Nottingham after taking the unusual step of batting first. ‘We learned a lot of lessons in the first two games,’ said Mott. ‘India came out with a really attacking mind-set and put us under pressure. We expected that but the ferocity of it took us a little bit by surprise. ‘After the second loss Jos spoke exceptionally well about these being times when you learn most about character. We just talked about being braver because if anything we could have been accused of being a bit timid with the bat.’ The position of Buttler will inevitably come under scrutiny even though he has long been the obvious choice as Morgan’s successor and has led the team well as his deputy. England suffered a series defeat to India last time out after being taken aback by the ‘ferocity’ New white ball coach Matthew Mott (pictured) says the returning trio will ‘come in pretty hot’ In particularly it is Buttler’s three-pronged role as captain, opener in T20 cricket and keeper that will face a fierce examination in the build-up to October’s World Cup in Australia. And, after an outstanding IPL, he had a quiet series with the bat against India. ‘Whenever you take over a team who have had such a dominant leader for so long it’s a real feeling-out process where you’re working out how you do stuff,’ added Mott. ‘I’ve been really impressed with how Jos has done that and more impressed that he hasn’t actually scored runs but still led well. That shows a lot about his character and presence in the group. He’s certainly not out of form.’ Advertisement Share or comment on this article: Post source: Daily mail The post England will welcome back Ben Stokes, Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow to white-ball side appeared first on 247 News Around The World.","pubDate":"2022-07-12 00:01:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"247newsaroundtheworld","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Smith ‘should be banned’ for huge error","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/should-be-banned-steve-smith-torn-to-shreds-following-desperate-review/news-story/81f7b6733927238f38775209846d47ad","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia’s dreadful use of the Decision Review System in Galle has come under the microscope following the second Test against Sri Lanka, and vice-captain Steve Smith is bearing the brunt of the criticism.","content":"Pat Cummins’ men were outclassed in all facets of the game this week, with hosts Sri Lanka cruising to a crushing innings victory on Monday.Watch South Africa’s Tour of England.

It was Australia’s lowest team score in Test cricket since October 2018.But despite some questionable umpiring from Kumar Dharmasena, the Australians shot themselves in the foot by burning three unsuccessful reviews early in Sri Lanka’s first innings.Sri Lankan No. 5 Dinesh Chandimal profited from Australia’s botched reviews and a missed stumping from Alex Carey, compiling an unbeaten 206 after edging a Mitchell Starc delivery through to the wicketkeeper while still on 35.It was the largest individual score by a Sri Lankan against Australia in Test history.Smith later became a laughing stock for a mind-boggling review during Australia’s batting collapse, which evoked unwanted comparisons to the 2016 Sri Lankan tour.Australia was 2/59 in the 19th over when Jayasuriya trapped Smith, who was yet to get off the mark, on the back pad with a delivery that spun past the outside edge. It was absolutely plumb.Umpire Michael Gough raised the dreaded finger without hesitation, and a bemused Smith called for the review following a brief consultation with teammate Marnus Labuschagne.Replays confirmed the inevitable — three reds, with Hawkeye suggesting the ball would have struck halfway up middle stump.Smith gingerly returned to the sheds, shaking his head and muttering under his breath after registering the seventh duck of his Test career.It was a desperate and ill-disciplined review from the former Australian captain, one that rightfully came under heavy criticism from cricket pundits.But Labuschagne was arguably just as guilty — he should have warned his batting comrade against wasting another unsuccessful review.Cricket commentator Adam Collins tweeted: “I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews — they happen. But Smith’s one of the worst; totally lacking in broader match awareness with so many batters to follow and fielders around the bat.”Former Victorian captain Darren Berry posted: “That is a very poor review need to be accountable and honest at both ends irrespective of the player absolutely plumb.”The Australian’s Peter Lalor branded it “one of the worst reviews you will ever see”.The Galle defeat was Cummins’ first as Test captain and Andrew McDonald’s first as national coach, with Australia slipping to second on the World Test Championship ladder.“I think half our batting line-up and half our bowling line-up hasn’t played a lot over here in the subcontinent,” Cummins told reporters after the loss.“We turned up knowing it’s a tough place to win series and games over here.“So to come away with a series draw, the same team that won last week … It might be a reality check that it’s tough playing away from home, in different conditions to what we’ve grown up playing in.“We’ll sit down and review it and look at different areas and maybe tactics, but I think it’s those methods which might be quite different to back home, and trying to be good enough overseas.“I think we got a lot of lessons out of it to take to India next year.”","pubDate":"2022-07-11 23:43:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Unbelievable’: Conmen busted after fooling gamblers with fake Indian cricket league","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/cricket-news-2022-fake-ipl-video-reaction-russian-gamblers-police-updates-details/news-story/4c4e1a8cd22b4dc117345368ce63a767","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A gang of conmen set up a fake Indian Premier League tournament with farm labourers acting as players to dupe Russian punters in a betting scam reminiscent of the Oscar-winning 1973 movie “The Sting”.","content":"A gang of conmen set up a fake Indian Premier League tournament with farm labourers acting as players to dupe Russian punters in a betting scam reminiscent of the Oscar-winning 1973 movie “The Sting”.

The gang hired labourers and unemployed youths for 400 rupees ($5) per game and broadcast the matches live over a YouTube channel called “IPL”. Players took turns to wear jerseys of the Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians and Gujarat Titans, police said, acting on the instructions of the Russia-based mastermind.

Aussies lose FOUR wickets at rapid rate | 01:19 At the same time the cameraman made sure that the entire ground was not shown, beaming close-ups of the players instead. Russian punters were lured into betting their rubles on a Telegram channel set up by the gang, who would then alert the fake umpire on the pitch using walkie-talkies. The supposed official “would signal the bowler and batsman to hit a six, four or get out,” Rathod added.

Having been willing to bench a world class player like Josh Hazlewood in favor of an extra spinner, batters who have shown a capacity to better handle conditions away from Australia may find themselves in the frame.Selectors twice toyed with the idea of playing Glenn Maxwell and the sub-par performance of Travis Head, who made just 23 runs in three innings in Sri Lanka, could put question marks on his sub-continental future.“I think within reason,” Cummins said of the selection considerations.“You see that with the bowlers, someone like Josh Hazlewood sitting on the bench. Glenn Maxwell was a conversation around his batting for this game, so absolutely.“The challenge with playing in Asia as well is unless you give people a go, you don’t know how someone like a Greeny (Cameron Green) can come out and show he’s well up to the task. Others might take a bit longer.“So I think it’s striking that balance. Even guys who didn’t do as well as they’d have hoped, it’s two more Test matches under their belt that they’ll learn from.”Cummins also conceded the process for reviews under his captaincy remained a work in progress after a first innings debacle in which the Australians lost all three reviews inside 80 overs of an innings that went for 100 more.“We’re always trying to get better at that,” he said.“In the past we’ve burned reviews that we’ve looked back and thought weren’t a good chance, but especially the two yesterday we were really confident on both.“So try to perfect and improve our systems, unfortunately over here there’s so many balls near edges and pads, it feels like there’s more chances to use them.”Smith’s awful review as Aussies disintegrateAn ugly Australian batting disintegration in Galle after one of the longest bowling efforts this century propelled Sri Lanka to a famous victory in the second Test in Galle and the first blemish in Pat Cummins’ golden captaincy run.The fourth-day subcontinental capitulation to three Sri Lankan spinners, who combined to roll Australia for just 151 in less than two sessions on Monday, ended a six-week tour for most of the players who will carry the nightmare finish in to a four-Test tour of India next February, where they haven’t won a series since 2004. WATCH STEVE SMITH’S REVIEW IN THE PLAYER ABOVEAfter a record-setting batting display from local hero Dinesh Chandimal pounded the Australian bowlers into submission, the top order folded in quick fashion on the back of the monster 181 overs in the field across three energy-sapping days as the series ended in a 1-1 draw. More horror reviews, first from David Warner, then Steve Smith as they questioned their plumb LBW calls, started the path to what became Cummins first loss in 10 Tests as captain with his team rolled in 40 overs to lose by an innings and 39 runs on a train wreck day.Smith’s review in particular, which came after a discussion with batting brother Marnus Labuschange, was panned by commentators and only enhanced Australia’s already perilous position in a match littered with poor umpiring decisions which cost the Aussies badly.Watch Australia’s Tour of Sri Lanka. Every T20, ODI and Test Match Live & On-Demand on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >Chandimal had benefited from the lack of Australian reviews on day three when a nick behind was missed by umpire Kumar Dharmasena and smashed an epic double hundred, brought up with consecutive sixes smashed out of the ground off Mitchell Starc, as Sri Lanka produced its highest ever score against Australia.The home team’s total of 554 came off a mammoth 181 overs from the Australians, the third most this century delivered in a single innings by an Aussie Test team.Starting 190 in arrears, having bashed out a better-than – average 364 themselves in the opening innings, a positive second beginning from the Australian openers quickly turned pear-shaped as the Sri Lankan spinners unleashed weaponry Nathan Lyon couldn’t muster.In a flurry of wickets 0-49 became 4-74 as the home team’s spinners found the Aussies listless in an effort sure to raise eyebrows ahead of a tour to India next year.Cricket: Sri Lanka's Dinesh Chandimal brought up his double century in serious style, smacking Mitch Starc for back-to-back sixes.After Warner and Usman Khawaja went within 10 runs, Smith followed for a duck putting his hand up for a review which found the ball was crashing into the pegs.Travis Head was then bowled for a second time in the match, once each by spinners Prabath Jayasuriya, who finished his debut Test with 12 wickets, and Ramesh Mendis, and his scores of six, five and 12 across the two-Test series pose serious questions about the left-handers capacity to tour India next year.Man of the series in the Ashes, Head, who was preferred ahead of Glenn Maxwell in Sri Lanka, has mustered just 83 runs in six innings since the home summer, in Pakistan and then Galle, to highlight his significant subcontinental worries.While Head’s capacity to make runs in Australia is unquestionable, selectors could be forced to make a hard call on him for next February’s four Tests in India with exposed form away from home making him a potential liability on wickets sure to suit their own arm of spinners.Warner, who was out for 24, stretched his run without an international century to 52 innings across all three formats and continued a pattern of him being the first batter out in every Australian innings since he partnered with Usman Khawaja at the top of the order during last summer’s Ashes.In 2022, Warner is averaging just 22 in Test cricket, with six single figure scores, and was, along with Head, one of just two top-six batters who didn’t score at least one half-century in Sri Lanka. The slight hint of Australian resistance from Marnus Labuschange and Cameron Green didn’t last long with both batters again falling victim to the spinners, and 4-112 became 6-117 with all hope now lost.The limp batting efforts of the Australians was made to look worse given only an hour or so earlier Chandimal went on a rampage with his own tail, smashing 42 off 18 balls after the fall of the ninth wicket, belting Australia out of the game. It was the first double-hundred score by a Sri Lankan and he remained unbeaten on 206 to put his team on track for a second win of the weekend following the efforts of his countrymen to force their under-fire president to resign on Saturday.aussie test oversThe Aussies are set for double blow with Sri Lanka’s win set to displace them from the top of the World Test Championship table.Next year’s WTC final at Lord’s remains a much-coveted target for Cummins and his men but the combination of a horribly slow over rate in Galle, which is sure to attract fines and a loss of points, plus the defeat will see the Aussies in fact lose top spot to South Africa, with the teams set to square-off against each other this summer.The cut-off for the WTC standings will come after the India tour early in 2023, a country where Australia have won just three Tests, and lost 11, in the past 20 years.","pubDate":"2022-07-11 20:29:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ash Barty: ‘I didn’t watch this year’s Wimbledon finals.

And, in her first major interview since quitting tennis at the height of her powers aged 25, the sport’s former first lady makes it clear she is not for turning. Not when she is having the time of her life travelling the world, playing golf and steadily ticking items off her bucket list. Wimbledon 2022 awards: the final word on the best and worst at SW19 Read more “I’ve no regrets about retiring,” she says. “Not one. I knew it was the right time for me. It was what I wanted to do. And I know that a lot of people may still not understand it. But I hope they respect that in the sense that it was my decision. And yeah, it’s been incredible. It’s been everything that I’ve ever wanted.” Her zest for her new life path was evident in her choices last weekend. Instead of watching the Wimbledon women’s and men’s singles finals she honed her golf game before playing the Old Course at St Andrews as part of a celebrity invitation event to mark the 150th Open , that gets under way on Thursday. Why cling to the past when the future offers such boundless opportunities? “I didn’t watch this year’s Wimbledon finals,” she says. “Sorry to disappoint. Obviously I was wrapped for Ons and Elena , who are both brilliant girls. And it was obviously awesome to see Nick, who I’ve known for over a dozen years, get to the final. Bradley Simpson, Ash Barty, Kevin Pietersen and Kathryn Newton pose for a photo on the Swilcan Bridge during the Celebrity Fourball prior to the 150th Open at St Andrews. Photograph: Stuart Kerr/R&A/Getty Images “But since retiring I’ve probably watched as many matches as I did when I was playing, which was slim to none. Occasionally we’ll have it on as background noise but it’s very seldom that I’ll sit down and watch a match from start to end with any interest. I hit enough tennis balls in my life. I don’t need to see others hitting them as well.” When photographs of her playing at St Andrews went viral on Sunday, the more excitable of the internet went into overdrive, with some people even speculating that Barty – who has a handicap of four – might consider a career in a third professional sport, after tennis and cricket. That, she makes clear, is not going to happen. “Golf is a hobby and it always will be,” she says. “I know what it takes to get to the very top of any sport, and I don’t have the desire or want to do the work required. And to be honest, I play golf for a good time and to have a good walk with people who I love. If I shoot a 70 or shoot a 100 it doesn’t matter to me.” I love to see how other professional athletes prepare and practise, how they understand their game But what about reports that she has already won a local tournament in Brisbane since hanging up her racket? She starts to laugh. “The internet has gone wild on that one. It was just a Saturday comp at home. I play it every week. I don’t win every week and when I do it’s a rarity. It’s just a very laidback event with my girlfriends and my mum!” Yet her love of the game is obvious as she relays what it was like to stand on the first tee at St Andrews in hushed tones. “It was a real pinch yourself moment to play at the home of golf under championship conditions. I made some good pars, hit some good drives, and also hit a few wild shots that went to areas of the golf course that you’ve probably never seen on TV before. It was just an amazing experience.” A particular highlight was saving par on the opening hole after flirting with the famed Swilcan Burn that guards the first green. “I hit an awful second shot – a bit of a skull with an eight iron – and it went into the little burn and popped back out again. And I managed to chip up and saved par. So I had a little bit of luck along the way but I finished about six over, so it wasn’t too bad.” She also spent time watching Tiger Woods and Justin Thomas practise , absorbing how other legends apply a final coating of gloss to their preparations. “It is incredible to see those guys doing their thing,” she says. “I love to see how other professional athletes prepare and practise, how they understand their game and their areas that they work on.” Ash Barty tees off during the Celebrity Fourball ahead of the 150th Open at St Andrews. Photograph: Stuart Kerr/R&A/Getty Images Did you grab a quick word? “No, no, no,” she replies quickly. “I stayed out of the way to give them the space they need, knowing that it’s leading up to a big event.” It is the nature of professional sport that it moves on, even when someone as compelling and popular as Barty retires. But her decision to walk away, having added the 2022 Australian Open to her 2021 Wimbledon and 2019 French Open titles, was a mic drop that still leaves a deep reverb. Such was Barty’s dominance of the women’s game at the time, she had been ranked the No 1 WTA player for 114 consecutive weeks – a run bettered only by Steffi Graf, Serena Williams and Martina Navratilova. But it was her relatability that helped her to strike an even deeper chord with the wider public. That, Barty says, has not changed even as she has slipped into joyous anonymity. “I like to think that I am approachable. I’m just a regular person that people can come up and say ‘G’day’ to and chat to.” So is there anything she misses in tennis? “I definitely miss seeing my mates. We spent so much time together and all of a sudden I’m living in a different corner of the globe. But retirement has been a really seamless transition. Instead of spending a few hours on the practice court every day I just get into different routines. And because I knew it was coming for quite a while, there wasn’t much of an adjustment.” ‘I play golf for a good time and to have a good walk with people who I love. If I shoot a 70 or shoot a 100 it doesn’t matter to me.’ says Ash Barty. Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/R&A/Getty Images However, she insists that the future of tennis remains in good hands, especially with the world No 1, Iga Swiatek, leading a new generation of young stars that includes Britain’s Emma Raducanu and now Rybakina. “Iga is an incredible talent, an exceptional human and a lovely girl,” Barty says. “I love her and her team, and I couldn’t be more proud that she took over the No 1 position, because she plays the sport in the right way and has so much energy and charisma. “But the depth in women’s tennis at the moment is great too. We’ve come from having one or two players dominating to there being more unpredictability. And that’s not because the tour is weak. In fact, it’s because the tour is so strong. Everyone in that top 40 to 50 bracket is so exceptionally good that week to week they could all be top‑10 players.” For the last few months Barty has been working on a series of illustrated children’s books, Little Ash, about school, sport, friendship and family; as well as a memoir, My Dream Time: A Memoir of Tennis and Teamwork. She has also played golf with Michael Phelps in New Jersey and plans to take in many other sporting events in the coming months – starting with the Open.

And maybe instead of putting a little £20 on my tennis career, we’ll put it on that instead.”","pubDate":"2022-07-11 20:00:08","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/176fed1e2e8d34ecab3220e07eac086987a37787/0_158_5047_3028/master/5047.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=91bd1080cd7b9d2d6c72cfafee1042d5","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lancashire v Somerset, Yorkshire v Surrey: county cricket – as it happened","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/11/lancashire-v-somerset-yorkshire-v-surrey-county-cricket-live","keywords":["County Championship","County Championship Division One","County Championship Division Two","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Tanya Aldred at Southport"],"video_url":null,"description":"Look back on updates on the day-one action around the groundsGoldsworthy scores ton for Somerset; Lyth hits 152 for YorksFirst half century of the round to Sussex’s young opener Ali Orr, only jut slower than a run a ball, making a mess of the Gloucesteshire bowling figures.

An assured hundred from Emma Lamb, who had not scored a run in white-ball cricket before this match, ensured England were utterly dominant in the run chase, while Nat Sciver joined in the fun by smashing a 31-ball half-century. England beat South Africa by five wickets in first women’s cricket ODI – live reaction! Read more “It feels amazing,” Lamb said. “When we lost an early wicket there was a bit of pressure on me, but I still wanted to play my game and not change anything. Anything in my arc I wanted to hit it with 100%. “It was a big mindset thing for us – we wanted to be really positive with the bat. When we play our best cricket we can dominate and win easily.” Lamb – whose innings was glittered with scything cuts – was out pulling one straight to square-leg in the 31st over, but it took just 12 more balls for Heather Knight and Danni Wyatt to finish the job. The newlyweds Sciver and Katherine Brunt had earlier set up the rout, between them taking seven wickets for 77 runs after becoming the first married couple to open the bowling in international cricket. Brunt made a typically feisty return to international cricket with an opening spell of 5-1-5-2, which began with her persuading Knight to call for a fruitless review for caught behind against Andrie Steyn. She made up for it with wickets in the fourth and fifth overs of the spell, trapping Steyn lbw, before Lara Goodall – having successfully overturned a second lbw decision two balls earlier – nicked one to Knight at slip. Katherine Brunt celebrates the wicket of South Africa’s Andrie Steyn. Photograph: Nathan Stirk/ECB/Getty Images Sciver was admittedly less successful with the new ball, conceding 21 runs in three overs from the Lynn Wilson Centre end. But when she switched to the Wantage Road end after drinks she struck immediately to remove the in-form Marizanne Kapp, with Kate Cross rolling to her left at mid-on to take the catch. Laura Wolvaardt had acquired a patient 43 from 72 balls, but she was given out lbw to Charlie Dean in the 30th over and walked – despite reviews later clearly showing an inside edge. It would have been an even bigger disaster for South Africa but for Chloe Tryon, who returned to the side with a vengeance after missing the Test with a hip niggle. She slammed a ferocious 88 from 73 balls, sharing a 97-run partnership with Nadine de Klerk for the sixth wicket. Admittedly she did bat like a cat with nine lives – put down by Amy Jones behind the stumps on 19, and twice reprieved by DRS after on-field lbw decisions went against her. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Her innings, epitomised by a huge six smashed on to the roof of the Cinch Stand in the 40th over, was enough to raise South Africa over 200, but – having earlier helped to reduce South Africa to 108 for five – Sciver and Brunt then combined at the death to have both batters caught, and force a tail collapse of five wickets for just 13 runs.","pubDate":"2022-07-11 19:01:47","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e307dd7434b19dcbd5a49a2e82ba686cf5c3b4/165_129_2937_1762/master/2937.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=88bae7d2a22203d2dc453becd5425e44","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Indian farmers streamed fake pro cricket matches to Russian bettors for two weeks - The Verge","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzcvMTEvMjMyMDM5MDgvZmFrZS1wcm8tY3JpY2tldC1tYXRjaGVzLWluZGlhbi1mYXJtZXJzLXN0cmVhbS1ydXNzaWFuLWJldHRvcnMtc2NhbdIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian farmers streamed fake pro cricket matches to Russian bettors for two weeks  The VergeFake IPL in Gujarat village dupes Russian punters  Times of IndiaFake IPL, Harsha Bhogle mimic, and live coverage: How Gujarat villagers duped Russian betters with a sham cricket tournament  OpIndiaHD cameras, crowd-noise effect & team jerseys: How fake IPL staged in India`s Gujarat duped Russian punters  WIONHow to sell a googly to non-Googlers  Economic TimesView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-11 19:01:02","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PHOTO FOCUS - 17 photos from Wykeham 3rds v Ravenscar 2nds","link":"https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/sport/cricket/photo-focus-17-photos-from-wykeham-3rds-v-ravenscar-2nds-3764459","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Andy Bloomfield"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ravenscar 2nds claimed a four-wicket victory in their CPH Scarborough Beckett Cricket League Division Five match against Wykeham 3rds on Sunday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-11 18:51:25","image_url":"https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/webimg/QVNIMTI2MzU0NDgx.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"thescarboroughnews","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sneh Rana back in India squad for Commonwealth Games - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuY3JpY2luZm8uY29tL3N0b3J5L2NvbW1vbndlYWx0aC1nYW1lcy0yMDIyLWluZGlhLXdvbWVuLXNxdWFkLXNuZWgtcmFuYS1yZXR1cm5zLXJpY2hhLWdob3NoLW5hbWVkLWFzLXN0YW5kYnktMTMyNDE0M9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sneh Rana back in India squad for Commonwealth Games  ESPNcricinfoHarmanpreet Kaur to lead India women at historic Commonwealth Games 2022  Hindustan TimesHarmanpreet Kaur to lead 15-member Indian women's squad in Commonwealth Games  Times of IndiaRana, Taniya, Harleen in India squad for Commonwealth Games | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIndia announces women’s cricket squad for Commonwealth Games  SportstarView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-11 18:44:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Fake T20 cricket league with bets from Russian bookies busted; 4 arrested","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/fake-t20-cricket-league-with-bets-from-russian-bookies-busted-4-arrested-2022-07-11-791386","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Gujarat police have very proactively hunted down and busted a gang that was conducting a fake T20 cricket tournament in Gujarat to take bets from Russian bookies by live-streaming the matches and arrested four of its members, an official said.

Key accused Shoeb Davda created an impression of an Indian Premier League ( )-like a major tournament, on a rented agricultural field and hired around 20 farm laborers and unemployed local youth to play the game wearing T-shirts of non-existent teams, Mehsana Special Operations Group (SOG) police inspector Bhavesh Rathod said. Along with Devda, the other three accused are Kolu Mohammad, Sadiq Davda, and Mohammad Sakib. Except for Sakib, all others are residents of Molipur village in Vadnagar Taluka, the police said. The police further seized cricket kits, flood lights, power generator and video cameras used for live streaming the matches, LED TVs, a laptop and some radio walkie-talkie sets all collectively worth Rs 3.21 lakh. While investigating the matter, the police further found out about a cricket betting racket involving Russian punters, a Mehsana SOG team raided a recently prepared cricket ground on the outskirts of Molipur village on July 7. The initial investigation carried out by the police revealed that it was Shoeb Davda who came up with the idea of organizing the IPL-like tournament here and taking bets from Russia-based bookies by telecasting the matches live on their YouTube channel, the official said. The fake teams in the tournament were given names like Chennai Fighters, Gandhinagar Challengers, and Palanpur Sports Kings. To play T20 cricket matches, Shoeb had hired around 20 farm laborers and local youth who would get Rs 400 per match, he said.
