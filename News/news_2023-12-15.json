The decision follows the sale of their Bayview residence for an impressive $3.55million at a mid-year auction. Since bidding farewell to his cricket career in 1980, Chappell has carved out a prominent niche as a sports journalist and cricket commentator, predominantly associated with Channel Nine. Notably, his impact on cricket is underscored by Shane Warne , who deemed Chappell the most significant influence on his career in 2006. The northern Sydney property purchased by Chappell has panoramic waterside views Chappell and his wife Barbara-Ann (pictured in 1997) snapped up the property before it went to market Chappell (pictured interviewing Allan Border) retired from his role at Channel Nine in 2022 Chappell's illustrious career has earned him prestigious accolades, including induction into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986, the FICA Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000, and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2003. Plus, in recognition of his contributions, Ian Chappell was enshrined in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame on July 9, 2009. The couple's new residence, a three-bedroom plus study penthouse located in The Elanora complex, offers breathtaking ocean views. Previously sold for $1,170,000 in 2014, the property boasts a prime location and a wraparound terrace that provides panoramic views from Pittwater to Lion Island. The Chappells initially purchased a property in the area in late 1984 for $295,000 when relocating from Neutral Bay. The recent move to Elanora Heights represents a significant downsizing decision. While the move could be considered as downsizing for Chappell and his wife, their new home is not short on room or features The living room opens out onto the water for magnificent views and breezes A modern kitchen including island is part of the open-plan property bought by the Chappells The purchase comes after the Chappells sold their previous property for $3.55million at a mid-year auction During the auction of their former Bayview abode, six registered buyers drove the final sale price $800,000 above the reserve. The property, a four-bedroom, three-bathroom house in a cul-de-sac, offered stunning views and had been in the Chappell family since the mid-1980s. Ian Chappell, now 80, had an illustrious cricket career, captaining Australia from 1971 to 1975 and playing 75 Tests for Australia between 1964 and 1980. Notably, he played a crucial role in the establishment of World Series Cricket. Aside from his cricket achievements, Chappell briefly owned a two-bedroom apartment in the Edgewater over-55s complex at Bayview, which was sold in 2020 for $1,850,000. Having retired from his four-decade-long career in commentary at Channel Nine in 2022, Ian Chappell continues to be a key figure in Australian cricket.

Khawaja and Sonny Bill Williams are both Muslim and have been vocal about the conflict, calling for an end to the deaths on both sides. Khawaja had planned to stage a peaceful protest during the first Test of the summer against Pakistan with the messages 'freedom is a human right' and 'all lives matter' written on his shoe, but was banned from doing so by the ICC. All lives are Equal! Just not when you’re a Palestinian. “Let’s be honest about it. If me saying all lives are equal has resulted in people being offended, well isn’t that the bigger problem?” 🇵🇸 https://t.co/BIgbLwbrYU — Sonny Bill Williams (@SonnyBWilliams) December 14, 2023 Khawaja wore a black armband to show his stance over the war in Gaza while batting with David Warner against Pakistan in the first Test on Thursday A planned peaceful protest on Khawaja's shoe was banned by the ICC for being too political Instead, the opening batter wore a black armband on day one in Perth to show he stands with the families who have lost loved ones in the conflict. He also shared a video message to social media, captioned: 'All Lives are Equal. Freedom is a Human right. I'm raising my voice for human rights. For a humanitarian appeal. If you see it any other way. That's on you.' Now Williams has shared that message and backed Khawaja's stance. 'All lives are Equal! Just not when you're a Palestinian. 'Let's be honest about it. If me saying all lives are equal has resulted in people being offended, well isn't that the bigger problem?' he posted. Khawaja insists his protests are not political while Sonny Bill Williams has backed his stance In the full video message, Khawaja asked those offended by his planned protest why they had become so triggered they would push for it to be banned. 'I won't say much, I don't need to, but what I do want is for everyone who did get offended, somehow, to ask yourself these questions: Is freedom not for everyone? Are all lives not equal?' he said. 'To me, personally, it doesn't matter what race, religion or culture you are. Let's be honest about it, if me saying 'All lives are equal' has offended people to the point where they're calling me up and telling me off, well isn't that a bigger problem? These people obviously don't believe in what I do, and it's obviously not a handful of people who feel this way - you'd be shocked. 'What I've written on my shoes isn't political. I'm not taking sides. Human life to me is equal. One Jewish life is equal to one Muslim life, is equal to one Hindu life, and so on. I'm just speaking up for those who don't have a voice.' Khawaja takes a moment ahead of the Perth Test after being told he could not wear the shoes with the protest message on them Khawaja stressed that his concerns were humanitarian, not politicial. 'This is close to my heart. When I see thousands of innocent children die without any repercussions or remorse, I imagine my two girls - what if this was them? No-one chooses where they're born - and then I see the world turn their backs on them, my heart can't take it. 'I already feel my life wasn't equal to others when I was growing up, but luckily for me I never lived in a world where that inequality was life or death. 'The ICC have told me I can't wear my shoes on the field as they believe it's a political statement under their guidelines. I don't believe it's so, it's a humanitarian appeal. 'I will respect their view and decision, but I will fight it and seek to gain approval. Freedom is a human right.'

Resta il fatto che a Bergamo e in Inghilterra la squadra schierata era migliore di quella avversaria, ma contro i nerazzurri questa non è mai parsa verità e contro gli inglesi (pure rimaneggiati e in altre grane recenti) per almeno un'ora i rossoneri hanno fatto fatica a mettere insieme due passaggi di fila e creare un'occasione. Poi è vero, sono arrivati 2 gol, 2 pali e una reazione dettata anche e soprattutto dai cambi (a proposito di panchina lunga...), ma è assolutamente necessario ritrovare alla svelta quella fluidità di gioco, quell'entusiasmo, quell'organizzazione che avevano portato il Milan in testa alla classifica dopo 8 giornate, facendo pensare che davvero il mercato avesse rinforzato la squadra. Oggi Lofutus, Musah e Reijnders - premiato dall'Uefa come MVP al St. James's Park, devo essermi perso qualcosa - hanno abbassato i rifornimenti offensivi e la protezione a un reparto difensivo reinventato con Theo centrale e Florenzi a sinistra. Dettaglio non indifferente quest'ultimo: fa piegare la nave su un fianco nonostante la disponibilità di Hernandez e l'abnegazione di Alessandro, che sbaglia più spesso la scelta e la giocata rispetto a quando sta nel suo (ed è sistematicamente tra i migliori). Il Milan resta tremendamente fragile: come scrivevo una settimana fa, manca una leadership riconosciuta in mezzo al campo. Maignan, Tomori e Giroud (in parte lo stesso Florenzi) gridano, spronano, incoraggiano, ma è là nel centro che serve come il pane Bennacer che con il gioco, prima che con le frustate, dia ordine e personalità a una squadra che tende a sfaldarsi al primo alito di vento. E' in campo, in partita, a Milanello che deve avvenire la svolta. Non saranno Ibra né il mercato di gennaio, per quanto importante per dare un aiuto alla rosa, a determinare il cambio di rotta. Zlatan arriva accompagnato da un minuzioso, esteso comunicato che ben definisce le sue alte responsabilità. I suoi ritorni da giocatore prima e da dirigente poi - conoscendo il suo carattere, le sue ambizioni - certificano che un progetto di alto profilo sia in atto come pensavo con la presenza di Paolo Maldini. Ora deve tradursi nei fatti che sono ritrovare la competitività in Italia e in Europa, oltre allo stadio nuovo: in EL la storia, il dovere, i tifosi impongono che si arrivi fino in fondo. Fino a Dublino. E per favore quest'anno si tenga nel mirino anche la farsesca Coppa Italia: diventa una cosa un po' più seria solo dalla semifinale in poi, quindi arrivarci dev'essere un obiettivo. Non è con i soldi, con il mercato, che si vince, anche se aiutano molto. E' con un progetto che si insegue un traguardo. Il Chelsea spende vagonate di sterline da 3 stagioni: balbetta in Premier, è fuori dall'Europa e dodicesimo in campionato, cambia più allenatori che calzettoni. Non parliamo dello United: sesto in campionato, malamente scaraventato fuori dall'Europa. Senza l'omaggio del rigore alle penultima del girone, il miliardario PSG a sua volta sarebbe out dalla Champions dove colleziona da anni brutte figure. Il piccolo Girona è in testa alla Liga. Lo stesso Milan, secondo nel 2021, campione nel 2022, semifinalista di Champions nel 2023, ha parametri di budget rigorosi e chissà dove sarebbe se facesse debiti su debiti o trasgredisse i paletti del FairPlay... Più dei soldi contano le idee, la competenza, la logica. L'ambiente ha bisogno di avere coesione, serenità, ordine. Deve ritrovare fiducia, continuità, ferocia. Non è utopia: aveva tutto a settembre e ottobre, ha perso le chiavi dopo la prima sosta. Ibra aiuterà senza bacchetta magica, ma con orgoglio, autorevolezza e carisma. E' una risorsa, non un problema né tanto meno una minaccia. Dissento, per una volta, da un’analisi a ritroso degli amici del gruppo “I Casciavit”: non è vero e non è giusto dire oggi che le semifinali di Champions nella scorsa stagione sono state un caso fortuito: il Milan disputò le 2 ultime gare del girone e le 4 con Tottenham e Napoli in maniera superba, tra l’altro senza subire gol se non quello ininfluente di Osimhen all’ultimo secondo della sesta gara. Una partita può essere fortunata, un gol, un episodio, ma non un intero cammino. Lasciate credere ad altri che lo scudetto fu figlio dell’errore di Radu a Bologna: su questa sponda sappiamo benissimo, invece, che la sorte nello sport segue il karma e le energie, sono conseguenza di come stai, cosa fai e quanto vali. Per tutte queste cose i rossoneri hanno strameritato di arrivare dove sono arrivati 8 mesi fa, meritano di andare in EL adesso. Ma non facciamo confusione. Nel frattempo, il Milan Football and Cricket Club compie 124 anni: auguri vecchio cuore rossonero, plasmato dall’anima e non da una fedifraga costoletta.","pubDate":"2023-12-14 23:05:08","image_url":"https://net-storage.tcccdn.com/storage/milannews.it/img_notizie/thumb3/1d/1d868a7906650c6fd702de354ad2d1ef-97265-oooz0000.jpeg","source_id":"milannews","source_priority":519547,"country":["italy"],"category":["sports"],"language":"italian"},{"article_id":"61df916c512d9283c48764eabe8ae722","title":"Matthew Mott seeks response from England after losing second T20 in West Indies","link":"https://www.bordercountiesadvertizer.co.uk/sport/national/23991177.matthew-mott-seeks-response-england-losing-second-t20-west-indies/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sam Curran made amends after being thumped for 30 in an over, with 50 off 32 balls, having been elevated to number four in the batting order.","content":"Sam Curran made amends after being thumped for 30 in an over, hit for four sixes and a four by Windies captain Rovman Powell, with 50 off 32 balls, having been elevated to number four in the batting order. While there were several cameos, Curran lacked support as England fell 10 runs short of overhauling their opponents’ 176 for seven to fall 2-0 down in the five-match series after losing the ODIs 2-1. Defeat by 10 runs, West Indies 2-0 up in the series. — England Cricket (@englandcricket) The tourists struggled against left-arm spinners Gudakesh Motie and Akeal Hosein, who leaked a combined 33 in eight overs. Motie was especially successful, taking 4-0-9-1 on a tricky pitch to bat on. “No one likes losing,” said Mott. “We played good cricket again for 90 per cent of the match. We had them under control up to the 15th-over mark and unfortunately, as West Indies can do, they hurt us. “We fought back at the back end to keep them to 176 which was definitely chase-able. It’s light and shade with our batting, there’s some really good things happening but probably just too many dot balls. “We have to respond from this. We will try to come up with more solutions. We are trying hard, we are close. We are a couple of good hits away from a win. “The message in the changing room is that we are not far away. We just have to stay the course. We’ve got to win one first. That’s our first target.” Curran averaged 11 from 26 previous T20 innings, albeit having only once before batted in the top five, but he has three Test fifties and sparkled with an unbeaten 95 in an ODI against India in 2021. It was still a surprise to see him stride out after Phil Salt was England’s second batter dismissed, with Liam Livingstone, Harry Brook and Moeen Ali each nudged down one position. Curran, though, was the pick of the batters and uncorked seven boundaries – including three sixes – and Mott revealed his promotion was down to how they thought he would fare against Hosein and Motie. “He didn’t seem to get a heap of strike, it’s funny how it works out and he ended up taking down the medium-pacers,” said Mott, who added it was a “50-50 call” about whether to elevate Curran or Moeen. “We just thought Sam was the one to try and really disrupt and get a free licence to go and go hard. He did it, not in the fashion we were expecting but he certainly did his job. “We’ve always rated his batting and he’s been in some strong teams, as he showed. When he gets an opportunity, he’s a class player. He’s worked really hard on facing fast bowling. “He’s got a great all-round game. We know he can hurt the spinners a lot but there’s certainly more layers to his batting which is exciting for the future. It was unfortunate he got out when he did.” Brandon King's 82 helps West Indies take a 2-0 lead in the T20I series against England. | 📝 — ICC (@ICC) The Windies belted 13 sixes to England’s eight, with opener Brandon King and Powell sharing five apiece. King anchored the Windies innings with 82 off 52 balls and Powell registered 50 off 28. Assessing Curran’s more ignominious offering on Thursday, Mott added: “When they line you up, it’s a tough place to be. “Every time you clear the rope it’s a big win, particularly early in an over. It’s something we have spoken about and we have got some really good six hitters ourselves.” Powell was on a run-a-ball 22 at the start of the 16th over having been kept quiet by Adil Rashid, who took 4-0-11-2, but followed up a streaky inside edge off Curran with some monstrous hits. Jacqueline Williams, who became the first female umpire from the Caribbean to stand in a men’s T20 international, raised her arms skywards on four occasions before Powell ended the over by holing out. “It definitely changed the game,” Powell reflected. “As a batter you sometimes look for that over. “After being pegged down by the leg-spinners and then the pacer comes on, you think ‘maybe this is the opportunity to cash in’.”","pubDate":"2023-12-14 23:02:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"bordercountiesadvertiser","source_priority":98087,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"db890716aabed3535505163aeffd25ee","title":"Rohit Sharma on disappointment of losing World Cup final","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/12/15/rohit-sharma-on-disappointment-of-losing-world-cup-final/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["KR Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"‘I had no idea how to come back from this.

The first few days I didn’t know what to do’ New Delhi: Rohit Sharma said that it took a while for him to move on from the disappointment of not winning the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup final but the empathetic reaction from fans he has met has helped him heal. Rohit, speaking on the official Instagram account run by his team, said that he found it hard to digest the fact that his team fell short of winning what he felt was the ultimate prize in cricket. “I had no idea how to come back from this. The first few days I didn’t know what to do. My family, and my friends kept me going. kept things pretty light around me, which was quite helpful. It wasn’t easy to digest, but life moves on. Honestly, it was tough,” said the Indian captain. India won 10 matches on the trot, and most of them rather comprehensively, before eventually falling short against Australia in the final played on 19 November at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The brand of cricket that India played during the tournament was impressive to see but Pat Cummins and Co got the better of them on the day when it mattered the most. “I thought we did everything we could from our side. If someone asked me what went wrong? Because we won 10 games. And in those 10 games, yes, we made mistakes, but that happens in every game that you play. You cannot have a perfect game, you can have a near-perfect game but you cannot have a perfect game. If I look on the other side of it, I am proud of the team as well, because how we played was simply outstanding. You don’t get to perform like that every World Cup, you know. And I’m pretty sure at least how we played at least up until that finals, it would have given people a lot of joy, a lot of pride watching the team play,” Rohit said. The Indian captain set an aggressive tone for the side when opening the batting, opting for going hard in the first powerplay pretty much all through the tournament. That laid the platform for the likes of Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, and Shreyas Iyer to take India to match-winning scores. Rohit said that he wanted to take a break after the World Cup to clear his head but it has been pleasing to see how the fans have reacted to the defeat, feeling pride at the winning run his team put together. “After that final, it was very hard to get back and start moving on. Which is why I decided that I need to go somewhere and just get my mind out of this,” the 36-year-old said. “But then, wherever I was, I realised that people were coming up to me and they were appreciating everyone’s effort, how well we played. I feel for all of them right because they, along with us, were dreaming of lifting that World Cup. Everywhere we went during this entire World Cup campaign, there was so much support from everyone you know who came to the stadium firstly, and then people who were watching it from home as well. I want to appreciate what people have done for us in that one and a half months. But again, if I think more and more about that, I just feel quite disappointed that we were not able to go through all the way.” Rohit, who was not selected for the 2011 World Cup and has spoken about how big a turning point it was for his career, said that it was disappointing to come this close to lifting the trophy. “I’ve always grown up watching 50-over World Cup. And to me, that was, you know, the ultimate prize, so we’ve worked all these years, you know, for that. And it is disappointing, right? If you don’t get through it, and you don’t get what you want, what you have been looking for all this while, what you were dreaming of… you get disappointed and you get frustrated as well at times,” he said. But people coming up to him to tell they were very proud of the team made him feel good to a certain extent, the Mumbaikar said. “And along with them, I was healing as well.” While he has opted for a break during the ongoing white-ball leg of the South Africa tour, it is not yet clear if Rohit will lead India at next year’s T20 World Cup, in a format that he has not played in since the last edition in Australia. “Because I felt ‘okay, you know, this is the kind of thing that you want to hear. When you meet people, when they understand what the player must be going through, and when they know these kinds of things, and not to bring out that frustration, that anger… it means a lot. For me, definitely, it meant a lot because there was no anger. It was just pure love from the people that I met. And it was wonderful to see that. So you know it gives you the motivation to get back and start working again and look for another ultimate prize,” he signed off.

Under Operation Sadhbhavana, the same was organised wherein six teams participated in the inaugural edition. Army continued its efforts to motivate more participants and in 2022, the number of teams increased to 14. Seeing the enthusiasm, ASEEM Foundation, a Pune based NGO working for youth and women empowerment in the border regions of India, proposed an idea of conducting practice and exhibition matches for selected girl cricket players at Pune. In 2023, while conducting the yearly championship, 16 girls were selected for a tour to Pune. These girls were then trained by resident players and an Op Sadhbhavana project was sought for their kiting and move from Kupwara to Pune and Back. Accordingly, a team of 16 players along with Officer in Charge (Women Officer ), JCO-IC, two NCOs (NA and Coach) were flagged off from Patahiri Garrison on 12 Dec 23 for a 14 days tour with effect from 15 to 24 Dec 2023. The team met Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi, AVSM, GOC-in-C, Northern Command on 14 Dec 23 and proceeded to Jammu for their onward journey to Pune. The Army Commander complimented the team members for their selection and exhorted them to imbibe the sportswoman spirit in their everyday endeavours. During their tour, the players will get an opportunity to play matches at National level Stadiums besides interacting with National and Ranji Players. The highlight would be witnessing Ind – Aus Match at Mumbai and local sight-seeing.

The decision follows the sale of their Bayview residence for an impressive $3.55million at a mid-year auction. Since bidding farewell to his cricket career in 1980, Chappell has carved out a prominent niche as a sports journalist and cricket commentator, predominantly associated with Channel Nine. Notably, his impact on cricket is underscored by Shane Warne , who deemed Chappell the most significant influence on his career in 2006. The northern Sydney property purchased by Chappell has panoramic waterside views Chappell and his wife Barbara-Ann (pictured in 1997) snapped up the property before it went to market Chappell (pictured interviewing Allan Border) retired from his role at Channel Nine in 2022 Chappell's illustrious career has earned him prestigious accolades, including induction into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986, the FICA Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000, and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2003. Plus, in recognition of his contributions, Ian Chappell was enshrined in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame on July 9, 2009. The couple's new residence, a three-bedroom plus study penthouse located in The Elanora complex, offers breathtaking ocean views. Previously sold for $1,170,000 in 2014, the property boasts a prime location and a wraparound terrace that provides panoramic views from Pittwater to Lion Island. The Chappells initially purchased a property in the area in late 1984 for $295,000 when relocating from Neutral Bay. The recent move to Elanora Heights represents a significant downsizing decision. While the move could be considered as downsizing for Chappell and his wife, their new home is not short on room or features The living room opens out onto the water for magnificent views and breezes A modern kitchen including island is part of the open-plan property bought by the Chappells The purchase comes after the Chappells sold their previous property for $3.55million at a mid-year auction During the auction of their former Bayview abode, six registered buyers drove the final sale price $800,000 above the reserve. The property, a four-bedroom, three-bathroom house in a cul-de-sac, offered stunning views and had been in the Chappell family since the mid-1980s. Ian Chappell, now 80, had an illustrious cricket career, captaining Australia from 1971 to 1975 and playing 75 Tests for Australia between 1964 and 1980. Notably, he played a crucial role in the establishment of World Series Cricket. Aside from his cricket achievements, Chappell briefly owned a two-bedroom apartment in the Edgewater over-55s complex at Bayview, which was sold in 2020 for $1,850,000. Having retired from his four-decade-long career in commentary at Channel Nine in 2022, Ian Chappell continues to be a key figure in Australian cricket.

Khawaja and Sonny Bill Williams are both Muslim and have been vocal about the conflict, calling for an end to the deaths on both sides. Khawaja had planned to stage a peaceful protest during the first Test of the summer against Pakistan with the messages 'freedom is a human right' and 'all lives matter' written on his shoe, but was banned from doing so by the ICC. All lives are Equal! Just not when you’re a Palestinian. “Let’s be honest about it. If me saying all lives are equal has resulted in people being offended, well isn’t that the bigger problem?” 🇵🇸 https://t.co/BIgbLwbrYU — Sonny Bill Williams (@SonnyBWilliams) December 14, 2023 Khawaja wore a black armband to show his stance over the war in Gaza while batting with David Warner against Pakistan in the first Test on Thursday A planned peaceful protest on Khawaja's shoe was banned by the ICC for being too political Instead, the opening batter wore a black armband on day one in Perth to show he stands with the families who have lost loved ones in the conflict. He also shared a video message to social media, captioned: 'All Lives are Equal. Freedom is a Human right. I'm raising my voice for human rights. For a humanitarian appeal. If you see it any other way. That's on you.' Now Williams has shared that message and backed Khawaja's stance. 'All lives are Equal! Just not when you're a Palestinian. 'Let's be honest about it. If me saying all lives are equal has resulted in people being offended, well isn't that the bigger problem?' he posted. Khawaja insists his protests are not political while Sonny Bill Williams has backed his stance In the full video message, Khawaja asked those offended by his planned protest why they had become so triggered they would push for it to be banned. 'I won't say much, I don't need to, but what I do want is for everyone who did get offended, somehow, to ask yourself these questions: Is freedom not for everyone? Are all lives not equal?' he said. 'To me, personally, it doesn't matter what race, religion or culture you are. Let's be honest about it, if me saying 'All lives are equal' has offended people to the point where they're calling me up and telling me off, well isn't that a bigger problem? These people obviously don't believe in what I do, and it's obviously not a handful of people who feel this way - you'd be shocked. 'What I've written on my shoes isn't political. I'm not taking sides. Human life to me is equal. One Jewish life is equal to one Muslim life, is equal to one Hindu life, and so on. I'm just speaking up for those who don't have a voice.' Khawaja takes a moment ahead of the Perth Test after being told he could not wear the shoes with the protest message on them Khawaja stressed that his concerns were humanitarian, not politicial. 'This is close to my heart. When I see thousands of innocent children die without any repercussions or remorse, I imagine my two girls - what if this was them? No-one chooses where they're born - and then I see the world turn their backs on them, my heart can't take it. 'I already feel my life wasn't equal to others when I was growing up, but luckily for me I never lived in a world where that inequality was life or death. 'The ICC have told me I can't wear my shoes on the field as they believe it's a political statement under their guidelines. I don't believe it's so, it's a humanitarian appeal. 'I will respect their view and decision, but I will fight it and seek to gain approval. Freedom is a human right.'

Ognuno è libero di riferire l'eliminazione dalla Champions agli episodi che più gli sembrano significativi: gli errori in attacco nelle prime 2 partite, l'espulsione di Thiaw con il Borussia, il rigore regalato al PSG allo scadere della gara col Newcastle (ignorare il FairPlay Uefa non incide), ma personalmente resto dell'idea che con un limitato numero di infortuni le cose sarebbero andate diversamente, fino ad oggi anche in campionato. Resta il fatto che a Bergamo e in Inghilterra la squadra schierata era migliore di quella avversaria, ma contro i nerazzurri questa non è mai parsa verità e contro gli inglesi (pure rimaneggiati e in altre grane recenti) per almeno un'ora i rossoneri hanno fatto fatica a mettere insieme due passaggi di fila e creare un'occasione. Poi è vero, sono arrivati 2 gol, 2 pali e una reazione dettata anche e soprattutto dai cambi (a proposito di panchina lunga...), ma è assolutamente necessario ritrovare alla svelta quella fluidità di gioco, quell'entusiasmo, quell'organizzazione che avevano portato il Milan in testa alla classifica dopo 8 giornate, facendo pensare che davvero il mercato avesse rinforzato la squadra. Oggi Lofutus, Musah e Reijnders - premiato dall'Uefa come MVP al St. James's Park, devo essermi perso qualcosa - hanno abbassato i rifornimenti offensivi e la protezione a un reparto difensivo reinventato con Theo centrale e Florenzi a sinistra. Dettaglio non indifferente quest'ultimo: fa piegare la nave su un fianco nonostante la disponibilità di Hernandez e l'abnegazione di Alessandro, che sbaglia più spesso la scelta e la giocata rispetto a quando sta nel suo (ed è sistematicamente tra i migliori). Il Milan resta tremendamente fragile: come scrivevo una settimana fa, manca una leadership riconosciuta in mezzo al campo. Maignan, Tomori e Giroud (in parte lo stesso Florenzi) gridano, spronano, incoraggiano, ma è là nel centro che serve come il pane Bennacer che con il gioco, prima che con le frustate, dia ordine e personalità a una squadra che tende a sfaldarsi al primo alito di vento. E' in campo, in partita, a Milanello che deve avvenire la svolta. Non saranno Ibra né il mercato di gennaio, per quanto importante per dare un aiuto alla rosa, a determinare il cambio di rotta. Zlatan arriva accompagnato da un minuzioso, esteso comunicato che ben definisce le sue alte responsabilità. I suoi ritorni da giocatore prima e da dirigente poi - conoscendo il suo carattere, le sue ambizioni - certificano che un progetto di alto profilo sia in atto come pensavo con la presenza di Paolo Maldini. Ora deve tradursi nei fatti che sono ritrovare la competitività in Italia e in Europa, oltre allo stadio nuovo: in EL la storia, il dovere, i tifosi impongono che si arrivi fino in fondo. Fino a Dublino. E per favore quest'anno si tenga nel mirino anche la farsesca Coppa Italia: diventa una cosa un po' più seria solo dalla semifinale in poi, quindi arrivarci dev'essere un obiettivo. Non è con i soldi, con il mercato, che si vince, anche se aiutano molto. E' con un progetto che si insegue un traguardo. Il Chelsea spende vagonate di sterline da 3 stagioni: balbetta in Premier, è fuori dall'Europa e dodicesimo in campionato, cambia più allenatori che calzettoni. Non parliamo dello United: sesto in campionato, malamente scaraventato fuori dall'Europa. Senza l'omaggio del rigore alle penultima del girone, il miliardario PSG a sua volta sarebbe out dalla Champions dove colleziona da anni brutte figure. Il piccolo Girona è in testa alla Liga. Lo stesso Milan, secondo nel 2021, campione nel 2022, semifinalista di Champions nel 2023, ha parametri di budget rigorosi e chissà dove sarebbe se facesse debiti su debiti o trasgredisse i paletti del FairPlay... Più dei soldi contano le idee, la competenza, la logica. L'ambiente ha bisogno di avere coesione, serenità, ordine. Deve ritrovare fiducia, continuità, ferocia. Non è utopia: aveva tutto a settembre e ottobre, ha perso le chiavi dopo la prima sosta. Ibra aiuterà senza bacchetta magica, ma con orgoglio, autorevolezza e carisma. E' una risorsa, non un problema né tanto meno una minaccia. Dissento, per una volta, da un’analisi a ritroso degli amici del gruppo “I Casciavit”: non è vero e non è giusto dire oggi che le semifinali di Champions nella scorsa stagione sono state un caso fortuito: il Milan disputò le 2 ultime gare del girone e le 4 con Tottenham e Napoli in maniera superba, tra l’altro senza subire gol se non quello ininfluente di Osimhen all’ultimo secondo della sesta gara. Una partita può essere fortunata, un gol, un episodio, ma non un intero cammino. Lasciate credere ad altri che lo scudetto fu figlio dell’errore di Radu a Bologna: su questa sponda sappiamo benissimo, invece, che la sorte nello sport segue il karma e le energie, sono conseguenza di come stai, cosa fai e quanto vali. Per tutte queste cose i rossoneri hanno strameritato di arrivare dove sono arrivati 8 mesi fa, meritano di andare in EL adesso. Ma non facciamo confusione. Nel frattempo, il Milan Football and Cricket Club compie 124 anni: auguri vecchio cuore rossonero, plasmato dall’anima e non da una fedifraga costoletta.","pubDate":"2023-12-14 23:05:08","image_url":"https://net-storage.tcccdn.com/storage/milannews.it/img_notizie/thumb3/1d/1d868a7906650c6fd702de354ad2d1ef-97265-oooz0000.jpeg","source_id":"milannews","source_priority":519547,"country":["italy"],"category":["sports"],"language":"italian"},{"article_id":"61df916c512d9283c48764eabe8ae722","title":"Matthew Mott seeks response from England after losing second T20 in West Indies","link":"https://www.bordercountiesadvertizer.co.uk/sport/national/23991177.matthew-mott-seeks-response-england-losing-second-t20-west-indies/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sam Curran made amends after being thumped for 30 in an over, with 50 off 32 balls, having been elevated to number four in the batting order.","content":"Sam Curran made amends after being thumped for 30 in an over, hit for four sixes and a four by Windies captain Rovman Powell, with 50 off 32 balls, having been elevated to number four in the batting order.

Defeat by 10 runs, West Indies 2-0 up in the series. — England Cricket (@englandcricket) The tourists struggled against left-arm spinners Gudakesh Motie and Akeal Hosein, who leaked a combined 33 in eight overs. Motie was especially successful, taking 4-0-9-1 on a tricky pitch to bat on. “No one likes losing,” said Mott. “We played good cricket again for 90 per cent of the match. We had them under control up to the 15th-over mark and unfortunately, as West Indies can do, they hurt us. “We fought back at the back end to keep them to 176 which was definitely chase-able. It’s light and shade with our batting, there’s some really good things happening but probably just too many dot balls. “We have to respond from this. We will try to come up with more solutions. We are trying hard, we are close. We are a couple of good hits away from a win. “The message in the changing room is that we are not far away. We just have to stay the course. We’ve got to win one first. That’s our first target.” Curran averaged 11 from 26 previous T20 innings, albeit having only once before batted in the top five, but he has three Test fifties and sparkled with an unbeaten 95 in an ODI against India in 2021. It was still a surprise to see him stride out after Phil Salt was England’s second batter dismissed, with Liam Livingstone, Harry Brook and Moeen Ali each nudged down one position. Curran, though, was the pick of the batters and uncorked seven boundaries – including three sixes – and Mott revealed his promotion was down to how they thought he would fare against Hosein and Motie. “He didn’t seem to get a heap of strike, it’s funny how it works out and he ended up taking down the medium-pacers,” said Mott, who added it was a “50-50 call” about whether to elevate Curran or Moeen. “We just thought Sam was the one to try and really disrupt and get a free licence to go and go hard. He did it, not in the fashion we were expecting but he certainly did his job. “We’ve always rated his batting and he’s been in some strong teams, as he showed. When he gets an opportunity, he’s a class player. He’s worked really hard on facing fast bowling. “He’s got a great all-round game. We know he can hurt the spinners a lot but there’s certainly more layers to his batting which is exciting for the future. It was unfortunate he got out when he did.” Brandon King's 82 helps West Indies take a 2-0 lead in the T20I series against England. | 📝 — ICC (@ICC) The Windies belted 13 sixes to England’s eight, with opener Brandon King and Powell sharing five apiece. King anchored the Windies innings with 82 off 52 balls and Powell registered 50 off 28. Assessing Curran’s more ignominious offering on Thursday, Mott added: “When they line you up, it’s a tough place to be. “Every time you clear the rope it’s a big win, particularly early in an over. It’s something we have spoken about and we have got some really good six hitters ourselves.” Powell was on a run-a-ball 22 at the start of the 16th over having been kept quiet by Adil Rashid, who took 4-0-11-2, but followed up a streaky inside edge off Curran with some monstrous hits. Jacqueline Williams, who became the first female umpire from the Caribbean to stand in a men’s T20 international, raised her arms skywards on four occasions before Powell ended the over by holing out. “It definitely changed the game,” Powell reflected. “As a batter you sometimes look for that over. “After being pegged down by the leg-spinners and then the pacer comes on, you think ‘maybe this is the opportunity to cash in’.”","pubDate":"2023-12-14 23:02:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"bordercountiesadvertiser","source_priority":98087,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"db890716aabed3535505163aeffd25ee","title":"Rohit Sharma on disappointment of losing World Cup final","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/12/15/rohit-sharma-on-disappointment-of-losing-world-cup-final/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["KR Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"‘I had no idea how to come back from this.

The first few days I didn’t know what to do’ New Delhi: Rohit Sharma said that it took a while for him to move on from the disappointment of not winning the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup final but the empathetic reaction from fans he has met has helped him heal. Rohit, speaking on the official Instagram account run by his team, said that he found it hard to digest the fact that his team fell short of winning what he felt was the ultimate prize in cricket. “I had no idea how to come back from this. The first few days I didn’t know what to do. My family, and my friends kept me going. kept things pretty light around me, which was quite helpful. It wasn’t easy to digest, but life moves on. Honestly, it was tough,” said the Indian captain. India won 10 matches on the trot, and most of them rather comprehensively, before eventually falling short against Australia in the final played on 19 November at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The brand of cricket that India played during the tournament was impressive to see but Pat Cummins and Co got the better of them on the day when it mattered the most. “I thought we did everything we could from our side. If someone asked me what went wrong? Because we won 10 games. And in those 10 games, yes, we made mistakes, but that happens in every game that you play. You cannot have a perfect game, you can have a near-perfect game but you cannot have a perfect game. If I look on the other side of it, I am proud of the team as well, because how we played was simply outstanding. You don’t get to perform like that every World Cup, you know. And I’m pretty sure at least how we played at least up until that finals, it would have given people a lot of joy, a lot of pride watching the team play,” Rohit said. The Indian captain set an aggressive tone for the side when opening the batting, opting for going hard in the first powerplay pretty much all through the tournament. That laid the platform for the likes of Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, and Shreyas Iyer to take India to match-winning scores. Rohit said that he wanted to take a break after the World Cup to clear his head but it has been pleasing to see how the fans have reacted to the defeat, feeling pride at the winning run his team put together. “After that final, it was very hard to get back and start moving on. Which is why I decided that I need to go somewhere and just get my mind out of this,” the 36-year-old said. “But then, wherever I was, I realised that people were coming up to me and they were appreciating everyone’s effort, how well we played. I feel for all of them right because they, along with us, were dreaming of lifting that World Cup. Everywhere we went during this entire World Cup campaign, there was so much support from everyone you know who came to the stadium firstly, and then people who were watching it from home as well. I want to appreciate what people have done for us in that one and a half months. But again, if I think more and more about that, I just feel quite disappointed that we were not able to go through all the way.” Rohit, who was not selected for the 2011 World Cup and has spoken about how big a turning point it was for his career, said that it was disappointing to come this close to lifting the trophy. “I’ve always grown up watching 50-over World Cup. And to me, that was, you know, the ultimate prize, so we’ve worked all these years, you know, for that. And it is disappointing, right? If you don’t get through it, and you don’t get what you want, what you have been looking for all this while, what you were dreaming of… you get disappointed and you get frustrated as well at times,” he said. But people coming up to him to tell they were very proud of the team made him feel good to a certain extent, the Mumbaikar said. “And along with them, I was healing as well.” While he has opted for a break during the ongoing white-ball leg of the South Africa tour, it is not yet clear if Rohit will lead India at next year’s T20 World Cup, in a format that he has not played in since the last edition in Australia. “Because I felt ‘okay, you know, this is the kind of thing that you want to hear. When you meet people, when they understand what the player must be going through, and when they know these kinds of things, and not to bring out that frustration, that anger… it means a lot. For me, definitely, it meant a lot because there was no anger. It was just pure love from the people that I met. And it was wonderful to see that. So you know it gives you the motivation to get back and start working again and look for another ultimate prize,” he signed off.

Under Operation Sadhbhavana, the same was organised wherein six teams participated in the inaugural edition. Army continued its efforts to motivate more participants and in 2022, the number of teams increased to 14. Seeing the enthusiasm, ASEEM Foundation, a Pune based NGO working for youth and women empowerment in the border regions of India, proposed an idea of conducting practice and exhibition matches for selected girl cricket players at Pune. In 2023, while conducting the yearly championship, 16 girls were selected for a tour to Pune. These girls were then trained by resident players and an Op Sadhbhavana project was sought for their kiting and move from Kupwara to Pune and Back. Accordingly, a team of 16 players along with Officer in Charge (Women Officer ), JCO-IC, two NCOs (NA and Coach) were flagged off from Patahiri Garrison on 12 Dec 23 for a 14 days tour with effect from 15 to 24 Dec 2023. The team met Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi, AVSM, GOC-in-C, Northern Command on 14 Dec 23 and proceeded to Jammu for their onward journey to Pune. The Army Commander complimented the team members for their selection and exhorted them to imbibe the sportswoman spirit in their everyday endeavours. During their tour, the players will get an opportunity to play matches at National level Stadiums besides interacting with National and Ranji Players. The highlight would be witnessing Ind – Aus Match at Mumbai and local sight-seeing.

The decision follows the sale of their Bayview residence for an impressive $3.55million at a mid-year auction. Since bidding farewell to his cricket career in 1980, Chappell has carved out a prominent niche as a sports journalist and cricket commentator, predominantly associated with Channel Nine. Notably, his impact on cricket is underscored by Shane Warne , who deemed Chappell the most significant influence on his career in 2006. The northern Sydney property purchased by Chappell has panoramic waterside views Chappell and his wife Barbara-Ann (pictured in 1997) snapped up the property before it went to market Chappell (pictured interviewing Allan Border) retired from his role at Channel Nine in 2022 Chappell's illustrious career has earned him prestigious accolades, including induction into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986, the FICA Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000, and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2003. Plus, in recognition of his contributions, Ian Chappell was enshrined in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame on July 9, 2009. The couple's new residence, a three-bedroom plus study penthouse located in The Elanora complex, offers breathtaking ocean views. Previously sold for $1,170,000 in 2014, the property boasts a prime location and a wraparound terrace that provides panoramic views from Pittwater to Lion Island. The Chappells initially purchased a property in the area in late 1984 for $295,000 when relocating from Neutral Bay. The recent move to Elanora Heights represents a significant downsizing decision. While the move could be considered as downsizing for Chappell and his wife, their new home is not short on room or features The living room opens out onto the water for magnificent views and breezes A modern kitchen including island is part of the open-plan property bought by the Chappells The purchase comes after the Chappells sold their previous property for $3.55million at a mid-year auction During the auction of their former Bayview abode, six registered buyers drove the final sale price $800,000 above the reserve. The property, a four-bedroom, three-bathroom house in a cul-de-sac, offered stunning views and had been in the Chappell family since the mid-1980s. Ian Chappell, now 80, had an illustrious cricket career, captaining Australia from 1971 to 1975 and playing 75 Tests for Australia between 1964 and 1980. Notably, he played a crucial role in the establishment of World Series Cricket. Aside from his cricket achievements, Chappell briefly owned a two-bedroom apartment in the Edgewater over-55s complex at Bayview, which was sold in 2020 for $1,850,000. Having retired from his four-decade-long career in commentary at Channel Nine in 2022, Ian Chappell continues to be a key figure in Australian cricket.

Khawaja and Sonny Bill Williams are both Muslim and have been vocal about the conflict, calling for an end to the deaths on both sides. Khawaja had planned to stage a peaceful protest during the first Test of the summer against Pakistan with the messages 'freedom is a human right' and 'all lives matter' written on his shoe, but was banned from doing so by the ICC. All lives are Equal! Just not when you’re a Palestinian. “Let’s be honest about it. If me saying all lives are equal has resulted in people being offended, well isn’t that the bigger problem?” 🇵🇸 https://t.co/BIgbLwbrYU — Sonny Bill Williams (@SonnyBWilliams) December 14, 2023 Khawaja wore a black armband to show his stance over the war in Gaza while batting with David Warner against Pakistan in the first Test on Thursday A planned peaceful protest on Khawaja's shoe was banned by the ICC for being too political Instead, the opening batter wore a black armband on day one in Perth to show he stands with the families who have lost loved ones in the conflict. He also shared a video message to social media, captioned: 'All Lives are Equal. Freedom is a Human right. I'm raising my voice for human rights. For a humanitarian appeal. If you see it any other way. That's on you.' Now Williams has shared that message and backed Khawaja's stance. 'All lives are Equal! Just not when you're a Palestinian. 'Let's be honest about it. If me saying all lives are equal has resulted in people being offended, well isn't that the bigger problem?' he posted. Khawaja insists his protests are not political while Sonny Bill Williams has backed his stance In the full video message, Khawaja asked those offended by his planned protest why they had become so triggered they would push for it to be banned. 'I won't say much, I don't need to, but what I do want is for everyone who did get offended, somehow, to ask yourself these questions: Is freedom not for everyone? Are all lives not equal?' he said. 'To me, personally, it doesn't matter what race, religion or culture you are. Let's be honest about it, if me saying 'All lives are equal' has offended people to the point where they're calling me up and telling me off, well isn't that a bigger problem? These people obviously don't believe in what I do, and it's obviously not a handful of people who feel this way - you'd be shocked. 'What I've written on my shoes isn't political. I'm not taking sides. Human life to me is equal. One Jewish life is equal to one Muslim life, is equal to one Hindu life, and so on. I'm just speaking up for those who don't have a voice.' Khawaja takes a moment ahead of the Perth Test after being told he could not wear the shoes with the protest message on them Khawaja stressed that his concerns were humanitarian, not politicial. 'This is close to my heart. When I see thousands of innocent children die without any repercussions or remorse, I imagine my two girls - what if this was them? No-one chooses where they're born - and then I see the world turn their backs on them, my heart can't take it. 'I already feel my life wasn't equal to others when I was growing up, but luckily for me I never lived in a world where that inequality was life or death. 'The ICC have told me I can't wear my shoes on the field as they believe it's a political statement under their guidelines. I don't believe it's so, it's a humanitarian appeal. 'I will respect their view and decision, but I will fight it and seek to gain approval. Freedom is a human right.'

Ognuno è libero di riferire l'eliminazione dalla Champions agli episodi che più gli sembrano significativi: gli errori in attacco nelle prime 2 partite, l'espulsione di Thiaw con il Borussia, il rigore regalato al PSG allo scadere della gara col Newcastle (ignorare il FairPlay Uefa non incide), ma personalmente resto dell'idea che con un limitato numero di infortuni le cose sarebbero andate diversamente, fino ad oggi anche in campionato. Resta il fatto che a Bergamo e in Inghilterra la squadra schierata era migliore di quella avversaria, ma contro i nerazzurri questa non è mai parsa verità e contro gli inglesi (pure rimaneggiati e in altre grane recenti) per almeno un'ora i rossoneri hanno fatto fatica a mettere insieme due passaggi di fila e creare un'occasione. Poi è vero, sono arrivati 2 gol, 2 pali e una reazione dettata anche e soprattutto dai cambi (a proposito di panchina lunga...), ma è assolutamente necessario ritrovare alla svelta quella fluidità di gioco, quell'entusiasmo, quell'organizzazione che avevano portato il Milan in testa alla classifica dopo 8 giornate, facendo pensare che davvero il mercato avesse rinforzato la squadra. Oggi Lofutus, Musah e Reijnders - premiato dall'Uefa come MVP al St. James's Park, devo essermi perso qualcosa - hanno abbassato i rifornimenti offensivi e la protezione a un reparto difensivo reinventato con Theo centrale e Florenzi a sinistra. Dettaglio non indifferente quest'ultimo: fa piegare la nave su un fianco nonostante la disponibilità di Hernandez e l'abnegazione di Alessandro, che sbaglia più spesso la scelta e la giocata rispetto a quando sta nel suo (ed è sistematicamente tra i migliori). Il Milan resta tremendamente fragile: come scrivevo una settimana fa, manca una leadership riconosciuta in mezzo al campo. Maignan, Tomori e Giroud (in parte lo stesso Florenzi) gridano, spronano, incoraggiano, ma è là nel centro che serve come il pane Bennacer che con il gioco, prima che con le frustate, dia ordine e personalità a una squadra che tende a sfaldarsi al primo alito di vento. E' in campo, in partita, a Milanello che deve avvenire la svolta. Non saranno Ibra né il mercato di gennaio, per quanto importante per dare un aiuto alla rosa, a determinare il cambio di rotta. Zlatan arriva accompagnato da un minuzioso, esteso comunicato che ben definisce le sue alte responsabilità. I suoi ritorni da giocatore prima e da dirigente poi - conoscendo il suo carattere, le sue ambizioni - certificano che un progetto di alto profilo sia in atto come pensavo con la presenza di Paolo Maldini. Ora deve tradursi nei fatti che sono ritrovare la competitività in Italia e in Europa, oltre allo stadio nuovo: in EL la storia, il dovere, i tifosi impongono che si arrivi fino in fondo. Fino a Dublino. E per favore quest'anno si tenga nel mirino anche la farsesca Coppa Italia: diventa una cosa un po' più seria solo dalla semifinale in poi, quindi arrivarci dev'essere un obiettivo. Non è con i soldi, con il mercato, che si vince, anche se aiutano molto. E' con un progetto che si insegue un traguardo. Il Chelsea spende vagonate di sterline da 3 stagioni: balbetta in Premier, è fuori dall'Europa e dodicesimo in campionato, cambia più allenatori che calzettoni. Non parliamo dello United: sesto in campionato, malamente scaraventato fuori dall'Europa. Senza l'omaggio del rigore alle penultima del girone, il miliardario PSG a sua volta sarebbe out dalla Champions dove colleziona da anni brutte figure. Il piccolo Girona è in testa alla Liga. Lo stesso Milan, secondo nel 2021, campione nel 2022, semifinalista di Champions nel 2023, ha parametri di budget rigorosi e chissà dove sarebbe se facesse debiti su debiti o trasgredisse i paletti del FairPlay... Più dei soldi contano le idee, la competenza, la logica. L'ambiente ha bisogno di avere coesione, serenità, ordine. Deve ritrovare fiducia, continuità, ferocia. Non è utopia: aveva tutto a settembre e ottobre, ha perso le chiavi dopo la prima sosta. Ibra aiuterà senza bacchetta magica, ma con orgoglio, autorevolezza e carisma. E' una risorsa, non un problema né tanto meno una minaccia. Dissento, per una volta, da un’analisi a ritroso degli amici del gruppo “I Casciavit”: non è vero e non è giusto dire oggi che le semifinali di Champions nella scorsa stagione sono state un caso fortuito: il Milan disputò le 2 ultime gare del girone e le 4 con Tottenham e Napoli in maniera superba, tra l’altro senza subire gol se non quello ininfluente di Osimhen all’ultimo secondo della sesta gara. Una partita può essere fortunata, un gol, un episodio, ma non un intero cammino. Lasciate credere ad altri che lo scudetto fu figlio dell’errore di Radu a Bologna: su questa sponda sappiamo benissimo, invece, che la sorte nello sport segue il karma e le energie, sono conseguenza di come stai, cosa fai e quanto vali. Per tutte queste cose i rossoneri hanno strameritato di arrivare dove sono arrivati 8 mesi fa, meritano di andare in EL adesso. Ma non facciamo confusione. Nel frattempo, il Milan Football and Cricket Club compie 124 anni: auguri vecchio cuore rossonero, plasmato dall’anima e non da una fedifraga costoletta.","pubDate":"2023-12-14 23:05:08","image_url":"https://net-storage.tcccdn.com/storage/milannews.it/img_notizie/thumb3/1d/1d868a7906650c6fd702de354ad2d1ef-97265-oooz0000.jpeg","source_id":"milannews","source_priority":519547,"country":["italy"],"category":["sports"],"language":"italian"},{"article_id":"61df916c512d9283c48764eabe8ae722","title":"Matthew Mott seeks response from England after losing second T20 in West Indies","link":"https://www.bordercountiesadvertizer.co.uk/sport/national/23991177.matthew-mott-seeks-response-england-losing-second-t20-west-indies/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sam Curran made amends after being thumped for 30 in an over, with 50 off 32 balls, having been elevated to number four in the batting order.","content":"Sam Curran made amends after being thumped for 30 in an over, hit for four sixes and a four by Windies captain Rovman Powell, with 50 off 32 balls, having been elevated to number four in the batting order. While there were several cameos, Curran lacked support as England fell 10 runs short of overhauling their opponents’ 176 for seven to fall 2-0 down in the five-match series after losing the ODIs 2-1. Defeat by 10 runs, West Indies 2-0 up in the series. — England Cricket (@englandcricket) The tourists struggled against left-arm spinners Gudakesh Motie and Akeal Hosein, who leaked a combined 33 in eight overs. Motie was especially successful, taking 4-0-9-1 on a tricky pitch to bat on. “No one likes losing,” said Mott. “We played good cricket again for 90 per cent of the match. We had them under control up to the 15th-over mark and unfortunately, as West Indies can do, they hurt us. “We fought back at the back end to keep them to 176 which was definitely chase-able. It’s light and shade with our batting, there’s some really good things happening but probably just too many dot balls. “We have to respond from this. We will try to come up with more solutions. We are trying hard, we are close. We are a couple of good hits away from a win. “The message in the changing room is that we are not far away. We just have to stay the course. We’ve got to win one first. That’s our first target.” Curran averaged 11 from 26 previous T20 innings, albeit having only once before batted in the top five, but he has three Test fifties and sparkled with an unbeaten 95 in an ODI against India in 2021. It was still a surprise to see him stride out after Phil Salt was England’s second batter dismissed, with Liam Livingstone, Harry Brook and Moeen Ali each nudged down one position. Curran, though, was the pick of the batters and uncorked seven boundaries – including three sixes – and Mott revealed his promotion was down to how they thought he would fare against Hosein and Motie. “He didn’t seem to get a heap of strike, it’s funny how it works out and he ended up taking down the medium-pacers,” said Mott, who added it was a “50-50 call” about whether to elevate Curran or Moeen. “We just thought Sam was the one to try and really disrupt and get a free licence to go and go hard. He did it, not in the fashion we were expecting but he certainly did his job. “We’ve always rated his batting and he’s been in some strong teams, as he showed. When he gets an opportunity, he’s a class player. He’s worked really hard on facing fast bowling. “He’s got a great all-round game. We know he can hurt the spinners a lot but there’s certainly more layers to his batting which is exciting for the future. It was unfortunate he got out when he did.” Brandon King's 82 helps West Indies take a 2-0 lead in the T20I series against England. | 📝 — ICC (@ICC) The Windies belted 13 sixes to England’s eight, with opener Brandon King and Powell sharing five apiece. King anchored the Windies innings with 82 off 52 balls and Powell registered 50 off 28. Assessing Curran’s more ignominious offering on Thursday, Mott added: “When they line you up, it’s a tough place to be. “Every time you clear the rope it’s a big win, particularly early in an over. It’s something we have spoken about and we have got some really good six hitters ourselves.” Powell was on a run-a-ball 22 at the start of the 16th over having been kept quiet by Adil Rashid, who took 4-0-11-2, but followed up a streaky inside edge off Curran with some monstrous hits. Jacqueline Williams, who became the first female umpire from the Caribbean to stand in a men’s T20 international, raised her arms skywards on four occasions before Powell ended the over by holing out. “It definitely changed the game,” Powell reflected. “As a batter you sometimes look for that over. “After being pegged down by the leg-spinners and then the pacer comes on, you think ‘maybe this is the opportunity to cash in’.”","pubDate":"2023-12-14 23:02:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"bordercountiesadvertiser","source_priority":98087,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"db890716aabed3535505163aeffd25ee","title":"Rohit Sharma on disappointment of losing World Cup final","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/12/15/rohit-sharma-on-disappointment-of-losing-world-cup-final/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["KR Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"‘I had no idea how to come back from this.

The first few days I didn’t know what to do’ New Delhi: Rohit Sharma said that it took a while for him to move on from the disappointment of not winning the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup final but the empathetic reaction from fans he has met has helped him heal. Rohit, speaking on the official Instagram account run by his team, said that he found it hard to digest the fact that his team fell short of winning what he felt was the ultimate prize in cricket. “I had no idea how to come back from this. The first few days I didn’t know what to do. My family, and my friends kept me going. kept things pretty light around me, which was quite helpful. It wasn’t easy to digest, but life moves on. Honestly, it was tough,” said the Indian captain. India won 10 matches on the trot, and most of them rather comprehensively, before eventually falling short against Australia in the final played on 19 November at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The brand of cricket that India played during the tournament was impressive to see but Pat Cummins and Co got the better of them on the day when it mattered the most. “I thought we did everything we could from our side. If someone asked me what went wrong? Because we won 10 games. And in those 10 games, yes, we made mistakes, but that happens in every game that you play. You cannot have a perfect game, you can have a near-perfect game but you cannot have a perfect game. If I look on the other side of it, I am proud of the team as well, because how we played was simply outstanding. You don’t get to perform like that every World Cup, you know. And I’m pretty sure at least how we played at least up until that finals, it would have given people a lot of joy, a lot of pride watching the team play,” Rohit said. The Indian captain set an aggressive tone for the side when opening the batting, opting for going hard in the first powerplay pretty much all through the tournament. That laid the platform for the likes of Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, and Shreyas Iyer to take India to match-winning scores. Rohit said that he wanted to take a break after the World Cup to clear his head but it has been pleasing to see how the fans have reacted to the defeat, feeling pride at the winning run his team put together. “After that final, it was very hard to get back and start moving on. Which is why I decided that I need to go somewhere and just get my mind out of this,” the 36-year-old said. “But then, wherever I was, I realised that people were coming up to me and they were appreciating everyone’s effort, how well we played. I feel for all of them right because they, along with us, were dreaming of lifting that World Cup. Everywhere we went during this entire World Cup campaign, there was so much support from everyone you know who came to the stadium firstly, and then people who were watching it from home as well. I want to appreciate what people have done for us in that one and a half months. But again, if I think more and more about that, I just feel quite disappointed that we were not able to go through all the way.” Rohit, who was not selected for the 2011 World Cup and has spoken about how big a turning point it was for his career, said that it was disappointing to come this close to lifting the trophy. “I’ve always grown up watching 50-over World Cup. And to me, that was, you know, the ultimate prize, so we’ve worked all these years, you know, for that. And it is disappointing, right? If you don’t get through it, and you don’t get what you want, what you have been looking for all this while, what you were dreaming of… you get disappointed and you get frustrated as well at times,” he said. But people coming up to him to tell they were very proud of the team made him feel good to a certain extent, the Mumbaikar said. “And along with them, I was healing as well.” While he has opted for a break during the ongoing white-ball leg of the South Africa tour, it is not yet clear if Rohit will lead India at next year’s T20 World Cup, in a format that he has not played in since the last edition in Australia. “Because I felt ‘okay, you know, this is the kind of thing that you want to hear. When you meet people, when they understand what the player must be going through, and when they know these kinds of things, and not to bring out that frustration, that anger… it means a lot. For me, definitely, it meant a lot because there was no anger. It was just pure love from the people that I met. And it was wonderful to see that. So you know it gives you the motivation to get back and start working again and look for another ultimate prize,” he signed off.

Under Operation Sadhbhavana, the same was organised wherein six teams participated in the inaugural edition. Army continued its efforts to motivate more participants and in 2022, the number of teams increased to 14. Seeing the enthusiasm, ASEEM Foundation, a Pune based NGO working for youth and women empowerment in the border regions of India, proposed an idea of conducting practice and exhibition matches for selected girl cricket players at Pune. In 2023, while conducting the yearly championship, 16 girls were selected for a tour to Pune. These girls were then trained by resident players and an Op Sadhbhavana project was sought for their kiting and move from Kupwara to Pune and Back. Accordingly, a team of 16 players along with Officer in Charge (Women Officer ), JCO-IC, two NCOs (NA and Coach) were flagged off from Patahiri Garrison on 12 Dec 23 for a 14 days tour with effect from 15 to 24 Dec 2023. The team met Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi, AVSM, GOC-in-C, Northern Command on 14 Dec 23 and proceeded to Jammu for their onward journey to Pune. The Army Commander complimented the team members for their selection and exhorted them to imbibe the sportswoman spirit in their everyday endeavours.
