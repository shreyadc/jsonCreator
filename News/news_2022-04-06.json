The manner in which Karthik collected as many as 21 runs off Ravichandran Ashwin‚Äôs 14th over was perhaps the turning point of the match at the Wankhede Stadium tonight. du Plessis‚Äô decision of electing to field first after winning the toss was justified by disciplined bowling performances by Harshal Patel, David Willey and Wanindu Hasaranga, all of whom picked a wicket apiece in the first innings.

Faf du Plessis and Anuj Rawat provided Bangalore with the perfect start, but once they perished, runs dried up and wickets started to fall. It was the partnership of Dinesh Karthik and Shahbaz Ahmed that guided them over the line. Dinesh Karthik started firing from the word go, while Shahbaz Ahmed put up a great show as well. The duo notched up 67 runs together and out Bangalore in the driver's seat. Rajasthan did not have the best start with the ball, they leaked 48 runs in the Powerplay. But they fought back well and grabbed five quick wickets, and put themselves ahead in the game. Rajasthan were all over Bangalore during the middle phase. However, once Dinesh Karthik walked in to bat, the bowlers had no answer to his brutal hitting. Yuzvendra Chahal was the leader of the pack, he grabbed two wickets and gave away just 15 runs in his spell. The first defeat for Rajasthan, however, they do have a few positives to take from this defeat. From 48 for 0 in the Powerplay to 88 for 5 at the end of 13 overs, to sealing victory with 5 balls to spare. What a dramatic game this has been! But it is Bangalore that have managed to get over the line and they have handed Rajasthan their first defeat of the tournament. 19.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Harshal Patel hits the winning runs!

Karthik shuffles and drags it from outside off and wide of mid-wicket and the ball races away to the fence. Just 7 needed now. 18.4 overs (1 Run) Wide! Way outside off, over the tramline and Karthik leaves it alone. Pressure on Krishna. 18.3 overs (1 Run) Length and on middle.

Karthik cuts it to the right of covers. Good fielding there. 16.1 overs (0 Run) Fuller and on middle. Karthik leans and keeps it out. Bangalore will not mind to see this over off. Time-Out! Dinesh Karthik has come in and put Bangalore in the driver's seat. He along with Shahbaz Ahmed have put a partnership of 51 runs off just 21 balls and put Rajasthan under immense pressure.

He says the wicket has less grass this time, it is very very hard this time and this isn't something we have seen so far. Says that the batters are in a little bit of a treat today and a high score is expected. We have seen how crucial the toss had been in this edition of the Indian T20 League. Dew has played a big factor at Wankhede and the teams chasing here have won all three matches. Both the teams are in super form at the moment. Who do you think will win here? We will find out! Stay tuned for the toss and other updates. Few players will play against their former team. The likes of Yuzvendra Chahal, Devdutt Padikkal, and Navdeep Saini who were part of Bangalore in the previous season will wear a different colour jersey this season. Chahal has already made his mark while Saini and Devdutt Padikkal are yet to display their true potential. It will be a bit emotional for them but in the end, two points are what matter the most. Bangalore will be hoping Glenn Maxwell returns to their playing XI, if he does it will only make their batting stronger. While Rajasthan will want to stick to their plans and continue to perform the same way. They will aim to remain unbeaten. Hello and a warm welcome to the coverage of match number 13 where Rajasthan will face Bangalore. Rajasthan are riding high on confidence with two impressive wins while Bangalore showed a much-improved performance to open their account.

Last year, former player Azeem Rafiq spoke out about years of racism he had suffered at the club prompting fundamental change at Yorkshire and an unprecedented review across cricket. Rafiq told Sky News that the new name at Headingley made him smile: \"I just laughed, the timing, everything - I just thought it just fitted perfectly. \"It is a clean slate... the name is one thing, but it is everything else from now on that happens that is important. \"There's a lot of good primary schools around Headingley and a big diverse community. \"I just want them to be able to walk past Headingley and look at Headingley and think this is my club.\" A ban on hosting international cricket at Headingley was recently lifted by the England and Wales Cricket Board, while Yorkshire CCC members overwhelmingly voted in favour of structural changes required by the ECB at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) held on Friday . Yorkshire demonstrated they had made significant progress addressing the problems that Rafiq had highlighted. As a result, England will host a Test match against New Zealand at the ground in June and a one-day international against South Africa in July.

As well as renaming the stadium, the main pavilion will be known as the 'Clean Slate Pavilion' and the name will appear on club kit. Clean Slate say their mission is to challenge gender stereotypes in Indian film and they want to help make Headingley \"a flagbearer for inclusivity and diversity in cricket\". New Yorkshire chairman Lord Patel and managing director of cricket Darren Gough are both in Mumbai to launch the partnership with Clean Slate founder Karnesh Ssharma, with Lord Patel saying: \"This new partnership - with a vibrant Indian brand that knows how to entertain diverse communities - is an exciting step for Yorkshire. \"Our proud club has a great future, welcoming everyone into our ground and this game.\" Clean Slate founder Ssharma said: \"We're incredibly proud to partner with Yorkshire and to be the first Indian company to have their name prominently featured within a UK sports ground. \"Clean Slate puts inclusivity and diversity at the fore of its entertainment roster, and we truly believe that our entertainment vision and values align with that of Yorkshire County Cricket Club moving forward.\"","image_url":"https://e2.365dm.com/22/04/1920x1080/skysports-headingley-cricket_5729016.jpg?20220404203530","source_id":"skysports","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LIVE IPL 2022 RR vs RCB Live Cricket Score, Rajasthan vs Bangalore, 13th Match Live Score Latest Updates","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ipl-2022-rr-vs-rcb-live-cricket-score-rajasthan-royals-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-t20-indian-premier-league-match-13-live-updates-2022-04-05-767876","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LIVE IPL 2022 RR vs RCB Live Cricket Score, Rajasthan vs Bangalore, 13th Match Live Score Latest Updates","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-05 12:11:54","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ICC Women's World Cup: A statistician's delight","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/icc-women-s-world-cup-a-statistician-s-delight-122040400385_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia's 71-run win over the Heather Knight-led England in the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup at the Hagley Oval was a statistician's delight, as several records tumbled during the course of play","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-05 12:06:00","full_description":"Australia's 71-run win over the Heather Knight-led England in the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup at the Hagley Oval on Sunday was a statistician's delight, as several records tumbled during the course of play -- not least the number of titles won by the Southern Stars, who now have a record seven 50-over World Cups in their cupboard. Australia's success at the Hagley Oval came after their six previous titles -- in 1978, 1982, 1988, 1997, 2005, 2013 --, which is the most by any team after four-time champions England and New Zealand, who won it in 2000. While it is Australia's seventh silverware, it is fifth time after 2005, 1997, 1982 and 1978 when they have lifted the trophy staying undefeated throughout the tournament. Australia's record in ODIs too is unrivalled with the team having won 38 out of 39 matches since the start of 2018, their solitary defeat coming against India in Mackay, Queensland last year. In addition to the seven World Cups, Australia have also won the ICC Women's T20 World Cup five times -- 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2020. Australia wicketkeeper-batter Alyssa Healy played an innings for the ages and shattered several records. Her innings of 170 off 138 balls against England is the highest score in the final of any ICC Cricket World Cup (men or women). As she scored a hundred, 129 against West Indies, in the semifinal too, she became the first cricketer in history to score a century in the semifinal and final of the same World Cup, according to ICC. There was another high-profile innings in the game, albeit in a losing cause, from England's Nat Sciver, who scored a gritty unbeaten 148 -- the third highest score in a World Cup final and second highest in women's events. Before the 2022 decider, the only century in Women's Cricket World Cup finals was by Australia's Karen Rolton (107 not out) against West Indies in Centurion in 2005. Healy's 170 is also the second-highest score for Australia in Women's ODIs after Belinda Clark's historic unbeaten 229 against Denmark in Mumbai in 1997. New Zealand legend Debbie Hockley's 25-year-old record for most runs in one edition of the Women's World Cup was also twice broken during the final. First Rachael Haynes (497 runs) toppled Hockley's tally of 456 runs and then Healy (509 runs) went past both Hockley and Haynes during the course of her 170-run knock. Healy is the first player to better the 500-run mark in a single edition of the Women's World Cup. At the end of the group stage, she had only 210 runs. In the two innings in the semifinal and final, she amassed 299 runs. For the rival side, Katherine Brunt became only the 10th woman in history and third from England to feature in three World Cup finals. Her previous two appearances came in 2017 and 2009. Brunt was part of the England team that won the final against India at Lord's in 2017 and New Zealand in Sydney in 2009. The two other English women to play three World Cup finals are Janette Brittin and Carole Hodges. The 2022 edition of the World Cup had plenty of thrills with as many as 11 games having extremely close finishes. Sune Luus' South Africa were the most successful in tight situations, prevailing on most occasions. All four thrillers involving the Proteas were decided in the final over. Their last group game, against India in Christchurch, was only the second chase in World Cup history that was completed on the last ball. The final of the tournament witnessed 681 runs across two innings, the second highest match aggregate in the history of the Women's World Cup. Australia scored 356 and England 285. The only game that has seen more runs was the England versus South Africa match in Bristol in 2017 when 678 runs were produced. England who had bowled 31 maiden overs in the tournament, the most by any team, failed to deliver an over without a run in the final. There was no maiden from Australia either making it the only complete 50 overs match in this World Cup without a maiden. Before Australia's 356 and England's 285 in the final in Christchurch, the highest total in Women's World Cup final was 259 by Australia against West Indies in Mumbai (Brabourne) in 2013. Surprisingly, Australia didn't hit any six in their massive total of 356 -- the second highest in ODIs without a maximum. The record is also by Australia -- 412 against Denmark in 1997. In the entire tournament, batters combined scored 11,754 runs, a new record for Women's World Cups. The previous highest tally was 11,656 runs in the 2017 edition. Bowlers also had a good time taking 406 wickets, the most in a Women's World Cup. --IANS akm/ (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","image_url":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1220404/thumb-122040400385.jpg","source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bangladesh To Complain Over South Africa Umpiring, Sledging","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/bangladesh-to-complain-over-south-africa-umpiring-sledging-2864142","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Bangladesh will formally complain to the International Cricket Council over claims of biased umpiring and \"unbearable\" sledging in the first Test against South Africa, officials said Tuesday","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-05 11:38:33","full_description":"Bangladesh will formally complain to the International Cricket Council over claims of biased umpiring and \"unbearable\" sledging in the first Test against South Africa, officials said Tuesday. The side was furious after several close calls went against them in Durban, where they remained competitive for most of the match before a batting collapse saw them dismissed for 53 in the second innings. Players have since taken issue with their opponents for on-field taunts they said crossed the line into abuse. \"You all have seen how biased the umpiring was. On the field, sledging was also unbearable,\" Bangladesh Cricket Board cricket operations chief Jalal Yunus told AFP. \"We will write a formal complaint to the ICC match referee manager,\" he added. Jalal said they raised similar issues to match referee Andy Pycroft after their 2-1 one-day international series win -- their first on South African soil. \"Our manager spoke to him several times. But he paid no attention to our complaint,\" Jalal said by phone from Durban. \"We want the ICC to appoint neutral umpires in Test series as soon as possible. We are also ready to welcome neutral umpires in our home series,\" he said. Umpires from host countries have been used exclusively since 2020, when the pandemic imposed worldwide travel restrictions, and South African umpires Marais Erasmus and Adrian Holdstock were standing in the Durban Test. Skipper Mominul Haque said umpires did not intervene when South African players sledged their Bangladeshi opponents. \"Sledging is a normal thing. But if it comes to the stage of abuse, that is very bad,\" he said. \"I think they abused us in the worst manner and umpires did not notice.\" South Africa won by 220 runs in Durban after the tourists' batting collapse in the second innings. Promoted The second Test will start in Gqeberha on April 8.

RR vs RCB MATCH PREVIEW Forty-eight hours after the battle of ‚ÄòKings‚Äô at the Brabourne Stadium, a ‚Äòroyal battle‚Äô will take place at the Wankhede Stadium when an in-form Rajasthan Royals take on Royal Challengers Bangalore on Tuesday. Much against the trend seen in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Royals posted two wins by defending targets, against former champion Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians. This underlines the Royals‚Äô belief in the quality of their resources. In contrast, the Challengers have gone with the tide - lost the toss and the match against Punjab Kings by five wickets and won the toss and the game against Kolkata Knight Riders by three wickets. READ | IPL 2022: Hazlewood unlikely to be available for RCB before April 12 game Notably for the Royals, except the Kiwi Trent Boult, all bowling options are home-grown internationals - Prasidh Krishna, Navdeep Saini, R. Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal. With Jos Buttler making his presence felt with a 100 against Mumbai Indians, and the duo of Sanju Samson and Shimron Hetmyer contributing, the failure of Devdutt Paddikkal was lost in the background. Overall, going by the balance of the teams, Royals is the early favourite to go all the way. An unconvincing Challengers‚Äô lone win in two matches came after the side's bowlers set it up in a low-scoring encounter against Kolkata Knight Riders. It was indeed a great comeback for the bowlers after looking so ineffective in the defence of 205 in the opener against Punjab Kings. Against the Royals, the Challengers will have to raise the bar a few notches to pose a threat. - Rakesh Rao RR vs RCB SQUADS Royal Challengers Bangalore : Faf du Plessis (c), Anuj Rawat, Virat Kohli, Dinesh Karthik, Sherfane Rutherford, Shahbaz Ahmed, David Willey, Wanindu Hasaranga, Harshal Patel, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Siddarth Kaul, Karn Sharma, Chama V Milind, Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Finn Allen, Suyash Prabhudessai, Aneeshwar Gautam Rajasthan Royals : Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson (c), Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Ravichandran Ashwin, Navdeep Saini, Trent Boult, Yuzvendra Chahal, Prasidh Krishna, Karun Nair, James Neesham, Rassie van der Dussen, KC Cariappa, Daryl Mitchell, Obed McCoy, Tejas Baroka, Kuldip Yadav, Anunay Singh, Kuldeep Sen, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Dhruv Jurel, Shubham Garhwal WHERE TO WATCH IPL 2022 LIVE?

David has the experience of playing for various franchises across the world -- Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2021 IPL, Perth Scorchers and Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League, Lahore Qalandars and Multan Sultans in the Pakistan Super League, Southern Brave in The Hundred and Saint Lucia Kings in the Caribbean Premier League. IPL 2022: Full Coverage | Points Table The big-hitting all-rounder has represented Singapore in international cricket in 14 T20Is, collecting 558 runs at an average of 46.5 and a strike rate of 158.52 since his debut against Qatar in July 2019. \"I think the depth of talent in Indian cricket. There are great players right throughout all the teams, and then obviously some really high-quality overseas players,‚Äù David was quoted as saying by the record five-time champions on the eve of their game against Kolkata Knight Riders. \"The IPL's obviously got the ticket as being the biggest T20 franchise competition, and I think it‚Äôs just that every team has a lot of bases covered. There are a lot of high-quality players and you‚Äôre going to get tested, so you‚Äôve got to be at your best,\" David said. David‚Äôs goals from his first full season with the most successful team in the world‚Äôs best franchise T20 leagues are clear-cut: \"First of all try and be a better player at the end of the tournament than I was when I got here. I‚Äôve tried to make the most of the environment that MI has provided. There have been some awesome opportunities to learn already. And obviously, most importantly, on the field it‚Äôs to try and put in some performances that can really help the team win some games.‚Äù Notably, David, who was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 8.25 crore at the mega auction, is yet to get going like the rest of the team in the tournament so far. Mumbai Indians have had a horrendous start to their campaign, having lost both their games ‚Äî against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals. But David believes that the team will get better. Next up for Mumbai Indians are Shreyas Iyer-led Kolkata Knight Riders. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a strong side, every team is strong in the IPL. We will do our analysis on the players and on the team. But I think it‚Äôs about sticking to our processes most importantly. If we play our best game, then we‚Äôve got to believe that‚Äôs capable of winning,‚Äù David said.
