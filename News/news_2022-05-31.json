Potts looks certain to face New Zealand on Thursday in what will be, other than one game in the Hundred last season, his first appearance at the home of cricket. And he will take confidence from the form that has seen him, with so many England bowlers falling injured by the wayside, dominate the County Championship so far this season with 35 wickets in six matches. Matthew Potts has vowed to change nothing from his county performances on his Test debut Potts has dominated the County Championship so far this season with 35 wickets in six matches ‘There is a difference in intensity at this level but I am honestly looking to change nothing from what got me here,’ said the 23-year-old. ‘I am just going to run in and bowl hard in my kind of areas and see if that works.’ Potts was described when he was selected as a ‘point of difference’ by new managing director Rob Key from what will be a largely one-paced England attack. But he will not be replacing the extreme pace of the injured Mark Wood, Jofra Archer and Olly Stone. The most likely bowler to miss out is Craig Overton even though that will leave a lengthy looking tail ‘I have no real idea what pace I bowl,’ he said. ‘I haven’t looked at the speed guns and streams but as a general guide I’d say I’m at maybe low to mid 80s.’ With Potts set to play and England seemingly wanting to include their spinner in Jack Leach, the most likely bowler to miss out is Craig Overton even though that will leave a lengthy looking tail. Potts might bat as high as eight but admitted ‘I haven’t had loads of runs this season.’ New Zealand will be without Trent Boult who has only just arrived from the IPL while there are fitness doubts over Matt Henry and Henry Nicholls.

The England men’s Test Cricket side is in all readiness to commence a new era under the leadership of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum as skipper and head coach respectively. Interestingly, McCullum, 40, will begin his tenure against New Zealanders themselves, as they tour England for a three-match Test series, with the series opener to take place at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground, from June 2 (Thursday). New Zealand, meanwhile, announced their 15-member squad for the imminent series on Monday, with veteran batter Kane Williamson as the skipper of the side. The Test series would be part of the World Test Championship Cycle (2021-2023). ALSO READ : Will Trent Boult play during ENG vs NZ first Test match at Lord’s? New Zealand head coach Gary Stead, while at the Lord’s Cricket Ground on Monday, admitted having a strange feeling upon seeing the former Kiwi skipper Brendon McCullum donning the English team training kit, ahead of the first Test match. “It already is strange (seeing him in England kit). I walked across the ground before and him and I walked together. I think he went into the right dressing room, he turned left and I turned right,” Stead hilariously remarked. Stead further stated that while he is quite certain that McCullum would have a positive impact on the England side, which has been struggling with their performances off-late, the same would not be instant, and the English fans would need a bit of patience. “Brendon will bring the heart-on-the-sleeve type play into that England squad. I’ve no doubt he’ll have an instant impact. But I’m not sure his impact right now will be as much as you’ll see in a year’s time. So, yes, people do need to be patient,” remarked Stead. “He’ll have an instant impact!” 💥 Gary Stead on taking on Brendon McCullum when New Zealand face England in the First Test. 🏏 pic.twitter.com/omvsr2MBo9 — Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) May 30, 2022 For more Cricket-related news, click here .","pubDate":"2022-05-30 18:28:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jonny Bairstow ‘excited and intrigued’ by England’s McCullum appointment","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/30/jonny-bairstow-england-test-cricket-brendon-mccullum-ben-stokes","keywords":["England cricket team","Jonny Bairstow","England v New Zealand 2022","Cricket","New Zealand cricket team","Sport"],"creator":["Simon Burnton"],"video_url":null,"description":"Batsman delighted to be part of new era for Test team‘It’s about taking wickets, winning games of cricket’Jonny Bairstow has said he is “excited and intrigued” by the arrival of Brendon McCullum as England’s Test coach and by the prospect of a new era for his team.Bairstow arrived in England last Monday following Punjab Kings’ elimination from the Indian Premier League, throwing him into a whirlwind turnaround as he prepares for England’s first Test against New Zealand, which starts at Lord’s on Thursday.

Bairstow arrived in England last Monday following Punjab Kings’ elimination from the Indian Premier League, throwing him into a whirlwind turnaround as he prepares for England’s first Test against New Zealand, which starts at Lord’s on Thursday. County cricket: T20 Blast lets game do the talking after quiet buildup Read more “I’m definitely intrigued because of the blend of how he played his cricket and his coaching style and how that all fits together, the successes he had on the field and also off the field, and how that fits with Test cricket and our English game,” Bairstow said of McCullum. “It’s about taking wickets, about going out and winning key periods of the game, winning games of cricket. That’s what we want to be doing. It takes time to play in that kind of fashion but I’m sure there’ll be things that rub off within the next weeks, months and years.” There is also the prospect of what Bairstow called “an exciting partnership” developing between McCullum and the team’s new captain, Ben Stokes, though he does not expect to see a great transformation in his teammate. “I don’t think he’ll change,” Bairstow said. “I think over a period of time now the experiences that he’s had, within his cricket career, within his life, all stand him in good stead. And those experiences, for good or bad, will also enable him to maintain his composure when it is tested.” The 32-year-old said he is “delighted with how I have come out of the winter”, having topped England’s batting averages in the Ashes – where he played only the third and fourth matches – and produced his highest Test score in nearly six years during the tour of West Indies, before competing in the IPL. Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum at Lord’s as they prepare England for the first Test. Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty Images “Obviously I was disappointed not to start in Australia but I was pleased with the way I reacted and also the way I played. Not getting easy runs – when you have to get the hard runs, they are the rewarding runs. When you have to score the tough runs and stand up for the side, that’s the bit I was most proud of. That’s the exciting part.” Though he has had only a few weeks away from cricket since the start of last summer Bairstow – who McCullum has confirmed will bat at No 5 – said the idea of taking time off after returning from India, where players’ movement was tightly restricted amid the continued threat of Covid disruptions, “hadn’t even come into my mind”. He said: “I’m happy with where my body’s at physically. Hopefully that’s now the end of bubbles, which is an excitement as well because that gives you an added amount of freshness, to be able to do some more normal things – to just leave your hotel, or have conversations other than on Zoom. So it’s exciting to be back at Lord’s, and come Thursday it’ll be absolutely fizzing.” With the batting lineup apparently set, the only uncertainty concerning England’s team is among the bowlers. Durham’s Matt Potts, who with 35 wickets in six County Championship matches is the country’s in-form seamer, has summoned his family to Lord’s in case he makes his debut. “This wasn’t at all on the radar at the start of the year so it would be a great moment – the pinnacle of cricket at the home of cricket,” he said. “I am honestly going to change nothing about what’s got me here – I’m just going to run in and bowl hard, bowl my kind of areas and see if that works.” The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.

New Zealand have announced their 15-member squad for the imminent three-match Test series against England, with the opening Test match to take place at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground, from June 2 (Thursday). While the likes of Jacob Duffy, Blair Tickner, Rachin Ravindra and Hamish Rutherford have been released from the initial 20 players list, fast bowler Trent Boult, who was part of the Rajasthan Royals playing 11 during the IPL 2022 grand finale versus Gujarat Titans (GT) on Sunday, has also been named in squad. Southpaw batter Henry Nicholls, who is yet to recover from his calf-injury, has also been named in the squad, despite his availability for the opening Test match remaining under dark clouds. Resultantly, the management has added Michael Bracewell as the 16th player in the squad, as the replacement cover for the 30-year-old. Meanwhile, the Kiwi pacer Trent Boult, who is scheduled to arrive in London late on Monday, after being part of the Rajasthan Royals (RR) who ended up as runners-up of IPL 2022 on Sunday, is also highly unlikely to feature in the series opener at the Lord’s Cricket Ground. “Trent arrives later today and we’ll see how he scrubs up, but I’ve had conversations with him leading up into this. We’ve been through this before with different players. I guess it’s not something that’s new to us and we’ll deal with that tomorrow and work out what’s best for us going forward with Trent Boult, in particular, ” remarked New Zealand head coach Gary Stead. While Stead’s statement with respect to Boult’s availability is a bit ambiguous, a statement released by the team management suggested his inclusion in the playing 11 for the first Test was “unlikely”.

A fairytale campaign for the Hardik Pandya-led Gujarat Titans (GT) in the 15 th season of the Indian Premier League only came to an end after they lifted their maiden IPL title , in only their debut appearance by defeating the Rajasthan Royals (RR) by 7 wickets in the night of the final at the Narendra Modi Stadium, in Ahmedabad. To act as the icing on the cake was Pandya’s match-winning performance – 3/17 and 34 (30), which earned him a rare spot in the list of captains to win ‘Player of the Match’ award in an IPL final . Charged with the franchise’s captaincy responsibility right after marking a return back to competitive Cricket after recovering from injury during the 2021 T20 World Cup, the 28-year-old was cancelled by fans and experts, as far as GT’s chances going forward in IPL 2022 were concerned. While his fitness was always a concern, many former cricketers even rated the GT squad as an average one on paper, devoid essentially of the power-hitters in it. However, here they are, soaking in all the praises and congratulatory messages overnight, which was followed by a roadshow in Ahmedabad as well the next evening, where scores and scores of people struggled to get a mere glimpse of the superstars of their victorious home franchise. We couldn’t have won this #SeasonOfFirsts without you, #TitansFAM 💙 We can’t thank the city police enough for ensuring our road show was a roaring success! 🙏 Love and wishes, #AavaDe 😍 pic.twitter.com/uQHF6bY8ad — Gujarat Titans (@gujarat_titans) May 30, 2022 Post the win, however, Hardik revealed yet again how his family members have been his constant support throughout the ups and downs of his off and on-field journey, and how his team’s victory yesterday, made his brother Krunal Pandya and sister-in-law Pankhuri Sharma emotional, when he called them post the win. “My family has been my strength. My brother Krunal, sister-in-law Pankhuri, second brother Vaibhav. All of them gave me mental comfort even in difficult times. When I called, both brother and sister-in-law cried. These were tears of joy. I know that as long as such people are behind me, I can play well,” exclaimed Hardik post the win. While Hardik lifted the trophy for Gujarat, Krunal’s Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), who also impressed right away in their maiden IPL season, finished at the fourth spot after bowing down against the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the ‘Eliminator’.","pubDate":"2022-05-30 15:34:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"😂 | Cricketclub gaat op Tinder om nieuwe leden te werven","link":"https://sportnieuws.nl/overig/cricket/cricketclub-gaat-op-tinder-om-nieuwe-leden-te-werven/","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Sportnieuws.nl"],"video_url":null,"description":"Engelse mannen die op Tinder zitten moeten raar hebben opgekeken toen ze ineens een foto van cricket voorbij zagen komen bij het swipen.

Brendon McCullum took his first training session as coach of the men’s test team that will be captained for the first time by Ben Stokes in England’s opening match of its international summer, starting Thursday. The opponent will be New Zealand, where Stokes was born — he moved to England at the age of 12 — and for whom McCullum is a cricket great. “It’s already strange,” New Zealand coach Gary Stead said of seeing McCullum take charge of England. “I walked across the ground before, him and I walked together. I think he went into the right dressing room.” As well as overseeing training from afar, McCullum was seen taking an active role by directing balls to a slip cordon for catching practice. Having only retired in 2019, he is coaching a test team for the first time and has already had a major influence on English cricket. The attack-minded New Zealand team that McCullum captained provided the template for England’s World Cup-winning team of 2019. England is hoping the same thing can happen in red-ball cricket. “It takes time to play in that kind of fashion,” batter Jonny Bairstow said. “We saw it with the white-ball side, how that transition took a little bit of time to adapt to it. “That’s the exciting part of it … the way Ben plays his red-ball cricket and Bazza (McCullum) played his red-ball and white-ball cricket, I’m sure there will be things that rub off within the environment over the next few weeks, months and years.” McCullum played 101 tests for New Zealand and was known for being an aggressive, expansive batter. He has spoken of wanting to rid England of what he described as a “fear of failure” and introducing a more relaxed environment. The team has only won one of its last 17 tests and is in last place in the World Championship standings. “He is someone I have always wanted to work with,“ Bairstow said of McCullum, ”someone who I played against and — growing up watching him — someone I was very intrigued by and looked up to in many ways because of the way he went about his cricket. “I’m very excited about the prospect of working with him, hopefully for a long period of time.” McCullum will have three days to get his ideas across to England’s players before the first of three tests against the Black Caps, the world champion in that format. “I know Brendon will have a clear vision of how he wants them to play the game,” Stead said. “Whether that happens instantly or not, I guess it always takes a bit of time to embed those things. I’m not sure his impact right now will be as much as you see in a year’s time.” ___ More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be registered Torstar account holder.

Hardik led from the front with a three-wicket haul and a crucial 34 as Gujarat defeated former champions Rajasthan Royals by seven wickets to lift the 2022 IPL trophy on Sunday. He was named the 'Player of the Match' for his brilliant performance. Earlier, several other former players including Virender Sehwag and Ravi Shatri lauded Hardik's captaincy in the IPL 2022. \"Fantastic achievement for a new franchise... If India need a captain in a couple of years I wouldn't look past @hardikpandya7... Well done Gujurat .. #IPL2022,\" Vaughan tweeted. Fantastic achievement for a new franchise ... If India need a captain in a couple of years I wouldn't look past @hardikpandya7 ... Well done Gujurat .. #IPL2022 Rohit Sharma is currently the Indian captain across formats, having taken over from Virat Kohli . The 28-year-old Hardik's leadership skills was lauded by former and current players, including former India captain Sunil Gavaskar and GT team mentor Gary Kirsten . Hardik, who has amassed 487 runs and taken 8 wickets, was simply sensational in the final as Gujarat limited a formidable Rajasthan Royals batting unit to 130 for nine. He also scored a crucial 34 before Shubman Gill and David Miller remained unbeaten on 45 and 32 to take the team home in 18.1 overs. It should have been a comfortable chase but Rajasthan bowled their hearts out to make it an interesting final. As they showed all season, Gujarat remained calm in tough situations to finish the chase in 18.1 overs. Promoted Not many gave Gujarat a chance in their first season especially after a mixed auction where they waited till the end to secure the services of wicketkeepers Wriddhiman Saha and Matthew Wade . It was not a team studded with star players but Hardik impressed with his leadership and got the best out of his colleagues.","pubDate":"2022-05-30 14:12:59","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/o6lvcn74_michael-vaughan_625x300_01_December_21.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Eboli: «RedBird-Milan?

Nicholas Pooran, the new white-ball captain of the West Indies attended a virtual press conference ahead of the 3-match ODI series against the Netherlands. Nicholas Pooran said that he is a very instinctive person, and he bats in the same way as well. Pooran insists that he wants to lead from the front and will try to be the best version of himself. “I’ll try my best to lead from the front,” Pooran said at a virtual press conference. “I’m very instinctive. On the field, I like to make decisions on how I feel. My teammates know I’m very instinctive when I’m batting as well.

Nicholas Pooran said that he cannot control the choices of Sunil Narine, and it is a matter between him and the selectors, and he does not play any part in it. “What Sunil wants, I’m in no control of that,” Pooran said. “But that’s a conversation between him and the selectors – what his aspirations are when it comes to West Indies cricket.” Narine is a veteran of 439 T20 wickets, and he has a brilliant economy of 6.02. He has also scored 2997 T20 runs with the bat courtesy of 11 half-centuries.","pubDate":"2022-05-30 12:13:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England cricket: Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum get down to business at Lord's","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-10867937/England-cricket-Ben-Stokes-Brendon-McCullum-business-Lords.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Newly-installed Test coach McCullum and new captain Stokes were seen in deep conversation on the outfield as they devised a plan of attack for the first Test beginning on Thursday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-30 11:48:07","image_url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/30/12/58457889-0-image-a-77_1653910820727.jpg","source_id":"dailymailuk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Let the best play with & against the best”: Kevin Pietersen again calls for lesser county teams to improve the quality of County Championship","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-let-the-best-play-with-against-the-best-kevin-pietersen-again-calls-for-lesser-county-teams-to-improve-the-quality-of-county-championship/","keywords":["Cricket","Coynty Championship","ECB","kevin pietersen"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kevin Pietersen has called for lesser teams in the County Championship to increase the quality of red-ball cricket in England.

English red-ball cricket has struggled a lot in the last year. It is quite interesting that the English team has been able to win just one of their last 17 red-ball games in international cricket. They lost the Ashes quite convincingly, and the performance on the West Indies tour was below par as well. Looking at the results, a lot of changes have already been made to England’s setup. Chris Silverwood was sacked from his head coach role, whereas captain Joe Root resigned from his role. Ben Stokes is the new red-ball captain of the side, whereas Brendon McCullum is the new head coach of the red-ball team. England’s next red-ball assignment will be against New Zealand in the 3-match test series starting from 2 June 2022 at the Lord’s in London. Former England batter Kevin Pietersen has yet again voted for the idea of having a lesser number of teams in the county championship to increase the quality of it. The County Select XI recently defeated New Zealand in the practice game by seven wickets. Kevin Pietersen said that the best players should play against the best in order to have a great impact with the red ball. Pietersen insists that lesser teams will create more competition between the players, and it will definitely increase the quality of cricket as well. “First Class Counties team beat NZ this last weekend. Combining the countries talent into less 4-day teams will only improve the players and that’s what I see from that result. Let the best play with & against the best in a 4 day comp!,” Kevin Pietersen said. First Class Counties team beat NZ this last weekend. Combining the countries talent into less 4-day teams will only improve the players and that’s what I see from that result. Let the best play with & against the best in a 4 day comp! 👀 — Kevin Pietersen🦏 (@KP24) May 30, 2022 Kevin Pietersen has been a regular caller of the revamp of the County Championship. Players like Rory Burns, Haseeb Hameed, etc have done incredibly well in the County Championship, but they failed on the international stage. The quality of the county cricket has been questioned in the recent past.","pubDate":"2022-05-30 11:19:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Down memory lane – Portsmouth area local cricket team photographs from 1988","link":"https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/other-sport/down-memory-lane-portsmouth-area-local-cricket-team-photographs-from-1988-3713914","keywords":["Other Sport","Sport"],"creator":["Simon Carter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Let’s take a stroll back in time - to the late 1980s.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-30 10:41:21","image_url":"https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjI5NGNkMzk5LTZhNDktNDBiOC1hOTU1LWJjZjNkMzQwOTE2MDo4ZjhjZGIxMC1hYjVjLTQ2ZDEtODk4My1kMGQ3YTYxMjk5ZTk=.jpg","source_id":"portsmouth","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jos Buttler, Rajasthan Royals Were \"Very, Very Timid\": Ex-England Captain After Poor Batting Show - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9ndC12cy1yci1pcGwtMjAyMi1qb3MtYnV0dGxlci1yYWphc3RoYW4tcm95YWxzLXdlcmUtdmVyeS12ZXJ5LXRpbWlkLWV4LWVuZ2xhbmQtY2FwdGFpbi1hZnRlci1wb29yLWJhdHRpbmctc2hvdy0zMDIyMjY20gGdAWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2lwbC0yMDIyL2d0LXZzLXJyLWlwbC0yMDIyLWpvcy1idXR0bGVyLXJhamFzdGhhbi1yb3lhbHMtd2VyZS12ZXJ5LXZlcnktdGltaWQtZXgtZW5nbGFuZC1jYXB0YWluLWFmdGVyLXBvb3ItYmF0dGluZy1zaG93LTMwMjIyNjYvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Jos Buttler, Rajasthan Royals Were \"Very, Very Timid\": Ex-England Captain After Poor Batting Show  NDTV SportsLive Cricket Score - IPL 2022 Final - Gujarat Titans vs Rajasthan Royals, Ahmedabad | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzJay Shah's Response To Matthew Wade Six Trends On Social Media | WATCH VIDEO  News18'I'll take the trophy rather than..': Pandya's big statement after IPL title win  Hindustan Times'Gujarat Titans taught us an important lesson of life' | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-30 10:36:58","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kohli jinx to Indian talent: Five things we learned from IPL","link":"https://ewn.co.za/2022/05/30/kohli-jinx-to-indian-talent-five-things-we-learned-from-ipl","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Indian Premier League ended with debutants Gujarat Titans hammering Rajasthan Royals by seven wickets in front of almost 105,000 fans at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-30 10:04:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"ewn","country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Finch confident technique tweak will end &#039;lean patch&#039;","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/05/30/cricket-finch-confident-technique-tweak-will-end-039lean-patch039","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia limited-overs captain Aaron Finch is confident that technical adjustments to his batting technique can help him end his \"reasonably lean patch\" ahead of their Twenty20 World Cup title defence this year.
