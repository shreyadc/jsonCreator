He is facing four counts of sexual intercourse without consent and has not yet entered a plea. After matching on Tinder, meeting up for a date and heading back to her home in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, the complainant alleges the cricketer refused to wear a condom and choked her three times. She cannot be identified.Gunathilaka was banned from using Tinder and other social media platforms when he was granted bail by a magistrate in November 2022. The Crown consented to varying his bail on Thursday so that he can once again use WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging platform owned by Facebook-parent Meta, and popular in his home country.Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson clarified the restrictions on his new freedom to use the platform. “It’s not to be used for the purposes of facilitating or managing dating,” she said. Crown prosecutor George Rixon opposed an application to vary a condition on a night-time curfew, however it was granted by the magistrate. Rixon said the curfew was needed to mitigate the risk of offending based on the alleged facts of the complainant’s statement, specifically, Gunathilaka’s “aggressive sexual behaviour” against her. “There are likely to be more opportunities for this alleged offending to occur at night,” he said.Atkinson agreed the alleged offending occurred at night. “But there’s nothing unique about it that it would have occurred at night and couldn’t occur during the day,” she said. Atkinson said it was going to be “more apparent” to the public that Gunathilaka had been charged and was on bail due to his high profile. “Respectfully, I disagree that this person is necessarily immediately identifiable in the community,” Rixon said. Defence barrister Emma Sullivan said media coverage of her client’s case has further increased his profile. “He’s very well known globally and in Australia,” she said. Gunathilaka has been on strict conditions and has been complying with them, Atkinson said, despite Rixon’s submission that compliance with the orders of the court was not a reason to vary his bail. “I’m not satisfied today that it is necessary to keep the curfew in place,” she said. She warned Gunathilaka he would likely face many months in custody waiting for a trial or sentencing if he breached bail. “This needs to be absolute compliance, you’ve been doing it up until now,” she told Gunathilaka. Gunathilaka travelled to Australia with Sri Lanka’s T20 World Cup team but only played in their first game before being ruled out of the competition with a hamstring tear. He was arrested shortly before boarding a flight home with the rest of the team after it bowed out of the tournament.His case is expected to return to court in April.

Chasing Australia's 4-172, India was 3-28 before a rally by the middle and lower-order gave it a chance of an upset against the two-time defending champion and top-ranked team. India needed 20 off the last 12 balls of the semi final after Jemimah Rodrigues (43 off 24 balls), captain Harmanpreet Kaur (52 off 34) and Deepti Sharma (20 not out off 17) dragged the last World Cup's losing finalist back into contention.

With 16 needed off the last over to win, or 15 to tie the scores and force a Super Over, India got 10 and fell just short at 8-167. “One of the best wins I’ve been involved in,” Australia captain Meg Lanning said. “India came hard at us so we knew this score would be hard to defend. But we pulled through in the clutch moments.” The crucial wicket for the Aussies came earlier when Rodrigues tried to ramp a short ball over wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy but only succeeded in edging it to Healy. That ended a partnership of 69 with Kaur that had put India ahead of the required run rate after 10 overs. Australia began to take control again when Kaur fell run out after getting her bat stuck in the ground as she tried to slide it into the crease. \"Can’t be unluckier than that,\" Kaur said of her run out. “Putting the effort in was important and we were happy to go to the last ball. We wanted to fight till the last ball.” Australia has won five of the seven T20 World Cups played, only missing out in 2016 when it lost to West Indies in the final and in the first tournament in 2009 when it lost in the semis. It has now made every final after 2009 and will play either England or host South Africa, who meet in the second semi-final on Saturday morning. Australia's score against India was down to its top four batters, with Healy getting 25, fellow opener Beth Mooney 54 off 37, Lanning 49 not out and Ashleigh Gardner 31 from 18. India also paid for a couple of crucial misses. Wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh dropped a catch off Lanning when the Aussie captain was on 1. Mooney was dropped on 32.

Pakistan-born cricketer Azeem Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire for more than 10 years, had claimed that racism at the club had left him on the brink of suicide. He later deposed before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS) in the UK, detailing his ordeal when he was at the club and how institutional racism was rampant there. Yorkshire removed a majority of its coaching and management staff in the aftermath of the allegations and Lord Kamlesh Patel took over as chairman of the country side and brought about a number of significant changes to counter racism. “It has been reported in a number of news outlets that, in relation to the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) inquiry, the Club has admitted a charge of deletion of data and documents,” read a statement issued by Yorkshire on Thursday following an uproar in the media over the deleted files. “After 5 November 2021, it was discovered that emails and documents, both held electronically by the club and in paper copy, had been irretrievably deleted from both servers and laptops and otherwise destroyed. “The CDC proceedings are ongoing and, as such, we are limited as to what we can say at this time. After a thorough independent investigation it was established that the deletion and destruction of documents date from a time period prior to the appointment of Lord Patel and relate to the allegations of racism and the club’s response to those allegations.” Yorkshire added that it was not certain why and how the deletion happened and who was responsible for the act. “The Club is not prepared to conjecture publicly as to why this occurred, who was responsible or the motivation for doing so. The ICO was of course informed of the position at the time of discovery, and no further action was taken.” The statement said the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had been apprised of the destruction of data, which had said it could be prejudicial to the interests of the game. “The ECB was also informed of the position, which led to a charge being brought on the basis that the conduct (deletion/destruction) may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket and/or which may bring the ECB and/or the game of cricket into disrepute. The Club has admitted this charge, as there was no viable defence in these circumstances.” PTI Yorkshire confirm data related to racism ‘irretrievably deleted’ added by Press Trust of India on 1:31 am February 24, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-02-23 20:01:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stokes won’t mind sacrificing IPL final for England duty","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/02/24/stokes-wont-mind-sacrificing-ipl-final-for-england-duty/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Wellington: World’s premier all-rounder Ben Stokes won’t allow Indian Premier League (IPL) come in the way of national duty, saying he would prefer to fly back and lead England against Ireland in the build-up Test ahead of the high-stakes Ashes series even if his franchise makes the final.

Stokes had missed the last edition of the world’s most popular T20 tournament but is set to wear the yellow Chennai Super Kings (CSK) jersey this season, starting March 31. The IPL final is slated for May 28 while England take on Ireland in the one-off warm-up Test from June 1. CSK play their first game of the season against Lucknow Supergiants on April 3. “Yes, I’ll play,” Stokes said when asked if he would play for England even if CSK qualify for the title clash. “I’ll be making sure that I give myself enough time to get back and play that game (against Ireland).” There has been a debate in international cricket whether players are preferring private leagues over national duty. Stokes said he can’t say about the choice of his England colleagues. Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and Harry Brook all have IPL contracts. “I think it’s a little bit too far ahead to say for others, but one thing I’ve got to look at is we’ve got the Ashes after the Ireland Test, so I’ll probably get round the individuals and ask them what they want to be ready for the Ashes,” Stokes said. “Those five games are obviously the big ones of the summer and you’ve got to think about what lads want, but you also have to think about if something was to happen in that game and we lose someone for the Ashes. “It’s just one of those where you have to weigh up the options of what the individual person actually wants out of that week versus do we really need to play that one? Because I’m obviously right in saying that series is bigger than that game against Ireland.” The five-match Ashes will begin on June 16 in Birmingham.

Do you approach immediately and ask for a selfie? (Also, does anyone ask for autographs any more?) Or, do you play it cool and keep some distance? Advertisement That was the decision facing my 8-year-old son and me during the Super Bowl. We were staying in the Phoenix area but didn’t attend the big game. We chose instead to visit the spring training homes of our favorite baseball teams — the San Diego Padres and the Chicago Cubs. Nothing was happening at Peoria Sports Complex, the ballpark that hosts the Padres, so we headed to Sloan Park. We were the only customers inside the team store when Cubs right fielder Seiya Suzuki walked in with friends. I recognized Suzuki immediately but didn’t want to bug him. So, I tried to ignore the Japanese star was doing the same thing that we were doing — shopping for the latest Cubs gear. Advertisement [ Spring training travel: A guide to what’s new in Arizona for Cubs and White Sox fans ] I wondered, however, if my son might be disappointed if I didn’t capture the moment. So, I awkwardly asked Suzuki if he would take a photo with him. He nodded and I snapped the photo. And that’s the best part about spring training, in my opinion — the casual access to players. Though our trip to Arizona was too early to catch practice or an exhibition game, we came home with a small souvenir. That alone is enough to satisfy until opening day, which is 35 days away. This marks the 25th year the Cubs and White Sox have both gathered in Arizona for spring training, but there have been a variety of fascinating stories throughout the decades and laundry list of locations that have hosted the teams. I’ve highlighted a few below, but my favorite one includes some noisy crickets. :) How you can support this newsletter Become a Tribune subscriber: it’s just $12 for a 1 year digital subscription .

Warner has flown home from India after suffering concussion and a broken elbow during the second Test in Delhi. It's raised the distinct possibility that his 103-Test career could be finished. THE MOLE: 'Real test' facing Cowboys after 'ambush' READ MORE: AFL boss' $360 million ultimatum to new team READ MORE: Roosters star takes break after diagnosis﻿ Warner averaged just 9.50 in England in 2019, and has not scored a century in 13 Tests in that country. Based on his record in England as well as his recent form - he averages 29.48 across his last 19 matches - it's hard to make a case for his retention. \"We'll address the Ashes planning later, but we are committed to picking the best fit and available players for Test series, particularly something as big as the Ashes,\" Dodemaide said. \"That's not a question that we've addressed so far.\" Former Australian captain Ian Chappell has previously told Wide World of Sports that dropping Warner is the easy part, the harder question for selectors is finding a replacement that will improve the side's performance.﻿ That's why Warner's form will be of concern for those in charge, but equally worrying is the records of the contenders to replace him as Usman Khawaja's opening partner. There'd be a certain irony if Bancroft was the man to end Warner's Test career, given the well-documented events of 2018. Now 30-years-old, Bancroft played the last of his 10 Tests in England in 2019, and his scores of 8, 7, 13 and 16 from that series hardly inspire confidence that he's the man to open the batting. Bancroft is the leading runscorer in this summer's Sheffield Shield competition, on Thursday scoring his fourth hundred of the season. But the question is - is he a better player now than when he was last in the Test side? The 30-year-old has had plenty of opportunities over the last five years to make a Test spot his own, without ever providing a compelling reason why he should continue to be picked. His 14 Tests have yielded just three 50s from 26 innings﻿, and an average of 25.29. Brought in to replace Bancroft for the final three Tests in England in 2019, he made 8, 19, 13, 6, 3 and 9. If part of the reason for dropping Warner is his struggles in England, you can't legitimately argue for Harris as his replacement. Unlike Bancroft and Harris, Matt Renshaw has a Test hundred to his name, and he's four years younger than both. Recalled to the Australian team for the Sydney Test against South Africa, he was firstly struck down by COVID-19﻿, while a combination of rain and centuries by Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith meant Renshaw faced only 11 balls before Australia declared. But four runs in three innings in India have hardly strengthened the case for his retention, although the conditions on the subcontinent are about as far removed from England as you can imagine.﻿ ﻿The most interesting of the four options. Head has risen to No.4 in the world rankings on the back of a superb run of form in the middle order. He's not a regular red-ball opener, although he has batted frequently at the top of the order in short-form matches. It raises the age-old question - do you weaken a strength to strengthen a weakness? Moving Head to the top to partner Khawaja would leave a gap at No.5, a position from which Head has swung a number of matches in Australia's favour in recent times. There's absolutely no doubt Head should be in the team, but moving him up the order may not be the solution.﻿ Selectors will be keen to stagger the departures of Warner, Khawaja and Steve Smith, all of whom could be gone within a couple of years. Like Warner, Khawaja is 36, while Smith has also flagged that the end is nigh. While they'll have one eye on the future, next summer's home Test matches against Pakistan and the West Indies might be an easier time to make a change, rather than the high-stakes cauldron of a World Test Championship final and an Ashes series in England. English conditions are tough enough for opening batters who are in form. ﻿Warner is clearly not, and hasn't been for some time. ﻿The fact is he doesn't really deserve to hold his spot for England. The sad reality, however, is that you can't make a strong case for any of the possible replacements. ﻿ For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here ! ﻿","pubDate":"2023-02-23 19:48:08","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/02/489611/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Clinical Australia sneak past resilient India to make World Cup final","link":"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2023-02-23-clinical-australia-sneak-past-resilient-india-to-make-world-cup-final/","keywords":null,"creator":["Keanan Hemmonsbey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia beat India by five runs to reach their seventh consecutive T20 World Cup final, scheduled for Newlands Cricket Ground this Sunday.

He is facing four counts of sexual intercourse without consent and has not yet entered a plea. After matching on Tinder, meeting up for a date and heading back to her home in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, the complainant alleges the cricketer refused to wear a condom and choked her three times. She cannot be identified.Gunathilaka was banned from using Tinder and other social media platforms when he was granted bail by a magistrate in November 2022. The Crown consented to varying his bail on Thursday so that he can once again use WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging platform owned by Facebook-parent Meta, and popular in his home country.Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson clarified the restrictions on his new freedom to use the platform. “It’s not to be used for the purposes of facilitating or managing dating,” she said. Crown prosecutor George Rixon opposed an application to vary a condition on a night-time curfew, however it was granted by the magistrate. Rixon said the curfew was needed to mitigate the risk of offending based on the alleged facts of the complainant’s statement, specifically, Gunathilaka’s “aggressive sexual behaviour” against her. “There are likely to be more opportunities for this alleged offending to occur at night,” he said.Atkinson agreed the alleged offending occurred at night. “But there’s nothing unique about it that it would have occurred at night and couldn’t occur during the day,” she said. Atkinson said it was going to be “more apparent” to the public that Gunathilaka had been charged and was on bail due to his high profile. “Respectfully, I disagree that this person is necessarily immediately identifiable in the community,” Rixon said. Defence barrister Emma Sullivan said media coverage of her client’s case has further increased his profile. “He’s very well known globally and in Australia,” she said. Gunathilaka has been on strict conditions and has been complying with them, Atkinson said, despite Rixon’s submission that compliance with the orders of the court was not a reason to vary his bail. “I’m not satisfied today that it is necessary to keep the curfew in place,” she said. She warned Gunathilaka he would likely face many months in custody waiting for a trial or sentencing if he breached bail. “This needs to be absolute compliance, you’ve been doing it up until now,” she told Gunathilaka. Gunathilaka travelled to Australia with Sri Lanka’s T20 World Cup team but only played in their first game before being ruled out of the competition with a hamstring tear. He was arrested shortly before boarding a flight home with the rest of the team after it bowed out of the tournament.His case is expected to return to court in April.

With 16 needed off the last over to win, or 15 to tie the scores and force a Super Over, India got 10 and fell just short at 8-167. “One of the best wins I’ve been involved in,” Australia captain Meg Lanning said. “India came hard at us so we knew this score would be hard to defend. But we pulled through in the clutch moments.” The crucial wicket for the Aussies came earlier when Rodrigues tried to ramp a short ball over wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy but only succeeded in edging it to Healy. That ended a partnership of 69 with Kaur that had put India ahead of the required run rate after 10 overs. Australia began to take control again when Kaur fell run out after getting her bat stuck in the ground as she tried to slide it into the crease. \"Can’t be unluckier than that,\" Kaur said of her run out. “Putting the effort in was important and we were happy to go to the last ball. We wanted to fight till the last ball.” Australia has won five of the seven T20 World Cups played, only missing out in 2016 when it lost to West Indies in the final and in the first tournament in 2009 when it lost in the semis. It has now made every final after 2009 and will play either England or host South Africa, who meet in the second semi-final on Saturday morning.

Pakistan-born cricketer Azeem Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire for more than 10 years, had claimed that racism at the club had left him on the brink of suicide. He later deposed before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS) in the UK, detailing his ordeal when he was at the club and how institutional racism was rampant there. Yorkshire removed a majority of its coaching and management staff in the aftermath of the allegations and Lord Kamlesh Patel took over as chairman of the country side and brought about a number of significant changes to counter racism. “It has been reported in a number of news outlets that, in relation to the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) inquiry, the Club has admitted a charge of deletion of data and documents,” read a statement issued by Yorkshire on Thursday following an uproar in the media over the deleted files. “After 5 November 2021, it was discovered that emails and documents, both held electronically by the club and in paper copy, had been irretrievably deleted from both servers and laptops and otherwise destroyed. “The CDC proceedings are ongoing and, as such, we are limited as to what we can say at this time. After a thorough independent investigation it was established that the deletion and destruction of documents date from a time period prior to the appointment of Lord Patel and relate to the allegations of racism and the club’s response to those allegations.” Yorkshire added that it was not certain why and how the deletion happened and who was responsible for the act. “The Club is not prepared to conjecture publicly as to why this occurred, who was responsible or the motivation for doing so. The ICO was of course informed of the position at the time of discovery, and no further action was taken.” The statement said the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had been apprised of the destruction of data, which had said it could be prejudicial to the interests of the game. “The ECB was also informed of the position, which led to a charge being brought on the basis that the conduct (deletion/destruction) may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket and/or which may bring the ECB and/or the game of cricket into disrepute. The Club has admitted this charge, as there was no viable defence in these circumstances.” PTI Yorkshire confirm data related to racism ‘irretrievably deleted’ added by Press Trust of India on 1:31 am February 24, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-02-23 20:01:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stokes won’t mind sacrificing IPL final for England duty","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/02/24/stokes-wont-mind-sacrificing-ipl-final-for-england-duty/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Wellington: World’s premier all-rounder Ben Stokes won’t allow Indian Premier League (IPL) come in the way of national duty, saying he would prefer to fly back and lead England against Ireland in the build-up Test ahead of the high-stakes Ashes series even if his franchise makes the final.

Stokes had missed the last edition of the world’s most popular T20 tournament but is set to wear the yellow Chennai Super Kings (CSK) jersey this season, starting March 31. The IPL final is slated for May 28 while England take on Ireland in the one-off warm-up Test from June 1. CSK play their first game of the season against Lucknow Supergiants on April 3. “Yes, I’ll play,” Stokes said when asked if he would play for England even if CSK qualify for the title clash. “I’ll be making sure that I give myself enough time to get back and play that game (against Ireland).” There has been a debate in international cricket whether players are preferring private leagues over national duty. Stokes said he can’t say about the choice of his England colleagues. Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and Harry Brook all have IPL contracts. “I think it’s a little bit too far ahead to say for others, but one thing I’ve got to look at is we’ve got the Ashes after the Ireland Test, so I’ll probably get round the individuals and ask them what they want to be ready for the Ashes,” Stokes said. “Those five games are obviously the big ones of the summer and you’ve got to think about what lads want, but you also have to think about if something was to happen in that game and we lose someone for the Ashes. “It’s just one of those where you have to weigh up the options of what the individual person actually wants out of that week versus do we really need to play that one? Because I’m obviously right in saying that series is bigger than that game against Ireland.” The five-match Ashes will begin on June 16 in Birmingham.

Do you approach immediately and ask for a selfie? (Also, does anyone ask for autographs any more?) Or, do you play it cool and keep some distance? Advertisement That was the decision facing my 8-year-old son and me during the Super Bowl. We were staying in the Phoenix area but didn’t attend the big game. We chose instead to visit the spring training homes of our favorite baseball teams — the San Diego Padres and the Chicago Cubs. Nothing was happening at Peoria Sports Complex, the ballpark that hosts the Padres, so we headed to Sloan Park. We were the only customers inside the team store when Cubs right fielder Seiya Suzuki walked in with friends. I recognized Suzuki immediately but didn’t want to bug him. So, I tried to ignore the Japanese star was doing the same thing that we were doing — shopping for the latest Cubs gear. Advertisement [ Spring training travel: A guide to what’s new in Arizona for Cubs and White Sox fans ] I wondered, however, if my son might be disappointed if I didn’t capture the moment. So, I awkwardly asked Suzuki if he would take a photo with him. He nodded and I snapped the photo. And that’s the best part about spring training, in my opinion — the casual access to players. Though our trip to Arizona was too early to catch practice or an exhibition game, we came home with a small souvenir. That alone is enough to satisfy until opening day, which is 35 days away. This marks the 25th year the Cubs and White Sox have both gathered in Arizona for spring training, but there have been a variety of fascinating stories throughout the decades and laundry list of locations that have hosted the teams.

Warner has flown home from India after suffering concussion and a broken elbow during the second Test in Delhi. It's raised the distinct possibility that his 103-Test career could be finished. THE MOLE: 'Real test' facing Cowboys after 'ambush' READ MORE: AFL boss' $360 million ultimatum to new team READ MORE: Roosters star takes break after diagnosis﻿ Warner averaged just 9.50 in England in 2019, and has not scored a century in 13 Tests in that country. Based on his record in England as well as his recent form - he averages 29.48 across his last 19 matches - it's hard to make a case for his retention. \"We'll address the Ashes planning later, but we are committed to picking the best fit and available players for Test series, particularly something as big as the Ashes,\" Dodemaide said. \"That's not a question that we've addressed so far.\" Former Australian captain Ian Chappell has previously told Wide World of Sports that dropping Warner is the easy part, the harder question for selectors is finding a replacement that will improve the side's performance.﻿ That's why Warner's form will be of concern for those in charge, but equally worrying is the records of the contenders to replace him as Usman Khawaja's opening partner. There'd be a certain irony if Bancroft was the man to end Warner's Test career, given the well-documented events of 2018. Now 30-years-old, Bancroft played the last of his 10 Tests in England in 2019, and his scores of 8, 7, 13 and 16 from that series hardly inspire confidence that he's the man to open the batting. Bancroft is the leading runscorer in this summer's Sheffield Shield competition, on Thursday scoring his fourth hundred of the season. But the question is - is he a better player now than when he was last in the Test side? The 30-year-old has had plenty of opportunities over the last five years to make a Test spot his own, without ever providing a compelling reason why he should continue to be picked. His 14 Tests have yielded just three 50s from 26 innings﻿, and an average of 25.29. Brought in to replace Bancroft for the final three Tests in England in 2019, he made 8, 19, 13, 6, 3 and 9. If part of the reason for dropping Warner is his struggles in England, you can't legitimately argue for Harris as his replacement. Unlike Bancroft and Harris, Matt Renshaw has a Test hundred to his name, and he's four years younger than both. Recalled to the Australian team for the Sydney Test against South Africa, he was firstly struck down by COVID-19﻿, while a combination of rain and centuries by Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith meant Renshaw faced only 11 balls before Australia declared. But four runs in three innings in India have hardly strengthened the case for his retention, although the conditions on the subcontinent are about as far removed from England as you can imagine.﻿ ﻿The most interesting of the four options. Head has risen to No.4 in the world rankings on the back of a superb run of form in the middle order. He's not a regular red-ball opener, although he has batted frequently at the top of the order in short-form matches. It raises the age-old question - do you weaken a strength to strengthen a weakness? Moving Head to the top to partner Khawaja would leave a gap at No.5, a position from which Head has swung a number of matches in Australia's favour in recent times. There's absolutely no doubt Head should be in the team, but moving him up the order may not be the solution.﻿ Selectors will be keen to stagger the departures of Warner, Khawaja and Steve Smith, all of whom could be gone within a couple of years. Like Warner, Khawaja is 36, while Smith has also flagged that the end is nigh. While they'll have one eye on the future, next summer's home Test matches against Pakistan and the West Indies might be an easier time to make a change, rather than the high-stakes cauldron of a World Test Championship final and an Ashes series in England. English conditions are tough enough for opening batters who are in form. ﻿Warner is clearly not, and hasn't been for some time. ﻿The fact is he doesn't really deserve to hold his spot for England. The sad reality, however, is that you can't make a strong case for any of the possible replacements. ﻿ For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here ! ﻿","pubDate":"2023-02-23 19:48:08","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/02/489611/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Clinical Australia sneak past resilient India to make World Cup final","link":"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2023-02-23-clinical-australia-sneak-past-resilient-india-to-make-world-cup-final/","keywords":null,"creator":["Keanan Hemmonsbey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia beat India by five runs to reach their seventh consecutive T20 World Cup final, scheduled for Newlands Cricket Ground this Sunday.

He is facing four counts of sexual intercourse without consent and has not yet entered a plea. After matching on Tinder, meeting up for a date and heading back to her home in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, the complainant alleges the cricketer refused to wear a condom and choked her three times. She cannot be identified.Gunathilaka was banned from using Tinder and other social media platforms when he was granted bail by a magistrate in November 2022. The Crown consented to varying his bail on Thursday so that he can once again use WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging platform owned by Facebook-parent Meta, and popular in his home country.Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson clarified the restrictions on his new freedom to use the platform. “It’s not to be used for the purposes of facilitating or managing dating,” she said. Crown prosecutor George Rixon opposed an application to vary a condition on a night-time curfew, however it was granted by the magistrate. Rixon said the curfew was needed to mitigate the risk of offending based on the alleged facts of the complainant’s statement, specifically, Gunathilaka’s “aggressive sexual behaviour” against her. “There are likely to be more opportunities for this alleged offending to occur at night,” he said.Atkinson agreed the alleged offending occurred at night. “But there’s nothing unique about it that it would have occurred at night and couldn’t occur during the day,” she said. Atkinson said it was going to be “more apparent” to the public that Gunathilaka had been charged and was on bail due to his high profile. “Respectfully, I disagree that this person is necessarily immediately identifiable in the community,” Rixon said. Defence barrister Emma Sullivan said media coverage of her client’s case has further increased his profile. “He’s very well known globally and in Australia,” she said. Gunathilaka has been on strict conditions and has been complying with them, Atkinson said, despite Rixon’s submission that compliance with the orders of the court was not a reason to vary his bail. “I’m not satisfied today that it is necessary to keep the curfew in place,” she said. She warned Gunathilaka he would likely face many months in custody waiting for a trial or sentencing if he breached bail. “This needs to be absolute compliance, you’ve been doing it up until now,” she told Gunathilaka. Gunathilaka travelled to Australia with Sri Lanka’s T20 World Cup team but only played in their first game before being ruled out of the competition with a hamstring tear. He was arrested shortly before boarding a flight home with the rest of the team after it bowed out of the tournament.His case is expected to return to court in April.

The award pays homage to Dinesh – a passionate player and avid supporter of the game. While he was always an ardent sportsman from his school going days, his interest in tennis developed much later in life when he would take his children for tennis lessons. He was inspired to take lessons himself and his innate drive pushed him to learn quickly and keep improving himself till he was ready to play competitively. Remarkably, within 6 months of starting lessons, he not only participated in the SSC Open Tennis Championship but reached the semi-finals in the Over-45 Doubles category – an extraordinary achievement for an amateur tennis player. This first tournament set the tone for what was to be a series of impressive achievements for Dinesh in the mere two years since learning to play competitive tennis, reaching the semi-finals and finals of several tournaments, and culminating in him becoming the Singles Champion at the Negombo Senior Tennis Tournament. Dinesh’s passion and dedication for the game extended well beyond the court. He facilitated sponsorships and support needed for many local competitions including international ranking tournaments such as the International Wheelchair Tennis Tournaments, Tennis Nationals, Clay Court Championship 2022 and Teen Tennis Tournaments. He devoted his personal time and funds for a majority of these projects and was committed to the overall development of the local sport and players. Published on By Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka can use the WhatsApp messaging service and go out at night again after having his bail for rape charges varied.Gunathilaka, 31, applied to vary his bail in Sydney’s Downing Centre Local Court today. He is facing four counts of sexual intercourse without consent and has not yet entered a plea. After matching on Tinder, meeting up for a date and heading back to her home in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, the complainant alleges the cricketer refused to wear a condom and choked her three times. She cannot be identified.Gunathilaka was banned from using Tinder and other social media platforms when he was granted bail by a magistrate in November 2022. The Crown consented to varying his bail on Thursday so that he can once again use WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging platform owned by Facebook-parent Meta, and popular in his home country.Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson clarified the restrictions on his new freedom to use the platform. “It’s not to be used for the purposes of facilitating or managing dating,” she said. Crown prosecutor George Rixon opposed an application to vary a condition on a night-time curfew, however it was granted by the magistrate. Rixon said the curfew was needed to mitigate the risk of offending based on the alleged facts of the complainant’s statement, specifically, Gunathilaka’s “aggressive sexual behaviour” against her. “There are likely to be more opportunities for this alleged offending to occur at night,” he said.Atkinson agreed the alleged offending occurred at night. “But there’s nothing unique about it that it would have occurred at night and couldn’t occur during the day,” she said. Atkinson said it was going to be “more apparent” to the public that Gunathilaka had been charged and was on bail due to his high profile. “Respectfully, I disagree that this person is necessarily immediately identifiable in the community,” Rixon said. Defence barrister Emma Sullivan said media coverage of her client’s case has further increased his profile. “He’s very well known globally and in Australia,” she said. Gunathilaka has been on strict conditions and has been complying with them, Atkinson said, despite Rixon’s submission that compliance with the orders of the court was not a reason to vary his bail. “I’m not satisfied today that it is necessary to keep the curfew in place,” she said. She warned Gunathilaka he would likely face many months in custody waiting for a trial or sentencing if he breached bail. “This needs to be absolute compliance, you’ve been doing it up until now,” she told Gunathilaka. Gunathilaka travelled to Australia with Sri Lanka’s T20 World Cup team but only played in their first game before being ruled out of the competition with a hamstring tear. He was arrested shortly before boarding a flight home with the rest of the team after it bowed out of the tournament.His case is expected to return to court in April. Published on By Sri Lanka boys’ and girls’ teams reached the semi-finals of the Junior Davis Cup and the Billie Jean King Cup tournaments currently in progress at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association courts.

With 16 needed off the last over to win, or 15 to tie the scores and force a Super Over, India got 10 and fell just short at 8-167. “One of the best wins I’ve been involved in,” Australia captain Meg Lanning said. “India came hard at us so we knew this score would be hard to defend. But we pulled through in the clutch moments.” The crucial wicket for the Aussies came earlier when Rodrigues tried to ramp a short ball over wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy but only succeeded in edging it to Healy. That ended a partnership of 69 with Kaur that had put India ahead of the required run rate after 10 overs. Australia began to take control again when Kaur fell run out after getting her bat stuck in the ground as she tried to slide it into the crease. \"Can’t be unluckier than that,\" Kaur said of her run out. “Putting the effort in was important and we were happy to go to the last ball. We wanted to fight till the last ball.” Australia has won five of the seven T20 World Cups played, only missing out in 2016 when it lost to West Indies in the final and in the first tournament in 2009 when it lost in the semis. It has now made every final after 2009 and will play either England or host South Africa, who meet in the second semi-final on Saturday morning. Australia's score against India was down to its top four batters, with Healy getting 25, fellow opener Beth Mooney 54 off 37, Lanning 49 not out and Ashleigh Gardner 31 from 18. India also paid for a couple of crucial misses. Wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh dropped a catch off Lanning when the Aussie captain was on 1. Mooney was dropped on 32.

Pakistan-born cricketer Azeem Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire for more than 10 years, had claimed that racism at the club had left him on the brink of suicide. He later deposed before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS) in the UK, detailing his ordeal when he was at the club and how institutional racism was rampant there. Yorkshire removed a majority of its coaching and management staff in the aftermath of the allegations and Lord Kamlesh Patel took over as chairman of the country side and brought about a number of significant changes to counter racism. “It has been reported in a number of news outlets that, in relation to the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) inquiry, the Club has admitted a charge of deletion of data and documents,” read a statement issued by Yorkshire on Thursday following an uproar in the media over the deleted files. “After 5 November 2021, it was discovered that emails and documents, both held electronically by the club and in paper copy, had been irretrievably deleted from both servers and laptops and otherwise destroyed. “The CDC proceedings are ongoing and, as such, we are limited as to what we can say at this time. After a thorough independent investigation it was established that the deletion and destruction of documents date from a time period prior to the appointment of Lord Patel and relate to the allegations of racism and the club’s response to those allegations.” Yorkshire added that it was not certain why and how the deletion happened and who was responsible for the act. “The Club is not prepared to conjecture publicly as to why this occurred, who was responsible or the motivation for doing so. The ICO was of course informed of the position at the time of discovery, and no further action was taken.” The statement said the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had been apprised of the destruction of data, which had said it could be prejudicial to the interests of the game. “The ECB was also informed of the position, which led to a charge being brought on the basis that the conduct (deletion/destruction) may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket and/or which may bring the ECB and/or the game of cricket into disrepute. The Club has admitted this charge, as there was no viable defence in these circumstances.” PTI Yorkshire confirm data related to racism ‘irretrievably deleted’ added by Press Trust of India on 1:31 am February 24, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-02-23 20:01:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stokes won’t mind sacrificing IPL final for England duty","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/02/24/stokes-wont-mind-sacrificing-ipl-final-for-england-duty/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Wellington: World’s premier all-rounder Ben Stokes won’t allow Indian Premier League (IPL) come in the way of national duty, saying he would prefer to fly back and lead England against Ireland in the build-up Test ahead of the high-stakes Ashes series even if his franchise makes the final.

Stokes had missed the last edition of the world’s most popular T20 tournament but is set to wear the yellow Chennai Super Kings (CSK) jersey this season, starting March 31. The IPL final is slated for May 28 while England take on Ireland in the one-off warm-up Test from June 1. CSK play their first game of the season against Lucknow Supergiants on April 3. “Yes, I’ll play,” Stokes said when asked if he would play for England even if CSK qualify for the title clash. “I’ll be making sure that I give myself enough time to get back and play that game (against Ireland).” There has been a debate in international cricket whether players are preferring private leagues over national duty. Stokes said he can’t say about the choice of his England colleagues. Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and Harry Brook all have IPL contracts. “I think it’s a little bit too far ahead to say for others, but one thing I’ve got to look at is we’ve got the Ashes after the Ireland Test, so I’ll probably get round the individuals and ask them what they want to be ready for the Ashes,” Stokes said. “Those five games are obviously the big ones of the summer and you’ve got to think about what lads want, but you also have to think about if something was to happen in that game and we lose someone for the Ashes. “It’s just one of those where you have to weigh up the options of what the individual person actually wants out of that week versus do we really need to play that one? Because I’m obviously right in saying that series is bigger than that game against Ireland.” The five-match Ashes will begin on June 16 in Birmingham.

Do you approach immediately and ask for a selfie? (Also, does anyone ask for autographs any more?) Or, do you play it cool and keep some distance? Advertisement That was the decision facing my 8-year-old son and me during the Super Bowl. We were staying in the Phoenix area but didn’t attend the big game. We chose instead to visit the spring training homes of our favorite baseball teams — the San Diego Padres and the Chicago Cubs. Nothing was happening at Peoria Sports Complex, the ballpark that hosts the Padres, so we headed to Sloan Park. We were the only customers inside the team store when Cubs right fielder Seiya Suzuki walked in with friends. I recognized Suzuki immediately but didn’t want to bug him. So, I tried to ignore the Japanese star was doing the same thing that we were doing — shopping for the latest Cubs gear. Advertisement [ Spring training travel: A guide to what’s new in Arizona for Cubs and White Sox fans ] I wondered, however, if my son might be disappointed if I didn’t capture the moment. So, I awkwardly asked Suzuki if he would take a photo with him. He nodded and I snapped the photo. And that’s the best part about spring training, in my opinion — the casual access to players. Though our trip to Arizona was too early to catch practice or an exhibition game, we came home with a small souvenir. That alone is enough to satisfy until opening day, which is 35 days away. This marks the 25th year the Cubs and White Sox have both gathered in Arizona for spring training, but there have been a variety of fascinating stories throughout the decades and laundry list of locations that have hosted the teams.

Warner has flown home from India after suffering concussion and a broken elbow during the second Test in Delhi. It's raised the distinct possibility that his 103-Test career could be finished. THE MOLE: 'Real test' facing Cowboys after 'ambush' READ MORE: AFL boss' $360 million ultimatum to new team READ MORE: Roosters star takes break after diagnosis﻿ Warner averaged just 9.50 in England in 2019, and has not scored a century in 13 Tests in that country. Based on his record in England as well as his recent form - he averages 29.48 across his last 19 matches - it's hard to make a case for his retention. \"We'll address the Ashes planning later, but we are committed to picking the best fit and available players for Test series, particularly something as big as the Ashes,\" Dodemaide said. \"That's not a question that we've addressed so far.\" Former Australian captain Ian Chappell has previously told Wide World of Sports that dropping Warner is the easy part, the harder question for selectors is finding a replacement that will improve the side's performance.﻿ That's why Warner's form will be of concern for those in charge, but equally worrying is the records of the contenders to replace him as Usman Khawaja's opening partner. There'd be a certain irony if Bancroft was the man to end Warner's Test career, given the well-documented events of 2018. Now 30-years-old, Bancroft played the last of his 10 Tests in England in 2019, and his scores of 8, 7, 13 and 16 from that series hardly inspire confidence that he's the man to open the batting. Bancroft is the leading runscorer in this summer's Sheffield Shield competition, on Thursday scoring his fourth hundred of the season. But the question is - is he a better player now than when he was last in the Test side? The 30-year-old has had plenty of opportunities over the last five years to make a Test spot his own, without ever providing a compelling reason why he should continue to be picked. His 14 Tests have yielded just three 50s from 26 innings﻿, and an average of 25.29. Brought in to replace Bancroft for the final three Tests in England in 2019, he made 8, 19, 13, 6, 3 and 9. If part of the reason for dropping Warner is his struggles in England, you can't legitimately argue for Harris as his replacement. Unlike Bancroft and Harris, Matt Renshaw has a Test hundred to his name, and he's four years younger than both. Recalled to the Australian team for the Sydney Test against South Africa, he was firstly struck down by COVID-19﻿, while a combination of rain and centuries by Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith meant Renshaw faced only 11 balls before Australia declared. But four runs in three innings in India have hardly strengthened the case for his retention, although the conditions on the subcontinent are about as far removed from England as you can imagine.﻿ ﻿The most interesting of the four options. Head has risen to No.4 in the world rankings on the back of a superb run of form in the middle order. He's not a regular red-ball opener, although he has batted frequently at the top of the order in short-form matches. It raises the age-old question - do you weaken a strength to strengthen a weakness? Moving Head to the top to partner Khawaja would leave a gap at No.5, a position from which Head has swung a number of matches in Australia's favour in recent times. There's absolutely no doubt Head should be in the team, but moving him up the order may not be the solution.﻿ Selectors will be keen to stagger the departures of Warner, Khawaja and Steve Smith, all of whom could be gone within a couple of years. Like Warner, Khawaja is 36, while Smith has also flagged that the end is nigh. While they'll have one eye on the future, next summer's home Test matches against Pakistan and the West Indies might be an easier time to make a change, rather than the high-stakes cauldron of a World Test Championship final and an Ashes series in England. English conditions are tough enough for opening batters who are in form. ﻿Warner is clearly not, and hasn't been for some time. ﻿The fact is he doesn't really deserve to hold his spot for England. The sad reality, however, is that you can't make a strong case for any of the possible replacements. ﻿ For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here ! ﻿","pubDate":"2023-02-23 19:48:08","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/02/489611/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Clinical Australia sneak past resilient India to make World Cup final","link":"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2023-02-23-clinical-australia-sneak-past-resilient-india-to-make-world-cup-final/","keywords":null,"creator":["Keanan Hemmonsbey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia beat India by five runs to reach their seventh consecutive T20 World Cup final, scheduled for Newlands Cricket Ground this Sunday.
