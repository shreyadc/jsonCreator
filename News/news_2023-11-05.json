He is extensively thought of one of many nation’s finest ever white-ball gamers however his tame dismissal for only one towards Australia means he has now scored simply 106 runs at a median of 15.14 on the World Cup. “It’s a low point, it hurts a lot,” he stated. “We feel like we’ve let people down and you wear that on your own shoulders.

After Abdullah Shafique’s early dismissal, Fakhar Zaman and Babar took on the opposition bowlers scored maximums for fun and keeping the momentum in their favour even after the game was halted by rain. Zaman struck eleven sixes on the night scoring most sixes by a Pakistan batter in an ODI innings. On the other end, Babar approached the game cautiously, but as soon as he understood the condition of the surface, he shifted through the gears rapidly to contribute to Pakistan’s healthy run rate. After Pakistan’s crucial victory over the Kiwis, Babar spoke about their approach of utlising short boundaries throughout the chase in a game which was marred by rain. “When we started batting, we believed (in ourselves). Inside dressing room, we passed the message that we need one good partnership. Back of the mind, we knew rain was coming, but didn’t expect it to be too much. To be honest, we just planned to build a partnership. I wanted to give strike to Fakhar; we knew we had short boundaries and we tried to utilise it. We were trying to give 100 per cent but in some matches we were not up to the mark. If we win our next match, let’s see. We will try to play positively and we are going match by match,” Babar said. Coming to the match, after losing an early wicket, in the form of opener Abdullah Shafique, Babar and Fakhar came together for a scintillating and rollicking partnership on the back of which Pakistan raced to 200/1 after 25.3 overs, staying ahead of the required score when persistent showers brought an early end to the contest prompting the outcome to be decided by the DLS method. The crowds in Bengaluru were witness to some sparkling batsmanship from both sides, but Fakhar’s ton, arguably one of the finest under pressure in the tournament’s history helped Pakistan prevail in the do-or-die battle. Launching a fierce counter-attack on the Kiwi attack, Fakhar slammed nine sixes en route to a hundred off just 63 balls. While the win gave hopes of qualification to the 1992 World Cup champions, the Kiwis suffered their consecutive fourth defeat of the tournament and now have to win their last round-robin fixture to progress to the business end of the tournament. Pakistan’s win over New Zealand also meant that South Africa became the second team to qualify for the knockout stage by virtue of a superior net run rate of +2.290.

Australian batters were guilty of not converting starts but still managed to post 286 against arch-rivals England. Marnus Labuschagne (71 off 83) recorded his highest score of the tournament. England, whose formidable batting line-up has massively underperformed in their title defence, had a good opportunity to pick up a win after four consecutive losses. Amid heavy dew, Ben Stokes (64 off 90) kept the chase alive while batting alongside Dawid Malan (50 off 64 ) and Moeen Ali (42 off 43) before Zampa landed the killer blows to stop England at 253 in 48.1 overs. Chris Woakes (32 off 33) tried his best towards the end but it wasn't enough. Zampa first had out-of-form England skipper Jos Buttler (1) caught in the deep before getting rid of Stokes in a soft dismissal. It was a short ball on the leg side and Stokes ended up offering a simple catch to Stoinis at short-fine leg. It was all over for England when Moeen's slog sweep off Zampa arrived straight into the hands of David Warner at deep mid-wicket. England batters including Stokes, Moeen and Dawid Malan did exhibit the strokeplay they are known for but could not stay long enough to see their team through.

He got lucky in the first ball of the England innings as Jonny Bairstow got a faint edge to one swinging down the leg-side. Joe Root was set up by Starc with a series of inswingers before he pushed one wide and the England number three got the outside edge. Australia's sharp fielding also contributed to their fifth win in a row. Earlier, Labuschange, Steve Smith (44 off 52), Cameron Green (47 off 52) and Marcus Stoinis (35 off 32) were among the batters who failed to cash in on their starts. Leggie Adil Rashid (2/38) was frugal as usual while pacer Mark Wood (2/70) was back to his menacing ways, using the short ball to hurry the opposition batters, especially Green. Chris Woakes (4/54) delivered with the new ball for the second game in a row, removing the dangerous opening duo of David Warner (15) and Travid Head (11). He also struck twice in the death overs. England were able to get the early wickets after putting Australia in to bat. Head handed a regulation catch to Joe Root at first slip off an angled away ball from Woakes. Three overs later, Warner mistimed a pull to give Woakes his second wicket, leaving Australia at 38 for two in the sixth over. Smith and Labuschagne, who both have not had the best of times in the tournament, then shared a 75-run stand off 96 balls. It was hard work in the middle for the seasoned batters who found the boundaries hard to come by. Following Smith's fall, Josh Inglis (3) tried to up the scoring rate but fell while attempting a reverse sweep off Rashid. Green, who looked uncomfortable against the short-pitched stuff from Wood, did hit some crisp boundaries off the other bowlers. His cover drive off Woakes was the highlight of his knock. He saw his leg stump uprooted after missing a slog sweep off left-arm pacer David Willey. Stoinis then got into the action depositing Rashid and Liam Livingstone into the stands over deep mid-wicket before getting caught in the same spot off a short ball from the latter. It seemed Australia would not be able to use their full quota of overs but Adam Zampa's timely cameo of 29 from 19 balls took the team close to 300.","pubDate":"2023-11-04 17:06:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"moneycontrol","source_priority":4662,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"cabb77dc13b6ed6344bfb7a9a8ffa3fb","title":"England’s World Cup title defence is officially OVER after a 33 run defeat to Australia… after Jos Buttler’s side lamely fail with the bat again in India","link":"https://247newsaroundtheworld.com/sports/englands-world-cup-title-defence-is-officially-over-after-a-33-run-defeat-to-australia-after-jos-buttlers-side-lamely-fail-with-the-bat-again-in-india/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["247 News Around The World"],"video_url":null,"description":"247 News Around The World 247 News Around The World England have finally been put out of their World Cup misery after… The post England’s World Cup title defence is officially OVER after a 33 run defeat to Australia… after Jos Buttler’s side lamely fail with the bat again in India appeared first on 247 News Around The World.","content":"England have finally been put out of their World Cup misery after their hopes of a consolation win over Australia fell foul of another lame effort with the bat. Realistically, of course, they were already out. But it was in keeping with what must go down as one of the worst World Cup defences in any sport that their fate was mathematically sealed by the old enemy. The pressure that was already mounting on captain Jos Buttler and head coach Matthew Mott has just gone up another notch. The whole thing has been a giant embarrassment, made worse by the failure of anyone in the dressing-room to adequately explain what on earth has gone wrong. If any moment summed up both this latest defeat – by 33 runs – and the general haplessness of the last month, it came when Jos Buttler lofted Adam Zampa straight to Cameron Green at long-off, and trudged off for a single. England’s captain has cut an increasingly careworn figure in India, unable either to diagnose his team’s travails, nor to prevent them. His latest misadventure left him with a tally of 106 runs at an average of 15 – a travesty for a player of his talents. Jos Buttler (right) and his England side have been knocked out of the World Cup This tournament’s black mark now sits alongside the gold star he earned at last year’s T20 World Cup. It remains unclear which competition more accurately reflects his standing as a leader. Chasing a gettable 287 to maintain a theoretical interest in retaining their title, England lost Jonny Bairstow first ball, caught behind down the leg side off Mitchell Starc, and Joe Root soon after. Dawid Malan and Ben Stokes responded with careful fifties, but Malan top-edged a hook off Pat Cummins, and Stokes paddle-swept leg-spinner Adam Zampa to short fine leg for 64, shouting ‘oh no!’ as he played the stroke. The expression will go down as this team’s epitaph. Frankly, they did not deserve to be bailed out by another Stokes special, and all that remains now is for England to sneak into eighth place and qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy. To achieve even that lowly goal, though, the Netherlands must first be beaten in Pune on Wednesday, then – in all likelihood – Pakistan vanquished in Kolkata. They may yet be dancing in the streets of Amsterdam and Islamabad. Back at the venue where their nightmare began with a nine-wicket defeat by New Zealand, England played as if they have learned little in the meantime. Even with Malan hoicking the last ball of the 10th over from Josh Hazlewood for six, a powerplay score of 38 for two was their lowest of a tournament in which they have consistently promised to attack – and consistently failed to deliver. Bairstow’s duck took his haul here to 141 at 20, Root’s innings of 13 – after he was badly dropped by Stoinis at cover on eight – to 188 at 26. With Buttler not reaching 50 even once, three of the central figures in their 2019 triumph have vanished almost without trace. Stokes played carefully, determined not to give it away as he had against India in Lucknow, yet even the 112 runs he has made in his four innings have chewed up 181 balls. He scores more quickly in Test cricket. Moeen Ali came and went for a run-a-ball 42 before providing the superb Zampa with his third wicket, and England had turned down the faintest of chances offered them by Pakistan’s miraculous victory over New Zealand earlier in the day. Their fate was sealed when Rachin Ravindra (left) and Kane Williamson (right) led New Zealand to victory over Pakistan on Saturday A New Zealand win – which would have guaranteed England’s elimination even before their game was over – looked certain after they racked up 401 for six in Bangalore. But Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman thrashed 11 sixes in an 81-ball 126 not out, taking his side ahead on DLS when rain arrived. England’s bowlers did their bit, with Chris Woakes removing Australia’s dangerous openers David Warner and Travis Head cheaply on his way to four wickets, and Adil Rashid producing another tidy spell of leg-breaks and googlies. But they allowed Zampa, little better than a rabbit, to bash 29 off 19 balls, and 247 for eight became 286, which felt like too many for a side whose previous four totals had been 215, 170, 156 and 129. Above all, perhaps, this game confirmed a curious stubbornness in England’s set-up. They have now lost nine of the last 10 ODIs in which they have chased, and they keep refusing to pick Harry Brook. England have spent much of the last eight years showing the world how to play white-ball cricket. The sadness is that no one in India will miss them when they fly home next weekend.

After Abdullah Shafique’s early dismissal, Fakhar Zaman and Babar took on the opposition bowlers scored maximums for fun and keeping the momentum in their favour even after the game was halted by rain. Zaman struck eleven sixes on the night scoring most sixes by a Pakistan batter in an ODI innings. On the other end, Babar approached the game cautiously, but as soon as he understood the condition of the surface, he shifted through the gears rapidly to contribute to Pakistan’s healthy run rate. After Pakistan’s crucial victory over the Kiwis, Babar spoke about their approach of utlising short boundaries throughout the chase in a game which was marred by rain. “When we started batting, we believed (in ourselves). Inside dressing room, we passed the message that we need one good partnership. Back of the mind, we knew rain was coming, but didn’t expect it to be too much. To be honest, we just planned to build a partnership. I wanted to give strike to Fakhar; we knew we had short boundaries and we tried to utilise it. We were trying to give 100 per cent but in some matches we were not up to the mark. If we win our next match, let’s see. We will try to play positively and we are going match by match,” Babar said. Coming to the match, after losing an early wicket, in the form of opener Abdullah Shafique, Babar and Fakhar came together for a scintillating and rollicking partnership on the back of which Pakistan raced to 200/1 after 25.3 overs, staying ahead of the required score when persistent showers brought an early end to the contest prompting the outcome to be decided by the DLS method. The crowds in Bengaluru were witness to some sparkling batsmanship from both sides, but Fakhar’s ton, arguably one of the finest under pressure in the tournament’s history helped Pakistan prevail in the do-or-die battle. Launching a fierce counter-attack on the Kiwi attack, Fakhar slammed nine sixes en route to a hundred off just 63 balls. While the win gave hopes of qualification to the 1992 World Cup champions, the Kiwis suffered their consecutive fourth defeat of the tournament and now have to win their last round-robin fixture to progress to the business end of the tournament. Pakistan’s win over New Zealand also meant that South Africa became the second team to qualify for the knockout stage by virtue of a superior net run rate of +2.290.

Australian batters were guilty of not converting starts but still managed to post 286 against arch-rivals England. Marnus Labuschagne (71 off 83) recorded his highest score of the tournament. England, whose formidable batting line-up has massively underperformed in their title defence, had a good opportunity to pick up a win after four consecutive losses. Amid heavy dew, Ben Stokes (64 off 90) kept the chase alive while batting alongside Dawid Malan (50 off 64 ) and Moeen Ali (42 off 43) before Zampa landed the killer blows to stop England at 253 in 48.1 overs. Chris Woakes (32 off 33) tried his best towards the end but it wasn't enough. Zampa first had out-of-form England skipper Jos Buttler (1) caught in the deep before getting rid of Stokes in a soft dismissal. It was a short ball on the leg side and Stokes ended up offering a simple catch to Stoinis at short-fine leg. It was all over for England when Moeen's slog sweep off Zampa arrived straight into the hands of David Warner at deep mid-wicket. England batters including Stokes, Moeen and Dawid Malan did exhibit the strokeplay they are known for but could not stay long enough to see their team through.

He got lucky in the first ball of the England innings as Jonny Bairstow got a faint edge to one swinging down the leg-side. Joe Root was set up by Starc with a series of inswingers before he pushed one wide and the England number three got the outside edge. Australia's sharp fielding also contributed to their fifth win in a row. Earlier, Labuschange, Steve Smith (44 off 52), Cameron Green (47 off 52) and Marcus Stoinis (35 off 32) were among the batters who failed to cash in on their starts. Leggie Adil Rashid (2/38) was frugal as usual while pacer Mark Wood (2/70) was back to his menacing ways, using the short ball to hurry the opposition batters, especially Green. Chris Woakes (4/54) delivered with the new ball for the second game in a row, removing the dangerous opening duo of David Warner (15) and Travid Head (11). He also struck twice in the death overs. England were able to get the early wickets after putting Australia in to bat. Head handed a regulation catch to Joe Root at first slip off an angled away ball from Woakes. Three overs later, Warner mistimed a pull to give Woakes his second wicket, leaving Australia at 38 for two in the sixth over. Smith and Labuschagne, who both have not had the best of times in the tournament, then shared a 75-run stand off 96 balls. It was hard work in the middle for the seasoned batters who found the boundaries hard to come by. Following Smith's fall, Josh Inglis (3) tried to up the scoring rate but fell while attempting a reverse sweep off Rashid. Green, who looked uncomfortable against the short-pitched stuff from Wood, did hit some crisp boundaries off the other bowlers. His cover drive off Woakes was the highlight of his knock. He saw his leg stump uprooted after missing a slog sweep off left-arm pacer David Willey. Stoinis then got into the action depositing Rashid and Liam Livingstone into the stands over deep mid-wicket before getting caught in the same spot off a short ball from the latter. It seemed Australia would not be able to use their full quota of overs but Adam Zampa's timely cameo of 29 from 19 balls took the team close to 300.","pubDate":"2023-11-04 17:06:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"moneycontrol","source_priority":4662,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"cabb77dc13b6ed6344bfb7a9a8ffa3fb","title":"England’s World Cup title defence is officially OVER after a 33 run defeat to Australia… after Jos Buttler’s side lamely fail with the bat again in India","link":"https://247newsaroundtheworld.com/sports/englands-world-cup-title-defence-is-officially-over-after-a-33-run-defeat-to-australia-after-jos-buttlers-side-lamely-fail-with-the-bat-again-in-india/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["247 News Around The World"],"video_url":null,"description":"247 News Around The World 247 News Around The World England have finally been put out of their World Cup misery after… The post England’s World Cup title defence is officially OVER after a 33 run defeat to Australia… after Jos Buttler’s side lamely fail with the bat again in India appeared first on 247 News Around The World.","content":"England have finally been put out of their World Cup misery after their hopes of a consolation win over Australia fell foul of another lame effort with the bat. Realistically, of course, they were already out. But it was in keeping with what must go down as one of the worst World Cup defences in any sport that their fate was mathematically sealed by the old enemy. The pressure that was already mounting on captain Jos Buttler and head coach Matthew Mott has just gone up another notch. The whole thing has been a giant embarrassment, made worse by the failure of anyone in the dressing-room to adequately explain what on earth has gone wrong. If any moment summed up both this latest defeat – by 33 runs – and the general haplessness of the last month, it came when Jos Buttler lofted Adam Zampa straight to Cameron Green at long-off, and trudged off for a single. England’s captain has cut an increasingly careworn figure in India, unable either to diagnose his team’s travails, nor to prevent them. His latest misadventure left him with a tally of 106 runs at an average of 15 – a travesty for a player of his talents. Jos Buttler (right) and his England side have been knocked out of the World Cup This tournament’s black mark now sits alongside the gold star he earned at last year’s T20 World Cup. It remains unclear which competition more accurately reflects his standing as a leader. Chasing a gettable 287 to maintain a theoretical interest in retaining their title, England lost Jonny Bairstow first ball, caught behind down the leg side off Mitchell Starc, and Joe Root soon after. Dawid Malan and Ben Stokes responded with careful fifties, but Malan top-edged a hook off Pat Cummins, and Stokes paddle-swept leg-spinner Adam Zampa to short fine leg for 64, shouting ‘oh no!’ as he played the stroke. The expression will go down as this team’s epitaph. Frankly, they did not deserve to be bailed out by another Stokes special, and all that remains now is for England to sneak into eighth place and qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy. To achieve even that lowly goal, though, the Netherlands must first be beaten in Pune on Wednesday, then – in all likelihood – Pakistan vanquished in Kolkata. They may yet be dancing in the streets of Amsterdam and Islamabad. Back at the venue where their nightmare began with a nine-wicket defeat by New Zealand, England played as if they have learned little in the meantime. Even with Malan hoicking the last ball of the 10th over from Josh Hazlewood for six, a powerplay score of 38 for two was their lowest of a tournament in which they have consistently promised to attack – and consistently failed to deliver. Bairstow’s duck took his haul here to 141 at 20, Root’s innings of 13 – after he was badly dropped by Stoinis at cover on eight – to 188 at 26. With Buttler not reaching 50 even once, three of the central figures in their 2019 triumph have vanished almost without trace. Stokes played carefully, determined not to give it away as he had against India in Lucknow, yet even the 112 runs he has made in his four innings have chewed up 181 balls. He scores more quickly in Test cricket. Moeen Ali came and went for a run-a-ball 42 before providing the superb Zampa with his third wicket, and England had turned down the faintest of chances offered them by Pakistan’s miraculous victory over New Zealand earlier in the day. Their fate was sealed when Rachin Ravindra (left) and Kane Williamson (right) led New Zealand to victory over Pakistan on Saturday A New Zealand win – which would have guaranteed England’s elimination even before their game was over – looked certain after they racked up 401 for six in Bangalore. But Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman thrashed 11 sixes in an 81-ball 126 not out, taking his side ahead on DLS when rain arrived. England’s bowlers did their bit, with Chris Woakes removing Australia’s dangerous openers David Warner and Travis Head cheaply on his way to four wickets, and Adil Rashid producing another tidy spell of leg-breaks and googlies. But they allowed Zampa, little better than a rabbit, to bash 29 off 19 balls, and 247 for eight became 286, which felt like too many for a side whose previous four totals had been 215, 170, 156 and 129. Above all, perhaps, this game confirmed a curious stubbornness in England’s set-up. They have now lost nine of the last 10 ODIs in which they have chased, and they keep refusing to pick Harry Brook. England have spent much of the last eight years showing the world how to play white-ball cricket. The sadness is that no one in India will miss them when they fly home next weekend.

The 2019 champions slumped to a sixth defeat in seven matches to lastly finish their dim and distant hopes of reaching the knockout phases, permitting rivals Australia to use the killer blow in Ahmedabad. Having already misplaced to New Zealand, Afghanistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and India it was hardly a shock to see England crushed by 33 runs. However, the continued downward spiral of a once-feared batting line-up continues to bemuse. Here they have been rounded up for 253 and have now misplaced 67 of a potential 69 wickets within the competitors. While their bowling assault has raised its sport previously two video games, the runs have dried up in alarming vogue, rendering England unable to compete. And a forlorn Buttler, who seems to be discovering his post-match appearances more and more carrying, put his personal poor returns entrance and centre on the record of issues. He is extensively thought of one of many nation’s finest ever white-ball gamers however his tame dismissal for only one towards Australia means he has now scored simply 106 runs at a median of 15.14 on the World Cup. “It’s a low point, it hurts a lot,” he stated. “We feel like we’ve let people down and you wear that on your own shoulders. You want to lead from the front as a captain. “My own form has really hurt us. Obviously, I’ve had a pivotal position in the batting line-up, so to play as poorly as I have done has had a big effect on the team. “Coming into the tournament I felt in fantastic form, as good as I’ve been in.

They want to complete within the prime eight to seal a spot on the Champions Trophy in 2025 and are presently an outdoor wager to take action. So, whereas they might be forgiven for pining for the exit lounge, the stakes are too excessive. “Exactly that,” Buttler added. “You know, the Champions Trophy is a tournament we want to be involved in and if we’re going to be involved in it, we need to win some games of cricket. “We threatened today but it’s still not good enough.” Australia’s Mitchell Starc took a jab at England in an interview with host broadcaster Star Sports, resurrecting a well-known theme from this summer time’s Ashes sequence.

After Abdullah Shafique’s early dismissal, Fakhar Zaman and Babar took on the opposition bowlers scored maximums for fun and keeping the momentum in their favour even after the game was halted by rain. Zaman struck eleven sixes on the night scoring most sixes by a Pakistan batter in an ODI innings. On the other end, Babar approached the game cautiously, but as soon as he understood the condition of the surface, he shifted through the gears rapidly to contribute to Pakistan’s healthy run rate. After Pakistan’s crucial victory over the Kiwis, Babar spoke about their approach of utlising short boundaries throughout the chase in a game which was marred by rain. “When we started batting, we believed (in ourselves). Inside dressing room, we passed the message that we need one good partnership. Back of the mind, we knew rain was coming, but didn’t expect it to be too much. To be honest, we just planned to build a partnership. I wanted to give strike to Fakhar; we knew we had short boundaries and we tried to utilise it. We were trying to give 100 per cent but in some matches we were not up to the mark. If we win our next match, let’s see. We will try to play positively and we are going match by match,” Babar said. Coming to the match, after losing an early wicket, in the form of opener Abdullah Shafique, Babar and Fakhar came together for a scintillating and rollicking partnership on the back of which Pakistan raced to 200/1 after 25.3 overs, staying ahead of the required score when persistent showers brought an early end to the contest prompting the outcome to be decided by the DLS method. The crowds in Bengaluru were witness to some sparkling batsmanship from both sides, but Fakhar’s ton, arguably one of the finest under pressure in the tournament’s history helped Pakistan prevail in the do-or-die battle. Launching a fierce counter-attack on the Kiwi attack, Fakhar slammed nine sixes en route to a hundred off just 63 balls. While the win gave hopes of qualification to the 1992 World Cup champions, the Kiwis suffered their consecutive fourth defeat of the tournament and now have to win their last round-robin fixture to progress to the business end of the tournament. Pakistan’s win over New Zealand also meant that South Africa became the second team to qualify for the knockout stage by virtue of a superior net run rate of +2.290.

Australian batters were guilty of not converting starts but still managed to post 286 against arch-rivals England. Marnus Labuschagne (71 off 83) recorded his highest score of the tournament. England, whose formidable batting line-up has massively underperformed in their title defence, had a good opportunity to pick up a win after four consecutive losses. Amid heavy dew, Ben Stokes (64 off 90) kept the chase alive while batting alongside Dawid Malan (50 off 64 ) and Moeen Ali (42 off 43) before Zampa landed the killer blows to stop England at 253 in 48.1 overs. Chris Woakes (32 off 33) tried his best towards the end but it wasn't enough. Zampa first had out-of-form England skipper Jos Buttler (1) caught in the deep before getting rid of Stokes in a soft dismissal. It was a short ball on the leg side and Stokes ended up offering a simple catch to Stoinis at short-fine leg. It was all over for England when Moeen's slog sweep off Zampa arrived straight into the hands of David Warner at deep mid-wicket. England batters including Stokes, Moeen and Dawid Malan did exhibit the strokeplay they are known for but could not stay long enough to see their team through.

He got lucky in the first ball of the England innings as Jonny Bairstow got a faint edge to one swinging down the leg-side. Joe Root was set up by Starc with a series of inswingers before he pushed one wide and the England number three got the outside edge. Australia's sharp fielding also contributed to their fifth win in a row. Earlier, Labuschange, Steve Smith (44 off 52), Cameron Green (47 off 52) and Marcus Stoinis (35 off 32) were among the batters who failed to cash in on their starts. Leggie Adil Rashid (2/38) was frugal as usual while pacer Mark Wood (2/70) was back to his menacing ways, using the short ball to hurry the opposition batters, especially Green. Chris Woakes (4/54) delivered with the new ball for the second game in a row, removing the dangerous opening duo of David Warner (15) and Travid Head (11). He also struck twice in the death overs. England were able to get the early wickets after putting Australia in to bat. Head handed a regulation catch to Joe Root at first slip off an angled away ball from Woakes. Three overs later, Warner mistimed a pull to give Woakes his second wicket, leaving Australia at 38 for two in the sixth over. Smith and Labuschagne, who both have not had the best of times in the tournament, then shared a 75-run stand off 96 balls. It was hard work in the middle for the seasoned batters who found the boundaries hard to come by. Following Smith's fall, Josh Inglis (3) tried to up the scoring rate but fell while attempting a reverse sweep off Rashid. Green, who looked uncomfortable against the short-pitched stuff from Wood, did hit some crisp boundaries off the other bowlers. His cover drive off Woakes was the highlight of his knock. He saw his leg stump uprooted after missing a slog sweep off left-arm pacer David Willey. Stoinis then got into the action depositing Rashid and Liam Livingstone into the stands over deep mid-wicket before getting caught in the same spot off a short ball from the latter. It seemed Australia would not be able to use their full quota of overs but Adam Zampa's timely cameo of 29 from 19 balls took the team close to 300.","pubDate":"2023-11-04 17:06:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"moneycontrol","source_priority":4662,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"cabb77dc13b6ed6344bfb7a9a8ffa3fb","title":"England’s World Cup title defence is officially OVER after a 33 run defeat to Australia… after Jos Buttler’s side lamely fail with the bat again in India","link":"https://247newsaroundtheworld.com/sports/englands-world-cup-title-defence-is-officially-over-after-a-33-run-defeat-to-australia-after-jos-buttlers-side-lamely-fail-with-the-bat-again-in-india/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["247 News Around The World"],"video_url":null,"description":"247 News Around The World 247 News Around The World England have finally been put out of their World Cup misery after… The post England’s World Cup title defence is officially OVER after a 33 run defeat to Australia… after Jos Buttler’s side lamely fail with the bat again in India appeared first on 247 News Around The World.","content":"England have finally been put out of their World Cup misery after their hopes of a consolation win over Australia fell foul of another lame effort with the bat. Realistically, of course, they were already out. But it was in keeping with what must go down as one of the worst World Cup defences in any sport that their fate was mathematically sealed by the old enemy. The pressure that was already mounting on captain Jos Buttler and head coach Matthew Mott has just gone up another notch. The whole thing has been a giant embarrassment, made worse by the failure of anyone in the dressing-room to adequately explain what on earth has gone wrong. If any moment summed up both this latest defeat – by 33 runs – and the general haplessness of the last month, it came when Jos Buttler lofted Adam Zampa straight to Cameron Green at long-off, and trudged off for a single. England’s captain has cut an increasingly careworn figure in India, unable either to diagnose his team’s travails, nor to prevent them. His latest misadventure left him with a tally of 106 runs at an average of 15 – a travesty for a player of his talents. Jos Buttler (right) and his England side have been knocked out of the World Cup This tournament’s black mark now sits alongside the gold star he earned at last year’s T20 World Cup. It remains unclear which competition more accurately reflects his standing as a leader. Chasing a gettable 287 to maintain a theoretical interest in retaining their title, England lost Jonny Bairstow first ball, caught behind down the leg side off Mitchell Starc, and Joe Root soon after. Dawid Malan and Ben Stokes responded with careful fifties, but Malan top-edged a hook off Pat Cummins, and Stokes paddle-swept leg-spinner Adam Zampa to short fine leg for 64, shouting ‘oh no!’ as he played the stroke. The expression will go down as this team’s epitaph. Frankly, they did not deserve to be bailed out by another Stokes special, and all that remains now is for England to sneak into eighth place and qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy. To achieve even that lowly goal, though, the Netherlands must first be beaten in Pune on Wednesday, then – in all likelihood – Pakistan vanquished in Kolkata. They may yet be dancing in the streets of Amsterdam and Islamabad. Back at the venue where their nightmare began with a nine-wicket defeat by New Zealand, England played as if they have learned little in the meantime. Even with Malan hoicking the last ball of the 10th over from Josh Hazlewood for six, a powerplay score of 38 for two was their lowest of a tournament in which they have consistently promised to attack – and consistently failed to deliver. Bairstow’s duck took his haul here to 141 at 20, Root’s innings of 13 – after he was badly dropped by Stoinis at cover on eight – to 188 at 26. With Buttler not reaching 50 even once, three of the central figures in their 2019 triumph have vanished almost without trace. Stokes played carefully, determined not to give it away as he had against India in Lucknow, yet even the 112 runs he has made in his four innings have chewed up 181 balls. He scores more quickly in Test cricket. Moeen Ali came and went for a run-a-ball 42 before providing the superb Zampa with his third wicket, and England had turned down the faintest of chances offered them by Pakistan’s miraculous victory over New Zealand earlier in the day. Their fate was sealed when Rachin Ravindra (left) and Kane Williamson (right) led New Zealand to victory over Pakistan on Saturday A New Zealand win – which would have guaranteed England’s elimination even before their game was over – looked certain after they racked up 401 for six in Bangalore. But Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman thrashed 11 sixes in an 81-ball 126 not out, taking his side ahead on DLS when rain arrived. England’s bowlers did their bit, with Chris Woakes removing Australia’s dangerous openers David Warner and Travis Head cheaply on his way to four wickets, and Adil Rashid producing another tidy spell of leg-breaks and googlies. But they allowed Zampa, little better than a rabbit, to bash 29 off 19 balls, and 247 for eight became 286, which felt like too many for a side whose previous four totals had been 215, 170, 156 and 129. Above all, perhaps, this game confirmed a curious stubbornness in England’s set-up. They have now lost nine of the last 10 ODIs in which they have chased, and they keep refusing to pick Harry Brook. England have spent much of the last eight years showing the world how to play white-ball cricket. The sadness is that no one in India will miss them when they fly home next weekend.

Jos Buttler’s side have fallen far short of all expectations surrounding the defending champions when they took off for India at the start of October, having recorded just one win from their six matches so far at the tournament. Ben Stokes , who came out of retirement to help the team defend their title, admitted on the eve of the Australia match that England have been ‘crap’, and it is a statement that is hard to argue with. England have one big opportunity against Pat Cummins ’ side to restore some pride to the side, especially after the Australia captain could barely suppress laughter when asked about Buttler’s side’s fortunes at the end of October.
