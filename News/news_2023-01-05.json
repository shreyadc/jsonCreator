Nortje was the ProteasтАЩ star man as he removed Warner cheaply for 10 and late in the day denied Labuschagne (79) his 11th Test hundred. As bad light and rain conspired to prematurely end the first day, Australia were 147 for two with Usman Khawaja, who averages 98 in Sydney Tests, unbeaten on 54 and Steven Smith yet to score. Nortje got the big breakthrough with a ripper, taking the edge of LabuschagneтАЩs bat to get him caught behind and end his 151-ball stay. тАЬI was trying to hit good areas, not trying to be fancy, just trying to keep it simple and try to hit the wicket as hard as I could,тАЭ Nortje said of the crucial dismissal. тАЬLuckily I got something out of it. It wasnтАЩt really a big set-up, just more to try and stay consistent and luckily we got some nip and bounce there.тАЭ The pacer earlier struck in his second over of the day when he had Melbourne Test double-centurion Warner caught at slip by Marco Jansen for 10. No sooner had Smith arrived at the wicket after LabuschagneтАЩs departure that the players left the field for bad light for the final time. тАЬDefinitely very frustrated. Obviously, it always makes you very angry as a batter when you get out and then everyone walks with you off the field,тАЭ Labuschagne said of his dismissal. тАЬBut at the end of the day he bowled a really good set there and that one obviously just kicked.тАЭ It is the sixth bedevilled Sydney Test out of the past seven to be affected by rain. тАШThought it was outтАЩ There was controversy earlier in LabuschagneтАЩs innings when on 70 he edged Jansen to Simon Harmer at slip. The on-field umpires referred the decision with a soft signal of out, only for third umpire Richard Kettleborough to rule that the ball had touched the ground between the fingers of Harmer. Nortje said of the decision: тАЬAll of us thought it was out. Simon was convinced that it went straight in and from the angles, to us it looked as though he got his fingers underneath itтАж so unfortunately we didnтАЩt get that one.тАЭ Khawaja also survived a review straight after lunch on 25 as he reverse-swept Harmer and was given out leg before wicket, but replays showed the ball touching the glove. The opening day was also marked by Matt Renshaw, recalled for his first Test for Australia since April 2018, returning a positive Covid-19 test after the toss was taken and the team composition confirmed. But team officials said he would continue to play in the match with his symptoms only described as mild. Renshaw was transferred to a separate dressing room from his teammates where he will prepare for the rest of the match, and spent most of play sitting away from the team runners near the Australian dug-out. Marnus Labuschagne (L) and Usman Khawaja both scored fifties to put Australia in a commanding position in the third Test against South Africa. PHOTO/AFP Skipper Pat Cummins won his fifth successive toss and decided to play an extra spinner with left-armer Ashton Agar, and Renshaw coming in to bolster the batting, squeezing out in-form paceman Scott Boland on a dry cracking Sydney Cricket Ground pitch. South Africa did likewise, with off-spinner Harmer ousting Lungi Ngidi while Heinrich Klaasen replaced Theunis de Bruyn at number three. The Australians have already wrapped up the three-match series after hammering the Proteas by an innings and 182 runs in Melbourne following a six-wicket rout in the opener in Brisbane inside two days.

His heroics helped India defend a modest total at the Wankhede Stadium. He took the 4 wickets and conceded only 22 runs in his quota of four overs. Earlier, it was only Pragyan Ojha and Barinder Sran, who claimed 4 wickets in a match playing for India. Batting first, India posted a modest total of 162 runs on the scoreboard. Thanks to Axar Patel and Deepak Hooda as the duo stitched a 68-run partnership for the 6th wicket when team India was struggling at 94/5. India desperately needed a good start, particularly with the kind of performances the team Sri Lanka has put up in recent months. Shivam Mavi gave India a perfect start as he clean-bowled Pathum Nissanka to claim his maiden wicket in the very first over of his spell. He then claimed the wicket of Dhananjaya De Silva in his second over. Mavi again struck twice in his second spell by taking the wickets of Hasaranga and Theekshana. Other fast bowlers like Harshal Patel and Umran Malik supported the 24-year-old by taking wickets at regular intervals to keep the Sri Lankan team under pressure. However, Chamika Karunaratne smashed a couple of sixes to take the match to the final over. With 13 needed off the last 6 balls, Karunaratne gave his Sri Lanka a chance by hitting a six in the final over, but Azar Patel managed to restrict the Lankan batsman from scoring the required runs. тАЬDream debut for Shivam Mavi the fabulous performance (sic),тАЭ wrote a user. тАЬSuperb Debut For #shivam Mavi,тАЭ tweeted another.

On December 30, early in the morning, Pant suffered multiple injuries when his car collided with a road divider and caught fire on the Delhi-Dehradun highway. The horrific car accident happened between Manglaur and Narsan in the Haridwar district in the state of Uttarakhand. The 25-year old is currently admitted at Max Hospital in Dehradun after being initially taken to Saksham Hospital Multispecialty and Trauma Centre. He was on his way to his hometown Roorkee from New Delhi and was driving his Mercedes car. In the latest development, (DDCA) Director confirmed that Pant will now be taken to Mumbai for further treatment and recovery from the injuries. тАЬHe (Rishabh Pant) will be shifted to Mumbai today. To which hospital where he will be admitted, will be told later,тАЭ said Sharma to IANS. As per an official statement from the BCCI on Friday afternoon, Pant has two cuts on his forehead, a ligament tear in his right knee and has also hurt his right wrist, ankle, and toe and has suffered abrasion injuries on his back after the car accident. Later in the evening, a medical bulletin said the results of PantтАЩs MRI of the brain and spine came out as normal. It added that Pant also underwent plastic surgery to manage his facial injuries, lacerated wounds and abrasions. But excessive pain and swelling meant that PantтАЩs MRI of right knee and ankle was held back. Sharma added that rest of the tests, including the MRI, will now happen in Mumbai. тАЬAll of his tests (including the MRI) will happen there and he will be taken care of very well. God willing, everything will be fine,тАЭ he added. The DDCA Director earlier on Monday had said that Rishabh had been shifted to a private suite from the ICU at Max Hospital, Dehradun, due to a high risk of catching infection. Pant was part of the India Test squad that sealed a 2-0 series victory over Bangladesh in Dhaka in December 2022. In that match which ended on December 25, he hit a match-winning 93 in the first innings of the second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium.","pubDate":"2023-01-04

In what turned out to be a special first appearance in the blue shirt, Mavi picked up four wickets and helped India win the game by a narrow margin of two runs. Mavi's 4 for 22 was the third-best T20I figures for India on debut after Barinder Sran (4 for 10) in 2016 and Pragyan Ojha (4 for 21) in 2009. Having played for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) from 2018 to 2022 in the Indian Premier League (IPL), Mavi said that he was less nervous on Tuesday in his maiden game for India, thanks to his experience in the Indian T20 league.\"The landing zone was a little slippery. Was waiting for six years after playing U19. Had to work hard in those six years - got injured as well. For a while it looked like my dream will remain a dream. But I kept at it.

Mavi, who is set to play under Hardik at Gujarat Titans (GT) in the upcoming edition of IPL, has so far picked up 30 wickets in 32 games.\"The conversation was very simple, I have seen him (Mavi) bowl well in the IPL and I know what his strengths are, just back yourself and don't worry about getting hit,\" said Hardik in the post-match presentation. After India picked up five wickets inside 10 overs, Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka took matters into his hands. He struck three fours and as many sixes in his knock of 45 off 27 balls that brought back the tourists into the game. \"I want to put this team in difficult situations because it will help us in big games (on Axar bowling the last over). Bilaterals we are very good at and this is how we are going to challenge ourselves. To be honest, all the young guns got us out of the situation today,\" added Hardik. The GT captain bowled three overs on Tuesday and gave away just 12 runs. He said he has been bowling in the nets and has been working on bowling inswingers.\"Now, yes definitely (getting used to being called captain). It was just cramps. Now I have a tendency to scare people but if I am smiling then everything is fine. I did not sleep well, and did not drink enough water and hence my glutes were stiff.

While Shivam Mavi ended with envious figures of 4/22 in four overs. PTI India's batters found the Sri Lankan spinners hard to put away before Deepak Hooda (41 not out off 23) and Axar Patel (31 not out off 20) took the hosts to 162/5. Sri Lanka surely had the firepower to chase down 163 but Mavi's strikes at the start and the back end of the innings tilted the game in favour of the home team. The game went down to the wire with spinner Axar Patel managing to defend 13 runs in the final over. Mavi ended with envious figures of 4/22 in four overs. The fighting knocks from skipper Dasun Shanaka (45 off 27) and Chamika Karunaratne (23 not out off 16) went in vain as Sri Lanka ended at 160 all out in 20 overs. This was the lowest total India defended at the stadium. Skipper Hardik Pandya decided to bowl the first over and the pressure created by him helped Mavi at the other end. Hardik bowled full tilt and hardly gave anything away, conceding only 12 runs in his three-over spell. Mavi's moment to cherish came in his first over as he showed remarkable composure to strike back after being hit for two fours by Kusal Mendis. Pathum Nissanka had no clue as Mavi's delivery jagged back to shatter the stumps. Earlier, Hooda and Axar shared an unbeaten 68-run stand off 38 balls for the sixth wicket after India found themselves at a shaky 94/5. Brief scores: India: 162/5 (Hooda 41*, Kishan 37, Axar 31*; Hasaranga 1/22); Sri Lanka: 160 all out in 20 overs (Shanaka 45, Kusal 28; Mavi 4/22, Umran 2/27, Harshal 2/41). тАФ PTI I was waiting for this moment for the last six years.

We knew if we got the momentum on our side, we would reach 160 тАФ Deepak Hooda, player of the match I have seen him (Mavi) bowling well in the IPL and I just told him to simply bowl. I told him, 'I am backing you. Even if you get hit, it's fine.' тАФ Hardik Pandya, india captain Really disappointed with the way we finished, it was a game we should have won.

BCCI invites bids for women's IPL teams New delhi: The Indian cricket board (BCCI) today invited bids for the right to \"own and operate\" teams in the first ever women's Indian Premier League (IPL). In December, the BCCI also floated tenders for the women's league's media rights for the 2023-27 cycle. \"The Governing Council of the IPL invites bids from reputed entities to acquire the right to own and operate a team in Women's Indian Premier League, through a tender process,\" the BCCI said in a statement. \"The (Invitation to Tender) will be available for purchase till January 21, 2023.\" The inaugural season of the women's IPL is likely to be played on March 3-26.

Zampa fails 'Mankad' attempt in BBL melbourne: Australia leg-spinner Adam Zampa found himself in an embarrassing situation on Tuesday when his attempt to get Melbourne Renegades' Tom Rogers run out with a \"Mankad\" went awry.
