GETTY IMAGESRoot sees Stokes as a ‘superhero’[/caption] In the event, Stokes struggled in Brisbane, scoring five and 14 and taking 0-65 in 12 overs as England were thrashed by nine wickets. The star all-rounder was short of form, confidence and match practice and also jarred his left knee while fielding. But Root is sure Stokes will produce one of his match-winning performances at some stage in the next four Ashes Tests. He could certainly do with something special from his big pal if England are to level the series in the pink ball Second Test in Adelaide, which starts tonight. And there were promising signs at training on Tuesday when Stokes cranked up his bowling to maximum speed — and hit Root a couple of times on the body in the nets and once on the helmet. Root said: “It was a huge ask for Ben and I’m probably as guilty as anyone — I expected too much of him because I see him almost as a bit of a superhero.

At least once a series, maybe twice a series, he’s done something extraordinary which has won a game on its own. “And you do get a little complacent about expecting that. It’s easy to forget that on a big occasion like this, whether because he’s not played a huge amount or because of what he’s had to go through recently, there was a bit too much on him. “But you know the character he is, it’ll have motivated him even more now to put in one of those magical performances. “Whether that comes this week or further down the series, I know it’s there. I know it’s going to come — it’s just when.” Stokes took a break from cricket to protect his mental health after a tumultuous few years and underwent further surgery on his troublesome left index finger. He only declared himself available for this tour two weeks after the original squad was chosen. Before arriving in Australia, Stokes had not played a Test match since March. England regard the two day/night Tests — the final match in Hobart next month is also under lights — as their best chance because of the potency of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson. But England have lost all three of their overseas pink ball matches while Australia’s record at home is played eight, won eight. It will be impossible to force a positive result unless many England players, particularly the batsmen, improve significantly on their efforts in recent months.England have seven Test centuries this year — Root has scored six of them and Rory Burns the other. Burns has also registered six ducks — including being bowled by the first ball of the series. At times, Root must feel like a one-man team but he is prepared to carry the failings of others on his shoulders. Root insisted: “Rory is a very strong character. One thing you can never doubt is that side of his game. “He’s someone who’ll get stuck in, he relishes a big occasion and he stands up to challenges. “It’s a marathon not a sprint. These games come thick and fast and there will be opportunities to get ahead in this one.” Spinner Nathan Lyon, who took his 400th Test wicket in Brisbane, reckons the Aussies can complete a whitewash. He said: “I do believe we can win 5-0, for sure. “If we prepare well and play the right positive brand of cricket under our new captain, there’s no reason why we can’t win 5-0.” England would like to play a spinner in Adelaide but will probably opt to bring in  Broad and Anderson for Chris Woakes and Jack Leach.

Why is a pink ball being used? The traditional red ball is too difficult to pick out in floodlit conditions. The white ball traditionally seen in limited-overs cricket clashes with players’ kits and sight screens. Normal red balls are dyed to achieve their colour, while the white and pink balls are painted. Will the ball behave differently? Players claim the pink ball goes soft quickly. They also report that it can be expected to swing more.

If one goes by the recent set of reports, both verified and the unverified ones revolving around the BCCI officials, and the two biggest names in Indian Cricket currently, he/she shouldn’t be gaslighted for believing that all is not well amongst the aforementioned parties in terms of their relationship with each other. Another big name in Indian Cricket- Shikhar Dhawan, is back in the news, finding some space in the discussions regarding his place in the team’s limited Overs side- the ODIs in particular. The BCCI’s selection committee had a few days ago, announced the 18-member Team India squad for the imminent 3-match Test series. While the Tests would be followed by a 3-match ODI series as well, the squad pertaining the same has not been announced as yet. Now, this creates further room for discussions and debates as to who deserves to find a place in the side and who shouldn’t. As far as the batters are concerned, discussions are rife regarding the opening slots, wherein Shikhar Dhawan has had a string of ordinary performances with the bat so far in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy 2021-22. On the other hand, the young 24-year-old from Maharashtra- Ruturaj Gaikwad, who has emerged as a new household name, especially after his performances for his IPL franchise CSK in previous two seasons is seen as Dhawan’s potential replacement in the team’s ODI side after a dream Vijay Hazare season this year. Shikhar Dhawan Vijay Hazare 2021 runs: Ruturaj Gaikwad as Dhawan’s replacement in SA ODI series? The first of the 3-match ODI series between India and South Africa will take place on January 19, 2022 at the Boland Park in Paarl, South Africa. Ruturaj Gaikwad, who made his T20I debut against Sri Lanka this year, is yet to play in Indian colours in the ODI format. If one takes a sneak-peak into his overall numbers in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy 2021-22- BCCI’s premier domestic 50-Over tournament, don’t be surprised if you are left slack-jawed. The 24-year-old has smashed a total of 4 centuries in the five group stage matches he has played in the aforementioned tournament. He has amassed a total of 603 runs at a stupendous average of 150.75 and was on the verge of becoming the all-time highest individual run-scorer in a single Vijay Hazare Trophy season. Venkatesh Iyer and Ruturaj Gaikwad are making me go to MP and Maharashtra first when I scan the Vijay Hazare Trophy scores. They must wish they could hang on to this form forever! — Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) December 11, 2021 How good a form he has been especially in the past couple of years can be understood here. However, team India’s regular feature right at the top of the batting order in the ODI format- Shikhar Dhawan has on the contrary returned with depressing number in the Vijay Hazare tournament. His recent scores in the aforementioned tournament are 0 (versus Jharkhand), 12 (versus Hyderabad), 14 (versus Uttar Pradesh), 18 (versus Haryana), and 12 (versus Saurashtra). His last assignment with the Indian team was against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka where he had led the Indian side in a 3-match ODI and T20I series. In the 3 above mentioned ODIs, he returned with scores of 86*, 29, and 13 and was far away from being the stand-out performer for the team, despite his average reading 64.00 in the series. However, one cannot dismiss the consistency with which he has been performing for Team India alongside Rohit Sharma at the top in White ball format. In the 6 ODI matches he has played this year, the 36-year-old averages a healthy 59.40 with 297 runs under his name, including 3 half-centuries. During India’s home series against England in March 2021, he scored 169 runs across 3 innings at an average of 56.33. Prior to that, during India’s away 3-match ODI series against Australia in 2020/21 he averaged a decent 40, with scores of 30 and 74 in two of the three matches. Although the sample size to arrive at a conclusion is low, to ascertain whether he has to be a definite inclusion in the upcoming away ODI series, a few string of low scores in domestic matches should certainly not be the reason you drop one of the best batters in the past five years or so. As far as Ruturaj Gaikwad is concerned, his chances will come and he won’t certainly mind waiting for some more time.                 The post Shikhar Dhawan Vijay Hazare 2021 runs: Should Ruturaj Gaikwad replace Shikhar Dhawan in Team India ODI squad for South Africa series? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2021-12-14 17:58:33","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"India tour of South Africa: No break for Virat Kohli, set to play in ODI series","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/india-tour-of-south-africa-no-break-for-virat-kohli-set-to-play-in-odi-series-749607","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In the home series against New Zealand, Rohit Sharma got the command of the Indian cricket team in the T20 format.

As soon as Rohit was made captain of the T20 side, there were speculations that there is a rift between Rohit and former India captain . The Indian cricket team's captaincy became the talk of the town and the fans started believing that the Indian dressing room is divided. It almost got confirmed when, on Tuesday news came which said, 'Virat will not be playing under Rohit's captaincy in ODI series against South Africa'. But this news proved to be a mere rumour. The top BCCI official has confirmed that Virat will play under the captaincy of Rohit and he will be part of the ODI team on the South Africa tour as he hasn't asked for any leave. The most surprising thing is that there was no response from BCCI on this. Now the big question why are we getting these kind of news? Big newspapers of the country are publishing such news quoting sources, due to which a player like Kohli is becoming a victim of trolls. The news about Rohit Sharma's injury had also come to the fore by quoting sources, which proved to be correct. A senior BCCI official spoke on condition of anonymity, “Virat has not sent any formal application to BCCI President Sourav Ganguly or Secretary Jay Shah for breaking during ODI series against South Africa.\" He told that Kohli will play in three ODIs to be held on January 19, 21 and 23. There are constant reports about the differences between Virat and Rohit and the former is the most targeted one by the fans. BCCI not coming forward on such matters is raising big questions. Especially, when most of the news is being published against Virat and the sources of all those news are based in Mumbai. Today, Virat got a 'clean chit' that he will play in the ODI series against South Africa. But the biggest question is that when will the BCCI come to the fore and answer the news of rift between Rohit and Virat? If cricket lovers of the country keep getting every news from the sources, then such questions would be bound to arise that at who and on whose command all the inside information is coming out. BCCI will have to clear its stand on such news immediately, else the spark of the sources will turn into a storm of rumours and the reputation of veteran players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will get scorched in it.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"India tour of South Africa: No brake for Virat Kohli, set to play in ODI series","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/india-tour-of-south-africa-no-brake-for-virat-kohli-set-to-play-in-odi-series-749605","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In the home series against New Zealand, Rohit Sharma got the command of the Indian cricket team in the T20 format.

The idea was to run super cards with the hottest independent wrestlers of the era as a way to fill the void of ECW house shows which had been Feinstein’s main income stream. The promotion would be a launching pad for the biggest stars of wrestling in the 21st century: CM Punk, Bryan Danielson, the Young Bucks, Adam Page, Tyler Black (a.k.a. Seth Rollins), and AJ Styles, among many others. As those wrestlers moved on to World Wrestling Entertainment and later All Elite Wrestling, the house style of Ring of Honor would become the default style of professional wrestling in the United States. ROH held its “Final Battle” pay per view on Saturday night, and while the promotion has made noise about reorganizing and restarting in 2022, it seems likely that it has run its final show. In honor (pun intended) of that potential farewell, here is a list of (some of) the greatest (and/or most significant, for a variety of reasons) matches in the company’s 20-year history (in one man’s humble opinion). Low Ki vs. “American Dragon” Bryan Danielson vs. Christopher Daniels, 2/23/02 This was a planted flag for what ROH was going to be, the three most acclaimed independent wrestlers of the time going out and throwing everything at the wall in an attempt to get buzz and sell tapes. For the most part, throughout history wrestling had been built around either the idea of seeing a beloved figure become a champion, or seeing two tough guys settle a violent grudge. This match was marketed as something new: great wrestlers having a great match. In many ways it was a paradigm shift in what wrestling could be. Here, fans weren’t witnessing a sporting event or a bar room brawl, they were watching a performance—and for better or worse that is what 21st century wrestling became. Here, in the first main event of the first ROH show, the three blue-chip prospects of turn-of-the-century U.S. indie wrestling took the ring, all three inspired by New Japan Juniors pro wrestling and North American wrestlers like Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, and Chris Jericho. Needless to say, the style they worked was very different then the Nikolai Volkoff and King Kong Bundy main-evented shows which dominated North East independent wrestling in the previous decade. Ki and Danielson had met first in the final of the East Coast Wrestling Alliance Super 8 tournament, a yearly independent tournament in Delaware, and had been matched up multiple times in indie promotions in 2001 and early 2002, having tremendous battles mixing the high spots of World Championship Wrestling cruiserweights with the hard striking and mat wrestling of the shootstyle promotions in Japan. Daniels started in Chicago and began touring Japan and Puerto Rico and U.S. independent promotions, even appearing on one of the final episodes of WCW Nitro. He wasn’t the grappler that Ki or Dragon were, but he was one of the smoothest wrestlers of all time, with the ability to pull off complicated sequences and acrobatics with ease. Those styles blended really well in this match, with Ki often interrupting the wrestling of Dragon and Daniels with thunderous violent kicks. There were a lot of three-person moves in this match, which has been something beaten into the ground in the years since, but it was groundbreaking 20 years ago. Often in three-ways one person is left out watching, but there really wasn’t that awkward sense of exclusion here—all three guys were in this match fighting for the win. Raven vs. CM Punk, 7/19/03 This was a dog collar match, one of pro wrestling’s most hallowed bloody traditions, but more importantly it was part of the feud where CM Punk developed the persona which would turn him into one of the biggest stars in the world. The Straight Edge Punk was disgusted by the notorious enjoyer of substances Raven coming into ROH. Punk cut a legendary promo to set this match up in which he compared Raven to his abusive alcoholic father. This match was a tribute to Extreme Championship Wrestling, a promotion of which Raven was a seminal part. Punk taunted ECW alum Danny Doring in the crowd, multiple weapons were employed by both parties, and there were run-ins and copious ECW chants from the crowd. ROH was on the precipice of taking ECW’s spot in the wrestling firmament and this was clearly the company showing respect to its elders. And what better way to tip its hat than with really intense bumping and bleeding by both guys. Punk was the primary plasma spiller in the early days of ROH and, if I can be straightforward, he opens himself up nicely here. Raven had cleaned himself up from a substance-fueled part of his career, and now he showed some athleticism which it wasn’t clear was still in there. At one point he gets yanked down the bleachers by the chain, which was a gnarly bump for a guy with that many miles on his odometer. More importantly, though, this was a star-making feud for Punk. He began to stand out from his peers, all of whom were good in the ring, but weren’t nearly the full package that Punk was at this point. In the end, Punk tapes Raven to the ropes and pours beer in his mouth, telling him to “Go back to the gutter, you drunk.” Then Raven’s old ECW rival Tommy Dreamer jumps Punk and tapes him to an opposite set of ropes and Raven responds by grabbing a beer and giving Punk his first taste of alcohol. The feud would continue, but this match was its unequivocal apex. Homicide vs. Steve Corino, 8/16/03 My pick for the greatest match in the promotion’s history, this wasn’t athleticism, workrate, and flashy action—this was an ugly, bloody, violent fight, much more reminiscent of classic 1980s territorial wrestling brawls then the athletic wrestling ROH is known for. By the end of this match both men and the entire ring mat were covered in claret, Corino had a broken eardrum, and Homicide had driven himself full force into the guardrail. Homicide was seconded by Julius Smokes—an entertaining mix of a Dipset hype man and Bundini Brown, Ali’s famous corner man. Corino brought out Bobby Cruise as his ring announcer and they did a tremendous bit of trolling, with Cruise listing off every tiny indie title that Corino had held over his long career (Cruise even stopped to take a long drink of water in between, only to resume). It worked like a great comedy skit, where it was funny, stopped being funny, kept going and got funny again. By the time the bell rang, Homicide was seething and attacked like a Rottweiler off of his chain. The match was worked at a tremendous pace with several big moments: Homicide landed a cuffing shot to the side of Corino’s head—which sounded like a pumpkin getting smashed by a cricket bat—and popped his ear drum; Homicide got smashed into the ring post and began pumping deep arterial red blood out of his forehead; Homicide drove barbed wire into Corino’s bicep and Corino began bleeding badly as well. Eventually Homicide locks Corino in an STF, causing Corino’s second to throw in the towel. ROH will be remembered primarily for its five-star workrate wrestling classics, but this match showed that they could do violent magnificence just as well. Samoa Joe vs. CM Punk, 12/4/04 This was the third match of their legendary trilogy in ROH. It followed two consecutive 60-minute draws, with the second draw receiving a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer at the Wrestling Observer, which was very rare at the time. (There is an essay on wrestling rating grade inflation that should probably be written and probably by someone besides me.) But this match is my favorite of the three—it played off of the previous two matches, while pushing pace in a way that the longer matches really couldn’t. The fact the fans got a final closure after more than 2 1/2 hours of build was really something. Plus I wrote an entire book on bloody wrestling, so I’m going to pick the match with the red. The match starts at the pace of the previous two with Punk playing mind games with Joe and catching him with side headlocks. After Punk stunned Joe with a slap to the ear, Joe fires back with a strike combination ending with a Justin Tucker field goal kick to Punk’s head. That kick splits open Punk and the rest of the match gets very chippy and nasty, with Joe ripping and pounding at the cut and both guys screaming obscenities at each other. It reminded me of Game 7 of a long, hard-fought NBA playoff series—the fouls are harder, the talk is trashier, and the players have moved from respect to disdain. Joe’s choke had been established as such a kill shot during the year and a half of his title reign, that every time it was put on it felt like curtains. They worked a ton of interesting stuff around that choke before Joe finally put him down. This series was ROH’s attempt to place itself in the same tradition as other legendary series in wrestling history, like Dory Funk Jr. vs. Jack Brisco, Terry Funk v. Harley Race, or Ricky Steamboat vs. Ric Flair. The fact that it doesn’t seem out of place to put Punk vs. Joe in that discussion is a testament to both wrestlers and what the promotion was able to build. Samoa Joe vs. Kenta Kobashi, 10/1/05 This is the most acclaimed ROH match of all time, and it really deserves all of those flowers. ROH started as a promotion run by a tape dealer, and this was a culmination of that idea. The idea was to bring Kobashi—living legend of All Japan Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling NOAH—to the United States to match him up with ROH’s ace Samoa Joe, who had just come off of a two-year title run. This was the kind of dream match booking that often can disappoint. Not only did this not disappoint, it actually exceeded reasonable expectations. Kobashi was unaware of what he meant to the fans who bought a ticket to see him, and actually thought he would have had to work heel in the match as many Japanese transplants had done before him. But ROH was about the art of the craft as opposed to the cookie-cutter jingoistic stories that fueled much of the past of pro wrestling, so he was entering as a conquering hero to a dedicated crowd of tape-trading Puroresu aficionados. Joe himself had to convince Kobashi that the fans were there to see him, and talked him out of playing the stereotypical bad guy. With the rise of the internet in the ’90s, wrestling fans were able to get access to video tapes of wrestling from all over the world. A fan could get a pair of VCRs and dub copies of their shows to send off to strangers, and get another rare tape in return (hopefully what was promised and with a watchable video quality). If you didn’t have tapes of your own to offer, you could write out a check for $40 and send it to a stranger and hope they didn’t steal your money. In the 1990s, All Japan Pro Wrestling’s “four pillars”—Akira Taue, Toshiaki Kawada, Mitsuharu Misawa and Kenta Kobashi—were considered by many to be the greatest wrestlers in the world, and their iconic matches were often just referred to by their dates. True deep-dive wrestling nerds know what it means to say 6/3/94 (Misawa and Kawada’s famous title match) or 12/6/96 (the Real World Tag League final between the team of Misawa and Jun Akiyama and Taue and Kawada). In the late ’90s, there was a split in All Japan and much of the roster started their own promotion in NOAH. Kobashi was one of four equals in All Japan, but he was the undisputed ace of NOAH, and his more emotive style led him to be the one of the four pillars who seemed to connect to American fans the most. By this point in 2005, Kobashi’s body was beginning to betray him, so ROH needed to pad the ring more than normal and find ring steps so he could climb into the ring. This was basically his last epic singles match. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2006, had surgery on his arms in 2008, and then continued to wrestle for another five years—but almost exclusively in tags and six-man matches, where his limitations could be hidden. This was an all-time great needing to muster one last huge performance, and he delivered all that could be expected from him. This match was incredibly hard-hitting, with the chops echoing off the walls of the New Yorker Hotel ballroom, but it was less about the actual moves in the match and more about what these two men meant to fans paying to see them. There is a moment early in the match when Joe strafes Kobashi with a chop and Kobashi just gives him a look, and you can see and hear the crowd go absolutely bananas because of what that look meant. The entire match was like that—each move was saturated in the expectations of fans who had been watching Kobashi on grainy six-hour videotapes and never expected to see him live. For his part, Joe had openly modeled himself on Kobashi and his peers and clearly saw the match in same spirit that the fans did. There have been better matches in wrestling history, but I am not sure any other match had that sort of unique connection between the crowd and performers. Ring of Honor (Homicide, Ace Steel, Adam Pearce, BJ Whitmer, American Dragon Bryan Danielson, Samoa Joe) vs. Combat Zone Wrestling (Spyder Nate Webb, Necro Butcher, Chris Hero, Eddie Kingston, Claudio Castagnoli), 7/15/06 This is a Cage of Death match—a War Games–style cage match between two competing Philadelphia-based wrestling promotions. CZW was a promotion built around violent gimmick matches and attracted a different, more cynical fan base. This led to a great European soccer–style atmosphere in the crowd, with partisans of each promotion wildly cheering for their side. The wrestlers and bookers delivered a match that built to a huge moment, with many twists and turns along the way, coupled with great individual performances and memorable moments. Nearly everyone in this match had moments to shine, but the standout was Homicide, who was the heart of Ring of Honor in its first years. Homicide was incredible as the conquering hero. Also on the top tier was Chris Hero, a guy that was unwanted by ROH management at the start of the promotion. He was such a unlikable prick—slapping on cravats to taunt the crowd, giving a mid-match speech, running away from Homicide—that the match centered on his weaselly dirtbag performance. Spyder Nate Webb was the one CZW team member who didn’t eventually end up on the ROH main roster, but he was a great, super-athletic guy who looked like a ’70s dirt-weed dealer and took every crazy bump he could. Wrestling is at its best when it’s simple: dreams, hatred, revenge. Angles and booking are like cumin: a little bit will make a match delicious, too much and it’s inedible. This match on paper shouldn’t have worked—it was ladled with scoops and scoops of cumin. There was an insider smarky joke (Four Horsemen manager JJ Dillon winning the coin toss), an in-match heel turn (Danielson jumping Samoa Joe and turning on ROH), multiple surprise entries (Homicide and Eddie Kingston), feuding tag partners (Hero and Kingston), and a mid-match rule change (allowing Homicide to come in when he wasn’t initially part of the team). This was all followed by a post-match heel turn (by legendary heel manager Jim Cornette, who had been ROH’s commissioner), which itself had another insidery shoot joke (the banned Low Ki was teased, but there was no intention of bringing him in). Any one of those things could bring a match to a halt, and the fact that they pulled them all off is incredible. It was like the wrestling-booking equivalent of doing backflips on a high wire. Takeshi Morishima vs. American Dragon Bryan Danielson, 8/25/07 David vs. Goliath is one of the most powerful narratives ever, and it is a great pro wrestling story. Morishima was a 6-foot-3, 300-pound nightmare from the NOAH promotion in Japan who had captured the ROH world title by brutalizing his opponents; the smaller Danielson held the ROH title in 2005-06 but was returning from an injury and hadn’t had a title shot in eight months. This was a brutal war which saw Morishima detach Danielson’s retina with a huge clubbing right hand, and Danielson slammed Morishma with heavy kicks in his side-of-beef-sized thighs. Danielson was the smartest, most skilled wrestler in the world trying to find a way to use those smarts and skills to steal a victory before getting run over by the bolder barreling down on him. This match showed the real value of having a history with your audience. Danielson had been one of the anchors of ROH for four years, and he had established so many ways to win matches. This made the crowd totally buy his multiple near falls—a small package, MMA elbows, trapped arm head stomps, and the cattle mutilation bridging chickenwing submission. For years, wrestling fans were trained to believe that matches could end only if wrestlers hit their one finishing hold—like how Hulk Hogan matches end on a leg drop, or Steve Austin hits the stunner. Danielson’s ability to finish someone in multiple ways is a real storytelling asset (one that he is using well currently in AEW), and Morishima had to survive a bunch of plausible moments of peril before he finally closed the show. Kevin Steen vs. El Generico, 12/16/12 This was a swan song for a feud between a pair of Canadian kids who came out of the hinterlands of Montreal independent wrestling and ground their way to the top of independent wrestling and eventually the WWE (Generico as Sami Zayn and Steen as Kevin Owens). They were teamed together and feuding for almost 10 years, but Steen had to fight the office to get this match booked because Generico wasn’t under ROH contract and was on his way to the WWE. This is clearly the insane match that they had been sketching in notebooks since they were working International Wrestling Syndicate (IWS) shows in filthy Montreal biker bars. Steen was sick with the flu, which actually added to the drama. He got brained by a ladder early and that pasty flu sweat made him look like a guy working through a concussion. Generico takes an absolute shellacking in this match. Despite being without a contract and weeks away from fulfilling his lifelong dream, here he is getting catapulted through metal ladders and tables—a pitch-perfect example of the total disregard for his own health and well-being that helped him become such a success. Steen had been tortured by Generico his entire career, and the story of their feud is that Steen always considered himself the better wrestler, but Generico always got the crowd support and fame denied him. This was Steen’s chance to send Generico off with a loss and prove his opinion of himself. Although the story between the two continued in NXT and WWE, they sensibly believed that this was going to be their final match against each other and they certainly tried to close out that relationship in an appropriately insane way. Chris Hero vs. AJ Styles, 3/22/14 This is a later-years ROH hidden gem. Hero and Styles had both recently returned to ROH after long absences—Hero had been gone for two years working in NXT, and Styles hadn’t wrestled there in eight years while he was headlining Total Nonstop Action (TNA). The bout was in Hero’s hometown of Dayton, Ohio, and was a compact, very hard-hitting match that didn’t fall victim to some of the excess of indy wrestling at the time. Finding the right moment to end a wrestling match is a difficult balance. In the mid-2010s, independent matches would often blow past the logical ending point to pile on more big moves and close kickouts, in the same way that a bad action movie will have extra climactic explosions and tomfoolery. John McClane jumping on the jet in Live Free or Die Hard wasn’t nearly as effective as him running across glass in the original, but the producers clearly thought they needed to ramp up with each film. So it often goes in pro wrestling. This match bucked that trend and actually may have ended a beat early with Styles pulling out a flash roll-up calf slicer to tap a rampaging Hero (who seemed to have the advantage). Hero is one of the most versatile wrestlers of all time, and he would shift his wrestling style over the years and excelled at every shift. Here he was working as the KO kid mixing in hard violent elbows and kicks. He was throwing real heat in this match, including a big boot that folded up Styles like a Murphy bed. Styles has always had impressive athletic explosion and there were moments in this match when he would whip off a kick or hurricanrana with incredible speed and force, it’s like watching Ja Morant dunk or Derrick Henry hit a hole. One of the great things about ROH is that they frequently had such a deep and talented roster that they could pull out mini classics like this on B-level house shows. BULLET CLUB (Cody Kenny Omega/Young Bucks) vs. CHAOS (Kazuchika Okada/Will Ospreay) & Briscoes, 2/27/17 This is a big-star main event of night two of ROH’s 2017 tour of Japan. The Elite era of ROH was a proving ground for the concept of AEW. The first All In show was coproduced by ROH, and they had some of their biggest houses ever with shows main evented by the Young Bucks and New Japan pro wrestling stars. The group of wrestlers who would go on to form AEW began to prove they could be more than complimentary players in a U.S. promotion. This is an eight-man tag with all four AEW executive vice presidents on one side and ROH mainstays the Briscoes tagging with two of the biggest New Japan stars Okada and Ospreay on the other. This match felt like a house show main event where your big stars aren’t going out to have an iconic five-star one-on-one main event, but instead hit all of their marks, entertain the crowd, do some shtick, and make everyone feel like their ticket was money well spent. Much of the early part of the match was the Elite team isolating and working over Will Ospreay. There were a bunch of really amusing heel pratfall spots, the kind of thing Bill Dundee or the Midnight Express mastered in the 1980s. There was a moment in particular when Omega kept running Ospreay’s head into boots held up by his partners in the corner, first one boot, then Omega would call for two, then two boots, then three, and finally all three of Omega’s partners put up both boots for the dreaded six boots, which of course, led to Ospreay turning the tables and running Omega’s head into his partner’s feet. There’s something really satisfying about a classic pratfall being paid off after a long setup. The match heats up at the end with some big dives and reversals, and there are some undeniably incredible athletes in this match—Ospreay especially just levitates in the air on his flips and spins. I have been left a bit cold by many of the wrestlers in this match in the past (outside of the Briscoes, love the Briscoes), but this was a great bit of business—a great mix of territorial tag wrestling and modern pyrotechnics. Briscoes vs. Rush and Dragon Lee, 6/29/19 The aforementioned Mark and Jay Briscoe are the standard-bearers of Ring of Honor. Jay wrestled the Amazing Red on the very first show (Mark was too young to wrestle in Philadelphia and was ringside), and they closed out the final show this past weekend in the semi-main event against Matt Taven and Mike Bennett. It is pretty amazing to look at the clean-cut, shaved-head teenagers who started ROH to the iconic, wild hillbillies they became. Dragon Lee and Rush are also brothers who both achieved big success in headlining positions in the CMLL promotion in Mexico. (Rush especially —he won several big hair matches against legends like Negro Casas and Shocker and main evented their biggest shows.) Rush was coming in with a huge push and was months away from taking the ROH world title and being the focus of the promotion for much of 2019 and pre-pandemic 2020. This was the real start of the Rush era of ROH and these two teams had a high-octane tag match that worked in a 21st-century tag wrestling style with a series of big moves one after another. The Lee and Rush teamwork a real contrast—Lee is an amazing masked high flyer who works an acrobatic style, and Rush is a charismatic powerhouse with long, flowing curly hair who hits big powerful blows, working more like a lucha version of the Rock. The Briscoes are incredibly malleable and work perfectly with both styles in the same match, brawling with Rush and flying with Dragon Lee. Jay ends up bleeding pretty badly, which added a little paprika to the proceedings, and the match ends with a decisive victory by Rush, who doing a great job of establishing the Rush-led La Facción Ingobernable as the next kings of ROH. COVID-19 and some political machinations by the Muñoz family killed a lot of the momentum of the Lee and Rush era of ROH, and Rush eventually forfeited the title. This was definitely a wild and entertaining start and a match that really got fans excited to see what the next iteration of ROH would become.

Had it not been for a postponement due to COVID-19’s latest variant named Omicron, India Test captain Virat Kohli would’ve been in South Africa attending press conferences ahead of the first of a three-match Test series. Having said that, Kohli is currently in a bio-bubble in Mumbai scheduled to be part of a virtual press conference tomorrow before the Indian Test team’s departure for the tour of South Africa. Upcoming cricket matches of India Originally scheduled to commence from December 17, India’s tour of South Africa will now begin from December 26 with the Boxing Day Test in Centurion. India, who have maintained an unbeaten Test record at the SuperSport Park, wouldn’t have got a better venue to start proceedings of this tour. As far as the tour of South Africa is concerned, India will be playing a total of three Tests and three ODIs. A three-match T20I series had to be sacrificed for now to accommodate a delay in the tour. With an ICC T20 World Cup to be played later next year, South Africa and India might be seen playing in the shortest format ahead of a world event. When will India vs South Africa 1st Test start? December 26-30 – 1st Test in Centurion January 3-7 – 2nd Test in Johannesburg January 11-15 – 3rd Test in Cape Town January 19 – 1st ODI in Paarl January 21 – 2nd ODI in Paarl January 23 – 3rd ODI in Cape Town The completion of India’s tour of South Africa and the start of West Indies’ tour of India will have less than two weeks’ time between each other.

According to their schedule, the national side is slated to play 52 international matches -- 37 ODIs, 12 T20Is, and three Test matches during the next two-year time period. In those two years, Afghanistan will play in the Asia Cup in 2022 and the ICC T20 World Cup in the same year, followed by the Asia Cup and the ICC 50-over World Cup in 2023. \"If we bifurcate the tally into limited-overs cricket and the Test format, it clearly shows that Afghanistan's focus will be on the shorter formats of the game,\" the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said in a release on Monday night. \"Considering the fact that Afghanistan will be playing seven ODI series in the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, as well as will participate in four major limited-overs events such as Asia Cup 2022 (T20 format), ICC T20 World Cup 2022, the Asia Cup 2023 (ODI format) & the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023,\" it added.

An avid cricket fan, he has written, “Watched the show Backstage with Boria”, enjoyed it. He further added - \"Can you please tell us if Rohit Sharma is actually injured or has the BCCI asked him to say so because they want to avoid the awkwardness in the dressing room?” To be honest, the message is laughable. In fact, I was about to laugh it off. But then this is indeed the sentiment going round that the two can’t face each other in the dressing room and their relationship is no longer civil. This is simply outrageous to tell the truth. Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale for Real Madrid, Pele and Garrincha for Brazil, Steve Waugh and Shane Warne for Australia and closer home, Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev for India. Relations between these super achievers was never the most amiable. In fact, can never be. Anyone who follows high performance sport will agree relations between such achievers will mostly be frosty. In fact, Gary Kirsten had said it best to me the morning after the India-Pakistan semi-final at Mohali during the 2011 World Cup. Gary was having breakfast when I bumped into him and congratulated him on India’s famous win against Pakistan, and went on to add how he had managed superstar egos really well and got them to be friends with each other. That’s when Gary smiled and put things in perspective. The very same should apply for Virat Kohli and Rohit. Do they have to be best friends to be captain and vice-captain of the Indian cricket team and yield the best results? The answer is a flat NO. Steve Waugh and Shane Warne, never really friendly to each other, presided over the most successful era in Australian cricket. While we in the media are happy debating and wasting newsprints on a possible rift between Kohli and Rohit, I wonder why it is so hard for us to accept that difference of opinion at this level is the norm and not an aberration. As long as Virat reaches out to Rohit as captain, whenever he feels the need that is, we should be happy. Whenever Rohit is in need, he will for sure reach out to Kohli as a leader in the pack. That’s what it should be like between two top achievers, who have both brought laurels to the country. At the end of the day, as hardened professionals, they know their job well and will not be impacted by all this surround sound. While rifts etc make for great copy, the truth is such things don’t really matter when India’s two best players step out donning national colours. For Rohit not to play Tests or Kohli not to play ODIs because the other is skipper is simple nonsense. They know better and so does the BCCI. The faster these rumours are laid to rest, the better it is for Indian cricket.","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2021/12/fb37b-16394830029839-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda"},{"title":"SHA vs ABD Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for Emirates D10, Match 30","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/sha-vs-abd-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-emirates-d10-match-30?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Azhar"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-14 13:34:12","full_description":"Sharjah will be up against Abu Dhabi in the 30th match of the Emirates D10 2021-22 on December 14th at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium. Sharjah have performed well this season and are second in the Emirates D10 points table having won five of their nine games. They suffered a seven-wicket defeat against Ajman in the previous game and will now aim to get back to winning ways. On the other hand, Abu Dhabi’s performances this season have not been up to the mark and they now see themselves placed at the bottom of the points table with two wins in eight games. They come into this game on the back of a seven-wicket defeat against Fujairah and will now hope to end their D10 journey on a positive note.

We have seen an even contest between both aspects of the game. The batters have dominated in the initial stages whereas the bowlers have taken control in the second half of the match. Wicketkeeper Khalid Shah: Khalid has been the leading run-scorer for Sharjah this season. He has hammered 200 runs in nine outings and has also contributed behind the stumps. Batters Ansar Khan: Ansar has scored 167 runs at a strike rate of over 190 and should be a part of your D11 team as he can fetch you plenty of points. Jamshaid Zafar: Jamshaid has been a dependable batter for Abu Dhabi. He has scored 155 runs so far in the tournament and could be a wise pick for today’s game. All-rounders Umair Ali: Umair has performed decently in both aspects of the game. He has scored 84 runs at a quick pace lower down the order and has grabbed six wickets as well. Atta Urrahim: Atta has been a top performer for Sharjah this season. He has scored 188 runs at a strike rate of around 150 and has also contributed with the ball, picking up three wickets. Bowlers Ali Anwaar: Ali’s contribution with the ball for Sharjah has been a major one. He is their leading wicket-taker with 10 scalps to his name in eight matches. Ghulam Murtaza: Ghulam has contributed to both aspects of the game in this tournament. His ability to smash sixes at the death, coupled with his wicket-taking skills, make him a top pick. Atta Urrahim: 422 Khalid Shah: 405 points Jamshaid Zafar: 374 points Ali Anwaar: 369 points Umair Ali: 355 points Atta Urrahim: 8 matches, 188 runs, 3 wickets Khalid Shah: 9 matches, 200 runs Jamshaid Zafar: 8 matches, 155 runs Ali Anwaar: 8 matches, 10 wickets Umair Ali: 7 matches, 84 runs, 6 wickets Fantasy Suggestion #1 : Khalid Shah, Jamshaid Zafar, Ansar Khan, Umair Ali, Atta Urrahim, Ghulam Murtaza, Ali Anwaar, Ali Abid, Fayyaz Ahmad, Zubair Khan, Irfan Ayub Captain: Atta Urrahim Vice-Captain: Umair Ali Fantasy Suggestion #2: Khalid Shah, Jamshaid Zafar, Ansar Khan, Umair Ali, Atta Urrahim, Ghulam Murtaza, Ali Anwaar, Kamran Atta, Amjad Gul, Faisal Shah, Hazrat Bilal Captain: Khalid Shah Vice Captain: Jamshaid Zafar","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2021/12/29d33-16394846856212-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda"},{"title":"Live Cricket Score, Pakistan vs West Indies 2nd T20I","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/live-cricket-score-pakistan-vs-west-indies-2021-2nd-t20i/liveblog/88280339.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-14 12:39:38","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"toi"},{"title":"Injured David Warner battles through unconvincing nets session ahead of second Ashes Test - Wide World of Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3b3MubmluZS5jb20uYXUvY3JpY2tldC90aGUtYXNoZXMtMjAyMS1hdXN0cmFsaWEtZW5nbGFuZC1hZGVsYWlkZS10ZXN0LWRhdmlkLXdhcm5lci1pbmp1cnktZml0bmVzcy1yaWJzLW5ldC1zZXNzaW9uLzAyODNiNGZhLWYwMDktNDUxNi04M2MyLTI0Mzc5ZmY2YWM1MtIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Injured David Warner battles through unconvincing nets session ahead of second Ashes Test  Wide World of SportsStruggling star nears point of no return as Warner exposes big problem: Burning Qs  Fox SportsRichardson or Neser: Aussies weigh up Adelaide selection  cricket.com.au“He's international ready”: McGain's choice for Hazlewood replacement  SENHussey: Richardson will cope in Adelaide  Fox SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-14 12:26:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Independent Scottish cricket racism review to begin next month","link":"https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/independent-scottish-cricket-racism-review-121534915.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-14 12:15:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo"},{"title":"Pakistan vs West Indies, 2nd T20I Live Cricket Score Updates from Karachi: Pakistan opt to bat first","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/live-cricket-score-pakistan-vs-west-indies-2nd-t20i-live-score-updates-pak-vs-wi-latest-scorecard-749562","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan vs West Indies, 2nd T20I Live Cricket Score Updates from Karachi  ","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-14 12:10:20","full_description":"Pakistan are unchanged from the last game while West Indies replaced Devon Thomas with Hayden Walsh.

The review, which was announced by Scotland's national agency for sport, sportscotland, will be led by equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) experts Plan4Sport, and comes after the country's all-time leading wicket-taker Majid Haq - in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports News - claimed Cricket Scotland is \"institutionally racist\". Working alongside Plan4Sport managing director Louise Tideswell on the review are: British Council head of EDI Dr Fiona Bartels-Ellis OBE, former EFL head of inclusion Aneel Javed, Sharon Girling OBE, Lucy Faulkner, Chris Gibbons and Tunde Banjoko OBE. The review will include in-depth consultation and engagement with individuals and organisations at all levels of Scottish cricket, along with the creation of a confidential space for individuals to share their personal experiences, with follow-up support provided. A comprehensive review of existing Cricket Scotland policies and procedures in line with EDI best practice will be undertaken, as well as the production of a full public report with associated recommendations for Cricket Scotland to address, held to account by sportscotland. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Chief Executive of sportscotland, Stewart Harris, said: \"Racism and discrimination of any kind must never be tolerated in sport and we are committed to playing our part in tackling issues where they exist. That is why it is vital a full independent investigation is carried out into racism in Scottish cricket. \"This will be a difficult time for many connected with the sport, but it is important that we all take the time to listen to what is said, and more importantly, to take steps to make things right. This will not happen overnight but in time I hope that the sport can heal, and that together, we can help rebuild trust. \"Plan4Sport has vast experience in this area and bring with them a diverse and skilled team of specialists, who will deal with this review with the highest level of professionalism, independence, empathy, integrity and compassion. They will have the full support of everyone at sportscotland as they carry out this independent review.\" President of Cricket Scotland, Sue Strachan, added: \"Cricket Scotland and its Regional Associations, The Cricket Scotland Match Officials and Umpires Association(CSMOA) and the Scottish Cricketers Association(SCA) are fully committed to engaging with Plan4Sport and sportscotland to assist this independent review. We will make change where it is required in order to ensure that there is no place for racism or discrimination within cricket in Scotland.\" Cricket has been engulfed in a racism scandal initially prompted by allegations made by Azeem Rafiq, who spoke about his experiences of racism at former county Yorkshire. Rafiq told a parliament select committee that English cricket is \"institutionally\" racist. Cricket Scotland told Sky Sports News last month it would thoroughly investigate and deal with any allegations of racism or harassment but would not discuss individual cases.

During the 12th match of the ongoing 11th season of the Big Bash League between Hobart Hurricanes and Perth Scorchers in Hobart, a fan got injured whilst wanting to unsuccessfully grab a crowd catch. It all happened on the last delivery of the seventh over in the second innings when Hobart Hurricanes batter Ben McDermott hit an Andrew Tye full toss for a massive six over deep mid-wicket. In what was a simple catching opportunity in the stands at the Bellerive Oval, a fan not just made a mess of the catch but also ended injuring himself. With the ball hitting him in the forehead, it was only a few seconds after the incident that he found himself bleeding. As far as the match is concerned, the home team ended up losing by 59 runs after failing to seal a 183-run target. Despite a 69-run partnership for the third wicket between D’Arcy Short (31) and McDermott (41), all Hurricanes could manage was 129/10 in 19 overs. On debut for Scorchers, England fast bowler Tymal Mills was the pick of the bowlers in the second innings after picking bowling figures of 4-0-23-3. Other than Mills, all-rounder Ashton Agar and Tye also picked a couple of wickets each. Earlier, Perth were bolstered by all-rounder Mitchell Marsh’s maiden T20 century after captain Ashton Turner (17) won the toss and chose to bat. Coming in to bat at No. 3 in the first over itself, Marsh ended up with 100* (60) with the help of six fours and five sixes.

The news comes after the cricketer injured himself during his practice match in Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has named 13 years old Gujarat batter Priyank Panchal as the replacement of Rohit Sharma. After the declaration of his position, Panchal who scored 96 in the A test match against South Africa A is now all set to play the series opener in Centurion, South Africa. He will be covering Rohit Sharma ahead of the tour of South Africa this month for the test matches.The three-match Test series between South Africa and India is scheduled to start from 26 December and will be continued till 30 December at SuperSport Park in Centurion. There is no confirmation about Rohit playing in the One-day International series (ODI) as it is informed that the injury caused during his practice is much serious and can lead to a risky condition of the cricketer if played in ODI. According to reports, the cricketer got severely injured as he was hit on his hand while practicing for the 3 match series for one week in Mumbai.

The news comes after the cricketer injured himself during his practice match in Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has named 13 years old Gujarat batter Priyank Panchal as the replacement of Rohit Sharma. After the declaration of his position, Panchal who scored 96 in the A test match against South Africa A is now all set to play the series opener in Centurion, South Africa. He will be covering Rohit Sharma ahead of the tour of South Africa this month for the test matches. The three-match Test series between South Africa and India is scheduled to start from 26 December and will be continued till 30 December at SuperSport Park in Centurion. There is no confirmation about Rohit playing in the One-day International series (ODI) as it is informed that the injury caused during his practice is much serious and can lead to a risky condition of the cricketer if played in ODI. According to reports, the cricketer got severely injured as he was hit on his hand while practicing for the 3 match series for one week in Mumbai.

Former white-ball captain Virat Kohli’s availability for the upcoming ODI series in South Africa has become the centre of attraction in the Indian media. It was only less than a week ago that Kohli was replaced by his deputy Rohit Sharma as the captain of the Indian ODI team. While debates regarding Kohli’s demotion were yet to be settled, fresh reports of him making himself unavailable for the three-match series ODI series have acted as fuel to fire as far as fans’ perception of an alleged rift between Kohli and Sharma is concerned. “Yes, Kohli has asked for a small break in January to spend more time with his family. It effectively means that he would miss the ODI series against South Africa,” a source was quoted as saying by PTI to kick-start rumours around Kohli’s availability. Will Virat Kohli skip South Africa vs India ODI series? A follow-up to this development came in the form of another source stating that Kohli hasn’t made any such request to the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) as of now. Since morning, it is being said that Kohli would be missing the ODI series for family reasons as his daughter Vamika Kohli will turn one on January 11. However, the same is unlikely to be a reason as Kohli will be playing his 100th Test in Cape Town from January 11. Meanwhile, the ODI series will commence from January 19 in Paarl. “As of now, Kohli hasn’t sent any formal request to skip the ODIs to either BCCI President Sourav Ganguly or secretary Jay Shah. If something is decided at a later date or God forbid, he sustains an injury, then it’s a different matter. As things stand today, he is playing the three ODIs on January 19, 21, 23,” the latest source told PTI. Virat Kohli has informed that he’s not available for the ODI series & Rohit Sharma is unavailable fr d upcoming test. There is no harm in takin a break but d timing has to be better. This just substantiates speculation abt d rift. Neither wil be giving up d other form of cricket. — Mohammed Azharuddin (@azharflicks) December 14, 2021 “The skipper is travelling with his family. But yes, if he feels bubble fatigue after the Test series and wants to take a break, he would definitely inform the chairman of selectors and secretary (Shah), who is the convenor of the selection committee.” Considering the poor manner in which BCCI announced Kohli’s demotion in the ODI team to the world, one expects the board to provide an official update in this matter.

The former captain is likely to give the series a miss due to personal reasons, according to reports. Kohli was removed from the post of ODI captain last week by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), who handed over the job to Rohit Sharma but the decision was met with a mixed response from different sections of the cricketing fraternity. Kohli is yet to make a comment on his removal and Rohit's subsequent appointment but there is growing speculation that all may not be well between the two senior cricketers after the former ODI skipper's likely decision to skip the series in the Rainbow nation. Notably, Rohit was ruled out of the 3-Test series against the Proteas starting December 26 after suffering a hamstring injury while training in Mumbai on Sunday. This means that Rohit won't be playing under Kohli's captaincy in the Tests and vice-versa if the Delhi cricketer decides to miss the ODIs, where the Mumbai opener will lead the Indian team. This conundrum has left fans furious and they took to social media to express their disappointment at Kohli for being \"unprofessional\" and the BCCI for not being able to handle this situation properly. From what it seems, Kohli has no motivation left to play ODIs. And I don't blame him. And, just like that, because of all the politics, one day, he'll just walk away. Almost like AB de Villiers, fed up of the board who never supported you. What a mess, Ganguly. — Sarah Waris (@swaris16) December 14, 2021 @ImRo45 out of test series due to injury and @imVkohli will take break from ODI series.. Wowww what an award winning movie script Courtesy: @BCCI — Aman Jha (@AmanJha68865006) December 14, 2021 I'm just so sad, because the BCCI has robbed us of watching two heroes of the game walk out together, to win more games together. To see Kohli become an even bigger great. All these factions for what? Money? Power? Authority? Remember it's the players who get you everything — Sarah Waris (@swaris16) December 14, 2021 Are these two trying to avoid playing under each other's captaincy? Earlier there was news about #RohitSharma that he was out of the Test series due to injury and now sources are saying that #ViratKohli will also be out of the One Day series. #IndvsSA #BCCI #TeamIndia @BCCI pic.twitter.com/iUnxMmuCHD — Shubhankar Mishra (@shubhankrmishra) December 14, 2021 Rohit Sharma won’t play test series.

Respect the game. Crores of kids dream to don the INDIA jersey. If it was earned then, it should be earned now.

Kohli stepped down from T20I captaincy after the tournament in the UAE but stated his intention to continue as ODI skipper. The BCCI however, decided to make Rohit the leader in both white-ball formats as the selectors didn't want any confusion in the team, as stated by the board president Sourav Ganguly. Rohit captained India in the three-match T20I series against New Zealand that came immediately after the final of the T20 World Cup in a series that Kohli sat out. Rohit then sat out the two-match Test series against New Zealand that followed the T20I series. Ajinkya Rahane was India's captain for the first Test in Kanpur as Kohli did not play in it while the latter returned to lead India in the second Test in Mumbai.
