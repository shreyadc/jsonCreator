The Kolkata Knight Riders were chasing an unlikely target of 205 to beat the champion Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Sunday (Monday AEST), with Rinku left with the seemingly impossible task of scoring 28 off the final five balls of the match. Incredibly, he did just that, with five towering blows. Rinku Singh and his Kolkata Knight Riders teammates celebrate their remarkable victory. Credit: AP The Titans were in complete control after Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan again demonstrated his brilliance by claiming a hat-trick to leave Kolkata reeling at 7-155. But with Kolkata needing 29 runs off the last over, the unfortunate Yash Dayal was handed the ball and, after giving up a single to Umesh Yadav, lost his nerve when he faced Rinku. Umesh just told Rinku: “Hit it – don’t think!” It proved sage advice. Three times the 25-year-old helped himself when Dayal served up full tosses. He then fetched the last two balls from outside off-stump over the long-on boundary to give Kolkata a three-wicket win. Rinku Singh finished unbeaten on 48 from 21 balls. Credit: AP “I was just trying to hit sixes. I was not thinking a lot, was just reacting to the ball,” said Rinku, who finished unbeaten on 48 from 21 balls after breaking the record for most runs by any batter in the final over of an IPL run chase. “It kept coming out of the middle. I had belief and it came off in the end.”","pubDate":"2023-04-09 22:18:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zimbabwe Under-19 to tour India","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimbabwe-under-19-to-tour-india/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Chronicle Editor"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Under-19 men’s cricket team is leaving the country today for India where they will play against different clubs from the Asian nation.

The team is set to tour for 20 days as part of their preparations for next year’s International Cricket Council (ICC) Under-19 World Cup to be held in Sri Lanka. Zimbabwe named a 19-member squad for the trip. Their tour will consist of two three-day matches and four 50-over games. The team is returning home on April 29. ZC director of cricket, Hamilton Masakadza confirmed the tour saying it will come in handy for the youngsters as the global showpiece draws closer. He also added that this will not be the only tour for the side. “The tour will be very key to the team, whatever amount of game time they get is very important. We are also working on organising a couple of more tours, especially closer to the start of World Cup” said Masakadza. The first match of the three-day game will run from April 13 to 15 before they take a rest on the following day. After their practice session on Monday April 17, the Young Chevrons will take to the field again on the following day for the second three-day match that will run till April 20. The four 50-over matches are scheduled for Saturday April 22, Monday April 24, Wednesday April 26 and Friday April 28 before they depart for Zimbabwe. The Prosper Utseya coached team will not be the first to go to India for a tour as the Under-23 side is on a 28-day trip in Mumbai where they are playing against Omtex ICWC Cricket Institute. Former Chevrons all-rounder and skipper, Elton Chigumbura is in charge of the Under-23 side who have played three matches, lost two and won one. Last year, the Zimbabwe women’s Under-19 team also toured India in their preparation for the World Cup.

Imam mentioned that the team has formed a balanced side and is playing regularly. “Our preparations for the upcoming World Cup are pretty good. We have formed a balanced side, which is playing regularly. We will get eight matches before the Asia Cup, which is adequate in my opinion. “We also have time to prepare for the New Zealand series, which we will use to play practice matches,” said Imam while talking to a private tv channel. The opening batter is currently part of Pakistan’s ODI squad which will take on New Zealand in a five-match ODI series in April-May, Imam highlighted the importance of facing fast bowlers in the nets as it helps the players to perform better in international cricket. “Playing fast bowlers in the nets helps a lot since it makes things easier for us in international cricket. “During international matches we only face express pace when Kagiso Rabada, Pat Cummins or Lockie Ferguson are bowling. However, in the nets we face bowlers like Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf bowling at 140kph on a daily basis,” he added. The 27-year-old cricketer said that the men in green are eager to beat India during this year’s ICC World Cup in India. “We had already started thinking about the 2023 World Cup during the 2019 World Cup. Everyone wants to beat India in India and perform well. I will also try to give my best against the arch-rivals.” He also expressed his excitement about the competition for the opening spot in the Pakistan side. He believes that when new players come into the team with a new batting style, it improves the team’s performance. “It is great to see these young players bat with a fearless approach in the PSL. It also helps us realise that we need to improve our game, if we want to prolong our career,” he asserted.

Preparations for the World Cup began with the tour to UAE last month on the invitation of the Afghanistan Cricket Board who hosted a Tri-Nation U19 tournament with Bangladesh as the third team and played Sri Lanka in two U19 ODI matches. Result-wise it was not a great tour for Sri Lanka winning only one match – the opener of the Tri-National U19 against Bangladesh which was a day game, and losing five matches played under lights which included the two U19 ODIs. Mubarak put it down to ‘lack of experience’ of playing under lights and facing fast bowlers of extreme pace from Afghanistan and Bangladesh which the boys have not experienced at school cricket level. “This is the first time that we have started an under 19 program so early in preparation for the World Cup next year. A lot of the boys are very early into their Under19 cycle and a lot of them were on their first tour. The first game (day) we won, all the others were day-night games which we lost,” said Mubarak. “To me it was to do a little bit about the skills. Afghanistan and Bangladesh had good fast bowlers and the wickets helped the fast bowlers. That is one area we need to work on, but overall it was the experience and maturity in handling situations.” “The other factor is we were all playing school cricket. The annual plan was for our first tour to be in August. West Indies were supposed to come here, but then Afghanistan reached out and said that they were playing a series with Bangladesh and whether we would also join. It was still worth it because the boys may be young but the exposure was very important. Even for us to know where we are from a coaching point of view and for the boys to know that the standard is much higher than school cricket and the mental skills that are needed. Their fast bowlers were bowling easily at 135 kph and sometimes 140 kph. Our boys playing school cricket have not faced bowlers of that speed.” “There are also other areas that we can improve on – our fielding especially under lights we struggled a little bit. Then there was a lot of wind on the open ground and some of our fast bowlers struggled bowling into the wind whereas their fast bowlers were able to use the wind and swing the ball. Little things like this were good for our boys to know and overall what we need to do to get ready for the World Cup.” What impressed Mubarak most was the fighting qualities displayed by the boys. “In every game we fought. That game against Afghanistan we were chasing 320 and came close to winning, we never gave up. That attitude I like.” “When you play tournament format the challenges are different. When you play a bilateral series it is very easy to prepare. Sometimes you have to figure things out in the middle, that exposure or experience is important for them to take responsibility for their cricket. We are working on it,” said Mubarak. “This is the first step we have taken in preparation for the World Cup. We will be looking at the wickets here where there will be more challenges from spin. Our batsmen will also have to play spin well. “Just because these boys were picked on this tour it doesn’t mean that they are guaranteed to play in the World Cup. We have told them also. There are a lot of other boys out there who are fighting hard to get into the team. There are other tournaments, school matches and super provincial U19 which the selectors will be looking at. Definitely other players can come in.” Of the 15 players who went on the tour 12 are eligible for next year’s World Cup. “We took Shevon Daniel as captain and Trevin Mathews to give a little bit of stability because we felt that without at least two or three senior players they might struggle. That was the case but Shevon captained the team well. He brought the culture in that captains who have played before have laid the foundations and we owe it to them to do better. Because of that even guys who were touring for the first time weren’t scared, they also came out of their shell. That was a big positive.” Daniel won’t be around for the next World Cup as this tour probably will be his last. On his likely successor Mubarak said: “There is no one clear cut at the moment to take over the u19 captaincy from Shevon. I would like to say that we have this group, but still these boys haven’t captained their school, so they don’t have that leadership experience captaining their first eleven team yet.”","pubDate":"2023-04-09 20:06:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Champions Dambulla pick up Rs. 2 m, two individual awards","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Champions-Dambulla-pick-up-Rs--2-m--two-individual-awards/23-747220","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The National Super League 50-over cricket final was concluded at the R.

It was Brook who boarded the space rocket to the stratosphere, though, while Bohannon made steady progress in a productive winter with the Lions. But on Easter Sunday, his 26th birthday, Bohannon’s low-slung street-fighting, with doughty support from Steven Croft, took Lancashire to a draw against Surrey , champions last year. His hundred, off 173 balls, included 14 fours, two particularly memorable shots hammered through the covers. An astonishing turnaround in Leeds where Leicestershire , wooden spoonists last year, chased down 389 in 87 overs to beat Yorkshire at Headingley for the first time since 1910, clinched with seven balls to spare. Rishi Patel laid the table for the bold pursuit with his maiden first-class hundred, and the dashers danced about him, barely slowing as wickets fell – Dom Bess took five. Sussex whittled down the 59 they needed to beat Durham in a nervy hour, winning their opening championship match of the season for the first time since 2015. Despite an obdurate partnership between Ryan Higgins and Luke Hollman, Middlesex could not recover from their disastrous top‑order batting, losing against Essex by 97 runs. Ben Compton proved that last year was no fluke, with an unbeaten 114 to take Kent to a 19-point win against Northamptonshire . Tom Lammonby (66 not out) had to listen to the familiar thud of wickets falling at the other end, as Warwickshire ’s Oliver Hannon-Dalby and Chris Rushworth gave Somerset a scare at Taunton. But together with Lewis Gregory and Craig Overton, the home team hauled themselves to safety.

The way our four seamers bowled on the third day, when they backed each other up, was outstanding and set the game up for us. “If there was a man of the match I’d give it to Ollie Carter. The way he kept wicket in both innings and the way be batted in the first innings, when he were 91 for 4 and he put together a partnership with [Cheteshwar] Pujara, and then again today was outstanding. In both innings he played really calmly and particularly this morning showed a lot of composure. He deserved to be the bloke who got us over the line. “It’s a great lesson for our team because it was shown they can beat good opponents. Bowling-wise, Durham’s attack is first division quality. They got a lot of good batters and are very experienced and will win a lot of games. They will win a lot of matches this year. “So hopefully the confidence this result gives our players, to have played in a really tough game on a fantastic cricket pitch, gives us something to really build on going forward.” 11h ago 08.10 EDT Lunchtime scores Division One The Rose Bowl : Notts 185 and 177 v Hampshire 231 and 132-2.

However, I felt a bit sorry for Finlay Bean of Yorkshire when reading this today. Imagine being interviewed for the sports pages of a national daily newspaper only to grab a copy and read this headline they’d written about you - The Bargain Basement Batsman.

The rest of the available streams can be picked up from the ECB website. 13h ago 05.42 EDT At Old Trafford the sun is out (though clouds hover) Lancashire are catching and Surrey warming up. A scattering of Easter spectators hunch their shoulders in the point. 14h ago 04.32 EDT It’s a busy day at Headingley where as well as the cricket, there is a double header of Super League this afternoon, the first game of the women’s season between Leeds and York followed by the last game of the men’s Super League Easter programme between the Rhinos and Huddersfield. 14h ago 04.32 EDT Saturday's round-up How to get Jonny Bairstow back into the Test team? Speculators have run their finger down the current XI, paused by the name of Ben Foakes and scuffed a large pencil asterisk next to his name. This one, he doesn’t rip apart phone directories, or haul up trees, in fact he doesn’t really do Bazball. But with Bairstow still recuperating from his broken leg, able only to run in straight lines, Foakes has started the County Championship season in the brightest possible hue. His 76 in the first innings against Lancashire was followed by a superb unbeaten hundred yesterday that enabled Rory Burns to declare with a lead of 443. In a Surrey lineup full of stars, Foakes’s innings stood out. There was fifty from Burns, a curtain of dark hair hanging loose from his helmet like a cavalier though batting like a roundhead, and a lovely cameo from Ollie Pope which came to an end in a hasty flurry of top edges, one caught by a diving Colin de Grandhomme, who lost his trousers in the process. But Foakes, long sleeves pulled up just so, played an innings of delight, full of no-fuss drives, cuts and sweeps, played with total control to bisect and thoroughly irritate fielders who then had to chase the ball to the boundary. The hundred came with a delicate sweep off Parkinson and was warmly applauded both on the field and on the Surrey balcony, where everyone wore their new regulation royal blue leisure wear. There was just time for Jordan Clark to ram a six before the declaration came. Matt Parkinson finished with five for 120 – not bad for a leg-spinner in early April. In the evening sunshine, Lancashire set off in search of what would be their second-highest fourth innings total, Foakes now immaculate behind the stumps. One of the early-season favourites, Hampshire , duly thrashed promoted Nottinghamshire by eight wickets, steaming gleefully to the top of the table, 19 points in their pocket. Fletcha Middleton, 21, son of the former cricketer Tony, made his second fifty of the game, putting on 101 with Nick Gubbins as Hampshire charged to their target of 132. Earlier, Mohammad Abbas had picked effectively away at the Notts tail, completing a haul of nine wickets in the game. The biggest surprise of the day was when, with scores level, the umpires took the players off for a 20-minute tea interval, to a chorus of boos. After the ignominy of being four for four in their first innings, Middlesex ’s suffered another top‑order malfunction in their second after being set 308 to win by Essex . This time it was 15 for three as Jamie Porter and Sam Cook resumed their deadly double act. The 18-year-old Rehan Ahmed, whose first over on Thursday was pancaked for 22, made a superb 85 in a determined rearguard sixth-wicket stand of 141 with the Australian Peter Handscomb, who danced to 112, as Leicestershire boldly chased Yorkshire ’s 517. Alex Davies hit his seventh first-class century as Warwickshire eased past Somerset in a game that lost its first day to a soggy outfield and looks likely to peter out into a draw. Jack Leach picked up three for 93. Marcus Harris waved prettily at the Australia selectors with a brilliant 148 that raised Gloucestershire from the dead at Sophia Gardens. Starting their second innings 239 runs behind Glamorgan , Harris and Chris Dent rattled along in a first‑wicket partnership of 161 at nearly five an over. A robust 101 not out from Rob Keogh gave Northamptonshire a whisker of a chance against Kent at Canterbury, backed up by fifty from Hassan Azad, who was released by Leicestershire during the winter. An unbeaten maiden hundred by Matthew Waite put Worcestershire in a dominant position against Derbyshire and Sussex were on the verge of turning the match against Durham on its head, needing 59 to win with wickets in hand. 14h ago 04.32 EDT Start of play scores Division One The Rose Bowl : Notts 185 and 177 v Hampshire 231 and 132-2.

Round the grounds, eight games are still in motion – with Hampshire putting their feet up after a three-day victory over Nottinghamshire yesterday. Plenty to keep an eye on, with Lancashire challenged to bat the day out against Kemar Roach and co; Northants unexpectedly giving Kent a run for their money and Middlesex in all sorts of trouble against Essex. Taunton looks likely to drift to a draw. In Division Two it’s all a-bubbling: a thriller in store at Hove , everything up in the air at Derby and S ophia Gardens and Leicestershire battling stoically for a draw against Yorkshire It is strange to think that three years ago on Easter Sunday, in theory the start of the Championship season, people celebrated by filming themselves at home during the first Covid lockdown.

The left-hander turned the chase on its head with an unbeaten 21-ball 48, after Kolkata slipped to 155-7 following Rashid Khan’s hat-trick at the world’s biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. Kolkata needed 29 from the final over off Yash Dayal. Rinku took strike after Umesh Yadav’s single on the first ball to send five hits over the fence and silence a raucous home crowd. The chase was set up by a 40-ball 83 by impact player Venkatesh Iyer, who put on a 100-run third-wicket stand with skipper Nitish Rana, who made 45. “Tonight was another example that we will never give up as a team,” Iyer said after the three-wicket win. “The wicket was quite good to bat and I was just trying to execute my plans.” Iyer, who came on in place of Suyash Sharma under the new impact player rule, fell to Alzarri Joseph and Rashid soon took over to claim his first Indian Premier League hat-trick. Rashid, a champion leg-spinner who now has four hat-tricks in T20 cricket, went for a celebratory sprint after sending back Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and Shardul Thakur. But little did Rashid know Rinku and Kolkata would have the last laugh. “A tough game for us, especially as a captain,” said Rashid, standing in as skipper for the unwell Hardik Pandya. “That is what T20 is all about, it is about entertainment.” After two straight wins, two-time champions Kolkata took second spot in the 10-team table, behind leaders Rajasthan Royals. It was a first defeat of the season for Gujarat, who won the league in their debut campaign last year. Earlier Gujarat’s Vijay Shankar smashed five sixes in his 24-ball 63 as Gujarat took 45 runs from the final two overs to reach 204-4. Shankar stood out for Gujarat with his blitz and key partnerships including an unbeaten 51-run fifth-wicket stand with David Miller, who made two.The post Kolkata’s Rinku hits five sixes in final over to win IPL thriller first appeared on Ariana News.","pubDate":"2023-04-09 17:55:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"ariananews","category":["sports"],"country":["Afghanistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rahul, Mayank lead SRH to open successful account in TATA IPL 2023","link":"https://www.livemint.com/sports/cricket-news/rahul-mayank-lead-srh-to-open-successful-account-in-tata-ipl-2023-11681061419759.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Saurav Mukherjee"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sunrisers Hyderabad defeated the PBKS by 8 wickets with 17 balls remaining.","content":"Despite a rough start in the Tata IPL 2023 season, Sunrisers Hyderabad on 9 April registered their first victory against Punjab Kings, while playing at Hyderabad.

The Kolkata Knight Riders were chasing an unlikely target of 205 to beat the champion Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Sunday (Monday AEST), with Rinku left with the seemingly impossible task of scoring 28 off the final five balls of the match. Incredibly, he did just that, with five towering blows. Rinku Singh and his Kolkata Knight Riders teammates celebrate their remarkable victory. Credit: AP The Titans were in complete control after Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan again demonstrated his brilliance by claiming a hat-trick to leave Kolkata reeling at 7-155. But with Kolkata needing 29 runs off the last over, the unfortunate Yash Dayal was handed the ball and, after giving up a single to Umesh Yadav, lost his nerve when he faced Rinku. Umesh just told Rinku: “Hit it – don’t think!” It proved sage advice. Three times the 25-year-old helped himself when Dayal served up full tosses. He then fetched the last two balls from outside off-stump over the long-on boundary to give Kolkata a three-wicket win. Rinku Singh finished unbeaten on 48 from 21 balls. Credit: AP “I was just trying to hit sixes. I was not thinking a lot, was just reacting to the ball,” said Rinku, who finished unbeaten on 48 from 21 balls after breaking the record for most runs by any batter in the final over of an IPL run chase. “It kept coming out of the middle.

The team is set to tour for 20 days as part of their preparations for next year’s International Cricket Council (ICC) Under-19 World Cup to be held in Sri Lanka. Zimbabwe named a 19-member squad for the trip. Their tour will consist of two three-day matches and four 50-over games. The team is returning home on April 29. ZC director of cricket, Hamilton Masakadza confirmed the tour saying it will come in handy for the youngsters as the global showpiece draws closer. He also added that this will not be the only tour for the side. “The tour will be very key to the team, whatever amount of game time they get is very important. We are also working on organising a couple of more tours, especially closer to the start of World Cup” said Masakadza. The first match of the three-day game will run from April 13 to 15 before they take a rest on the following day. After their practice session on Monday April 17, the Young Chevrons will take to the field again on the following day for the second three-day match that will run till April 20. The four 50-over matches are scheduled for Saturday April 22, Monday April 24, Wednesday April 26 and Friday April 28 before they depart for Zimbabwe. The Prosper Utseya coached team will not be the first to go to India for a tour as the Under-23 side is on a 28-day trip in Mumbai where they are playing against Omtex ICWC Cricket Institute.

Imam mentioned that the team has formed a balanced side and is playing regularly. “Our preparations for the upcoming World Cup are pretty good. We have formed a balanced side, which is playing regularly. We will get eight matches before the Asia Cup, which is adequate in my opinion. “We also have time to prepare for the New Zealand series, which we will use to play practice matches,” said Imam while talking to a private tv channel. The opening batter is currently part of Pakistan’s ODI squad which will take on New Zealand in a five-match ODI series in April-May, Imam highlighted the importance of facing fast bowlers in the nets as it helps the players to perform better in international cricket. “Playing fast bowlers in the nets helps a lot since it makes things easier for us in international cricket. “During international matches we only face express pace when Kagiso Rabada, Pat Cummins or Lockie Ferguson are bowling. However, in the nets we face bowlers like Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf bowling at 140kph on a daily basis,” he added. The 27-year-old cricketer said that the men in green are eager to beat India during this year’s ICC World Cup in India. “We had already started thinking about the 2023 World Cup during the 2019 World Cup. Everyone wants to beat India in India and perform well. I will also try to give my best against the arch-rivals.” He also expressed his excitement about the competition for the opening spot in the Pakistan side. He believes that when new players come into the team with a new batting style, it improves the team’s performance. “It is great to see these young players bat with a fearless approach in the PSL. It also helps us realise that we need to improve our game, if we want to prolong our career,” he asserted.

Talking to media, members of national cricket team said the Punjab government has taken a very good step for the revival of hockey by holding this event. “Sports Board Punjab has made excellent arrangements but still a lot of work is needed to be done for the revival of hockey.” Shadab Khan said several new potential players will emerge from First Ramzan Sports Series Hockey Championship. “It is very effective tournament and it will motivate the young hockey players of the country.” Haris Rauf said the hockey championship is a very good initiative. “Hockey is our national game and this kind of events will help a lot in the promotion of hockey in Pakistan.” Faheem Ashraf said the Ramzan Sports Series hockey championship will definitely prove to be very useful tournament for the growth and revival of hockey in the country. Imam said Punjab government and Wahab Riaz took a nice step by organizing Ramzan Sports Series Hockey Championship. “All stakeholders must play their due role for the revival of hockey in the country.”","pubDate":"2023-04-09 21:31:54","image_url":"https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2023-04-10/top-cricket-stars-play-hockey-in-ramazan-sports-series-1681075906-4479.jpg","source_id":"nation_pk","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ali Naqvi, Chris Broad to lead playing control teams during Pakistan-NZ series","link":"https://www.nation.com.pk/10-Apr-2023/ali-naqvi-chris-broad-to-lead-playing-control-teams-during-pakistan-nz-series","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["STAFF REPORT"],"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE- Former Test cricketers and respected match referees Ali Naqvi and Chris Broad will lead the playing control teams in the T20 International and One-Day International series between Pakistan and New Zealand from 14 April till 7 May.","content":"LAHORE- Former Test cricketers and respected match referees and Chris Broad will lead the playing control teams in the T20 International and One-Day International series between Pakistan and New Zealand from 14 April till 7 May. will be the match referee in the five T20Is – spread over Lahore and Rawalpindi – in which Ahsan Raza, Aleem Dar, Asif Yaqoob, Faisal Afridi and Rashid Riaz will take up on-field umpiring duties.

Preparations for the World Cup began with the tour to UAE last month on the invitation of the Afghanistan Cricket Board who hosted a Tri-Nation U19 tournament with Bangladesh as the third team and played Sri Lanka in two U19 ODI matches. Result-wise it was not a great tour for Sri Lanka winning only one match – the opener of the Tri-National U19 against Bangladesh which was a day game, and losing five matches played under lights which included the two U19 ODIs. Mubarak put it down to ‘lack of experience’ of playing under lights and facing fast bowlers of extreme pace from Afghanistan and Bangladesh which the boys have not experienced at school cricket level. “This is the first time that we have started an under 19 program so early in preparation for the World Cup next year. A lot of the boys are very early into their Under19 cycle and a lot of them were on their first tour. The first game (day) we won, all the others were day-night games which we lost,” said Mubarak. “To me it was to do a little bit about the skills. Afghanistan and Bangladesh had good fast bowlers and the wickets helped the fast bowlers. That is one area we need to work on, but overall it was the experience and maturity in handling situations.” “The other factor is we were all playing school cricket. The annual plan was for our first tour to be in August. West Indies were supposed to come here, but then Afghanistan reached out and said that they were playing a series with Bangladesh and whether we would also join. It was still worth it because the boys may be young but the exposure was very important. Even for us to know where we are from a coaching point of view and for the boys to know that the standard is much higher than school cricket and the mental skills that are needed. Their fast bowlers were bowling easily at 135 kph and sometimes 140 kph. Our boys playing school cricket have not faced bowlers of that speed.” “There are also other areas that we can improve on – our fielding especially under lights we struggled a little bit. Then there was a lot of wind on the open ground and some of our fast bowlers struggled bowling into the wind whereas their fast bowlers were able to use the wind and swing the ball. Little things like this were good for our boys to know and overall what we need to do to get ready for the World Cup.” What impressed Mubarak most was the fighting qualities displayed by the boys. “In every game we fought. That game against Afghanistan we were chasing 320 and came close to winning, we never gave up. That attitude I like.” “When you play tournament format the challenges are different. When you play a bilateral series it is very easy to prepare. Sometimes you have to figure things out in the middle, that exposure or experience is important for them to take responsibility for their cricket. We are working on it,” said Mubarak. “This is the first step we have taken in preparation for the World Cup. We will be looking at the wickets here where there will be more challenges from spin. Our batsmen will also have to play spin well. “Just because these boys were picked on this tour it doesn’t mean that they are guaranteed to play in the World Cup. We have told them also. There are a lot of other boys out there who are fighting hard to get into the team. There are other tournaments, school matches and super provincial U19 which the selectors will be looking at. Definitely other players can come in.” Of the 15 players who went on the tour 12 are eligible for next year’s World Cup. “We took Shevon Daniel as captain and Trevin Mathews to give a little bit of stability because we felt that without at least two or three senior players they might struggle. That was the case but Shevon captained the team well. He brought the culture in that captains who have played before have laid the foundations and we owe it to them to do better. Because of that even guys who were touring for the first time weren’t scared, they also came out of their shell. That was a big positive.” Daniel won’t be around for the next World Cup as this tour probably will be his last. On his likely successor Mubarak said: “There is no one clear cut at the moment to take over the u19 captaincy from Shevon. I would like to say that we have this group, but still these boys haven’t captained their school, so they don’t have that leadership experience captaining their first eleven team yet.”","pubDate":"2023-04-09 20:06:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Champions Dambulla pick up Rs. 2 m, two individual awards","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Champions-Dambulla-pick-up-Rs--2-m--two-individual-awards/23-747220","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The National Super League 50-over cricket final was concluded at the R.

It was Brook who boarded the space rocket to the stratosphere, though, while Bohannon made steady progress in a productive winter with the Lions. But on Easter Sunday, his 26th birthday, Bohannon’s low-slung street-fighting, with doughty support from Steven Croft, took Lancashire to a draw against Surrey , champions last year. His hundred, off 173 balls, included 14 fours, two particularly memorable shots hammered through the covers. An astonishing turnaround in Leeds where Leicestershire , wooden spoonists last year, chased down 389 in 87 overs to beat Yorkshire at Headingley for the first time since 1910, clinched with seven balls to spare. Rishi Patel laid the table for the bold pursuit with his maiden first-class hundred, and the dashers danced about him, barely slowing as wickets fell – Dom Bess took five. Sussex whittled down the 59 they needed to beat Durham in a nervy hour, winning their opening championship match of the season for the first time since 2015. Despite an obdurate partnership between Ryan Higgins and Luke Hollman, Middlesex could not recover from their disastrous top‑order batting, losing against Essex by 97 runs. Ben Compton proved that last year was no fluke, with an unbeaten 114 to take Kent to a 19-point win against Northamptonshire . Tom Lammonby (66 not out) had to listen to the familiar thud of wickets falling at the other end, as Warwickshire ’s Oliver Hannon-Dalby and Chris Rushworth gave Somerset a scare at Taunton. But together with Lewis Gregory and Craig Overton, the home team hauled themselves to safety. Jake Libby and Azhar Ali’s partnership of 139 sped Worcestershire to victory against Derbyshire at Derby; and Graeme van Buuren’s 110 took Gloucestershire to safety in a topsy-turvy game against Glamorgan at Sophia Gardens. 5h ago 14.05 EDT That’s it from me for this round.

A scattering of Easter spectators hunch their shoulders in the point. 14h ago 04.32 EDT It’s a busy day at Headingley where as well as the cricket, there is a double header of Super League this afternoon, the first game of the women’s season between Leeds and York followed by the last game of the men’s Super League Easter programme between the Rhinos and Huddersfield. 14h ago 04.32 EDT Saturday's round-up How to get Jonny Bairstow back into the Test team? Speculators have run their finger down the current XI, paused by the name of Ben Foakes and scuffed a large pencil asterisk next to his name. This one, he doesn’t rip apart phone directories, or haul up trees, in fact he doesn’t really do Bazball. But with Bairstow still recuperating from his broken leg, able only to run in straight lines, Foakes has started the County Championship season in the brightest possible hue. His 76 in the first innings against Lancashire was followed by a superb unbeaten hundred yesterday that enabled Rory Burns to declare with a lead of 443. In a Surrey lineup full of stars, Foakes’s innings stood out. There was fifty from Burns, a curtain of dark hair hanging loose from his helmet like a cavalier though batting like a roundhead, and a lovely cameo from Ollie Pope which came to an end in a hasty flurry of top edges, one caught by a diving Colin de Grandhomme, who lost his trousers in the process. But Foakes, long sleeves pulled up just so, played an innings of delight, full of no-fuss drives, cuts and sweeps, played with total control to bisect and thoroughly irritate fielders who then had to chase the ball to the boundary. The hundred came with a delicate sweep off Parkinson and was warmly applauded both on the field and on the Surrey balcony, where everyone wore their new regulation royal blue leisure wear. There was just time for Jordan Clark to ram a six before the declaration came. Matt Parkinson finished with five for 120 – not bad for a leg-spinner in early April. In the evening sunshine, Lancashire set off in search of what would be their second-highest fourth innings total, Foakes now immaculate behind the stumps. One of the early-season favourites, Hampshire , duly thrashed promoted Nottinghamshire by eight wickets, steaming gleefully to the top of the table, 19 points in their pocket. Fletcha Middleton, 21, son of the former cricketer Tony, made his second fifty of the game, putting on 101 with Nick Gubbins as Hampshire charged to their target of 132. Earlier, Mohammad Abbas had picked effectively away at the Notts tail, completing a haul of nine wickets in the game. The biggest surprise of the day was when, with scores level, the umpires took the players off for a 20-minute tea interval, to a chorus of boos. After the ignominy of being four for four in their first innings, Middlesex ’s suffered another top‑order malfunction in their second after being set 308 to win by Essex . This time it was 15 for three as Jamie Porter and Sam Cook resumed their deadly double act. The 18-year-old Rehan Ahmed, whose first over on Thursday was pancaked for 22, made a superb 85 in a determined rearguard sixth-wicket stand of 141 with the Australian Peter Handscomb, who danced to 112, as Leicestershire boldly chased Yorkshire ’s 517. Alex Davies hit his seventh first-class century as Warwickshire eased past Somerset in a game that lost its first day to a soggy outfield and looks likely to peter out into a draw. Jack Leach picked up three for 93. Marcus Harris waved prettily at the Australia selectors with a brilliant 148 that raised Gloucestershire from the dead at Sophia Gardens. Starting their second innings 239 runs behind Glamorgan , Harris and Chris Dent rattled along in a first‑wicket partnership of 161 at nearly five an over. A robust 101 not out from Rob Keogh gave Northamptonshire a whisker of a chance against Kent at Canterbury, backed up by fifty from Hassan Azad, who was released by Leicestershire during the winter. An unbeaten maiden hundred by Matthew Waite put Worcestershire in a dominant position against Derbyshire and Sussex were on the verge of turning the match against Durham on its head, needing 59 to win with wickets in hand. 14h ago 04.32 EDT Start of play scores Division One The Rose Bowl : Notts 185 and 177 v Hampshire 231 and 132-2.

Round the grounds, eight games are still in motion – with Hampshire putting their feet up after a three-day victory over Nottinghamshire yesterday. Plenty to keep an eye on, with Lancashire challenged to bat the day out against Kemar Roach and co; Northants unexpectedly giving Kent a run for their money and Middlesex in all sorts of trouble against Essex. Taunton looks likely to drift to a draw. In Division Two it’s all a-bubbling: a thriller in store at Hove , everything up in the air at Derby and S ophia Gardens and Leicestershire battling stoically for a draw against Yorkshire It is strange to think that three years ago on Easter Sunday, in theory the start of the Championship season, people celebrated by filming themselves at home during the first Covid lockdown.

The left-hander turned the chase on its head with an unbeaten 21-ball 48, after Kolkata slipped to 155-7 following Rashid Khan’s hat-trick at the world’s biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. Kolkata needed 29 from the final over off Yash Dayal. Rinku took strike after Umesh Yadav’s single on the first ball to send five hits over the fence and silence a raucous home crowd. The chase was set up by a 40-ball 83 by impact player Venkatesh Iyer, who put on a 100-run third-wicket stand with skipper Nitish Rana, who made 45. “Tonight was another example that we will never give up as a team,” Iyer said after the three-wicket win. “The wicket was quite good to bat and I was just trying to execute my plans.” Iyer, who came on in place of Suyash Sharma under the new impact player rule, fell to Alzarri Joseph and Rashid soon took over to claim his first Indian Premier League hat-trick. Rashid, a champion leg-spinner who now has four hat-tricks in T20 cricket, went for a celebratory sprint after sending back Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and Shardul Thakur. But little did Rashid know Rinku and Kolkata would have the last laugh. “A tough game for us, especially as a captain,” said Rashid, standing in as skipper for the unwell Hardik Pandya. “That is what T20 is all about, it is about entertainment.” After two straight wins, two-time champions Kolkata took second spot in the 10-team table, behind leaders Rajasthan Royals. It was a first defeat of the season for Gujarat, who won the league in their debut campaign last year. Earlier Gujarat’s Vijay Shankar smashed five sixes in his 24-ball 63 as Gujarat took 45 runs from the final two overs to reach 204-4. Shankar stood out for Gujarat with his blitz and key partnerships including an unbeaten 51-run fifth-wicket stand with David Miller, who made two.The post Kolkata’s Rinku hits five sixes in final over to win IPL thriller first appeared on Ariana News.","pubDate":"2023-04-09 17:55:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"ariananews","category":["sports"],"country":["Afghanistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rahul, Mayank lead SRH to open successful account in TATA IPL 2023","link":"https://www.livemint.com/sports/cricket-news/rahul-mayank-lead-srh-to-open-successful-account-in-tata-ipl-2023-11681061419759.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Saurav Mukherjee"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sunrisers Hyderabad defeated the PBKS by 8 wickets with 17 balls remaining.","content":"Despite a rough start in the Tata IPL 2023 season, Sunrisers Hyderabad on 9 April registered their first victory against Punjab Kings, while playing at Hyderabad.

The Kolkata Knight Riders were chasing an unlikely target of 205 to beat the champion Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Sunday (Monday AEST), with Rinku left with the seemingly impossible task of scoring 28 off the final five balls of the match. Incredibly, he did just that, with five towering blows. Rinku Singh and his Kolkata Knight Riders teammates celebrate their remarkable victory. Credit: AP The Titans were in complete control after Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan again demonstrated his brilliance by claiming a hat-trick to leave Kolkata reeling at 7-155. But with Kolkata needing 29 runs off the last over, the unfortunate Yash Dayal was handed the ball and, after giving up a single to Umesh Yadav, lost his nerve when he faced Rinku. Umesh just told Rinku: “Hit it – don’t think!” It proved sage advice. Three times the 25-year-old helped himself when Dayal served up full tosses. He then fetched the last two balls from outside off-stump over the long-on boundary to give Kolkata a three-wicket win. Rinku Singh finished unbeaten on 48 from 21 balls. Credit: AP “I was just trying to hit sixes. I was not thinking a lot, was just reacting to the ball,” said Rinku, who finished unbeaten on 48 from 21 balls after breaking the record for most runs by any batter in the final over of an IPL run chase. “It kept coming out of the middle.

The team is set to tour for 20 days as part of their preparations for next year’s International Cricket Council (ICC) Under-19 World Cup to be held in Sri Lanka. Zimbabwe named a 19-member squad for the trip. Their tour will consist of two three-day matches and four 50-over games. The team is returning home on April 29. ZC director of cricket, Hamilton Masakadza confirmed the tour saying it will come in handy for the youngsters as the global showpiece draws closer. He also added that this will not be the only tour for the side. “The tour will be very key to the team, whatever amount of game time they get is very important. We are also working on organising a couple of more tours, especially closer to the start of World Cup” said Masakadza. The first match of the three-day game will run from April 13 to 15 before they take a rest on the following day. After their practice session on Monday April 17, the Young Chevrons will take to the field again on the following day for the second three-day match that will run till April 20. The four 50-over matches are scheduled for Saturday April 22, Monday April 24, Wednesday April 26 and Friday April 28 before they depart for Zimbabwe. The Prosper Utseya coached team will not be the first to go to India for a tour as the Under-23 side is on a 28-day trip in Mumbai where they are playing against Omtex ICWC Cricket Institute. Former Chevrons all-rounder and skipper, Elton Chigumbura is in charge of the Under-23 side who have played three matches, lost two and won one.

Imam mentioned that the team has formed a balanced side and is playing regularly. “Our preparations for the upcoming World Cup are pretty good. We have formed a balanced side, which is playing regularly. We will get eight matches before the Asia Cup, which is adequate in my opinion. “We also have time to prepare for the New Zealand series, which we will use to play practice matches,” said Imam while talking to a private tv channel. The opening batter is currently part of Pakistan’s ODI squad which will take on New Zealand in a five-match ODI series in April-May, Imam highlighted the importance of facing fast bowlers in the nets as it helps the players to perform better in international cricket. “Playing fast bowlers in the nets helps a lot since it makes things easier for us in international cricket. “During international matches we only face express pace when Kagiso Rabada, Pat Cummins or Lockie Ferguson are bowling. However, in the nets we face bowlers like Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf bowling at 140kph on a daily basis,” he added. The 27-year-old cricketer said that the men in green are eager to beat India during this year’s ICC World Cup in India. “We had already started thinking about the 2023 World Cup during the 2019 World Cup. Everyone wants to beat India in India and perform well. I will also try to give my best against the arch-rivals.” He also expressed his excitement about the competition for the opening spot in the Pakistan side. He believes that when new players come into the team with a new batting style, it improves the team’s performance. “It is great to see these young players bat with a fearless approach in the PSL. It also helps us realise that we need to improve our game, if we want to prolong our career,” he asserted.

Preparations for the World Cup began with the tour to UAE last month on the invitation of the Afghanistan Cricket Board who hosted a Tri-Nation U19 tournament with Bangladesh as the third team and played Sri Lanka in two U19 ODI matches. Result-wise it was not a great tour for Sri Lanka winning only one match – the opener of the Tri-National U19 against Bangladesh which was a day game, and losing five matches played under lights which included the two U19 ODIs. Mubarak put it down to ‘lack of experience’ of playing under lights and facing fast bowlers of extreme pace from Afghanistan and Bangladesh which the boys have not experienced at school cricket level. “This is the first time that we have started an under 19 program so early in preparation for the World Cup next year. A lot of the boys are very early into their Under19 cycle and a lot of them were on their first tour. The first game (day) we won, all the others were day-night games which we lost,” said Mubarak. “To me it was to do a little bit about the skills. Afghanistan and Bangladesh had good fast bowlers and the wickets helped the fast bowlers. That is one area we need to work on, but overall it was the experience and maturity in handling situations.” “The other factor is we were all playing school cricket. The annual plan was for our first tour to be in August. West Indies were supposed to come here, but then Afghanistan reached out and said that they were playing a series with Bangladesh and whether we would also join. It was still worth it because the boys may be young but the exposure was very important. Even for us to know where we are from a coaching point of view and for the boys to know that the standard is much higher than school cricket and the mental skills that are needed. Their fast bowlers were bowling easily at 135 kph and sometimes 140 kph. Our boys playing school cricket have not faced bowlers of that speed.” “There are also other areas that we can improve on – our fielding especially under lights we struggled a little bit. Then there was a lot of wind on the open ground and some of our fast bowlers struggled bowling into the wind whereas their fast bowlers were able to use the wind and swing the ball. Little things like this were good for our boys to know and overall what we need to do to get ready for the World Cup.” What impressed Mubarak most was the fighting qualities displayed by the boys. “In every game we fought. That game against Afghanistan we were chasing 320 and came close to winning, we never gave up. That attitude I like.” “When you play tournament format the challenges are different. When you play a bilateral series it is very easy to prepare. Sometimes you have to figure things out in the middle, that exposure or experience is important for them to take responsibility for their cricket. We are working on it,” said Mubarak. “This is the first step we have taken in preparation for the World Cup. We will be looking at the wickets here where there will be more challenges from spin. Our batsmen will also have to play spin well. “Just because these boys were picked on this tour it doesn’t mean that they are guaranteed to play in the World Cup. We have told them also. There are a lot of other boys out there who are fighting hard to get into the team. There are other tournaments, school matches and super provincial U19 which the selectors will be looking at. Definitely other players can come in.” Of the 15 players who went on the tour 12 are eligible for next year’s World Cup. “We took Shevon Daniel as captain and Trevin Mathews to give a little bit of stability because we felt that without at least two or three senior players they might struggle. That was the case but Shevon captained the team well. He brought the culture in that captains who have played before have laid the foundations and we owe it to them to do better. Because of that even guys who were touring for the first time weren’t scared, they also came out of their shell. That was a big positive.” Daniel won’t be around for the next World Cup as this tour probably will be his last. On his likely successor Mubarak said: “There is no one clear cut at the moment to take over the u19 captaincy from Shevon. I would like to say that we have this group, but still these boys haven’t captained their school, so they don’t have that leadership experience captaining their first eleven team yet.”","pubDate":"2023-04-09 20:06:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Champions Dambulla pick up Rs. 2 m, two individual awards","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Champions-Dambulla-pick-up-Rs--2-m--two-individual-awards/23-747220","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The National Super League 50-over cricket final was concluded at the R.

It was Brook who boarded the space rocket to the stratosphere, though, while Bohannon made steady progress in a productive winter with the Lions. But on Easter Sunday, his 26th birthday, Bohannon’s low-slung street-fighting, with doughty support from Steven Croft, took Lancashire to a draw against Surrey , champions last year. His hundred, off 173 balls, included 14 fours, two particularly memorable shots hammered through the covers. An astonishing turnaround in Leeds where Leicestershire , wooden spoonists last year, chased down 389 in 87 overs to beat Yorkshire at Headingley for the first time since 1910, clinched with seven balls to spare. Rishi Patel laid the table for the bold pursuit with his maiden first-class hundred, and the dashers danced about him, barely slowing as wickets fell – Dom Bess took five. Sussex whittled down the 59 they needed to beat Durham in a nervy hour, winning their opening championship match of the season for the first time since 2015. Despite an obdurate partnership between Ryan Higgins and Luke Hollman, Middlesex could not recover from their disastrous top‑order batting, losing against Essex by 97 runs. Ben Compton proved that last year was no fluke, with an unbeaten 114 to take Kent to a 19-point win against Northamptonshire . Tom Lammonby (66 not out) had to listen to the familiar thud of wickets falling at the other end, as Warwickshire ’s Oliver Hannon-Dalby and Chris Rushworth gave Somerset a scare at Taunton. But together with Lewis Gregory and Craig Overton, the home team hauled themselves to safety. Jake Libby and Azhar Ali’s partnership of 139 sped Worcestershire to victory against Derbyshire at Derby; and Graeme van Buuren’s 110 took Gloucestershire to safety in a topsy-turvy game against Glamorgan at Sophia Gardens. 5h ago 14.05 EDT That’s it from me for this round.

The way our four seamers bowled on the third day, when they backed each other up, was outstanding and set the game up for us. “If there was a man of the match I’d give it to Ollie Carter. The way he kept wicket in both innings and the way be batted in the first innings, when he were 91 for 4 and he put together a partnership with [Cheteshwar] Pujara, and then again today was outstanding. In both innings he played really calmly and particularly this morning showed a lot of composure. He deserved to be the bloke who got us over the line. “It’s a great lesson for our team because it was shown they can beat good opponents. Bowling-wise, Durham’s attack is first division quality. They got a lot of good batters and are very experienced and will win a lot of games. They will win a lot of matches this year. “So hopefully the confidence this result gives our players, to have played in a really tough game on a fantastic cricket pitch, gives us something to really build on going forward.” 11h ago 08.10 EDT Lunchtime scores Division One The Rose Bowl : Notts 185 and 177 v Hampshire 231 and 132-2.

Middlesex need another 184, but with only three wickets left in the bag, and Warwickshire bat on at Taunton, a hundred for Sam Hain to go alongside yesterday’s ton for Al Davies, in the hunt for another batting point if they can get a wriggle on – 361-7.

However, I felt a bit sorry for Finlay Bean of Yorkshire when reading this today. Imagine being interviewed for the sports pages of a national daily newspaper only to grab a copy and read this headline they’d written about you - The Bargain Basement Batsman. It’s the last thing he deserved after his tight-fisted old man lived up to Boycott stereotypes and only paid his own kith-and-kin a measly 2 quid an hour!” 13h ago 05.56 EDT The Durham live stream For neutrals everywhere, this might be worth the first hour or so of your morning. The rest of the available streams can be picked up from the ECB website. 13h ago 05.42 EDT At Old Trafford the sun is out (though clouds hover) Lancashire are catching and Surrey warming up. A scattering of Easter spectators hunch their shoulders in the point. 14h ago 04.32 EDT It’s a busy day at Headingley where as well as the cricket, there is a double header of Super League this afternoon, the first game of the women’s season between Leeds and York followed by the last game of the men’s Super League Easter programme between the Rhinos and Huddersfield. 14h ago 04.32 EDT Saturday's round-up How to get Jonny Bairstow back into the Test team? Speculators have run their finger down the current XI, paused by the name of Ben Foakes and scuffed a large pencil asterisk next to his name. This one, he doesn’t rip apart phone directories, or haul up trees, in fact he doesn’t really do Bazball. But with Bairstow still recuperating from his broken leg, able only to run in straight lines, Foakes has started the County Championship season in the brightest possible hue. His 76 in the first innings against Lancashire was followed by a superb unbeaten hundred yesterday that enabled Rory Burns to declare with a lead of 443. In a Surrey lineup full of stars, Foakes’s innings stood out. There was fifty from Burns, a curtain of dark hair hanging loose from his helmet like a cavalier though batting like a roundhead, and a lovely cameo from Ollie Pope which came to an end in a hasty flurry of top edges, one caught by a diving Colin de Grandhomme, who lost his trousers in the process. But Foakes, long sleeves pulled up just so, played an innings of delight, full of no-fuss drives, cuts and sweeps, played with total control to bisect and thoroughly irritate fielders who then had to chase the ball to the boundary. The hundred came with a delicate sweep off Parkinson and was warmly applauded both on the field and on the Surrey balcony, where everyone wore their new regulation royal blue leisure wear. There was just time for Jordan Clark to ram a six before the declaration came. Matt Parkinson finished with five for 120 – not bad for a leg-spinner in early April. In the evening sunshine, Lancashire set off in search of what would be their second-highest fourth innings total, Foakes now immaculate behind the stumps. One of the early-season favourites, Hampshire , duly thrashed promoted Nottinghamshire by eight wickets, steaming gleefully to the top of the table, 19 points in their pocket. Fletcha Middleton, 21, son of the former cricketer Tony, made his second fifty of the game, putting on 101 with Nick Gubbins as Hampshire charged to their target of 132. Earlier, Mohammad Abbas had picked effectively away at the Notts tail, completing a haul of nine wickets in the game. The biggest surprise of the day was when, with scores level, the umpires took the players off for a 20-minute tea interval, to a chorus of boos. After the ignominy of being four for four in their first innings, Middlesex ’s suffered another top‑order malfunction in their second after being set 308 to win by Essex . This time it was 15 for three as Jamie Porter and Sam Cook resumed their deadly double act. The 18-year-old Rehan Ahmed, whose first over on Thursday was pancaked for 22, made a superb 85 in a determined rearguard sixth-wicket stand of 141 with the Australian Peter Handscomb, who danced to 112, as Leicestershire boldly chased Yorkshire ’s 517. Alex Davies hit his seventh first-class century as Warwickshire eased past Somerset in a game that lost its first day to a soggy outfield and looks likely to peter out into a draw. Jack Leach picked up three for 93. Marcus Harris waved prettily at the Australia selectors with a brilliant 148 that raised Gloucestershire from the dead at Sophia Gardens. Starting their second innings 239 runs behind Glamorgan , Harris and Chris Dent rattled along in a first‑wicket partnership of 161 at nearly five an over. A robust 101 not out from Rob Keogh gave Northamptonshire a whisker of a chance against Kent at Canterbury, backed up by fifty from Hassan Azad, who was released by Leicestershire during the winter. An unbeaten maiden hundred by Matthew Waite put Worcestershire in a dominant position against Derbyshire and Sussex were on the verge of turning the match against Durham on its head, needing 59 to win with wickets in hand. 14h ago 04.32 EDT Start of play scores Division One The Rose Bowl : Notts 185 and 177 v Hampshire 231 and 132-2.

Round the grounds, eight games are still in motion – with Hampshire putting their feet up after a three-day victory over Nottinghamshire yesterday. Plenty to keep an eye on, with Lancashire challenged to bat the day out against Kemar Roach and co; Northants unexpectedly giving Kent a run for their money and Middlesex in all sorts of trouble against Essex. Taunton looks likely to drift to a draw. In Division Two it’s all a-bubbling: a thriller in store at Hove , everything up in the air at Derby and S ophia Gardens and Leicestershire battling stoically for a draw against Yorkshire It is strange to think that three years ago on Easter Sunday, in theory the start of the Championship season, people celebrated by filming themselves at home during the first Covid lockdown.

The left-hander turned the chase on its head with an unbeaten 21-ball 48, after Kolkata slipped to 155-7 following Rashid Khan’s hat-trick at the world’s biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. Kolkata needed 29 from the final over off Yash Dayal. Rinku took strike after Umesh Yadav’s single on the first ball to send five hits over the fence and silence a raucous home crowd. The chase was set up by a 40-ball 83 by impact player Venkatesh Iyer, who put on a 100-run third-wicket stand with skipper Nitish Rana, who made 45. “Tonight was another example that we will never give up as a team,” Iyer said after the three-wicket win. “The wicket was quite good to bat and I was just trying to execute my plans.” Iyer, who came on in place of Suyash Sharma under the new impact player rule, fell to Alzarri Joseph and Rashid soon took over to claim his first Indian Premier League hat-trick. Rashid, a champion leg-spinner who now has four hat-tricks in T20 cricket, went for a celebratory sprint after sending back Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and Shardul Thakur. But little did Rashid know Rinku and Kolkata would have the last laugh. “A tough game for us, especially as a captain,” said Rashid, standing in as skipper for the unwell Hardik Pandya. “That is what T20 is all about, it is about entertainment.” After two straight wins, two-time champions Kolkata took second spot in the 10-team table, behind leaders Rajasthan Royals. It was a first defeat of the season for Gujarat, who won the league in their debut campaign last year. Earlier Gujarat’s Vijay Shankar smashed five sixes in his 24-ball 63 as Gujarat took 45 runs from the final two overs to reach 204-4. Shankar stood out for Gujarat with his blitz and key partnerships including an unbeaten 51-run fifth-wicket stand with David Miller, who made two.The post Kolkata’s Rinku hits five sixes in final over to win IPL thriller first appeared on Ariana News.","pubDate":"2023-04-09 17:55:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"ariananews","category":["sports"],"country":["Afghanistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rahul, Mayank lead SRH to open successful account in TATA IPL 2023","link":"https://www.livemint.com/sports/cricket-news/rahul-mayank-lead-srh-to-open-successful-account-in-tata-ipl-2023-11681061419759.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Saurav Mukherjee"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sunrisers Hyderabad defeated the PBKS by 8 wickets with 17 balls remaining.","content":"Despite a rough start in the Tata IPL 2023 season, Sunrisers Hyderabad on 9 April registered their first victory against Punjab Kings, while playing at Hyderabad.
