Pakistan reached the final after back-to-back victories, setting up a thrilling showdown. While both teams have performed well, the toss could play a decisive role, according to past trends and statistics.At the Dubai International Stadium, India and Pakistan faced off twice this season, with India winning both encounters. Interestingly, in the five T20Is played between these teams at this venue, the side batting second has always emerged victorious.This suggests that the winner of the toss, who chooses to bowl first, may hold a crucial advantage tonight.India Riding High in Asia Cup 2025Team India enters the Asia Cup 2025 final in superb form, having won all their matches so far. Abhishek Sharma has been the standout performer with the bat, accumulating 309 runs in six games at an impressive strike rate of 204. Tilak Verma has also contributed consistently alongside Abhishek, providing stability at the top order.On the bowling front, Kuldeep Yadav has delivered impactful performances, helping India dominate their opponents throughout the tournament. The combination of in-form batters and effective bowlers makes Team India a strong contender for Asia Cup title.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-09-28 12:24:28","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/09/28/7f601a204363791740688376e044a8f5175906222902324_original.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","source_name":"Abp News","source_priority":7754,"source_url":"http://abplive.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/abplive.jpg","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","ai_content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"4a2ea6b7a62c680745eae166ba578c2b","title":"IND vs PAK Final: Asia Cup 2025 Prize Money Hits Record High","link":"https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-asia-cup-final-2025-prize-money-hits-record-high-1802903","keywords":["cricket"],"creator":["ABP Live Sports"],"description":"The Asia Cup 2025 has reached its electrifying climax, and for the first time in 41 years, fans will witness a historic India vs Pakistan final.Cricket’s fiercest rivalry will take center stage at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, where the two powerhouses will battle it out for the ultimate glory. The match is set to begin at 8 PM IST, and the stakes couldn't be higher, not just in terms of pride and legacy, but also when it comes to record-breaking prize money.Asia Cup 2025 Prize MoneyThis year, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) has ramped up the rewards like never before. The winning team will take home a whopping US$300,000, while the runner-up will receive US$150,000.In Indian currency, that’s approximately ₹2.6 crore for the champions and ₹1.33 crore for the second-place finishers—a massive jump from previous editions.To compare, when Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup in 2022, they received US$200,000, while Pakistan, the runners-up, took home US$100,000. In 2023, India lifted the trophy and were awarded US$250,000, with Sri Lanka earning US$125,000 as runners-up.With India entering the final unbeaten and Pakistan determined to break the streak, the atmosphere is nothing short of electric.
