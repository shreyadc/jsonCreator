The son of West Indies great Shivnarine, the 27-year-old is doing his best to take the shine off the ball and put pressure back on Australia. Given it’s been 44 years since Australia won the toss and bowled first in Adelaide, there is extra pressure on the home side to make the most of this pitch early on. One thing we know about this Australian side is that they will be mighty patient. Seldom do we see this team lose their bundle and panic when things aren’t going their way. A bit of swing and seam for this formidable opening pair of Starc and Hazlewood as Brathwaite edges one towards first slip but it falls short. The skipper fails to move his front foot and can consider himself lucky that that didn’t ball fly to Khawaja at first slip. Starc nearly strikes. A tidy maiden from the left-armer. West Indies 0-14 Also, if anyone knows a member of the ground staff in Adelaide, give them a buzz.

Credit: Getty The 11 players Australia have gone with for this match have played a combined 689 Tests (62.6 per player). By comparison, the West Indies’ XI has 235 Tests between them (21.4 per player). This graphic is a good visual to show just how experienced this Australian side is. The average age has dropped for this match since David Warner’s retirement in Sydney. The left-handed Chanderpaul tries to let a ball go off Mitchell Starc through to Alex Carey but it finds the edge of his bat. It flies off at a 45-degree angle to gully region but it goes past Cam Green who was no chance of catching that. It would have been an ugly way to go and a lazy outcome for an opening batsman. At the other end, Hazlewood is getting into his groove but is less than amused after Brathwaite french cuts one down to the fine leg boundary for four. It’s early days but there doesn’t seem to be too many demons in this Adelaide pitch. That could change very quickly though. West Indies 0-14 Travis Head, Steve Smith and Pat Cummins before play in Adelaide. Credit: Getty Only nine teams have won the toss and bowled in an Adelaide Test going back a century and only one has triumphed. The West Indies managed to do so in 1982 to level a three-Test series one-all. After a hot lead-up in Adelaide this week, Wednesday is a wonderful bowling day; cool, cloudy and the pitch with a tinge of green. It will take a mighty effort by the inexperienced West Indians, with three debutants, to last the day against this Australian attack. Going into the match they had played 235 Tests between them, with captain Kraigg Braithwaite and veteran paceman Kemar Roach having 166 between them. Australia collectively tops 700 Tests. It’s the first time Australia has won the toss and bowled in Adelaide since 1980. Meanwhile, Josh Hazlewood’s first over goes for a couple of runs. West Indies 0-2 Mitchell Starc has the new ball in his hand and gets one to fizz past the off stump of Kraigg Brathwaite to start us off today. There is a little bit of swing and nip off the seam from the first couple of deliveries. Ball four and Starc beats the outside edge. Brathwaite looks a little tentative to get on the front foot, but he will be eyeing off the big gap that has been left in the cover region. It’s a maiden to start the day. West Indies 0-0 Australian opener Usman Khawaja has continued his push to be heard on issues relating to the war in Gaza after releasing a T-shirt featuring a picture of the shoes he was banned from wearing in Test cricket. Usman Khawaja with his T-shirts for sale. Credit: Instagram Khawaja was seen at training last month wearing shoes featuring the slogans “all lives are equal” and “freedom is a human right”, which were references to the ongoing conflict in Palestine. The 37-year-old wanted to wear the shoes in a Test match but, despite having the backing of Cricket Australia, was told by the International Cricket Council he was not allowed to do so. Khawaja was reprimanded by the ICC for wearing a black armband and also told he could not take the field with shoes featuring a dove. READ THE FULL YARN HERE The West Indies have a handful of debutants, with Kavem Hodge, Justin Greaves, Shamar Joseph all getting thei first opportunities at the top level. Australian skipper Pat Cummins has sent the West Indies into bat in Adelaide. Shades of the World Cup final against India with that call, albeit on a very different surface and with a different coloured ball. Windies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite said he would have had a bat. A weak sun is starting to break through the clouds over Adelaide Oval, which brought rain and a cool change to the venue for the first Test between Australia and the West Indies. It’s 31 years since the Caribbean side won their last series down under, a result made possible by a one-run win here in late January 1993. This time Australia are the undisputed world champions, with West Indies stripped further of their chances of challenged by the exodus of seven players to Twenty20 franchise leagues.

Interestingly, captain Kraigg Brathwaite says he would have batted first anyway so everyone’s happy. 10m ago 18.01 EST Preamble Greetings cricket fans! Welcome to Adelaide for the Guardian’s over-by-over coverage of the first Test in this two-match series between Australia and West Indies for the famous Frank Worrell Trophy. Angus Fontaine here to steer you through the opening sessions with Geoff Lemon taking you to stumps. This will be the 119th Test fought out by these two mighty cricket nations. Of the 118 clashes since 1930-31, Australia have won 60 and West Indies 32, with 25 draws and one famous tie in 1960-61, the first in Test cricket history and a contest (and series) still considered by Wisden the G.O.A.T . That breathtaking, crowdpleasing showdown was widely lauded for reinventing Test cricket for the modern age. Although Australia won it, West Indies got their revenge in 1964-65, their first ever series win over Australia and the spark for the era of dominance that followed. The men from the Caribbean would win every Frank Worrell Trophy from 1977 until May 1995, when Steve Waugh’s double-century (and twin Mark’s 126) at Sabina Park, Kingston won back an ascendancy Australia have held ever since. This West Indies side isn’t expected to reclaim those former glories. They arrived in Australia ranked eighth in the world and with seven uncapped players in their squad of 15 (and only four survivors from the series they lost 2-0 last summer). But cool cat captain Kraigg Brathwaite and fast bowling deputy Alzarri Joseph deputy have great faith in veteran quick Kemar Roach and high hopes for a fresh-faced batting lineup that showed great promise in their warm-up game last week . Pat Cummins’ Australians arrive in Adelaide hot from their 3-0 sweep of Pakistan and still aglow from the feats of 2023 – an Ashes retention, victory in the World Test Championship and winning the ODI World Cup. However, it’s a fresh start for them too, with this the first Test in the post-David Warner era. Matthew Renshaw comes into the squad, Cameron Green is recalled to bat at No 4 and Steve Smith adds a new feather to his baggy green by stepping up as opening batter for the first time . So there’s intrigue aplenty and an exciting day lies ahead of us. It’s been hot, damn hot, in Adelaide. But the forecast today is for sunshine, clear skies and temperatures in the low-to-mid twenties. Perfect weather for cricket and a glorious stage for this Test at the beautiful Adelaide Oval. Buckle ‘em up and batten ‘em down.

Cummins said: “Looks like there’s a fair bit of grass on the wicket and (we’ll have) first use of it.” West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said he would have chosen to bat. Brett Lee said on Fox Cricket: “I reckon the Aussies might bowl first. They’ll go for the kill.” Pat Cummins elected to bowl first.

Newer ball, there’s probably more gaps around the field. Hopefully I can be free flowing.” 9.30am - Aussie legend ‘nearly vomited’ at Smith move The decision to pick Steve Smith to open the batting surprised many, given specialist opener Cameron Bancroft was overlooked despite strong Sheffield Shield form. Fox Cricket’s Brendon Julian said elevating Smith to opener and slotting Cam Green in at No.4 undoubtedly makes the Australian team better overall . But not everyone is happy with the selection call. Several West Australian greats including former Australian captain Kim Hughes have slammed Bancroft’s omission. “I nearly vomited,” Hughes told WA Sport. “I’ve got no doubts in my mind that if Cameron Bancroft played for New South Wales he’d be in the Test side. He’s in his prime. Steve Smith will open the batting against the West Indies. (Photo by Mark Brake/Getty Images) Cam Green is back in the Aussie side. (Photo by Sarah Reed/Getty Images) “Smith is struggling at the moment. He’s been an absolute superstar, but as an opener, he is no more opener than me opening the bowling. “He needs to stay at No.4, get his mojo back if you like, without all the fluff.” Pat Cummins said there was no conspiracy as to why Cameron Bancroft wasn’t chosen to replace Warner in this series. “Yeah, I’ve got absolutely no issues with Bangers, love what he brings,” Cummins said in Adelaide. “(I told him) ‘just don’t change. We’ve loved playing with you in the past and keep doing your thing. I’m sure you’ll be back in Aussie colours pretty soon.” More Coverage ‘Ridiculous’ rules cricket must change now Australia just made Test team even better 9am - Teams named, Smith change confirmed Australia XI: Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Cameron Green, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey (wk), Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (c), Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood West Indies XI: Kraigg Brathwaite (c), Tagenarine Chanderpaul, Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze, Kavem Hodge, Justin Greaves, Joshua Da Silva (wk), Gudakesh Motie, Alzarri Joseph, Shamar Joseph, Kemar Roach Originally published as Australia vs West Indies Day 1 live: Legend ‘nearly vomited’ at Steve Smith move More related stories Cricket ‘Mentally fatiguing’: Smith breaks down opening desire Australia takes its first steps towards a new era against an inexperienced West Indies lineup in today’s Test at the Adelaide Oval.

This will be India's final T20 game ahead of the World Cup in June, and the team management wouldn't want any drop in intensity that was displayed during victories at Mohali and Indore. India's identical six-wicket wins were marked by an ultra-aggressive mindset from ball one that saw them chasing down 159 in 17.3 overs and 173 in 15.4 overs respectively. It was a clear deviation from their earlier approach of building the momentum for a final flourish in T20s. None showed this intent more brightly than Shivam Dube and Virat Kohli. Kohli was playing a T20 for India after 14 months at Indore, but he creamed a 16-ball 29 at a strike rate of 181. The most noteworthy feature of his little yet significant innings was the way he handled Afghan spinner Mujeeb-ur-Rahman, whom he carted for 18 runs off seven balls, striking against him at a rate of 257. Kohli has always been a bit of a slow-mover against spin but there was no trepidation this time and he showed commendable alacrity to contribute his two cents to a transformed approach. Dube reappeared in the Indian blue after a gap of three years when he was selected for the T20 series against Ireland at Malahide, Dublin, last year. But after playing in the subsequent Asian Games, Dube could not find a spot in the series against Australia and South Africa. However, the scattered appearances did not prevent Dube from following the path set by the think tank. His two brutal fifties were too heavy to handle for Afghanistan, who did not have the services of injured star spinner Rashid Khan. Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, who had missed the first match at Mohali with a groin niggle, too showed the willingness to imbibe the pattern with a quick half-century in the last game. India will eye an encore from the trio here. Among these slews of positives, a minor irritant has been the failure of Rohit to fire. He was run out in the first match after a mix up with Shubman Gill, while misjudging pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi's length doomed him at Indore. His tally of two runs across as many matches will not worry the management by any stretch of imagination. But they will certainly like to see him signing off from the series with a substantial innings. While India might not affect any major changes in the batting unit, the think-tank can look to give some game-time to Kuldeep Yadav and Avesh Khan. The left-arm wrist spinner can come in for either Ravi Bishnoi or Washington Sundar, and Avesh can replace his fellow pacer Mukesh Kumar. Wicketkeeper batter Jitesh Sharma has been playing T20Is from the fourth match against Australia last year at Raipur, and if the thought leaders want to give him a rest, they have the option of bringing in Sanju Samson. As for Afghanistan, they have shown isolated sparks in this series without being able to transform them into match-winning fireworks. They would hope for a good effort from opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz after two mediocre outings, as his salvos up the order go a long way in Afghans setting or chasing a target. The smooth pitch at the Chinnaswamy Stadium and its shorter boundaries offer him a fine chance to be among runs. A victory against India will also boost Afghanistan's confidence ahead of a packed away calendar consisting of fixtures against Sri Lanka and Ireland. Teams (from): India: Rohit Sharma (captain), Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Ravi Bishnoi, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Avesh Khan, Mukesh Kumar.

The son of West Indies great Shivnarine, the 27-year-old is doing his best to take the shine off the ball and put pressure back on Australia. Given it’s been 44 years since Australia won the toss and bowled first in Adelaide, there is extra pressure on the home side to make the most of this pitch early on. One thing we know about this Australian side is that they will be mighty patient. Seldom do we see this team lose their bundle and panic when things aren’t going their way. A bit of swing and seam for this formidable opening pair of Starc and Hazlewood as Brathwaite edges one towards first slip but it falls short. The skipper fails to move his front foot and can consider himself lucky that that didn’t ball fly to Khawaja at first slip. Starc nearly strikes. A tidy maiden from the left-armer. West Indies 0-14 Also, if anyone knows a member of the ground staff in Adelaide, give them a buzz.

Credit: Getty The 11 players Australia have gone with for this match have played a combined 689 Tests (62.6 per player). By comparison, the West Indies’ XI has 235 Tests between them (21.4 per player). This graphic is a good visual to show just how experienced this Australian side is. The average age has dropped for this match since David Warner’s retirement in Sydney. The left-handed Chanderpaul tries to let a ball go off Mitchell Starc through to Alex Carey but it finds the edge of his bat. It flies off at a 45-degree angle to gully region but it goes past Cam Green who was no chance of catching that. It would have been an ugly way to go and a lazy outcome for an opening batsman. At the other end, Hazlewood is getting into his groove but is less than amused after Brathwaite french cuts one down to the fine leg boundary for four. It’s early days but there doesn’t seem to be too many demons in this Adelaide pitch. That could change very quickly though. West Indies 0-14 Travis Head, Steve Smith and Pat Cummins before play in Adelaide. Credit: Getty Only nine teams have won the toss and bowled in an Adelaide Test going back a century and only one has triumphed. The West Indies managed to do so in 1982 to level a three-Test series one-all. After a hot lead-up in Adelaide this week, Wednesday is a wonderful bowling day; cool, cloudy and the pitch with a tinge of green. It will take a mighty effort by the inexperienced West Indians, with three debutants, to last the day against this Australian attack. Going into the match they had played 235 Tests between them, with captain Kraigg Braithwaite and veteran paceman Kemar Roach having 166 between them. Australia collectively tops 700 Tests. It’s the first time Australia has won the toss and bowled in Adelaide since 1980. Meanwhile, Josh Hazlewood’s first over goes for a couple of runs. West Indies 0-2 Mitchell Starc has the new ball in his hand and gets one to fizz past the off stump of Kraigg Brathwaite to start us off today. There is a little bit of swing and nip off the seam from the first couple of deliveries. Ball four and Starc beats the outside edge. Brathwaite looks a little tentative to get on the front foot, but he will be eyeing off the big gap that has been left in the cover region. It’s a maiden to start the day. West Indies 0-0 Australian opener Usman Khawaja has continued his push to be heard on issues relating to the war in Gaza after releasing a T-shirt featuring a picture of the shoes he was banned from wearing in Test cricket. Usman Khawaja with his T-shirts for sale. Credit: Instagram Khawaja was seen at training last month wearing shoes featuring the slogans “all lives are equal” and “freedom is a human right”, which were references to the ongoing conflict in Palestine. The 37-year-old wanted to wear the shoes in a Test match but, despite having the backing of Cricket Australia, was told by the International Cricket Council he was not allowed to do so. Khawaja was reprimanded by the ICC for wearing a black armband and also told he could not take the field with shoes featuring a dove.

This time Australia are the undisputed world champions, with West Indies stripped further of their chances of challenged by the exodus of seven players to Twenty20 franchise leagues. The Australian and West Indies teams took part in a barefoot circle before the first Test in Adelaide began on Wednesday, Australia’s version of taking a knee. It is a mark of respect to traditional owners which has been performed at the start of every series since November 2020. Now captain Pat Cummins admits, at the time, that Australian cricket had not done enough to combat racism. “Obviously not only as a sport but we as people are absolutely against racism. I think we could probably put our hands up and say we haven’t done enough in the past and we want to get better,” Cummins said. “Racism exists. We want to do our bit to try and help stop that and try and be better. Travis Head admits he was taken aback by the scale of adulation for his World Cup exploits , and has vowed to return to his attacking best in Adelaide after the slimmest home Test series of his career. A hero of Australia’s Cup campaign and a cult figure for his prominent role in the celebrations afterwards, Head walked to the wicket in Perth, Melbourne and Sydney to receptions he was only used to getting in home town Adelaide. Those welcome cheers were swiftly followed by groans: Head cobbled just 81 runs in five innings against Pakistan, ending a hugely productive three-year run of scoring. At the end of the series, still battling the after-effects of a rapid rehabilitation from a broken hand to take part in the World Cup, Head chose to rest rather than join the likes of Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith and Alex Carey in the Big Bash League. He spent extra time at home with his wife Jess and daughter Milla, while also working to return to the technical fundamentals and clear mindset that allowed him to dominate India in Ahmedabad a couple of months before.

Khawaja was seen at training last month wearing shoes featuring the slogans ‘all lives are equal’ and ‘freedom is a human right’, which were references to the ongoing conflict in Palestine. The 37-year-old wanted to wear the shoes in a Test match but, despite having the backing of Cricket Australia, was told by the International Cricket Council he was not allowed to do so. Khawaja was reprimanded by the ICC and also told he could not take the field with shoes featuring a dove. The West Indies have a handful of debutants, with Kavem Hodge, Justin Greaves, Shamar Joseph all getting thei first opportunities at the top level. Australian skipper Pat Cummins has sent the West Indies into bat in Adelaide. Shades of the World Cup final against India with that call, albeit on a very different surface and with a different coloured ball. Windies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite said he would have had a bat. A weak sun is starting to break through the clouds over Adelaide Oval, which brought rain and a cool change to the venue for the first Test between Australia and the West Indies. It’s 31 years since the Caribbean side won their last series down under, a result made possible by a one-run win here in late January 1993. This time Australia are the undisputed world champions, with West Indies stripped further of their chances of challenged by the exodus of seven players to Twenty20 franchise leagues. The Australian and West Indies teams took part in a barefoot circle before the first Test in Adelaide began on Wednesday, Australia’s version of taking a knee. It is a mark of respect to traditional owners which has been performed at the start of every series since November 2020. Now captain Pat Cummins admits, at the time, that Australian cricket had not done enough to combat racism. “Obviously not only as a sport but we as people are absolutely against racism. I think we could probably put our hands up and say we haven’t done enough in the past and we want to get better,” Cummins said. “Racism exists. We want to do our bit to try and help stop that and try and be better. Travis Head admits he was taken aback , and has vowed to return to his attacking best in Adelaide after the slimmest home Test series of his career. A hero of Australia’s Cup campaign and a cult figure for his prominent role in the celebrations afterwards, Head walked to the wicket in Perth, Melbourne and Sydney to receptions he was only used to getting in home town Adelaide. Those welcome cheers were swiftly followed by groans: Head cobbled just 81 runs in five innings against Pakistan, ending a hugely productive three-year run of scoring. At the end of the series, still battling the after-effects of to take part in the World Cup, Head chose to rest rather than join the likes of Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith and Alex Carey in the Big Bash League. He spent extra time at home with his wife Jess and daughter Milla, while also working to return to the technical fundamentals and clear mindset that allowed him to dominate India in Ahmedabad a couple of months before.

Interestingly, captain Kraigg Brathwaite says he would have batted first anyway so everyone’s happy. 10m ago 18.01 EST Preamble Greetings cricket fans! Welcome to Adelaide for the Guardian’s over-by-over coverage of the first Test in this two-match series between Australia and West Indies for the famous Frank Worrell Trophy. Angus Fontaine here to steer you through the opening sessions with Geoff Lemon taking you to stumps. This will be the 119th Test fought out by these two mighty cricket nations. Of the 118 clashes since 1930-31, Australia have won 60 and West Indies 32, with 25 draws and one famous tie in 1960-61, the first in Test cricket history and a contest (and series) still considered by Wisden the G.O.A.T . That breathtaking, crowdpleasing showdown was widely lauded for reinventing Test cricket for the modern age. Although Australia won it, West Indies got their revenge in 1964-65, their first ever series win over Australia and the spark for the era of dominance that followed. The men from the Caribbean would win every Frank Worrell Trophy from 1977 until May 1995, when Steve Waugh’s double-century (and twin Mark’s 126) at Sabina Park, Kingston won back an ascendancy Australia have held ever since. This West Indies side isn’t expected to reclaim those former glories. They arrived in Australia ranked eighth in the world and with seven uncapped players in their squad of 15 (and only four survivors from the series they lost 2-0 last summer). But cool cat captain Kraigg Brathwaite and fast bowling deputy Alzarri Joseph deputy have great faith in veteran quick Kemar Roach and high hopes for a fresh-faced batting lineup that showed great promise in their warm-up game last week . Pat Cummins’ Australians arrive in Adelaide hot from their 3-0 sweep of Pakistan and still aglow from the feats of 2023 – an Ashes retention, victory in the World Test Championship and winning the ODI World Cup. However, it’s a fresh start for them too, with this the first Test in the post-David Warner era. Matthew Renshaw comes into the squad, Cameron Green is recalled to bat at No 4 and Steve Smith adds a new feather to his baggy green by stepping up as opening batter for the first time . So there’s intrigue aplenty and an exciting day lies ahead of us. It’s been hot, damn hot, in Adelaide. But the forecast today is for sunshine, clear skies and temperatures in the low-to-mid twenties. Perfect weather for cricket and a glorious stage for this Test at the beautiful Adelaide Oval. Buckle ‘em up and batten ‘em down.

Play is due to begin in Adelaide at 10.30am AEDT. 10.01am - Aussies win toss, to ‘go for the kill’ Overcast conditions in Adelaide could make for favourable bowling conditions and Pat Cummins has chosen to bowl first after winning the toss. Cummins said: “Looks like there’s a fair bit of grass on the wicket and (we’ll have) first use of it.” West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said he would have chosen to bat. Brett Lee said on Fox Cricket: “I reckon the Aussies might bowl first. They’ll go for the kill.” Pat Cummins elected to bowl first. Photo: Fox Cricket. 9.40am - Smith ‘excited’ to open Steve Smith told Fox Cricket on Wednesday morning he was excited to open the batting in Test cricket for the first time. “It’s nothing foreign,” he said of his move up the order. “I’ve been waiting to bat for a long time since Marnus has been playing. “I’m just keen to get out there and amongst it. “I’m just excited by the challenge. Newer ball, there’s probably more gaps around the field. Hopefully I can be free flowing.” 9.30am - Aussie legend ‘nearly vomited’ at Smith move The decision to pick Steve Smith to open the batting surprised many, given specialist opener Cameron Bancroft was overlooked despite strong Sheffield Shield form. Fox Cricket’s Brendon Julian said elevating Smith to opener and slotting Cam Green in at No.4 undoubtedly makes the Australian team better overall . But not everyone is happy with the selection call. Several West Australian greats including former Australian captain Kim Hughes have slammed Bancroft’s omission. “I nearly vomited,” Hughes told WA Sport. “I’ve got no doubts in my mind that if Cameron Bancroft played for New South Wales he’d be in the Test side. He’s in his prime. Steve Smith will open the batting against the West Indies. (Photo by Mark Brake/Getty Images) Cam Green is back in the Aussie side. (Photo by Sarah Reed/Getty Images) “Smith is struggling at the moment. He’s been an absolute superstar, but as an opener, he is no more opener than me opening the bowling. “He needs to stay at No.4, get his mojo back if you like, without all the fluff.” Pat Cummins said there was no conspiracy as to why Cameron Bancroft wasn’t chosen to replace Warner in this series. “Yeah, I’ve got absolutely no issues with Bangers, love what he brings,” Cummins said in Adelaide. “(I told him) ‘just don’t change. We’ve loved playing with you in the past and keep doing your thing. I’m sure you’ll be back in Aussie colours pretty soon.” More Coverage ‘Ridiculous’ rules cricket must change now Australia just made Test team even better 9am - Teams named, Smith change confirmed Australia XI: Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Cameron Green, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey (wk), Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (c), Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood West Indies XI: Kraigg Brathwaite (c), Tagenarine Chanderpaul, Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze, Kavem Hodge, Justin Greaves, Joshua Da Silva (wk), Gudakesh Motie, Alzarri Joseph, Shamar Joseph, Kemar Roach Originally published as Australia vs West Indies Day 1 live: Legend ‘nearly vomited’ at Steve Smith move More related stories Cricket ‘Mentally fatiguing’: Smith breaks down opening desire Australia takes its first steps towards a new era against an inexperienced West Indies lineup in today’s Test at the Adelaide Oval.

This will be India's final T20 game ahead of the World Cup in June, and the team management wouldn't want any drop in intensity that was displayed during victories at Mohali and Indore. India's identical six-wicket wins were marked by an ultra-aggressive mindset from ball one that saw them chasing down 159 in 17.3 overs and 173 in 15.4 overs respectively. It was a clear deviation from their earlier approach of building the momentum for a final flourish in T20s. None showed this intent more brightly than Shivam Dube and Virat Kohli. Kohli was playing a T20 for India after 14 months at Indore, but he creamed a 16-ball 29 at a strike rate of 181. The most noteworthy feature of his little yet significant innings was the way he handled Afghan spinner Mujeeb-ur-Rahman, whom he carted for 18 runs off seven balls, striking against him at a rate of 257. Kohli has always been a bit of a slow-mover against spin but there was no trepidation this time and he showed commendable alacrity to contribute his two cents to a transformed approach. Dube reappeared in the Indian blue after a gap of three years when he was selected for the T20 series against Ireland at Malahide, Dublin, last year. But after playing in the subsequent Asian Games, Dube could not find a spot in the series against Australia and South Africa. However, the scattered appearances did not prevent Dube from following the path set by the think tank. His two brutal fifties were too heavy to handle for Afghanistan, who did not have the services of injured star spinner Rashid Khan. Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, who had missed the first match at Mohali with a groin niggle, too showed the willingness to imbibe the pattern with a quick half-century in the last game. India will eye an encore from the trio here. Among these slews of positives, a minor irritant has been the failure of Rohit to fire. He was run out in the first match after a mix up with Shubman Gill, while misjudging pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi's length doomed him at Indore. His tally of two runs across as many matches will not worry the management by any stretch of imagination. But they will certainly like to see him signing off from the series with a substantial innings. While India might not affect any major changes in the batting unit, the think-tank can look to give some game-time to Kuldeep Yadav and Avesh Khan. The left-arm wrist spinner can come in for either Ravi Bishnoi or Washington Sundar, and Avesh can replace his fellow pacer Mukesh Kumar. Wicketkeeper batter Jitesh Sharma has been playing T20Is from the fourth match against Australia last year at Raipur, and if the thought leaders want to give him a rest, they have the option of bringing in Sanju Samson. As for Afghanistan, they have shown isolated sparks in this series without being able to transform them into match-winning fireworks. They would hope for a good effort from opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz after two mediocre outings, as his salvos up the order go a long way in Afghans setting or chasing a target. The smooth pitch at the Chinnaswamy Stadium and its shorter boundaries offer him a fine chance to be among runs. A victory against India will also boost Afghanistan's confidence ahead of a packed away calendar consisting of fixtures against Sri Lanka and Ireland. Teams (from): India: Rohit Sharma (captain), Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Ravi Bishnoi, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Avesh Khan, Mukesh Kumar.

The son of West Indies great Shivnarine, the 27-year-old is doing his best to take the shine off the ball and put pressure back on Australia. Given it’s been 44 years since Australia won the toss and bowled first in Adelaide, there is extra pressure on the home side to make the most of this pitch early on. One thing we know about this Australian side is that they will be mighty patient. Seldom do we see this team lose their bundle and panic when things aren’t going their way. A bit of swing and seam for this formidable opening pair of Starc and Hazlewood as Brathwaite edges one towards first slip but it falls short. The skipper fails to move his front foot and can consider himself lucky that that didn’t ball fly to Khawaja at first slip. Starc nearly strikes. A tidy maiden from the left-armer. West Indies 0-14 Also, if anyone knows a member of the ground staff in Adelaide, give them a buzz.

Credit: Getty The 11 players Australia have gone with for this match have played a combined 689 Tests (62.6 per player). By comparison, the West Indies’ XI has 235 Tests between them (21.4 per player). This graphic is a good visual to show just how experienced this Australian side is. The average age has dropped for this match since David Warner’s retirement in Sydney. The left-handed Chanderpaul tries to let a ball go off Mitchell Starc through to Alex Carey but it finds the edge of his bat. It flies off at a 45-degree angle to gully region but it goes past Cam Green who was no chance of catching that. It would have been an ugly way to go and a lazy outcome for an opening batsman. At the other end, Hazlewood is getting into his groove but is less than amused after Brathwaite french cuts one down to the fine leg boundary for four. It’s early days but there doesn’t seem to be too many demons in this Adelaide pitch. That could change very quickly though. West Indies 0-14 Travis Head, Steve Smith and Pat Cummins before play in Adelaide. Credit: Getty Only nine teams have won the toss and bowled in an Adelaide Test going back a century and only one has triumphed. The West Indies managed to do so in 1982 to level a three-Test series one-all. After a hot lead-up in Adelaide this week, Wednesday is a wonderful bowling day; cool, cloudy and the pitch with a tinge of green. It will take a mighty effort by the inexperienced West Indians, with three debutants, to last the day against this Australian attack. Going into the match they had played 235 Tests between them, with captain Kraigg Braithwaite and veteran paceman Kemar Roach having 166 between them. Australia collectively tops 700 Tests. It’s the first time Australia has won the toss and bowled in Adelaide since 1980. Meanwhile, Josh Hazlewood’s first over goes for a couple of runs. West Indies 0-2 Mitchell Starc has the new ball in his hand and gets one to fizz past the off stump of Kraigg Brathwaite to start us off today. There is a little bit of swing and nip off the seam from the first couple of deliveries. Ball four and Starc beats the outside edge. Brathwaite looks a little tentative to get on the front foot, but he will be eyeing off the big gap that has been left in the cover region. It’s a maiden to start the day. West Indies 0-0 Australian opener Usman Khawaja has continued his push to be heard on issues relating to the war in Gaza after releasing a T-shirt featuring a picture of the shoes he was banned from wearing in Test cricket.

Khawaja was reprimanded by the ICC for wearing a black armband and also told he could not take the field with shoes featuring a dove.

Interestingly, captain Kraigg Brathwaite says he would have batted first anyway so everyone’s happy. 10m ago 18.01 EST Preamble Greetings cricket fans! Welcome to Adelaide for the Guardian’s over-by-over coverage of the first Test in this two-match series between Australia and West Indies for the famous Frank Worrell Trophy. Angus Fontaine here to steer you through the opening sessions with Geoff Lemon taking you to stumps. This will be the 119th Test fought out by these two mighty cricket nations. Of the 118 clashes since 1930-31, Australia have won 60 and West Indies 32, with 25 draws and one famous tie in 1960-61, the first in Test cricket history and a contest (and series) still considered by Wisden the G.O.A.T . That breathtaking, crowdpleasing showdown was widely lauded for reinventing Test cricket for the modern age. Although Australia won it, West Indies got their revenge in 1964-65, their first ever series win over Australia and the spark for the era of dominance that followed. The men from the Caribbean would win every Frank Worrell Trophy from 1977 until May 1995, when Steve Waugh’s double-century (and twin Mark’s 126) at Sabina Park, Kingston won back an ascendancy Australia have held ever since. This West Indies side isn’t expected to reclaim those former glories. They arrived in Australia ranked eighth in the world and with seven uncapped players in their squad of 15 (and only four survivors from the series they lost 2-0 last summer). But cool cat captain Kraigg Brathwaite and fast bowling deputy Alzarri Joseph deputy have great faith in veteran quick Kemar Roach and high hopes for a fresh-faced batting lineup that showed great promise in their warm-up game last week . Pat Cummins’ Australians arrive in Adelaide hot from their 3-0 sweep of Pakistan and still aglow from the feats of 2023 – an Ashes retention, victory in the World Test Championship and winning the ODI World Cup. However, it’s a fresh start for them too, with this the first Test in the post-David Warner era. Matthew Renshaw comes into the squad, Cameron Green is recalled to bat at No 4 and Steve Smith adds a new feather to his baggy green by stepping up as opening batter for the first time . So there’s intrigue aplenty and an exciting day lies ahead of us. It’s been hot, damn hot, in Adelaide. But the forecast today is for sunshine, clear skies and temperatures in the low-to-mid twenties. Perfect weather for cricket and a glorious stage for this Test at the beautiful Adelaide Oval.

Play is due to begin in Adelaide at 10.30am AEDT. 10.01am - Aussies win toss, to ‘go for the kill’ Overcast conditions in Adelaide could make for favourable bowling conditions and Pat Cummins has chosen to bowl first after winning the toss. Cummins said: “Looks like there’s a fair bit of grass on the wicket and (we’ll have) first use of it.” West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said he would have chosen to bat. Brett Lee said on Fox Cricket: “I reckon the Aussies might bowl first. They’ll go for the kill.” Pat Cummins elected to bowl first. Photo: Fox Cricket. 9.40am - Smith ‘excited’ to open Steve Smith told Fox Cricket on Wednesday morning he was excited to open the batting in Test cricket for the first time. “It’s nothing foreign,” he said of his move up the order. “I’ve been waiting to bat for a long time since Marnus has been playing. “I’m just keen to get out there and amongst it. “I’m just excited by the challenge. Newer ball, there’s probably more gaps around the field. Hopefully I can be free flowing.” 9.30am - Aussie legend ‘nearly vomited’ at Smith move The decision to pick Steve Smith to open the batting surprised many, given specialist opener Cameron Bancroft was overlooked despite strong Sheffield Shield form. Fox Cricket’s Brendon Julian said elevating Smith to opener and slotting Cam Green in at No.4 undoubtedly makes the Australian team better overall . But not everyone is happy with the selection call. Several West Australian greats including former Australian captain Kim Hughes have slammed Bancroft’s omission. “I nearly vomited,” Hughes told WA Sport. “I’ve got no doubts in my mind that if Cameron Bancroft played for New South Wales he’d be in the Test side. He’s in his prime. Steve Smith will open the batting against the West Indies. (Photo by Mark Brake/Getty Images) Cam Green is back in the Aussie side. (Photo by Sarah Reed/Getty Images) “Smith is struggling at the moment. He’s been an absolute superstar, but as an opener, he is no more opener than me opening the bowling. “He needs to stay at No.4, get his mojo back if you like, without all the fluff.” Pat Cummins said there was no conspiracy as to why Cameron Bancroft wasn’t chosen to replace Warner in this series. “Yeah, I’ve got absolutely no issues with Bangers, love what he brings,” Cummins said in Adelaide. “(I told him) ‘just don’t change. We’ve loved playing with you in the past and keep doing your thing.

This will be India's final T20 game ahead of the World Cup in June, and the team management wouldn't want any drop in intensity that was displayed during victories at Mohali and Indore. India's identical six-wicket wins were marked by an ultra-aggressive mindset from ball one that saw them chasing down 159 in 17.3 overs and 173 in 15.4 overs respectively. It was a clear deviation from their earlier approach of building the momentum for a final flourish in T20s. None showed this intent more brightly than Shivam Dube and Virat Kohli. Kohli was playing a T20 for India after 14 months at Indore, but he creamed a 16-ball 29 at a strike rate of 181. The most noteworthy feature of his little yet significant innings was the way he handled Afghan spinner Mujeeb-ur-Rahman, whom he carted for 18 runs off seven balls, striking against him at a rate of 257. Kohli has always been a bit of a slow-mover against spin but there was no trepidation this time and he showed commendable alacrity to contribute his two cents to a transformed approach. Dube reappeared in the Indian blue after a gap of three years when he was selected for the T20 series against Ireland at Malahide, Dublin, last year. But after playing in the subsequent Asian Games, Dube could not find a spot in the series against Australia and South Africa. However, the scattered appearances did not prevent Dube from following the path set by the think tank. His two brutal fifties were too heavy to handle for Afghanistan, who did not have the services of injured star spinner Rashid Khan. Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, who had missed the first match at Mohali with a groin niggle, too showed the willingness to imbibe the pattern with a quick half-century in the last game. India will eye an encore from the trio here. Among these slews of positives, a minor irritant has been the failure of Rohit to fire. He was run out in the first match after a mix up with Shubman Gill, while misjudging pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi's length doomed him at Indore. His tally of two runs across as many matches will not worry the management by any stretch of imagination. But they will certainly like to see him signing off from the series with a substantial innings. While India might not affect any major changes in the batting unit, the think-tank can look to give some game-time to Kuldeep Yadav and Avesh Khan. The left-arm wrist spinner can come in for either Ravi Bishnoi or Washington Sundar, and Avesh can replace his fellow pacer Mukesh Kumar. Wicketkeeper batter Jitesh Sharma has been playing T20Is from the fourth match against Australia last year at Raipur, and if the thought leaders want to give him a rest, they have the option of bringing in Sanju Samson. As for Afghanistan, they have shown isolated sparks in this series without being able to transform them into match-winning fireworks. They would hope for a good effort from opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz after two mediocre outings, as his salvos up the order go a long way in Afghans setting or chasing a target. The smooth pitch at the Chinnaswamy Stadium and its shorter boundaries offer him a fine chance to be among runs. A victory against India will also boost Afghanistan's confidence ahead of a packed away calendar consisting of fixtures against Sri Lanka and Ireland.

He has been plagued by injuries since bursting on to the international scene by helping England win the 50-over World Cup in 2019 before starring in that summer’s Ashes. Archer did train with England during their white-ball tour of the Caribbean in December and Key is optimistic he can play a part in their T20 World Cup title defence. “Our plan is the T20 World Cup, building him up slowly,” Key told the BBC’s Tailenders podcast. “I saw him bowl in the Caribbean and it was like he’d never been away. “I don’t want to get back to this thing where he plays and then goes down again. “He wanted to play in the IPL, but we said not this time. Hopefully the years he has missed he can add to the end of his career. He is such a talent.” England begin the T20 World Cup, which will be held in the West Indies and the United States, against Scotland in Barbados on June 4.","pubDate":"2024-01-16 23:02:11","image_url":"https://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk/resources/images/17653495/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"basingstokegazette","source_url":"https://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk","source_priority":967252,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"}]}
