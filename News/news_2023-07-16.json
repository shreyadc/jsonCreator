The former England captain and one of their greatest batsmen has enjoyed the all-action style that has transformed the Test side under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum and ignited this series. But Gooch feels there has to be more cricketing intelligence shown if England are going to win the next two Tests to take the Ashes 3-2. ‘The way England have been playing has been a fantastic shot in the arm for Test cricket because it’s been exciting, entertaining and unpredictable,’ said Gooch. ‘None of us know what they will do next when we’re watching it and that makes for a great spectacle. I’m all in favour of it, but I do have caveats. England's newly adopted Bazball approach inspired by Ben Stokes (left) and Brendon McCullum (right) has attracted renewed interest in Test cricket Former England captain and one of their greatest batsmen Graham Gooch loves Bazball but warned they must also play smart to win the Ashes ‘You have to play smart cricket where necessary and we just have not done that on occasions. If we want to level up the series at Old Trafford, we have to make some smart decisions to go with the bold ones. ‘Look at that declaration on the first day at Edgbaston. If there were two tailenders in, then fair enough that’s a good decision, but with [Joe] Root at the crease? Weigh up another 30 or 40 runs against the possibility of getting a wicket that first night and those runs in the bank could have been valuable later in the match.’ Gooch, who scored 8,900 runs in his 118 Tests, says Root is the biggest example of a player who is wrong to change his game in the name of entertainment. ‘Root has to play normally,’ said Gooch, who turns 70 next Sunday and is still heavily involved at Essex. ‘He’s our glue and our world-class player and the one who’s been the volume run-maker for us over the last decade. ‘He scores quickly in Test cricket so surely he doesn’t need to do anything else. He’s a brilliant player in all forms, he’s got all the shots and he rotates the strike. ‘When I say smart, in Joe’s case that means play normally because everyone else can bat around him.’ That means attack and entertain but, says Gooch, do it sensibly. ‘There are degrees of being attacking,’ said the man who has also been an England batting coach, selector and manager. ‘You have to be clever in how you go about it. If you’ve hit two boundaries in an over, do you need to take chances to try to hit two more? McCullum has been praised for reinventing England's approach to Test cricket since taking over as head coach England currently trail 2-1 in the Ashes series but won the last Test at Headingley ‘If they bowl you a long hop or a half-volley fair enough, but play the percentages. Great players play the situation. A bowler will always buy a wicket and will happily pay 20 or 30 runs for one.’ But Gooch acknowledges the 2-1 scoreline to Australia could have been very different had England taken their chances. ‘We’ve dropped a lot of catches,’ he said. ‘That costs you against good players. ‘I’m a big fan of Jonny Bairstow but he looks rusty with the gloves. He’s never let England down when keeping before now but it’s a while since he kept before this summer.’ But Gooch insists Stokes can become the first England captain to lead his side from two down to win an Ashes series. ‘Yes, England can create history but they must add some smart play when necessary.’ Share or comment on this article: Graham Gooch loves Bazball but tells Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum to be intelligent e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Thanks to thunderbolts, Ferrero Rocher and the fear of flying, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes is the unlikely bromance that brought England back into Ashes Chris Woakes and Mark Wood helped claw England back into the Ashes series The pair shared the crease as England batted their way to victory at Headingley And share an unlikely bromance that extends beyond the dressing room By Lawrence Booth for The Mail on Sunday Updated: 00:48, 16 July 2023 e-mail View comments After Chris Woakes and Mark Wood shared the match-clinching partnership in the third Ashes Test at Headingley, it came as little surprise to learn they share much else besides. The two men had driven together to the ground each day, always parking in the same spot. And when they go on tour, they bring each other’s favourite treats: chocolate digestives for Woakes, Ferrero Rocher for Wood. It even emerged that Woakes holds Wood’s hand during internal flights on small aircraft, to ease his fear of flying. Woakes, though, presumably drew the line at Wood’s behaviour in the Headingley dressing room, where according to fellow seamer Ollie Robinson he went down on all fours and barked like a dog. You do not have to be mad to win the Ashes , but it certainly helps... Both men had missed England’s defeats at Edgbaston and Lord’s. By the time they had shared 13 wickets in the third Test, and put on an unbroken 24 to secure victory, they had become the greatest Ashes bromance since the days when the mutual affection between Australian openers Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer would cause eyerolls among team-mates. Mark Wood (left) and Chris Woakes are the unlikely bromance that brought England back into the Ashes The England duo clinched victory for England in the third Ashes Test at Headingley to keep themselves in the hunt for the urn Perhaps it was no great shock that newcomers on both sides fared best in Leeds, where the game started only four days after Australia’s emotionally-charged win at Lord’s. Woakes and Wood were raring to go for England, just as Mitchell Marsh — whose powerful run-a-ball 118 saved Australia from collapse in the first innings — was for the tourists. But while Marsh may yet give way to Australia’s first-choice all-rounder Cameron Green in Manchester, the interventions of the Two Ws — with apologies to Frank Worrell, Clyde Walcott and Everton Weekes — have changed the perception of this remarkable Ashes series. In Wood’s case, the impact has been electrifying. Asked by Ben Stokes, his old mate from Durham days, whether he was ready to bowl ‘thunderbolts’, Wood said he was — and obliged with the quickest spell by an England bowler in a home Test, at one point reaching the heights of 96.5mph. Five wickets in the first innings were followed by two in the second, but his batting proved crucial, too. For all the whispers that Bazball England go easy on the practice sessions, Wood had spent time both before the game and during the lunch breaks at Headingley facing bouncers slung down by assistant coach Paul Collingwood. After the interval on the second day, with England in strife at 142 for seven, he thrashed Mitchell Starc’s first three deliveries for six, four and six, before top-edging Pat Cummins for six more. On the last day, it was Wood’s hook for six off Cummins that eased English nerves after the departure of Harry Brook with 21 still required. In all, he made 40 runs in the Test off just 16 balls — his strike-rate of 250 was the highest in the game’s history. If the pitch at Old Trafford proves as lively, Wood could be in business again when the fourth Test starts on Wednesday. And no matter that, in his ninth summer as a Test player, he is yet to play a Test there. Woakes cannot get enough of the place. Much has been made of his outstanding record at Lord’s, which is why his omission from the second Test raised one or two eyebrows. Yet Old Trafford has brought him 23 Test wickets at 18, and 188 runs at 47, including an unbeaten 84 to seal a tough chase against Pakistan three years ago. If Wood had not played a Test since the previous December in Pakistan, Woakes’s absence stretched back to the miserable tour of the Caribbean in March 2022 — the trip that spelled the end for Joe Root’s captaincy. Wood (right) and Woakes (left) share a strong friendship that extends beyond cricket Wood (pictured) was asked to bowl 'thunderbolts' by Ben Stokes and obliged with the quickest spell by an England bowler in a home Test, at one point reaching the heights of 96.5mph He had not quite given up hope in the meantime, turning down the IPL this year because he wanted to focus on his red-ball fitness. But the thought did cross his mind that, at the age of 34, he had played his last game for England. And like Wood, he chipped in with both ball and bat: six Australian wickets in the match, all top-seven players, then a nerveless 32no on the final afternoon, when he and Brook added a vital 59. Woakes’s presence at No8 gave them lower-order ballast which — for all Stuart Broad’s heroics with the bat at Lord’s — had been missing. For both men, Headingley brought a sense of release, of a chance they might not have envisaged, perhaps even the equivalent of a free hit. Manchester will bring more expectation, not least because England fans will hope Wood can have the Australians hopping around once more as Stokes’s team seek to square the series ahead of the final Test at The Oval. With Woakes and Wood likely to retain their places at Old Trafford, and Broad undroppable at the top of the series’ wicket-taking charts, England may limit themselves to one change: Jimmy Anderson, who was rested at Headingley, for Robinson, who suffered a back spasm there — even though he insists he is fit again. Woakes’s presence at No8 gave England the lower-order ballast which had previously been missing Wood is likely to retain his place ahead of the fourth Test at Old Trafford after his electrifying display The other option is Josh Tongue, who took five wickets on his Ashes debut at Lord’s and worried Australia’s top order with his pace. Tongue, though, is regarded by the management as Wood’s deputy, and it is hard to see how Anderson misses out at his home ground if he feels ready to play. Australia, for their part, must work out if they can fit Marsh and Green in the same side — a scenario that would probably involve dropping veteran opener David Warner. Despite his struggles against Broad, that seems unlikely as they look for the win, or the draw, that would see them retain the urn. Seamer Scott Boland, meanwhile, could make way for Josh Hazlewood after taking just two wickets in two games at an average of 115, and going at nearly five an over. Whatever sides both choose, it is hard to imagine anything other than another classic.

But a couple of accomplished bowling displays – in which they defended sub-150 totals against both Surrey in the semi-final then Essex in the Edgbaston showpiece – saw them belatedly end their hoodoo. Gregory was beaming after Matt Henry’s four for 24 underpinned a 14-run win over Essex, who were all out for 131 in 18.3 overs when Daniel Sams was dismissed for a belligerent 45 off 26 balls. “(It feels) pretty damn good,” said a relieved Gregory at the presentation ceremony. “I’ve been to finals day many, many times and this is a special feeling to get over the line. “Everyone sees Somerset as the nearly men, and it becomes harder each time you come back. I was just praying we had a couple of guys who were having on of those days where you just can’t stop them. “We did it the hard way throughout the day, it’s just rewards.” A score of 142 for seven – in a match reduced to 19 overs per side because of rain – was enough for Somerset to move into Saturday night’s final, where they were all out for 145 in exactly 20 overs. The moment that made Champions 🏆 Incredible. — Vitality Blast (@VitalityBlast) Adam Rossington and Dan Lawrence flew out of the traps for Essex, putting on 27 in 11 deliveries, but they were halted in their tracks by an accomplished spell of fast bowling from Henry, who took out both batters then produced the ball of the day with a bail-trimmer to see the back of Michael Pepper. Ish Sodhi, signed on a short-term deal last month due to injuries to Peter Siddle and Roelof van der Merwe, made crucial inroads into Essex’s batting, with the New Zealand leg-spinner taking three for 22. However, Sams played a lone hand to keep Essex in the game, prompting Gregory to turn to his ace Henry, who saw the first ball of his final over dispatched for a towering, straight six. It was his third maximum of the game and left Essex needing 15 off the last 11 deliveries with just one wicket left, but a dot was followed by Henry offering width and Sams carving to short third, where Tom Kohler-Cadmore plucked the ball out of the air with a terrific one-handed grab. “It’s going to be played a lot over the next wee while,” said Sodhi. “He took an absolute hanger and it’s definitely one of the most exciting moments in my cricketing career so far, I’m glad he hung on to it because Sams is a dangerous player. “T20 is a fickle game, with 15 runs left it’s effectively two and a half hits and you win the game, and Sams is well capable of that. It makes that catch that Tom took all that more special.” Victory for Somerset marks the fifth successive occasion that the team who prevailed in the second semi-final also won the final. While Sams was at the crease, Essex were always in with a chance but captain Simon Harmer felt the Australian’s dismissal to a breathtaking catch was one of many things that did not go their way. Harmer conceded Somerset, who lost just twice in the entire campaign, were worthy winners but rued what he perceived to be luck being against them, having reached the final by defeating defending champions Hampshire. “Hats off to Somerset, they were the better team – they outplayed us,” Harmer said. “We didn’t get the rub of the green, in my opinion, and on days like this, you need a bit of luck. “I can’t fault the way the boys played it. At the very end Daniel Sams just needed someone to bat with him and unfortunately we kept losing wickets. Such is the nature of the game.”","pubDate":"2023-07-15 23:40:38","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17004727/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SL vs PAK Dream11 Prediction, 1st Test 2023: Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Predicted XIs, form guide, squads","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/sl-vs-pak-dream11-prediction-1st-test-predicted-playing-11-sri-lanka-vs-pakistan-squads-form-guide-live-streaming-info/article67085393.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"SL vs PAK: Here are the fantasy picks, predicted XIs and squads for the first Test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Galle.","content":"Sri Lanka and Pakistan will commence their World Test Championship (WTC) 2023-25 cycle with a two-match bilateral series, which begins from Sunday at the Galle International Stadium.

It’s one of those things where a stumping that’s given out on the field is turned into a massive story. ‘Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I respect that. Everyone’s entitled to their opinion on the spirit of cricket as well. ‘Not just myself, the whole group’s had some stuff spoken about them. But we’re really tight. We understand what’s important and who matters and those guys definitely have our back. ‘We’re all in it together, we were all out there, all walked through the Long Room together, post-match we all discussed it together. I don’t think the group would do anything differently.’ Alex Carey has no regrets over Jonny Bairstow's controversial stumping at Lord's The England batsman (middle) was stumped in the fourth innings after Carey spotted him walking down the crease and rolled the ball onto the stumps The Australian players were verbally abused in the Long Room at Lord’s, which led to the suspension of three MCC members on a day when Australia took a 2-0 lead in the Ashes series, before England’s win at Headingley last week. Speaking to the press for the first time since the incident, Carey said Australia had noticed Bairstow’s habit of leaving the crease immediately after each delivery. ‘We were switched on to the fact that it was a bouncer plan and it felt like Jonny was pretty switched on to getting out of the way. He wasn’t playing any shots. Carey (second left) revealed himself and his Australia team-mates received 'nasty' abuse after the incident Australia captain Pat Cummins (pictured) insisted Carey had nothing to apologise for following the incident at Lord's 'When he ducked, his first movement was pretty much out of his crease, so I instinctively grabbed the ball, threw the stumps down and the rest is history,’ said Carey, 31. He said he had tried the method before, after getting dismissed himself in a similar manner during a Sheffield Shield match. ‘My first A-grade game in South Australia, I was out that way. And when I walked off, I was pretty disappointed. The captain came up to me and said, “you’ll remember to keep your foot behind the line next time”. ‘From my point of view, I wasn’t called on it back when I’d have tried it about the spirit of cricket and when I was given out in the same sort of manner, I didn’t question it either.’ Share or comment on this article: Alex Carey received 'nasty' abuse after controversial Jonny Bairstow stumping at Lord's e-mail Add comment Comments 2 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

The wicketkeeper says the players are ‘riding on a wave of confidence and belief’, while having huge fun in the process of trying to make history. Warwickshire star Jones, 30, says there is a queue of players desperate to play the hero role and get the team over the line, just as tailender Kate Cross did in helping captain Heather Knight set up a crucial ODI win in Bristol four days ago. It levelled the multi-format series but England will need more special moments to ensure victory in Southampton on Sunday and then in the final ODI at Taunton on Tuesday if they are to regain the Ashes and complete a comeback from 6-0 down. Jones said: ‘I don’t think there is any extra pressure on us now just because we are level with two games remaining. If anything it is now about just doing what we’ve been doing and staying in the moment. Amy firmly says England have a burning ‘fire in the belly’ to defy the odds and beat Australia England will need more special moments if they are to regain the Ashes from Australia Jones says Australia are the best team in the world but England are capable of beating them ‘There was more pressure when we were 6-0 down because we’ve had disaster Ashes before and we didn’t want to repeat that. Knowing just getting that first win brings another level of belief. ‘When you are winning you are a lot happier in the dressing room. You don’t create belief, it is there. We all have that fire in the belly and we all want to be there at the end and do that Kate Cross at the end of innings in the game in Bristol, which helped us get over the line. ‘We’ve shown the depth is really there in English cricket and having so many people ready to step up as a team puts us in a very good place. ‘It is important to keep the positive mindset going. We turned the series around in the T20s and now it’s about riding that wave of confidence. ‘We’ve been on the wrong side of games against Australia over the last few years so it does feel nice to get some wins on the bounce against them.’ ‘But Australia are the best team in the world. We felt we were good enough to beat them but you don’t know until you actually do it.

Daniel Sams threatened to pull off a dramatic finish with 45 off 26 balls but Henry, who was held back until the penultimate over, had the last laugh as Essex were all out for 131 to lose by 14 runs. Somerset won their first crown in 2005 but they have been unrewarded on their previous seven visits to Finals Day, finishing runners-up in three successive years in 2009, 2010 and 2011 then again in 2021. They reached the final by defending 142 against Surrey and needed another excellent collective effort from their bowlers after being bowled out for 145, built on Sean Dickson’s understated 53 off 35 balls. Essex – who earlier edged out defending champions Hampshire on a day where both semi-finals were affected by passing showers, with the showpiece going off without a hitch – lost regular wickets as leg-spinner Ish Sodhi claimed three for 22 and Somerset captain Lewis Gregory took two for 25. Essex’s Shane Snater was unfortunate to be on the losing side after exploiting the unpredictable bounce, perhaps caused by the moisture that built up through the day, to finish with 4-1-13-3. Your 2023 Winners 🏆 — Somerset Cricket 🏆 (@SomersetCCC) Snater removed both openers before he had conceded anything off the bat, with Will Smeed inside-edging a leg-cutter on to his stumps for a run-a-ball nine in a wicket maiden while Tom Banton, dropped on nought, injudiciously reverse lapped a shot which looped gently to backward point for 20 off 16 deliveries. Tom Kohler-Cadmore’s late cut brought the lone boundary Somerset took off Snater but he was out for a run-a-ball 19 after an attempted dab caught the under-edge on to the stumps. Paul Walter was in the wickets when Tom Abell spliced to mid-on on the charge, attempting to up the ante after crawling to eight off 14 deliveries, while a flash point occurred when Gregory prodded his first ball back to Matt Critchley, who seemed to scoop up the catch diving forward. Gregory was unconvinced and television replays only muddied the waters, with differing perspectives depending on the camera angle, persuading third umpire Nigel Llong to spare the Somerset captain. To compound matters, Gregory edged Critchley for Somerset’s first four in 32 balls at the end of the 12th over. While Gregory did not especially excel after getting the benefit of the doubt, he proved a capable foil in a 46-run stand in 28 balls with Dickson, who upped the tempo after a watchful start. Gregory was eventually out for 11 after miscuing Snater’s slower ball back to the bowler, starting a slide that saw Somerset lose their last six wickets for just 32 runs in 27 deliveries. Dickson ploughed a lone furrow with a crucial 33-ball fifty – with most of his runs coming square of the wicket – but then gloved through to Rossington, who timed his jump to perfection, as Somerset only just batted out their allotment. Rossington signalled his intent in the run chase by hammering the second ball back past Craig Overton for four as Essex’s openers took 27 off the first two overs. Rossington took three successive fours off Henry, who had his revenge as the opener departed for 19 off nine deliveries after bludgeoning to cover point. The moment that made Champions 🏆 Incredible. — Vitality Blast (@VitalityBlast) Henry had two wickets in two deliveries after finding a hint of lateral movement to clip the off-bail of a stunned Pepper while later in the over, Lawrence, who was also in a hurry after slamming Overton over long-on, was beaten for pace and rapped on the front pad for 16 off eight balls. Overton got in on the act as Robin Das got no elevation on a straight drive while Henry was unfortunate not to make further inroads in his third over after beating the outside edge of Walter and Critchley. Walter batted sensibly for 26 off 24 balls to keep Essex up with the rate but was castled after missing a heave off Sodhi. While Essex continued to lose wickets, Sams made sure they did not collapse without trace by clattering Kasey Aldridge and Sodhi over the boundary rope to leave 21 required off the final 12 balls. It was all on his shoulders as he greeted Henry back into the attack with a third towering six but when the New Zealand seamer went wider, Sams got a thick edge and Kohler-Cadmore produced a terrific diving catch as Essex were all out in 18.3 overs.","pubDate":"2023-07-15 21:48:16","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17004674/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"STUART BROAD: The truth is I have always found it hard bowling to David Warner","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12302881/STUART-BROAD-truth-hard-bowling-David-Warner.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"STUART BROAD: He used to sit back against me and hit me through the off side, and before the 2015 Ashes our bowling coach Ottis Gibson pointed out that my average was much higher against left-handers.","content":"STUART BROAD: The truth is I have always found it hard bowling to David Warner... despite my 17 dismissals of him Stuart Board continued his dominance over David Warner on the third Ashes test The England bowler opens up on how to face the Australian ahead of fourth Test By Stuart Broad for the Mail on Sunday Updated: 22:33, 15 July 2023 e-mail View comments Stuart Broad claimed a familiar victim in David Warner on the third Test as England maintained their hopes of winning the Ashes . Broad has dismissed the Australian 17 times in his career having added to his superb record in the third Test. And below, the Mail Sport columnist and England bowler opens up on how to face Warner and why he has found it hard bowling to him. Stuart Board continued his dominance over David Warner on the third Ashes test The England bowler say he has always found it difficult bowling to Davey, and still does A video was doing the rounds on social media last week showing all 17 of my Test dismissals of David Warner, including the two at Headingley. It explained the journey, because the early ones are all from over the wicket, and the later ones from round the wicket. He used to sit back against me and hit me through the off side, and before the 2015 Ashes our bowling coach Ottis Gibson pointed out that my average was much higher against left-handers. The Aussie team that season was full of lefties, and Ottis said I’d be out of the team if I didn’t find a way to bowl to them. I spent four months practising round the wicket. I wanted to bring the stumps into play, while still threatening the outside edge. By the time I got to Trent Bridge eight years ago I bowled round the wicket all the time — and picked up eight for 15. The truth is I’ve always found it difficult bowling to Davey, and I still do. By going round the wicket I’ve tried to minimise the width he loves outside off stump, but also bowl a fuller length and make him play at 80 to 85 per cent of deliveries.

The former England captain and one of their greatest batsmen has enjoyed the all-action style that has transformed the Test side under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum and ignited this series. But Gooch feels there has to be more cricketing intelligence shown if England are going to win the next two Tests to take the Ashes 3-2. ‘The way England have been playing has been a fantastic shot in the arm for Test cricket because it’s been exciting, entertaining and unpredictable,’ said Gooch. ‘None of us know what they will do next when we’re watching it and that makes for a great spectacle. I’m all in favour of it, but I do have caveats. England's newly adopted Bazball approach inspired by Ben Stokes (left) and Brendon McCullum (right) has attracted renewed interest in Test cricket Former England captain and one of their greatest batsmen Graham Gooch loves Bazball but warned they must also play smart to win the Ashes ‘You have to play smart cricket where necessary and we just have not done that on occasions. If we want to level up the series at Old Trafford, we have to make some smart decisions to go with the bold ones. ‘Look at that declaration on the first day at Edgbaston. If there were two tailenders in, then fair enough that’s a good decision, but with [Joe] Root at the crease? Weigh up another 30 or 40 runs against the possibility of getting a wicket that first night and those runs in the bank could have been valuable later in the match.’ Gooch, who scored 8,900 runs in his 118 Tests, says Root is the biggest example of a player who is wrong to change his game in the name of entertainment. ‘Root has to play normally,’ said Gooch, who turns 70 next Sunday and is still heavily involved at Essex. ‘He’s our glue and our world-class player and the one who’s been the volume run-maker for us over the last decade. ‘He scores quickly in Test cricket so surely he doesn’t need to do anything else. He’s a brilliant player in all forms, he’s got all the shots and he rotates the strike. ‘When I say smart, in Joe’s case that means play normally because everyone else can bat around him.’ That means attack and entertain but, says Gooch, do it sensibly. ‘There are degrees of being attacking,’ said the man who has also been an England batting coach, selector and manager. ‘You have to be clever in how you go about it. If you’ve hit two boundaries in an over, do you need to take chances to try to hit two more? McCullum has been praised for reinventing England's approach to Test cricket since taking over as head coach England currently trail 2-1 in the Ashes series but won the last Test at Headingley ‘If they bowl you a long hop or a half-volley fair enough, but play the percentages. Great players play the situation. A bowler will always buy a wicket and will happily pay 20 or 30 runs for one.’ But Gooch acknowledges the 2-1 scoreline to Australia could have been very different had England taken their chances. ‘We’ve dropped a lot of catches,’ he said. ‘That costs you against good players. ‘I’m a big fan of Jonny Bairstow but he looks rusty with the gloves. He’s never let England down when keeping before now but it’s a while since he kept before this summer.’ But Gooch insists Stokes can become the first England captain to lead his side from two down to win an Ashes series. ‘Yes, England can create history but they must add some smart play when necessary.’ Share or comment on this article: Graham Gooch loves Bazball but tells Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum to be intelligent e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Thanks to thunderbolts, Ferrero Rocher and the fear of flying, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes is the unlikely bromance that brought England back into Ashes Chris Woakes and Mark Wood helped claw England back into the Ashes series The pair shared the crease as England batted their way to victory at Headingley And share an unlikely bromance that extends beyond the dressing room By Lawrence Booth for The Mail on Sunday Updated: 00:48, 16 July 2023 e-mail View comments After Chris Woakes and Mark Wood shared the match-clinching partnership in the third Ashes Test at Headingley, it came as little surprise to learn they share much else besides. The two men had driven together to the ground each day, always parking in the same spot. And when they go on tour, they bring each other’s favourite treats: chocolate digestives for Woakes, Ferrero Rocher for Wood. It even emerged that Woakes holds Wood’s hand during internal flights on small aircraft, to ease his fear of flying. Woakes, though, presumably drew the line at Wood’s behaviour in the Headingley dressing room, where according to fellow seamer Ollie Robinson he went down on all fours and barked like a dog. You do not have to be mad to win the Ashes , but it certainly helps... Both men had missed England’s defeats at Edgbaston and Lord’s. By the time they had shared 13 wickets in the third Test, and put on an unbroken 24 to secure victory, they had become the greatest Ashes bromance since the days when the mutual affection between Australian openers Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer would cause eyerolls among team-mates. Mark Wood (left) and Chris Woakes are the unlikely bromance that brought England back into the Ashes The England duo clinched victory for England in the third Ashes Test at Headingley to keep themselves in the hunt for the urn Perhaps it was no great shock that newcomers on both sides fared best in Leeds, where the game started only four days after Australia’s emotionally-charged win at Lord’s. Woakes and Wood were raring to go for England, just as Mitchell Marsh — whose powerful run-a-ball 118 saved Australia from collapse in the first innings — was for the tourists. But while Marsh may yet give way to Australia’s first-choice all-rounder Cameron Green in Manchester, the interventions of the Two Ws — with apologies to Frank Worrell, Clyde Walcott and Everton Weekes — have changed the perception of this remarkable Ashes series. In Wood’s case, the impact has been electrifying. Asked by Ben Stokes, his old mate from Durham days, whether he was ready to bowl ‘thunderbolts’, Wood said he was — and obliged with the quickest spell by an England bowler in a home Test, at one point reaching the heights of 96.5mph. Five wickets in the first innings were followed by two in the second, but his batting proved crucial, too. For all the whispers that Bazball England go easy on the practice sessions, Wood had spent time both before the game and during the lunch breaks at Headingley facing bouncers slung down by assistant coach Paul Collingwood. After the interval on the second day, with England in strife at 142 for seven, he thrashed Mitchell Starc’s first three deliveries for six, four and six, before top-edging Pat Cummins for six more. On the last day, it was Wood’s hook for six off Cummins that eased English nerves after the departure of Harry Brook with 21 still required. In all, he made 40 runs in the Test off just 16 balls — his strike-rate of 250 was the highest in the game’s history. If the pitch at Old Trafford proves as lively, Wood could be in business again when the fourth Test starts on Wednesday. And no matter that, in his ninth summer as a Test player, he is yet to play a Test there. Woakes cannot get enough of the place. Much has been made of his outstanding record at Lord’s, which is why his omission from the second Test raised one or two eyebrows. Yet Old Trafford has brought him 23 Test wickets at 18, and 188 runs at 47, including an unbeaten 84 to seal a tough chase against Pakistan three years ago. If Wood had not played a Test since the previous December in Pakistan, Woakes’s absence stretched back to the miserable tour of the Caribbean in March 2022 — the trip that spelled the end for Joe Root’s captaincy. Wood (right) and Woakes (left) share a strong friendship that extends beyond cricket Wood (pictured) was asked to bowl 'thunderbolts' by Ben Stokes and obliged with the quickest spell by an England bowler in a home Test, at one point reaching the heights of 96.5mph He had not quite given up hope in the meantime, turning down the IPL this year because he wanted to focus on his red-ball fitness. But the thought did cross his mind that, at the age of 34, he had played his last game for England. And like Wood, he chipped in with both ball and bat: six Australian wickets in the match, all top-seven players, then a nerveless 32no on the final afternoon, when he and Brook added a vital 59. Woakes’s presence at No8 gave them lower-order ballast which — for all Stuart Broad’s heroics with the bat at Lord’s — had been missing. For both men, Headingley brought a sense of release, of a chance they might not have envisaged, perhaps even the equivalent of a free hit. Manchester will bring more expectation, not least because England fans will hope Wood can have the Australians hopping around once more as Stokes’s team seek to square the series ahead of the final Test at The Oval. With Woakes and Wood likely to retain their places at Old Trafford, and Broad undroppable at the top of the series’ wicket-taking charts, England may limit themselves to one change: Jimmy Anderson, who was rested at Headingley, for Robinson, who suffered a back spasm there — even though he insists he is fit again. Woakes’s presence at No8 gave England the lower-order ballast which had previously been missing Wood is likely to retain his place ahead of the fourth Test at Old Trafford after his electrifying display The other option is Josh Tongue, who took five wickets on his Ashes debut at Lord’s and worried Australia’s top order with his pace. Tongue, though, is regarded by the management as Wood’s deputy, and it is hard to see how Anderson misses out at his home ground if he feels ready to play. Australia, for their part, must work out if they can fit Marsh and Green in the same side — a scenario that would probably involve dropping veteran opener David Warner. Despite his struggles against Broad, that seems unlikely as they look for the win, or the draw, that would see them retain the urn. Seamer Scott Boland, meanwhile, could make way for Josh Hazlewood after taking just two wickets in two games at an average of 115, and going at nearly five an over. Whatever sides both choose, it is hard to imagine anything other than another classic.

But a couple of accomplished bowling displays – in which they defended sub-150 totals against both Surrey in the semi-final then Essex in the Edgbaston showpiece – saw them belatedly end their hoodoo. Gregory was beaming after Matt Henry’s four for 24 underpinned a 14-run win over Essex, who were all out for 131 in 18.3 overs when Daniel Sams was dismissed for a belligerent 45 off 26 balls. “(It feels) pretty damn good,” said a relieved Gregory at the presentation ceremony. “I’ve been to finals day many, many times and this is a special feeling to get over the line. “Everyone sees Somerset as the nearly men, and it becomes harder each time you come back. I was just praying we had a couple of guys who were having on of those days where you just can’t stop them. “We did it the hard way throughout the day, it’s just rewards.” A score of 142 for seven – in a match reduced to 19 overs per side because of rain – was enough for Somerset to move into Saturday night’s final, where they were all out for 145 in exactly 20 overs. The moment that made Champions 🏆 Incredible. — Vitality Blast (@VitalityBlast) Adam Rossington and Dan Lawrence flew out of the traps for Essex, putting on 27 in 11 deliveries, but they were halted in their tracks by an accomplished spell of fast bowling from Henry, who took out both batters then produced the ball of the day with a bail-trimmer to see the back of Michael Pepper. Ish Sodhi, signed on a short-term deal last month due to injuries to Peter Siddle and Roelof van der Merwe, made crucial inroads into Essex’s batting, with the New Zealand leg-spinner taking three for 22. However, Sams played a lone hand to keep Essex in the game, prompting Gregory to turn to his ace Henry, who saw the first ball of his final over dispatched for a towering, straight six. It was his third maximum of the game and left Essex needing 15 off the last 11 deliveries with just one wicket left, but a dot was followed by Henry offering width and Sams carving to short third, where Tom Kohler-Cadmore plucked the ball out of the air with a terrific one-handed grab. “It’s going to be played a lot over the next wee while,” said Sodhi. “He took an absolute hanger and it’s definitely one of the most exciting moments in my cricketing career so far, I’m glad he hung on to it because Sams is a dangerous player. “T20 is a fickle game, with 15 runs left it’s effectively two and a half hits and you win the game, and Sams is well capable of that. It makes that catch that Tom took all that more special.” Victory for Somerset marks the fifth successive occasion that the team who prevailed in the second semi-final also won the final. While Sams was at the crease, Essex were always in with a chance but captain Simon Harmer felt the Australian’s dismissal to a breathtaking catch was one of many things that did not go their way. Harmer conceded Somerset, who lost just twice in the entire campaign, were worthy winners but rued what he perceived to be luck being against them, having reached the final by defeating defending champions Hampshire. “Hats off to Somerset, they were the better team – they outplayed us,” Harmer said. “We didn’t get the rub of the green, in my opinion, and on days like this, you need a bit of luck. “I can’t fault the way the boys played it. At the very end Daniel Sams just needed someone to bat with him and unfortunately we kept losing wickets. Such is the nature of the game.”","pubDate":"2023-07-15 23:40:38","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17004727/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SL vs PAK Dream11 Prediction, 1st Test 2023: Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Predicted XIs, form guide, squads","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/sl-vs-pak-dream11-prediction-1st-test-predicted-playing-11-sri-lanka-vs-pakistan-squads-form-guide-live-streaming-info/article67085393.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"SL vs PAK: Here are the fantasy picks, predicted XIs and squads for the first Test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Galle.","content":"Sri Lanka and Pakistan will commence their World Test Championship (WTC) 2023-25 cycle with a two-match bilateral series, which begins from Sunday at the Galle International Stadium.

On the other hand, Sri Lanka will be confident of exploiting home conditions, especially with spinner Prabath Jayasuriya in its ranks. The left-arm spinner has picked 50 Test wickets in just seven matches at an average of 23.70. Sri Lanka has had a mixed record of late in Test cricket with five wins and four defeats in its last 10 games. It is coming off a comprehensive 2-0 win over minnow Ireland at home after losing 0-2 to New Zealand away. Sri Lanka’s last two Test series at home - against Pakistan and Australia - have ended level at 1-1. Interestingly, all four matches were played at Galle. Pakistan’s last Test win was a year ago - against Sri Lanka at Galle. It has been swept 0-3 by England and drawn a two-match series 0-0 against New Zealand at home since that win. With just one win in its last 10 Test appearances, Pakistan will hope for a change in fortune in the new cycle of the World Test Championship.

While Pakistan has the head-to-head edge over Sri Lanka in Test matches, the Babar Azam-led side has struggled in the longest format of late. Pakistan has been winless in its last six Tests and, interestingly, its last win in the format came at Galle in the first Test of a two-match series in July 2022. However, it went on to lose the next game as the host levelled the series 1-1. Even in home conditions, Sri Lanka hasn’t been able to dominate Pakistan in Test cricket. It has won eight games at home while losing nine and its last Test series win in Sri Lanka against Pakistan was back in August 2014. This time around too, the Dimuth Karunaratne-led side is likely to have an uphill battle against Babar’s men.

It’s one of those things where a stumping that’s given out on the field is turned into a massive story. ‘Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I respect that. Everyone’s entitled to their opinion on the spirit of cricket as well. ‘Not just myself, the whole group’s had some stuff spoken about them. But we’re really tight. We understand what’s important and who matters and those guys definitely have our back. ‘We’re all in it together, we were all out there, all walked through the Long Room together, post-match we all discussed it together. I don’t think the group would do anything differently.’ Alex Carey has no regrets over Jonny Bairstow's controversial stumping at Lord's The England batsman (middle) was stumped in the fourth innings after Carey spotted him walking down the crease and rolled the ball onto the stumps The Australian players were verbally abused in the Long Room at Lord’s, which led to the suspension of three MCC members on a day when Australia took a 2-0 lead in the Ashes series, before England’s win at Headingley last week. Speaking to the press for the first time since the incident, Carey said Australia had noticed Bairstow’s habit of leaving the crease immediately after each delivery. ‘We were switched on to the fact that it was a bouncer plan and it felt like Jonny was pretty switched on to getting out of the way. He wasn’t playing any shots. Carey (second left) revealed himself and his Australia team-mates received 'nasty' abuse after the incident Australia captain Pat Cummins (pictured) insisted Carey had nothing to apologise for following the incident at Lord's 'When he ducked, his first movement was pretty much out of his crease, so I instinctively grabbed the ball, threw the stumps down and the rest is history,’ said Carey, 31. He said he had tried the method before, after getting dismissed himself in a similar manner during a Sheffield Shield match. ‘My first A-grade game in South Australia, I was out that way. And when I walked off, I was pretty disappointed. The captain came up to me and said, “you’ll remember to keep your foot behind the line next time”. ‘From my point of view, I wasn’t called on it back when I’d have tried it about the spirit of cricket and when I was given out in the same sort of manner, I didn’t question it either.’ Share or comment on this article: Alex Carey received 'nasty' abuse after controversial Jonny Bairstow stumping at Lord's e-mail Add comment Comments 2 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

The wicketkeeper says the players are ‘riding on a wave of confidence and belief’, while having huge fun in the process of trying to make history. Warwickshire star Jones, 30, says there is a queue of players desperate to play the hero role and get the team over the line, just as tailender Kate Cross did in helping captain Heather Knight set up a crucial ODI win in Bristol four days ago. It levelled the multi-format series but England will need more special moments to ensure victory in Southampton on Sunday and then in the final ODI at Taunton on Tuesday if they are to regain the Ashes and complete a comeback from 6-0 down. Jones said: ‘I don’t think there is any extra pressure on us now just because we are level with two games remaining. If anything it is now about just doing what we’ve been doing and staying in the moment. Amy firmly says England have a burning ‘fire in the belly’ to defy the odds and beat Australia England will need more special moments if they are to regain the Ashes from Australia Jones says Australia are the best team in the world but England are capable of beating them ‘There was more pressure when we were 6-0 down because we’ve had disaster Ashes before and we didn’t want to repeat that. Knowing just getting that first win brings another level of belief. ‘When you are winning you are a lot happier in the dressing room. You don’t create belief, it is there. We all have that fire in the belly and we all want to be there at the end and do that Kate Cross at the end of innings in the game in Bristol, which helped us get over the line. ‘We’ve shown the depth is really there in English cricket and having so many people ready to step up as a team puts us in a very good place. ‘It is important to keep the positive mindset going. We turned the series around in the T20s and now it’s about riding that wave of confidence. ‘We’ve been on the wrong side of games against Australia over the last few years so it does feel nice to get some wins on the bounce against them.’ ‘But Australia are the best team in the world. We felt we were good enough to beat them but you don’t know until you actually do it. We now need to do it two more times.’ Share or comment on this article: Amy Jones insists England have a burning 'fire in the belly' to regain the Ashes from Australia e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Daniel Sams threatened to pull off a dramatic finish with 45 off 26 balls but Henry, who was held back until the penultimate over, had the last laugh as Essex were all out for 131 to lose by 14 runs. Somerset won their first crown in 2005 but they have been unrewarded on their previous seven visits to Finals Day, finishing runners-up in three successive years in 2009, 2010 and 2011 then again in 2021. They reached the final by defending 142 against Surrey and needed another excellent collective effort from their bowlers after being bowled out for 145, built on Sean Dickson’s understated 53 off 35 balls. Essex – who earlier edged out defending champions Hampshire on a day where both semi-finals were affected by passing showers, with the showpiece going off without a hitch – lost regular wickets as leg-spinner Ish Sodhi claimed three for 22 and Somerset captain Lewis Gregory took two for 25. Essex’s Shane Snater was unfortunate to be on the losing side after exploiting the unpredictable bounce, perhaps caused by the moisture that built up through the day, to finish with 4-1-13-3. Your 2023 Winners 🏆 — Somerset Cricket 🏆 (@SomersetCCC) Snater removed both openers before he had conceded anything off the bat, with Will Smeed inside-edging a leg-cutter on to his stumps for a run-a-ball nine in a wicket maiden while Tom Banton, dropped on nought, injudiciously reverse lapped a shot which looped gently to backward point for 20 off 16 deliveries. Tom Kohler-Cadmore’s late cut brought the lone boundary Somerset took off Snater but he was out for a run-a-ball 19 after an attempted dab caught the under-edge on to the stumps. Paul Walter was in the wickets when Tom Abell spliced to mid-on on the charge, attempting to up the ante after crawling to eight off 14 deliveries, while a flash point occurred when Gregory prodded his first ball back to Matt Critchley, who seemed to scoop up the catch diving forward. Gregory was unconvinced and television replays only muddied the waters, with differing perspectives depending on the camera angle, persuading third umpire Nigel Llong to spare the Somerset captain. To compound matters, Gregory edged Critchley for Somerset’s first four in 32 balls at the end of the 12th over. While Gregory did not especially excel after getting the benefit of the doubt, he proved a capable foil in a 46-run stand in 28 balls with Dickson, who upped the tempo after a watchful start. Gregory was eventually out for 11 after miscuing Snater’s slower ball back to the bowler, starting a slide that saw Somerset lose their last six wickets for just 32 runs in 27 deliveries. Dickson ploughed a lone furrow with a crucial 33-ball fifty – with most of his runs coming square of the wicket – but then gloved through to Rossington, who timed his jump to perfection, as Somerset only just batted out their allotment. Rossington signalled his intent in the run chase by hammering the second ball back past Craig Overton for four as Essex’s openers took 27 off the first two overs. Rossington took three successive fours off Henry, who had his revenge as the opener departed for 19 off nine deliveries after bludgeoning to cover point. The moment that made Champions 🏆 Incredible. — Vitality Blast (@VitalityBlast) Henry had two wickets in two deliveries after finding a hint of lateral movement to clip the off-bail of a stunned Pepper while later in the over, Lawrence, who was also in a hurry after slamming Overton over long-on, was beaten for pace and rapped on the front pad for 16 off eight balls. Overton got in on the act as Robin Das got no elevation on a straight drive while Henry was unfortunate not to make further inroads in his third over after beating the outside edge of Walter and Critchley. Walter batted sensibly for 26 off 24 balls to keep Essex up with the rate but was castled after missing a heave off Sodhi. While Essex continued to lose wickets, Sams made sure they did not collapse without trace by clattering Kasey Aldridge and Sodhi over the boundary rope to leave 21 required off the final 12 balls. It was all on his shoulders as he greeted Henry back into the attack with a third towering six but when the New Zealand seamer went wider, Sams got a thick edge and Kohler-Cadmore produced a terrific diving catch as Essex were all out in 18.3 overs.","pubDate":"2023-07-15 21:48:16","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17004674/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"STUART BROAD: The truth is I have always found it hard bowling to David Warner","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12302881/STUART-BROAD-truth-hard-bowling-David-Warner.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"STUART BROAD: He used to sit back against me and hit me through the off side, and before the 2015 Ashes our bowling coach Ottis Gibson pointed out that my average was much higher against left-handers.","content":"STUART BROAD: The truth is I have always found it hard bowling to David Warner... despite my 17 dismissals of him Stuart Board continued his dominance over David Warner on the third Ashes test The England bowler opens up on how to face the Australian ahead of fourth Test By Stuart Broad for the Mail on Sunday Updated: 22:33, 15 July 2023 e-mail View comments Stuart Broad claimed a familiar victim in David Warner on the third Test as England maintained their hopes of winning the Ashes . Broad has dismissed the Australian 17 times in his career having added to his superb record in the third Test. And below, the Mail Sport columnist and England bowler opens up on how to face Warner and why he has found it hard bowling to him. Stuart Board continued his dominance over David Warner on the third Ashes test The England bowler say he has always found it difficult bowling to Davey, and still does A video was doing the rounds on social media last week showing all 17 of my Test dismissals of David Warner, including the two at Headingley. It explained the journey, because the early ones are all from over the wicket, and the later ones from round the wicket. He used to sit back against me and hit me through the off side, and before the 2015 Ashes our bowling coach Ottis Gibson pointed out that my average was much higher against left-handers. The Aussie team that season was full of lefties, and Ottis said I’d be out of the team if I didn’t find a way to bowl to them. I spent four months practising round the wicket. I wanted to bring the stumps into play, while still threatening the outside edge. By the time I got to Trent Bridge eight years ago I bowled round the wicket all the time — and picked up eight for 15. The truth is I’ve always found it difficult bowling to Davey, and I still do. By going round the wicket I’ve tried to minimise the width he loves outside off stump, but also bowl a fuller length and make him play at 80 to 85 per cent of deliveries.

The former England captain and one of their greatest batsmen has enjoyed the all-action style that has transformed the Test side under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum and ignited this series. But Gooch feels there has to be more cricketing intelligence shown if England are going to win the next two Tests to take the Ashes 3-2. ‘The way England have been playing has been a fantastic shot in the arm for Test cricket because it’s been exciting, entertaining and unpredictable,’ said Gooch. ‘None of us know what they will do next when we’re watching it and that makes for a great spectacle. I’m all in favour of it, but I do have caveats. England's newly adopted Bazball approach inspired by Ben Stokes (left) and Brendon McCullum (right) has attracted renewed interest in Test cricket Former England captain and one of their greatest batsmen Graham Gooch loves Bazball but warned they must also play smart to win the Ashes ‘You have to play smart cricket where necessary and we just have not done that on occasions. If we want to level up the series at Old Trafford, we have to make some smart decisions to go with the bold ones. ‘Look at that declaration on the first day at Edgbaston. If there were two tailenders in, then fair enough that’s a good decision, but with [Joe] Root at the crease? Weigh up another 30 or 40 runs against the possibility of getting a wicket that first night and those runs in the bank could have been valuable later in the match.’ Gooch, who scored 8,900 runs in his 118 Tests, says Root is the biggest example of a player who is wrong to change his game in the name of entertainment. ‘Root has to play normally,’ said Gooch, who turns 70 next Sunday and is still heavily involved at Essex. ‘He’s our glue and our world-class player and the one who’s been the volume run-maker for us over the last decade. ‘He scores quickly in Test cricket so surely he doesn’t need to do anything else. He’s a brilliant player in all forms, he’s got all the shots and he rotates the strike. ‘When I say smart, in Joe’s case that means play normally because everyone else can bat around him.’ That means attack and entertain but, says Gooch, do it sensibly. ‘There are degrees of being attacking,’ said the man who has also been an England batting coach, selector and manager. ‘You have to be clever in how you go about it. If you’ve hit two boundaries in an over, do you need to take chances to try to hit two more? McCullum has been praised for reinventing England's approach to Test cricket since taking over as head coach England currently trail 2-1 in the Ashes series but won the last Test at Headingley ‘If they bowl you a long hop or a half-volley fair enough, but play the percentages. Great players play the situation. A bowler will always buy a wicket and will happily pay 20 or 30 runs for one.’ But Gooch acknowledges the 2-1 scoreline to Australia could have been very different had England taken their chances. ‘We’ve dropped a lot of catches,’ he said. ‘That costs you against good players. ‘I’m a big fan of Jonny Bairstow but he looks rusty with the gloves. He’s never let England down when keeping before now but it’s a while since he kept before this summer.’ But Gooch insists Stokes can become the first England captain to lead his side from two down to win an Ashes series. ‘Yes, England can create history but they must add some smart play when necessary.’ Share or comment on this article: Graham Gooch loves Bazball but tells Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum to be intelligent e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Thanks to thunderbolts, Ferrero Rocher and the fear of flying, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes is the unlikely bromance that brought England back into Ashes Chris Woakes and Mark Wood helped claw England back into the Ashes series The pair shared the crease as England batted their way to victory at Headingley And share an unlikely bromance that extends beyond the dressing room By Lawrence Booth for The Mail on Sunday Updated: 00:48, 16 July 2023 e-mail View comments After Chris Woakes and Mark Wood shared the match-clinching partnership in the third Ashes Test at Headingley, it came as little surprise to learn they share much else besides. The two men had driven together to the ground each day, always parking in the same spot. And when they go on tour, they bring each other’s favourite treats: chocolate digestives for Woakes, Ferrero Rocher for Wood. It even emerged that Woakes holds Wood’s hand during internal flights on small aircraft, to ease his fear of flying. Woakes, though, presumably drew the line at Wood’s behaviour in the Headingley dressing room, where according to fellow seamer Ollie Robinson he went down on all fours and barked like a dog. You do not have to be mad to win the Ashes , but it certainly helps... Both men had missed England’s defeats at Edgbaston and Lord’s. By the time they had shared 13 wickets in the third Test, and put on an unbroken 24 to secure victory, they had become the greatest Ashes bromance since the days when the mutual affection between Australian openers Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer would cause eyerolls among team-mates. Mark Wood (left) and Chris Woakes are the unlikely bromance that brought England back into the Ashes The England duo clinched victory for England in the third Ashes Test at Headingley to keep themselves in the hunt for the urn Perhaps it was no great shock that newcomers on both sides fared best in Leeds, where the game started only four days after Australia’s emotionally-charged win at Lord’s. Woakes and Wood were raring to go for England, just as Mitchell Marsh — whose powerful run-a-ball 118 saved Australia from collapse in the first innings — was for the tourists. But while Marsh may yet give way to Australia’s first-choice all-rounder Cameron Green in Manchester, the interventions of the Two Ws — with apologies to Frank Worrell, Clyde Walcott and Everton Weekes — have changed the perception of this remarkable Ashes series. In Wood’s case, the impact has been electrifying. Asked by Ben Stokes, his old mate from Durham days, whether he was ready to bowl ‘thunderbolts’, Wood said he was — and obliged with the quickest spell by an England bowler in a home Test, at one point reaching the heights of 96.5mph. Five wickets in the first innings were followed by two in the second, but his batting proved crucial, too. For all the whispers that Bazball England go easy on the practice sessions, Wood had spent time both before the game and during the lunch breaks at Headingley facing bouncers slung down by assistant coach Paul Collingwood. After the interval on the second day, with England in strife at 142 for seven, he thrashed Mitchell Starc’s first three deliveries for six, four and six, before top-edging Pat Cummins for six more. On the last day, it was Wood’s hook for six off Cummins that eased English nerves after the departure of Harry Brook with 21 still required. In all, he made 40 runs in the Test off just 16 balls — his strike-rate of 250 was the highest in the game’s history. If the pitch at Old Trafford proves as lively, Wood could be in business again when the fourth Test starts on Wednesday. And no matter that, in his ninth summer as a Test player, he is yet to play a Test there. Woakes cannot get enough of the place. Much has been made of his outstanding record at Lord’s, which is why his omission from the second Test raised one or two eyebrows. Yet Old Trafford has brought him 23 Test wickets at 18, and 188 runs at 47, including an unbeaten 84 to seal a tough chase against Pakistan three years ago. If Wood had not played a Test since the previous December in Pakistan, Woakes’s absence stretched back to the miserable tour of the Caribbean in March 2022 — the trip that spelled the end for Joe Root’s captaincy. Wood (right) and Woakes (left) share a strong friendship that extends beyond cricket Wood (pictured) was asked to bowl 'thunderbolts' by Ben Stokes and obliged with the quickest spell by an England bowler in a home Test, at one point reaching the heights of 96.5mph He had not quite given up hope in the meantime, turning down the IPL this year because he wanted to focus on his red-ball fitness. But the thought did cross his mind that, at the age of 34, he had played his last game for England. And like Wood, he chipped in with both ball and bat: six Australian wickets in the match, all top-seven players, then a nerveless 32no on the final afternoon, when he and Brook added a vital 59. Woakes’s presence at No8 gave them lower-order ballast which — for all Stuart Broad’s heroics with the bat at Lord’s — had been missing. For both men, Headingley brought a sense of release, of a chance they might not have envisaged, perhaps even the equivalent of a free hit. Manchester will bring more expectation, not least because England fans will hope Wood can have the Australians hopping around once more as Stokes’s team seek to square the series ahead of the final Test at The Oval. With Woakes and Wood likely to retain their places at Old Trafford, and Broad undroppable at the top of the series’ wicket-taking charts, England may limit themselves to one change: Jimmy Anderson, who was rested at Headingley, for Robinson, who suffered a back spasm there — even though he insists he is fit again. Woakes’s presence at No8 gave England the lower-order ballast which had previously been missing Wood is likely to retain his place ahead of the fourth Test at Old Trafford after his electrifying display The other option is Josh Tongue, who took five wickets on his Ashes debut at Lord’s and worried Australia’s top order with his pace. Tongue, though, is regarded by the management as Wood’s deputy, and it is hard to see how Anderson misses out at his home ground if he feels ready to play. Australia, for their part, must work out if they can fit Marsh and Green in the same side — a scenario that would probably involve dropping veteran opener David Warner. Despite his struggles against Broad, that seems unlikely as they look for the win, or the draw, that would see them retain the urn. Seamer Scott Boland, meanwhile, could make way for Josh Hazlewood after taking just two wickets in two games at an average of 115, and going at nearly five an over. Whatever sides both choose, it is hard to imagine anything other than another classic.

But a couple of accomplished bowling displays – in which they defended sub-150 totals against both Surrey in the semi-final then Essex in the Edgbaston showpiece – saw them belatedly end their hoodoo. Gregory was beaming after Matt Henry’s four for 24 underpinned a 14-run win over Essex, who were all out for 131 in 18.3 overs when Daniel Sams was dismissed for a belligerent 45 off 26 balls. “(It feels) pretty damn good,” said a relieved Gregory at the presentation ceremony. “I’ve been to finals day many, many times and this is a special feeling to get over the line. “Everyone sees Somerset as the nearly men, and it becomes harder each time you come back. I was just praying we had a couple of guys who were having on of those days where you just can’t stop them. “We did it the hard way throughout the day, it’s just rewards.” A score of 142 for seven – in a match reduced to 19 overs per side because of rain – was enough for Somerset to move into Saturday night’s final, where they were all out for 145 in exactly 20 overs. The moment that made Champions 🏆 Incredible. — Vitality Blast (@VitalityBlast) Adam Rossington and Dan Lawrence flew out of the traps for Essex, putting on 27 in 11 deliveries, but they were halted in their tracks by an accomplished spell of fast bowling from Henry, who took out both batters then produced the ball of the day with a bail-trimmer to see the back of Michael Pepper. Ish Sodhi, signed on a short-term deal last month due to injuries to Peter Siddle and Roelof van der Merwe, made crucial inroads into Essex’s batting, with the New Zealand leg-spinner taking three for 22. However, Sams played a lone hand to keep Essex in the game, prompting Gregory to turn to his ace Henry, who saw the first ball of his final over dispatched for a towering, straight six. It was his third maximum of the game and left Essex needing 15 off the last 11 deliveries with just one wicket left, but a dot was followed by Henry offering width and Sams carving to short third, where Tom Kohler-Cadmore plucked the ball out of the air with a terrific one-handed grab. “It’s going to be played a lot over the next wee while,” said Sodhi. “He took an absolute hanger and it’s definitely one of the most exciting moments in my cricketing career so far, I’m glad he hung on to it because Sams is a dangerous player. “T20 is a fickle game, with 15 runs left it’s effectively two and a half hits and you win the game, and Sams is well capable of that. It makes that catch that Tom took all that more special.” Victory for Somerset marks the fifth successive occasion that the team who prevailed in the second semi-final also won the final. While Sams was at the crease, Essex were always in with a chance but captain Simon Harmer felt the Australian’s dismissal to a breathtaking catch was one of many things that did not go their way. Harmer conceded Somerset, who lost just twice in the entire campaign, were worthy winners but rued what he perceived to be luck being against them, having reached the final by defeating defending champions Hampshire. “Hats off to Somerset, they were the better team – they outplayed us,” Harmer said. “We didn’t get the rub of the green, in my opinion, and on days like this, you need a bit of luck. “I can’t fault the way the boys played it. At the very end Daniel Sams just needed someone to bat with him and unfortunately we kept losing wickets. Such is the nature of the game.”","pubDate":"2023-07-15 23:40:38","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17004727/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SL vs PAK Dream11 Prediction, 1st Test 2023: Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Predicted XIs, form guide, squads","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/sl-vs-pak-dream11-prediction-1st-test-predicted-playing-11-sri-lanka-vs-pakistan-squads-form-guide-live-streaming-info/article67085393.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"SL vs PAK: Here are the fantasy picks, predicted XIs and squads for the first Test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Galle.","content":"Sri Lanka and Pakistan will commence their World Test Championship (WTC) 2023-25 cycle with a two-match bilateral series, which begins from Sunday at the Galle International Stadium.

It’s one of those things where a stumping that’s given out on the field is turned into a massive story. ‘Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I respect that. Everyone’s entitled to their opinion on the spirit of cricket as well. ‘Not just myself, the whole group’s had some stuff spoken about them. But we’re really tight. We understand what’s important and who matters and those guys definitely have our back. ‘We’re all in it together, we were all out there, all walked through the Long Room together, post-match we all discussed it together. I don’t think the group would do anything differently.’ Alex Carey has no regrets over Jonny Bairstow's controversial stumping at Lord's The England batsman (middle) was stumped in the fourth innings after Carey spotted him walking down the crease and rolled the ball onto the stumps The Australian players were verbally abused in the Long Room at Lord’s, which led to the suspension of three MCC members on a day when Australia took a 2-0 lead in the Ashes series, before England’s win at Headingley last week. Speaking to the press for the first time since the incident, Carey said Australia had noticed Bairstow’s habit of leaving the crease immediately after each delivery. ‘We were switched on to the fact that it was a bouncer plan and it felt like Jonny was pretty switched on to getting out of the way. He wasn’t playing any shots. Carey (second left) revealed himself and his Australia team-mates received 'nasty' abuse after the incident Australia captain Pat Cummins (pictured) insisted Carey had nothing to apologise for following the incident at Lord's 'When he ducked, his first movement was pretty much out of his crease, so I instinctively grabbed the ball, threw the stumps down and the rest is history,’ said Carey, 31. He said he had tried the method before, after getting dismissed himself in a similar manner during a Sheffield Shield match. ‘My first A-grade game in South Australia, I was out that way. And when I walked off, I was pretty disappointed. The captain came up to me and said, “you’ll remember to keep your foot behind the line next time”. ‘From my point of view, I wasn’t called on it back when I’d have tried it about the spirit of cricket and when I was given out in the same sort of manner, I didn’t question it either.’ Share or comment on this article: Alex Carey received 'nasty' abuse after controversial Jonny Bairstow stumping at Lord's e-mail Add comment Comments 2 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

The wicketkeeper says the players are ‘riding on a wave of confidence and belief’, while having huge fun in the process of trying to make history. Warwickshire star Jones, 30, says there is a queue of players desperate to play the hero role and get the team over the line, just as tailender Kate Cross did in helping captain Heather Knight set up a crucial ODI win in Bristol four days ago. It levelled the multi-format series but England will need more special moments to ensure victory in Southampton on Sunday and then in the final ODI at Taunton on Tuesday if they are to regain the Ashes and complete a comeback from 6-0 down. Jones said: ‘I don’t think there is any extra pressure on us now just because we are level with two games remaining. If anything it is now about just doing what we’ve been doing and staying in the moment. Amy firmly says England have a burning ‘fire in the belly’ to defy the odds and beat Australia England will need more special moments if they are to regain the Ashes from Australia Jones says Australia are the best team in the world but England are capable of beating them ‘There was more pressure when we were 6-0 down because we’ve had disaster Ashes before and we didn’t want to repeat that. Knowing just getting that first win brings another level of belief. ‘When you are winning you are a lot happier in the dressing room. You don’t create belief, it is there. We all have that fire in the belly and we all want to be there at the end and do that Kate Cross at the end of innings in the game in Bristol, which helped us get over the line. ‘We’ve shown the depth is really there in English cricket and having so many people ready to step up as a team puts us in a very good place. ‘It is important to keep the positive mindset going. We turned the series around in the T20s and now it’s about riding that wave of confidence. ‘We’ve been on the wrong side of games against Australia over the last few years so it does feel nice to get some wins on the bounce against them.’ ‘But Australia are the best team in the world. We felt we were good enough to beat them but you don’t know until you actually do it. We now need to do it two more times.’ Share or comment on this article: Amy Jones insists England have a burning 'fire in the belly' to regain the Ashes from Australia e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Daniel Sams threatened to pull off a dramatic finish with 45 off 26 balls but Henry, who was held back until the penultimate over, had the last laugh as Essex were all out for 131 to lose by 14 runs. Somerset won their first crown in 2005 but they have been unrewarded on their previous seven visits to Finals Day, finishing runners-up in three successive years in 2009, 2010 and 2011 then again in 2021. They reached the final by defending 142 against Surrey and needed another excellent collective effort from their bowlers after being bowled out for 145, built on Sean Dickson’s understated 53 off 35 balls. Essex – who earlier edged out defending champions Hampshire on a day where both semi-finals were affected by passing showers, with the showpiece going off without a hitch – lost regular wickets as leg-spinner Ish Sodhi claimed three for 22 and Somerset captain Lewis Gregory took two for 25. Essex’s Shane Snater was unfortunate to be on the losing side after exploiting the unpredictable bounce, perhaps caused by the moisture that built up through the day, to finish with 4-1-13-3. Your 2023 Winners 🏆 — Somerset Cricket 🏆 (@SomersetCCC) Snater removed both openers before he had conceded anything off the bat, with Will Smeed inside-edging a leg-cutter on to his stumps for a run-a-ball nine in a wicket maiden while Tom Banton, dropped on nought, injudiciously reverse lapped a shot which looped gently to backward point for 20 off 16 deliveries. Tom Kohler-Cadmore’s late cut brought the lone boundary Somerset took off Snater but he was out for a run-a-ball 19 after an attempted dab caught the under-edge on to the stumps. Paul Walter was in the wickets when Tom Abell spliced to mid-on on the charge, attempting to up the ante after crawling to eight off 14 deliveries, while a flash point occurred when Gregory prodded his first ball back to Matt Critchley, who seemed to scoop up the catch diving forward. Gregory was unconvinced and television replays only muddied the waters, with differing perspectives depending on the camera angle, persuading third umpire Nigel Llong to spare the Somerset captain. To compound matters, Gregory edged Critchley for Somerset’s first four in 32 balls at the end of the 12th over. While Gregory did not especially excel after getting the benefit of the doubt, he proved a capable foil in a 46-run stand in 28 balls with Dickson, who upped the tempo after a watchful start. Gregory was eventually out for 11 after miscuing Snater’s slower ball back to the bowler, starting a slide that saw Somerset lose their last six wickets for just 32 runs in 27 deliveries. Dickson ploughed a lone furrow with a crucial 33-ball fifty – with most of his runs coming square of the wicket – but then gloved through to Rossington, who timed his jump to perfection, as Somerset only just batted out their allotment. Rossington signalled his intent in the run chase by hammering the second ball back past Craig Overton for four as Essex’s openers took 27 off the first two overs. Rossington took three successive fours off Henry, who had his revenge as the opener departed for 19 off nine deliveries after bludgeoning to cover point. The moment that made Champions 🏆 Incredible. — Vitality Blast (@VitalityBlast) Henry had two wickets in two deliveries after finding a hint of lateral movement to clip the off-bail of a stunned Pepper while later in the over, Lawrence, who was also in a hurry after slamming Overton over long-on, was beaten for pace and rapped on the front pad for 16 off eight balls. Overton got in on the act as Robin Das got no elevation on a straight drive while Henry was unfortunate not to make further inroads in his third over after beating the outside edge of Walter and Critchley. Walter batted sensibly for 26 off 24 balls to keep Essex up with the rate but was castled after missing a heave off Sodhi. While Essex continued to lose wickets, Sams made sure they did not collapse without trace by clattering Kasey Aldridge and Sodhi over the boundary rope to leave 21 required off the final 12 balls. It was all on his shoulders as he greeted Henry back into the attack with a third towering six but when the New Zealand seamer went wider, Sams got a thick edge and Kohler-Cadmore produced a terrific diving catch as Essex were all out in 18.3 overs.","pubDate":"2023-07-15 21:48:16","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17004674/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"STUART BROAD: The truth is I have always found it hard bowling to David Warner","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12302881/STUART-BROAD-truth-hard-bowling-David-Warner.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"STUART BROAD: He used to sit back against me and hit me through the off side, and before the 2015 Ashes our bowling coach Ottis Gibson pointed out that my average was much higher against left-handers.","content":"STUART BROAD: The truth is I have always found it hard bowling to David Warner... despite my 17 dismissals of him Stuart Board continued his dominance over David Warner on the third Ashes test The England bowler opens up on how to face the Australian ahead of fourth Test By Stuart Broad for the Mail on Sunday Updated: 22:33, 15 July 2023 e-mail View comments Stuart Broad claimed a familiar victim in David Warner on the third Test as England maintained their hopes of winning the Ashes . Broad has dismissed the Australian 17 times in his career having added to his superb record in the third Test. And below, the Mail Sport columnist and England bowler opens up on how to face Warner and why he has found it hard bowling to him. Stuart Board continued his dominance over David Warner on the third Ashes test The England bowler say he has always found it difficult bowling to Davey, and still does A video was doing the rounds on social media last week showing all 17 of my Test dismissals of David Warner, including the two at Headingley. It explained the journey, because the early ones are all from over the wicket, and the later ones from round the wicket. He used to sit back against me and hit me through the off side, and before the 2015 Ashes our bowling coach Ottis Gibson pointed out that my average was much higher against left-handers. The Aussie team that season was full of lefties, and Ottis said I’d be out of the team if I didn’t find a way to bowl to them. I spent four months practising round the wicket. I wanted to bring the stumps into play, while still threatening the outside edge. By the time I got to Trent Bridge eight years ago I bowled round the wicket all the time — and picked up eight for 15. The truth is I’ve always found it difficult bowling to Davey, and I still do. By going round the wicket I’ve tried to minimise the width he loves outside off stump, but also bowl a fuller length and make him play at 80 to 85 per cent of deliveries.
