Opener Crawley was out for nine and has reached double figures just three times in his last 11 Test innings. The 24-year-old batsman looks short of confidence with a technique that is being ruthlessly unpicked by some of the world’s best bowlers. With Alex Lees, Ollie Pope and Joe Root not contributing much and England enduring a miserable first session with the ball — including Stuart Broad conceding an all-time Test record of 35 runs in a single over — Ben Stokes’ team are in deep trouble. By the close of a heavily rain-affected day two of the Fifth Test, England had reached 84-5 in response to India’s 416 all out. Even the new-look, super-positive England will struggle to blast their way out of this hole against a probing attack. FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS Crawley was out in his usual manner — caught in the slips attempting an ambitious drive. We can copy and paste that dismissal virtually every time he bats. Captain Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum said before the match that Crawley will continue to play “regardless” of how many runs he scores. They reckon his attacking approach fits with the team ethos and that he is a streak batter who will play the occasional innings of brilliance between failures. But Crawley has become a bit like Hampshire’s James Vince, who averaged 24.90 in 13 Tests between 2016 and 2018. At least Vince looked a million dollars before nicking off — right now, Crawley looks terrible before nicking off. The first three of England five wickets fell to Jasprit Bumrah who, not content with scoring 29 of the 35 runs in Broad’s historic over, bowled superbly. Lees was beaten for pace from around the wicket and both Crawley and Pope were caught in the slips aiming big drives. Then, after another rain interruption, Root was caught behind to a ball that lifted a touch as he tried to guide to third man and nightwatchman Jack Leach edged the superb Mohammed Shami. After Rishabh Pant’s pyrotechnics on day one — he scored 146 from 111 balls — Ravindra Jadeja reached a more sedate but no less important century in the morning session. His First Test hundred outside India helped his team reach 416 all out after being 98-5 when he took guard. The left-hander was calm and selective with his strokeplay and waved his bat in his trademark sword celebration when reaching three figures. We’re up against it but we’ve been in this position before this summer. We’ll continue to be positive — the best line of defence is attack. Broad’s 550th Test wicket came when Shami upper cut to third man and Jadeja was bowled attempting to whack a ball from Jimmy Anderson. Broad was then plundered for those extraordinary 35 runs in an over. There have been around 700,000 overs bowled in Test history and this was the most expensive. Considering the previous most in a Test over was 28, the world record was advanced by the huge margin of 25 per cent. The tenth-wicket stand realised 41 before Broad caught Mohammed Siraj above his head at mid-off, giving Anderson a 32nd five-wicket haul in Test cricket. A defiant Anderson, 39, said: “We’re up against it but we’ve been in this position before this summer. “There are plenty of guys in the dressing-room willing to fight. “We’ll continue to be positive — our message is that the best line of defence is to attack.”","pubDate":"2022-07-02 20:19:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bazball England Cricket: Bazball meaning in cricket England team","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-bazball-england-cricket-bazball-meaning-in-cricket-england-team/","keywords":["Cricket","Bazball","Brendon McCullum","India tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bazball England Cricket: The ‘Bazball’ approach of the England Test side was mocked by fans on social media after stumps on Day 2.

At stumps on ‘Day 2’ of the ongoing rescheduled ‘fifth’ Test match between India and England at Edgbaston in Birmingham, the Ben Stokes-led side were tottering at 84/5 while catching up India’s massive first innings total of 416. On a day which was mostly marred by rain, team India skipper Jasprit Bumrah provided the ideal Test match thrill with both bat and the ball, as he not only smashed Stuart Broad for the most-expensive Over ever in Test match history, but also breathed fire with the red cherry in hand, by getting rid of the top-3 England batters early on. With England still trailing by 332 runs, skipper Ben Stokes (0*) and Jonny Bairstow (12*) – a crucial face of their famous ‘Baz Ball’ approach, were at the crease with half their side down. With wickets tumbling down at regular intervals, Bairstow had to curb his attacking instincts and put a brief halt to the ‘Baz Ball’, with him currently batting at a strike rate of 25.5. Anyone got the bazball button — Felix White (@felixwhite) July 2, 2022 Not seeing much evidence of something called Bazball that has been a theme in sections of the media just recently. #ENGvIND #JustSaying — Anand Vasu (@anandvasu) July 2, 2022 “You think Bazball is your ally? You merely adopted Bazball. I was born in it, molded by it” #ENGvIND pic.twitter.com/yqj8rKDTI0 — Annanya (@annanyajohari) July 1, 2022 “It’s a case of putting pressure back on other people. If you sit there, sit there, sit there, there’s a good ball in there for you. Rather than being a sitting duck and saying ‘look, alright, you can bowl at me’ it’s ‘OK, you can’t bowl at me, so let’s go’.” While the above remarks from Jonny Bairstow after he led England to a record-breaking win at the Trent Bridge during the second Test against New Zealand, is not the official definition of the trending term, this is more or less the ‘Baz Ball’ approach with which England played against the Kiwis last week during which the latter were whitewashed 3-0 in the three-match Test series. Derived from former New Zealand skipper and present England Test team head coach Bredon McCullum’s nickname ‘Baz’, the ‘Baz Ball’ refers to the aggressive brand of Cricket which McCullum played during his playing days. Bairstow, who is the leading face of this very famous term, went on to credit his skipper Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum (in particular) for a change in attitude and approach within the team right from their very first series together. England managed to chase down the targets in each of the three matches by their aggressive batting approach during the fourth innings. Bairstow, in fact notched-up the second-fastest century and half-century by an English player ever while chasing during the second and third Test of the series respectively.","pubDate":"2022-07-02 20:02:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Inside cricket’s doomsday TV rights scenario","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-australia-and-channel-7-forced-into-shotgun-marriage-despite-all-signs-pointing-to-divorce/news-story/7d9a7ab6a41ea14b682994eb68d59b8f","keywords":["Big Bash News","Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket Australia has been forced into a tortured double life, where a shattered relationship with Channel 7 is one they can’t afford to live without.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-02 20:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Brilliant Bumrah Puts India On Top | Highlights | England v India - Day 2 | LV= Insurance Test 2022 - England & Wales Cricket Board","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9WnVQTlp4VURLSUnSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Brilliant Bumrah Puts India On Top | Highlights | England v India - Day 2 | LV= Insurance Test 2022  England & Wales Cricket BoardIndia tour of England, 2022: Rishabh Pant runs his own show at Edgbaston | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIndia 416 all out against England in Edgbaston test  Reuters.comWatch: Rahul Dravid's Animated Celebration After Rishabh Pant's Century Goes Viral  NDTV SportsIndia vs England 5th Test, Day 2 weather update: Rain threat looms large in Birmingham  Zee NewsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-02 19:52:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies vs Bangladesh, 1st T20I, Bangladesh tour of West Indies, 2022 - Cricbuzz","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbS5jcmljYnV6ei5jb20vY3JpY2tldC1jb21tZW50YXJ5LzQ3ODU3L2Jhbi12cy13aS0xc3QtdDIwaS1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLXRvdXItb2Ytd2VzdC1pbmRpZXMtMjAyMtIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"West Indies vs Bangladesh, 1st T20I, Bangladesh tour of West Indies, 2022  CricbuzzWest Indies vs Bangladesh, LIVE Cricket Score and updates, 1st T20I - Firstpost  FirstpostWI vs BAN Prediction- Who Will Win Today's Match Between West Indies And Bangladesh, Bangladesh Tour Of West Indies 2022,1s t T20I  Cricket AddictorWest Indies vs Bangladesh, Check Captain, Vice-Captain, and Probable Playing XIs for Today's WI vs BAN T20I  News18West Indies vs Bangladesh 1st T20 Live Streaming: When and where to watch?  The Indian ExpressView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-02 19:47:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Northamptonshire vs India live streaming: India warm up match live on which channel today","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-northamptonshire-vs-india-live-streaming-india-warm-up-match-live-on-which-channel-today/","keywords":["Cricket","India","India tour of England 2022","Northamptonshire"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Northamptonshire vs India live streaming: The SportsRush presents before you the timing and live streaming details of tonight’s practice match.

He returns back to bowl that again and picks a wicket. The pacer had been continously bowling around the off stumps channel on a fuller length. Pope had some width on offer on that one, he goes for the drive, edges the ball and is caught in the slips.Day 1 report: Rishabh Pant was combative and Ravindra Jadeja composed in leading India's recovery from 98-5 to 338-7 against England on the first day of the series-deciding test at Edgbaston on Friday.Pant made 146 off 111 balls in a fabulous 222-run sixth-wicket stand with Ravindra Jadeja, who was not out on 83 at stumps.Pant’s brutal counterattack featured 19 fours and four sixes and ended when he was deceived by Joe Root’s offspin and gave Zak Crawley his third catch in the slips.Captain Ben Stokes promised the same aggressive approach which helped England sweep New Zealand 3-0 in their test series this week, but the hosts were on the receiving end of a belligerent Pant and Jadeja, who played the anchor role. Their brilliant stand of 222 came off 239 balls.England took full advantage of winning the toss and opting to bowl in overcast conditions.Fast bowlers James Anderson and Matthew Potts, with support from luckless Stuart Broad, troubled the India top order and reduced the visitors to 98-5 midway through the second session.Pant resisted and reached his half-century at the stroke of tea off 51 balls. He raised his third test hundred against England off a mere 89 balls. Pant had sprayed around Edgbaston 15 fours and a six off Jack Leach.Jadeja proved a perfect foil to Pant’s aggression as the left-handers scored at a healthy run-rate of 4.63.Pant took charge from the outset and was hardly bothered by the bounce of Potts, and quick to pounce on full-pitched deliveries by Anderson and Broad.Leach, who took a maiden 10-wicket haul in the last test against the Kiwis, was also not spared as Pant used his feet well against the spinner, who finished the day an expensive 0-71 off nine overs.This fifth test was postponed a year ago when India, up 2-1 in the series, was stricken by a coronavirus outbreak. The virus hit the team again on the eve of this match when captain Rohit Sharma was ruled out and Jasprit Bumrah became the first fast bowler since Kapil Dev to lead the side as interim skipper.Anderson and Potts used the new ball effectively on a pitch where the fast bowlers got appreciable bounce.Opening batters Shubman Gill (17) and Cheteshwar Pujara (13) were worn down by the bowlers' nagging line and length, and Potts extracted lots of bounce.Gill hit two boundaries in a Broad over, but with the ball zipping and bouncing ominously he finally succumbed to Anderson’s brilliance when he edged to second slip.Broad came close to his 550th test wicket but Pujara, who replaced Rohit, successfully overturned a caught behind ruling off the DRS. However, Pujara didn’t last long against Anderson’s relentless seam and swing as the fast bowler struck in his second spell when Crawley grabbed a straightforward catch in the slip cordon.Crawley should have had his third catch, but couldn’t hold onto a sharp one-handed chance off Hanuma Vihari, which could have earned Potts his first wicket.India lost three more wickets inside six overs after rain delayed post-lunch play for 1 1/2 hours.Vihari was trapped leg before by Potts on 20 as the ball seamed into the left-hander.Virat Kohli, on 11, was indecisive against Potts and left the ball which cannoned onto his stumps after hitting the toe end of the bat.Anderson had Shreyas Iyer out for 15 down the leg side off a short delivery. Wicketkeeper Sam Billings took a brilliant one-handed diving catch.Anderson had 3-52 and Potts 2-85. Root bagged Pant, and Stokes got an edge off Shardul Thakur just before stumps.With inputs from APRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

During the first T20 warm-up match between India and Derbyshire at the County Ground in Derby, the Indians, led by wicket-keeper batter Dinesh Karthik prevailed by seven wickets, to commence their limited Overs format preparation in style ahead of the imminent three-match ODI and T20I series against England. Notably, yesterday was the first occasion when the Derbyshire County Cricket Club had hosted a match using a hybrid pitch. While Derbyshire managed to post 150/8 in their first innings, the Indians comfortably chased the total down with 20 deliveries to spare, and seven wickets in hand. History being made at Derby tonight…for the first time @DerbyshireCCC are hosting a match using a hybrid pitch. Five per cent of this pitch consists of synthetic grass stitched into the surface… @BenjaminJJ03 @ngodders (did I get that bit right chaps??) pic.twitter.com/sqRtIHEd6s — David Griffin Photography (@dgriffinpix) July 1, 2022 The preparation of a Hybrid pitch involves the technique of stitching polyethylene yarn onto the pitch’s natural grass. The resultant pitch is thus comprised of 95% natural and 5% artificial grass. Having been used successfully to create Football and Rugby pitches, the Hybrid pitch has not been approved for use on a Cricket field as far as the international matches are concerned. Although one still needs to prepare a hybrid pitch akin the natural Cricket pitch, the former reduces preparation times for each pitch and cuts the renovation time from six or seven weeks to four or five. The standout qualities of a hybrid Cricket pitch is its longevity and quick recovery time. Subject to wear and tear after a considerable period of time and successive matches, these pitches are considered to be ideal for the T20 format tournaments when matches are required to be played on a particular pitch within a few hours gap. The one demerit, however is that these hybrid pitches tend to dry out quicker and therefore need more water than a natural pitch. Hybrid pitches have already been approved by the ECB for its One Day Cup, the Vitality Blast and all formats of second eleven cricket. ECB’s National Performance Centre in Loughborough, Nottinghamshire’s Trent Bridge, and practice pitches at Lord’s, the Oval and other Test venues have such hybrid pitches in place for quite some time now.","pubDate":"2022-07-02 18:02:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs NOR Dream11 prediction: Fantasy cricket tips for India vs Northamptonshire T20 match in Northampton","link":"https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-ind-vs-nor-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tip-for-india-vs-northamptonshire-match-in-northampton-fancode-2965430","keywords":["Sports","Cricket"],"creator":["DNA Web Team"],"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs NOR Dream 11 Team - Check My Dream11 Team, Best Player's list for 2nd warmup T20 match, India vs Northamptonshire","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-02 17:56:36","image_url":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/third/public/2022/07/02/2519313-ind-vs-northamptonshire.jpg","source_id":"dnaindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stuart Broad takes unwanted record after bowling most expensive over in Test cricket history - Sky News","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2t5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zdHVhcnQtYnJvYWQtdGFrZXMtdW53YW50ZWQtcmVjb3JkLWFmdGVyLWJvd2xpbmctbW9zdC1leHBlbnNpdmUtb3Zlci1pbi10ZXN0LWNyaWNrZXQtaGlzdG9yeS0xMjY0NDQ3NNIBhAFodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2t5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9hbXAvc3R1YXJ0LWJyb2FkLXRha2VzLXVud2FudGVkLXJlY29yZC1hZnRlci1ib3dsaW5nLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLW92ZXItaW4tdGVzdC1jcmlja2V0LWhpc3RvcnktMTI2NDQ0NzQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Stuart Broad takes unwanted record after bowling most expensive over in Test cricket history  Sky NewsEngland v India: Stuart Broad concedes Test-record 35 runs in one over at Edgbaston  BBCEngland reeling as India captain Jasprit Bumrah smacks 35 off one Stuart Broad over and takes three wickets  Sky SportsEngland's misguided short-ball tactics fail the test against tailenders once again  The TelegraphStuart Broad becomes the sixth Test bowler to take 550 wickets before conceding world record 35 runs  Daily MailView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-02 17:27:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies vs Bangladesh, LIVE Cricket Score and updates, 1st T20I","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/west-indies-vs-bangladesh-live-cricket-score-watch-wi-vs-ban-1st-t20i-live-updates-streaming-online-today-match-updates-10864521.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"West Indies vs Bangladesh, LIVE Cricket Score and updates, 1st T20I","content":"Cricket West Indies Vs Bangladesh LIVE SCORE (t20) Quick Scorecard Full scorecard Ball by ball commentary FP commentary West Indies Vs Bangladesh At Windsor Park, Roseau, Dominica, 02 July, 2022 02 July, 2022 Starts (IST) Match Abandoned Bangladesh 105/8 (13.0 ov) 1st T20I West Indies Yet To Bat Match Abandoned Bangladesh West Indies 105/8 (13.0 ov) - R/R 8.08 Match Abandoned Shoriful Islam - 0 Nasum Ahmed - 2 This Over Batting Status R B 4s 6s Nasum Ahmed not out 7 4 1 0 Shoriful Islam not out 0 0 0 0 Bowling 0 M R W Obed McCoy 2 0 16 1 Odean Smith 2 0 22 1 Current Partnership Last Wicket 103/8 (12.5) 2 (2) R/R: 12 Shoriful Islam 0(0) Nasum Ahmed 2(1) Nurul Hasan (W) 25(16) S.R (156.25) c Brandon King b Odean Smith West Indies vs Bangladesh, LIVE Cricket Score and updates, 1st T20I West Indies vs Bangladesh, 1st T20I, LIVE Cricket score and Updates FirstCricket Staff July 2nd, 2022 22:55:19 IST West Indies take on Bangladesh in first T20I.

If the aforementioned two innings wasn’t box office entertainment stuff already, the Edgbaston crowd witnessed team India’s skipper cum fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah break a world record, surprisingly with the bat in hand. Smashing as many as 35 runs (including six extras) off the 84th Over bowled by pacer Stuart Broad, Bumrah broke the record of scoring the maximum runs by a batter in an Over during a Test match. The jaw-dropping, unbeaten innings of 31* off 16 deliveries, helped India surpass the 400-run mark, to post 416/10 in their first innings.

Ultima actualizare: 07/02/22 18:10 Alize Cornet a pus capăt impresionantă serie de 37 de victorii consecutive a lui Iga Swiatek pentru a ajunge în optimi la Wimbledon pentru prima dată din 2014. Iga Swiatek a suferit o înfrângere șoc în set direct în fața lui Alize Cornet la Wimbledon, în timp ce seria ei de 37 de victorii consecutive s-a încheiat uimitor. Numărul unu mondial nu a pierdut din februarie când a mers la Jelena Ostapenko în Dubai, dar a fost departe de adversara ei franceză pe primul teren. Swiatek a făcut 32 de erori neforțate pentru a pierde cu 6-4, 6-2 într-o oră și 32 de minute în runda a treia la All England Club. Coco Gauff s-a luptat cu o ieșire din turul al treilea după ce a pierdut cu 6-7 (4-7) 6-2, 6-1 pe terenul central în fața coechipierului ei american. Amanda Anisimova . Gauff, vicecampionul de la French Open, a reușit să câștige un meci dificil de deschidere, dar nu a reușit să țină pasul cu al 20-lea nivel de cap de serie după aceea. Anisimova, care a câștigat finala de juniori a US Open din 2017 dintre cei doi, a câștigat cu o lovitură de rever pentru a ajunge în optimi la primul club din Anglia. Această întâlnire dintre americani a fost o repetare a finalei de juniori a US Open din 2017, pe care Anisimova a câștigat-o, dar Gauff a fost cel care a câștigat primul set de deschidere aici. Gauff a excelat în tiebreak, dar a avut puține răspunsuri la numărul 25 mondial, care a susținut succesul cu un câștigător bun de backhand. Anisimova, semifinalistă la Roland Garros în 2019, a ajuns pentru prima dată în turul al patrulea la Wimbledon. Tânăra de 20 de ani era plină de emoție în timp ce stătea întinsă pe iarbă la sfârșitul a două ore și șapte minute de tenis. Anisimova s-a putut pregăti pentru un interviu în instanță unde a recunoscut: „Este cea mai specială zi din cariera mea. „Este o mare onoare să joc pe acest stadion, am fost foarte entuziasmat și l-am jucat pe Coco, un mare jucător. „Anterior, încercam doar să mă pregătesc să profit de asta sau să câștig sau să pierd, așa că câștigarea a fost foarte specială”.

Stuart Broad conceded a record 35 runs of one over against India’s number 10 batter.pa It came just minutes after Broad dismissed Mohammed Shami and became only the third seam bowler after Jimmy Anderson and Glenn McGrath to reach 550 Test wickets. Broad already held the world record for Twenty20 internationals after being bashed for a maximum 36 – six sixes – by Indian batter Yuvraj Singh in 2007. So now he has delivered the worst Test and T20 overs. The previous record for a Test over was 28 runs – achieved three times including Aussie George Bailey belting James Anderson during the 2013-14 Ashes and South Africa Keshav Maharaj against Joe Root in 2020.

CENTURY! No 3 for Ravindra Jadeja! Since 2017, he has stepped up big time and showed why he has three triple tons in FC cricket.

Smashing as many as 35 runs (including six extras) off the 84th Over bowled by pacer Stuart Broad, Bumrah collected the maximum runs ever in an Over in Test match history, to register Broad’s name at the top of the infamous list. The skipper’s 16-ball 31*, ensured that team India posted a massive total of 416/10 on the scoreboard in their first innings. However, with only six Overs into the England innings, the rain Gods decided to make an appearance to halt the smooth passage of play.

With Broad and Anderson both operating at different ends with the Dukes in their hands, it is always expected that they will scalp quick wickets and put their team into commanding position. Stuart Broad, who has been a faithful servant of English cricket has been doing this for many years now and he has never looked back since the day Yuvraj Singh smacked him for six consecutive sixes in the inaugural edition of the T20I World Cup played in South Africa. English skipper Ben Stokes won the toss and opted to field first in the fifth and final Test match that is being played at Edgbaston. With the help from overcast conditions, England reduced India to 93-5 and then Pant and Jadeja walked in who rescued India with a 222 runs stand and took India's score past 300 runs. When play resumed on day 2, it was Jadeja, who scored a fabulous ton and helped India cruise past 350. With Mohammad Shami at the other end, Stuart Broad was invited to the attack. The English veteran made no mistake as he claimed Mohammad Shami's wicket. His 550th scalp in Test cricket. The English legend is the son of current ICC match referee Chris Broad and had started his cricketing exploits as an opening batsman. Broad who was once appointed as the T20I captain did not relish the role much and opted to focus on his game more.

That’s despite being 37 and, at the time, was helping to run a pub. The football world is mourning the loss of a Scotland great following the death of Goram at the age of 58 , after a short battle with cancer. Described as ‘a little fella with a huge personality’ who ‘enjoyed a drink’, Goram was the product of a bygone era of football when you didn’t have to be a supreme athlete to reach the very top of the game. It’s even said that he was known to enjoy a beer or two before games. They don’t make them like that anymore. As Scottish football reporter David Tanner told talkSPORT: “What he lacked in stature he made up for his ability as a shot-stopper.” He is regarded by many to be Scotland’s greatest goalkeeper of time, and he wasn’t bad with cricket bat in hand, either. Representing his country at four major tournaments – 1986 and 1990 World Cups, 1992 and 1996 European Championships – he also played first-class cricket for Scotland, before being forced to choose football over cricket by his old Rangers boss, another late, great legend, Walter Smith. It certainly paid off, with Goram going on to enjoy a career which saw him win five Scottish first division titles, three Scottish Cups and two Scottish League Cups with Rangers, and named the Football of the Year and Players’ Player of the Year in the 1992/93 season. Not even he would have foreseen his golden career finale, though – which came in the form of a brief spell at Manchester United , where he played a key role in their 2000/01 Premier League title run-in. Having given Goram his Scotland debut during his spell as national team boss, Fergie was encouraged to give ‘The Goalie’ a call when injuries to Fabien Barthez and Raimond van der Gouw – plus Mark Bosnich’s free transfer to Chelsea two months previously – saw United enter March with no fit goalkeepers. After a suggestion from Ferguson’s older brother, Martin, who was United’s chief scout at the time, the iconic boss gave Goram a call to make the out-of-the-blue offer – only, the goalkeeper didn’t believe him. It’s said that both Smith and former Rangers teammate Ally McCoist had contacted Goram one morning, urging him to keep his phone close by – because an important call was coming. Fergie made the call, and the conversation went something like this: Ferguson: “Goalie, I want you to come down for three months on loan. Fabien Barthez is injured and Raimond van der Gouw is injured. We’ve got Bayern Munich [on] Wednesday and Liverpool [on] Sunday.” Goram: “Coisty [McCoist], f*** off!” He put the phone down. Ferguson, who of course knew well what Goram was like, called back, and Goram told his first wife, Miriam – they were driving in the car at the time – to answer it. “Miriam, this is Alex Ferguson, and you can tell that fat b****** he’s got ten seconds to say aye or naw!” Aye was the answer and, although ‘The Goalie’ ultimately didn’t play in those clashes against Bayern and Liverpool – with Barthez returning to fitness in time – he did play his small part in Red Devils history. Goram made his Manchester United debut the day after his 37th birthday in a Premier League game against Coventry. He conceded twice and was substituted for Van der Gouw on the 66th minute – apparently so that the No.2 would qualify for a winner’s medal. Fortunately for the veteran Scot, United won the match 4-2 and, with title rivals Arsenal losing to Middlesbrough that weekend, it meant Goram started the game that crowned the Red Devils as champions. Ferguson even arranged the goalkeeper to receive a Premier League winner’s medal for his services – a mark of respect between the legendary Scotsmen. He made one further appearance for the English giants, which came almost a month later against Southampton where he was again substituted by Van der Gouw in the second-half as they lost 2-1. So there it was, Goram’s Manchester United career ended almost as quickly as it started, but he didn’t leave without making an impression – including with Roy Keane . The pair didn’t see eye-to-eye at Old Trafford due to their Rangers and Celtic allegiances, with Irishman Keane said to have refused a welcoming captain’s handshake to the new signing. Goram even described their meeting in an interview with the Daily Mirror , saying: “Shark’s eyes. Dead, devoid of emotion, glaring at me. No handshake. Welcome to Manchester United, Roy Keane-style.” He also hit back at Keane in one training session, where he told the skipper to ‘f*** off’ in front of the entire team. “One day in training, we were playing a game of eight-a-side, and Keane and Luke Chadwick were up front for my team,” he explained. “I half-volleyed a peach of a pass right onto Chadwick’s foot. The kid snatched at it and ballooned his volley over the bar. Suddenly, I was the target of a volley of abuse from Keane. ‘Hey you, give me the f****** ball,’ he screamed. I replied: ‘What, do you get the ball just cos you’re Roy Keane? F*** off!’” Gary Neville then had a word afterwards. “Goalie,” he said. “We don’t talk to Roy like that down here. We just don’t.” Neville was one of many football stars to pay tribute to the goalkeeper following Saturday’s sad news. Terribly sad news about Andy Goram. RIP Andy. Love to all your family ❤️ Andy Goram. 1964-2022 💙 The Goalie pic.twitter.com/6HouAgSche Many will remember Goram for different reasons – for his crucial role in a glorious period for Rangers, for his maverick behaviour off the pitch, or even that he was in goal for Paul Gascoigne’s famous strike against Scotland at Euro 96, which is said to have left ‘The Goalie’ fuming. But, for talkSPORT’s man in Scotland, he’ll be remembered as the greatest ever – even though he may not have looked like it. “Richard Gough [the former Scotland defender] nicknamed him ‘the flying pig’,” Tanner said. “He was not a guy you’d think of when you look at modern goalkeepers now – slim and athletic. ‘The Goalie’ was as wide as he was tall, very much an old fashioned guy, but he was strong, agile, very brave – he had teeth missing because he was not afraid to put his head where it hurt. “A goalkeeper from a bygone age, even in his own era, but my word he was good. “’The Goalie’ was genuinely world-class,” he added. “Alan Hodgkinson, the former England goalkeeper who at the time spent half his week coaching Andy at Rangers and the other half of the week coaching Peter Schmeichel at Manchester United, said he felt Goram was the best in the world in the late 1990s. “That was one hell of a tribute.”","pubDate":"2022-07-02 14:48:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Absolute carnage’: England legend Stuart Broad bowls the most expensive over in Test history","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/countries/england/stuart-broad-just-bowled-the-most-expensive-over-in-test-history/news-story/9b8bc36253d24a9fab6be8b469fe907b","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Stuart Broad bowled the most expensive over in Test cricket history on Saturday (AEST), before England bowled India out for 416 on Day 2 at Edgbaston.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-02 14:48:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Saha parts ways with Bengal after obtaining NOC from CAB - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuY3JpY2luZm8uY29tL3N0b3J5L2luZGlhLWRvbWVzdGljLW5ld3Mtd3JpZGRoaW1hbi1zYWhhLXBhcnRzLXdheXMtd2l0aC1iZW5nYWwtYWZ0ZXItb2J0YWluaW5nLW5vYy1mcm9tLWNhYi0xMzIyODM10gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Saha parts ways with Bengal after obtaining NOC from CAB  ESPNcricinfoWriddhiman Saha parts ways with Bengal, set to play for Tripura  SportsCafeCricket Association Of Bengal Grants NOC To Wriddhiman Saha  NDTV SportsCAB grants NOC to Wriddhiman Saha to play for other Ranji team; keeper says he holds no grudges - Firstpost  FirstpostWriddhiman Saha quits Bengal cricket after receiving No Objection Certificate from CAB  India TodayView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-02 14:47:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"What time is tea today in cricket: India vs England session timings 5th Test Day 2","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-what-time-is-tea-today-in-cricket-india-vs-england-session-timings-5th-test-day-2/","keywords":["Cricket","England","India","India tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs England session timings 5th Test Day 2: A total of 50.3 overs remain to be bowled at Edgbaston today.

Players have resumed play after a couple of rain breaks on the second day of the ongoing rescheduled fifth Test match between England and India at Edgbaston. Going by the weather prediction in the city for the rest of the day, there are comparatively lesser chances of rain pouring down. With the rain probability being in vicinity of 30%, all the stakeholders would be hoping for rain gods to remain kind by allowing uninterrupted play for the remainder of Saturday. India, who have managed to pick a wicket before both the rain breaks today, have dismissed the opposition’s opening batters cheaply. Captain Jasprit Bumrah, whose name has already been etched in history due to his batting heroics in the morning session, has also picked a couple of wickets in Alex Lees (6) and Zac Crawley (9). the way bumrah is bowling, bumrah is going to take some convincing to take bumrah off #ENGvIND — Gaurav Kalra (@gauravkalra75) July 2, 2022 While some 15 overs were lost on the first day of the match yesterday, close to 26 overs have been lost to rain today. It is noteworthy that the second session is currently in play today. Resuming at 03:15 PM (local time), the afternoon session will be played for 105 minutes before players break for tea. Hence, tea will be taken at 05:00 PM. A 20-minute interval will be followed by a 111-minute evening session. Furthermore, there will be an attempt to bowl a total of 50.3 remaining overs in these sessions assuming that rain doesn’t play spoilsport again today. As far as the timings for Indian audiences are concerned, the second session will be played between 07:45 PM – 09:30 PM. A 20-minute tea break will be followed by the third session between 09:50 PM – 11:41 PM. Considering how late play will continue (till 07:11 PM) in Birmingham, one can’t rule out the possibility of bad light stopping play.","pubDate":"2022-07-02 14:46:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jasprit Bumrah to Yuvraj Singh - Indian born players hold record for most runs in an over in all 3 formats","link":"https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-jasprit-bumrah-to-yuvraj-singh-indian-born-players-hold-record-for-most-runs-in-an-over-in-all-3-formats-2965383","keywords":["Sports","Cricket"],"creator":["DNA Web Team"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jasprit Bumrah became the batsman with the most runs in an over in Test cricket history after he scored 29 runs against Stuart Broad on Saturday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-02 14:39:44","image_url":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/third/public/2022/07/02/2519255-bumrah-yuvraj-jaskaran.jpg","source_id":"dnaindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs ENG, 5th Test: Stuart Broad becomes 3rd pacer in history of Test cricket to achieve THIS milestone","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-vs-eng-5th-test-stuart-broad-becomes-3rd-pacer-in-history-of-test-cricket-to-achieve-this-milestone-joins-james-anderson-and-glenn-mcgrath-in-elite-list-2480816.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India started off things on day 2 at 338/7.

On day one of England’s 5th test against India , the hosts managed to skittle their opponents to 98-5, as it seemed they were riding the wave of success from their recent 3-0 series win over New Zealand. WORLD RECORD! 🤯🇮🇳 India broke the record for most runs in a Test over – 35 in total! INCREDIBLE. #ENGvIND pic.twitter.com/k4RuKCMGPg Next in, however, came the dangerous Rishabh Pant who hit an outstanding 146 runs of 111 balls to put India in the driving seat. When England eventually dismissed Pant and Shardul Thakur in quick succession it seemed they might receive some respite, but tail-enders Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah delivered the exact opposite. In one over, with Bumrah on strike and Broad bowling, India added an incredible 35 runs to their total, which included a no-ball six and a wide that went past the batsman and wicket-keeper for four runs. It smashed the record for most runs scored off one over in Test history and came just after Broad had reached a milestone of 550 wickets. The previous unfortunate record-holder was South Africa’s Robin Peterson, who was hit for 28 runs in one over by West Indies legend Brian Lara back in 2003. Peterson took to Twitter to jokingly express his disappointment at no longer holding the record, as he said: “Sad to lose my record today. Oh well, records are made to be broken I guess. Onto the next one.” Sad to lose my record today 😜 oh well, records are made to be broken I guess. Onto the next one 🏏 #ENGvIND Surprisingly, this is not even the highest number of runs Broad has ever conceded in an over, as back in 2007 he was hit for six sixes in a row by India’s Yuvraj Singh in a T20 match. England eventually bowled India out for 416 runs, with Jimmy Anderson taking the final wicket to make it 5-60 in this test match, which is the 32nd five-wicket haul in 171 test matches for England’s all-time leading wicket-taker. As it stands, rain has stopped play with England on 31-2 in their first innings, after openers Alex Lees and Zak Crawley were both dismissed early on by Bumrah. 888Sport – Bet £10 on Wimbledon, Get £40 In Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE Min deposit £/€/$10 • Offer is valid until 10/07/2022 23:59 • A qualifying bet is a ‘real money’ stake of at least £/€/$10 on Tennis market • Min odds 1/2 (1.50) • Free Bets expire after 10 days and valid only for Tennis • Free Bet stakes not included in returns • Withdrawal restrictions, payment methods, country & Full T&C’s apply. 18+ Begambleaware.org SEE MORE FREE BET OFFERS HERE","pubDate":"2022-07-02 14:13:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WI vs BAN Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Playing XI, Pitch Report & Injury Update for 1st T20I - CricTracker","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcmljdHJhY2tlci5jb20vd2ktdnMtYmFuLWRyZWFtMTEtcHJlZGljdGlvbi1mYW50YXN5LWNyaWNrZXQtdGlwcy1wbGF5aW5nLXhpLXBpdGNoLXJlcG9ydC1pbmp1cnktdXBkYXRlLWZvci0xc3QtdDIwaS_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WI vs BAN Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Playing XI, Pitch Report & Injury Update for 1st T20I  CricTrackerWI vs BAN Prediction- Who Will Win Today's Match Between West Indies And Bangladesh, Bangladesh Tour Of West Indies 2022,1s t T20I  Cricket AddictorMahmudullah unfussed with Test loss; motto in T20s is to be 'aggressive' | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzWest Indies vs Bangladesh, LIVE Cricket Score and updates, 1st T20I - Firstpost  FirstpostWI vs BAN: Weather Forecast And Pitch Report of Windsor Park, In Dominica- Bangladesh Tour Of West Indies 2022, 1st T20I  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-02 13:32:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"[WATCH] Jasprit Bumrah clobbers Stuart Broad as England pacer bowls most expensive over in Test cricket","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-ind-vs-eng-2022-watch-jasprit-bumrah-clobbers-stuart-broad-england-pacer-bowls-expensive-test-cricket?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Renin Wilben Albert"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-02 13:26:11","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/07/8bd81-16567617414202-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'It’s Broad getting Yuvified by Bumrah': Twitter reacts as pacer concedes most expensive over in Test history","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/its-broad-getting-yuvified-by-bumrah-twitter-reacts-as-pacer-concedes-most-expensive-over-in-test-history-10863841.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"'It’s Broad getting Yuvified by Bumrah': Twitter reacts as pacer concedes most expensive over in Test history","content":"Cricket 'It’s Broad getting Yuvified by Bumrah': Twitter reacts as pacer concedes most expensive over in Test history England's Stuart Broad gave away 35 runs in one over against India. FP Trending July 2nd, 2022 18:54:53 IST Stuart Broad was hit for six sixes in an over by Yuvraj Singh during T20 World Cup in 2007. AFP/AP It was a mixed bag for Stuart Broad at Edgbaston on Saturday. The English pacer dismissed Mohammad Shami to scalp his 550th wicket in Tests. However, he also conceded 35 runs in an over later on. Bumrah smashed Broad all over the park for 4, 5 wides, 6 (no-ball), 4, 4, 4, 6 and 1. Broad now has the unwanted record for conceding the most expensive over in the history of Test cricket. As Bumrah kept whacking the English pacer, Indian fans could not stop grinning. Watch: Interestingly, in the 2007 T20 World Cup, India batter Yuvraj Singh took the pacer to the cleaners and slammed six sixes in an over. Even Robin Peterson, who held the previous record for the most expensive over in Tests, commented on Broad leaking 35 runs, and joked that he was sad to lose his record. After Broad created this unwanted record, here’s how Twitter reacted: Before Jasprit Bumrah, Caribbean legend Brian Lara held the joint record for slamming most runs in an over, alongside George Bailey and Keshav Maharaj. All three of them had smashed 28 runs in an over. Bumrah slammed 29 runs, while the rest were extras. India finished their first innings at 416. Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja were the stars of the team, with both southpaws slamming a ton each. The visitors currently lead 2-1 in the 5-Test series. If this game results in a draw or a win, it will be the side’s first Test series win on English soil since 2007. Under Rahul Dravid’s captaincy, India had won the series 1-0. Currently, Dravid is the head coach of the side, leading to expectations that the team can repeat this milestone under his guidance.
