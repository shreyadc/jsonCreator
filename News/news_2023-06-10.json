The first half of Day 3, saw impressive contributions from Ajinkya Rahane (89) and Shardul Thakur (51) to help India reach a total of 296 in their first innings, avoiding the follow-on after lunch on day three but handing Australia a 173-run lead going into their second dig. Thakur scored three half-centuries in three innings at The Oval before leaving for a lively 51. The all-rounder’s century puts him in exclusive company as one of only three players in the game’s history to record three successive 50-plus scores at the south London venue. “Well, cricket is a funny game. You can never say what is the right total and this one-off game, especially ICC finals, you never know, I mean, who can handle the pressure better out there, one good partnership when you can even chase down 450 or maybe more than that,” Shardul Thakur said in a post-match press conference. “Last year England chased 400 here and they did not lose too many wickets. So that’s a positive sign for us. Whatever they put up on the board, it’s too early to make any predictions. We see a lot of times in Test cricket that game changes within an hour. So yes, we like to be optimistic tomorrow going on the field. And yeah, we’ll take it on from there,” Shardul added. At the beginning of the day, Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur’s partnership laid the groundwork for India to fight back after having their backs against the wall for the better part of two days. When asked why Ajinkya Rahane did not field after reaching 89, Thakur revealed that he got hit on the finger while batting, but that it doesn’t appear that awful. “Rahane got hurt in his finger and he is getting it treated. It does not look too bad and he will certainly come out to bat. We just spoke to each other and Rahane guided me well as we were also the last recognized pair. Ajinkya Rahane has performed well for India on many occasions. He has struck many tons and has been involved in big partnerships. He has performed in England, Australia and South Africa. He has got experience,” the India all-rounder added. Thakur described the wicket as “underprepared”. “There is an area where the ball is lifting up. There is a crack over there. You have to be careful and watchful. If it bounces then good luck to the batter. Ball was doing a bit. The pitch was under-prepared as the ball was bouncing as well as keeping low. Travis Head came and swung his bat and got some quick runs. Maybe we could have bowled some more bouncers to him,” Thakur said. Coming to the match, Australia lead the ICC World Test Championship Final by 296 runs going into day four, but counterattacking half-centuries from Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur were followed by a superb bowling performance to give India a glimmer of hope after a thrilling day’s play. Australia closed the day at 123/4 in 44 overs, with Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green unbeaten at 41(118)* and 7(27)* respectively.

Rahane, who made a memorable 89 in his comeback Test after 18 months, hoped that the finger injury he sustained on Thursday would not affect his batting in the second innings. \"Don't think it will affect [my] batting [in India's second innings],\" Rahane told the broadcaster at the end of the third day's play. Rahane faced 129 balls and struck 11 fours and a six during his stay in the middle. His 109-run partnership for the seventh wicket with Shardul Thakur (51 off 109) kept India in the game but Australia still managed to take a massive 173-run first-innings lead. At stumps, Australia extended their lead to 296 runs by reaching 123 for four in 44 overs in their second innings. \"Happy with the way I batted. Had a good today. We were looking to get 320-330 but overall we had a good day. Bowling wise we bowled well. Everyone chipped in.\" Referring to Cameron Green's incredible catch to dismiss him, Rahane said, \"That was a really good catch. We all know he's a really good fielder. Has a big reach.\" He had no qualms in admitting that Australia have their nose ahead. \"Australia slightly ahead in the game. For us it's important to be in the moment, play session by session. First one hour will be crucial tomorrow. We know funny things can happen. Jadeja bowled really well, footmarks helped him against the left-hander. Still feel wicket will help seam bowlers,\" Rahane said. Rahane was struck on his right hand's index finger off a Pat Cummins bouncer on the second day of the match. He immediately felt pain and called on the physio for treatment. Thakur also said Rahane will \"definitely bat\" in the second innings. \"He [Rahane] got a bad blow on his finger. It does not look too bad, it is being assessed. He did not go out in the field as it would have been risky and he had already fractured the same finger previously. He will definitely bat.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-09 19:25:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WTC Final 2023: Rahane, Shardul help India live to fight another day","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wtc-final-2023-rahane-shardul-help-india-live-to-fight-another-day/article66952007.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The duo’s heroics not only enable the team avoid the follow-on, but also raise hopes of salvaging an honourable draw; Australia finishes the third day on 123 for four for an overall lead of 296","content":"The Indians were expected to capitulate without a fight, but Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur had other ideas. With every minute of resistance, the decibel level from the crowd increased. At the stroke of lunch, the loudest roar came when Pat Cummins kicked the ball. Cummins was understandably angry, having been called for a no-ball when he had Shardul trapped plumb in front. The Indian flag filled the stands, as the 25,170-strong crowd took delight in Australia’s agony. The atmosphere at The Oval was electric, in stark contrast to the sullen faces at the start of play. Rahane (89, 129b, 11x4, 1x6) and Shardul (51, 109b, 6x4) put on 109 runs for the seventh wicket, raising India’s hopes of salvaging an honourable draw. The duo’s heroics helped India avoid the follow-on and finish with 296. Australia moved to 123 for four at close, an overall lead of 296 runs. Cummins’ men continue to sit in the driver’s seat, but the Indians have shown the stomach for a fight. It was a memorable comeback for Rahane, who last played a Test around 18 months ago. He was all class, hitting shots all around the ground. He reached his fifty with a powerful hook shot off Cummins which sailed into the stands over fine-leg. When off-spinner Nathan Lyon was brought into the attack, Rahane came into his own. He cut the short balls, and strode well forward to punish anything full. The Mumbai batter made a strong case for cementing his spot in the eleven. Shardul was not as flamboyant with his strokeplay, but more than made up with grit. Shardul copped back-to-back blows to the arm, which only strengthened his resolve. The 31-year-old recorded his third consecutive Test fifty at this venue. Both Rahane and Shardul were lucky to benefit from a dropped catch each. Cameron Green, who had put one down earlier, pulled off a stunning one-handed grab at gully to end Rahane’s stay. The carnival ended for the spectators, who rose for one final applause as Rahane walked back. Green then scalped Shardul with a length delivery outside off which took the edge. Australia’s second essay started shakily, with David Warner snapped up by wicketkeeper K.S. Bharat off Mohammed Siraj in the fourth over. Usman Khawaja, out for a duck in the first innings, disappointed again. The southpaw flung his bat at a wide ball from Umesh and offered Bharat another catch. Steve Smith (34, 47b, 3x4) had a ‘brain fade’ moment when he charged at Ravindra Jadeja and attempted a wild slog. The shot, completely out of character for this batter of high pedigree, ballooned to Shardul at point. Travis Head took one chance too many. A heavy-handed drive gave Jadeja a simple return catch. Marnus Labuschagne (41 n.o., 118b, 4x4) held firm. He received a couple of snorters from Siraj, but with the use of soft hands, managed to drop the ball gently to the ground. There was a lesson here for Virat Kohli, who went hard at a rising delivery and spooned a catch to slip on Thursday. The fate of the match now depends on how the Indian batters fare. Rahane and Shardul have shown the way for the rest to follow.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 19:12:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Behind the scenes of Bazball, England’s Ashes game changer","link":"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/behind-the-scenes-of-bazball-england-s-ashes-game-changer-20230605-p5de2u.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Daniel Brettig and Tom Decent"],"video_url":null,"description":"It is the revolutionary method that has lifted England from 2021-22 Ashes flunks to genuine contenders.","content":"Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Success, as they say, has many fathers. In this case, England’s bold new approach to Test cricket was born out of some years of mediocrity and worse by the team then led by Joe Root, the appointment of Ben Stokes as captain, and the decision of England performance boss Rob Key to choose Brendon McCullum as Stokes’ coaching offsider. “Bazball”, the term first coined by ESPNcricinfo’s Andrew Miller, embodied the fact that England were playing with the sort of verve McCullum (whose middle name is Barry, hence the nickname “Baz”) demonstrated in his final years as an international cricketer. In 2016 McCullum had clubbed the fastest-ever Test hundred against Australia in Christchurch - and taken from the philosophy he articulated later that same year in his MCC Cowdrey Lecture at Lord’s . McCullum spoke of playing the game without fear or inhibition about the possible consequences of failure. That attitude had stemmed, he said, from the traumatic days after Phillip Hughes’ death in 2014, when New Zealand were in the middle of a Test match against Pakistan. “It was so strange, and yet it felt so right, that after Phil’s death we didn’t really care any more about the result,” McCullum had said. “Because nothing we could or couldn’t do on the field really mattered in comparison to what had happened to Phil. Our perspective changed completely for the rest of my time playing Test cricket for New Zealand, and we were a much better side as a result.” England are now playing with that very freedom, which brings us to another thread. In white-ball cricket, led by former captain Eoin Morgan, England had broken their self-imposed shackles as early as 2015, leading to a fearless ODI and Twenty20 combination that now hold the World Cups in both formats . A deep well of white-ball talent, particularly with the bat, was particularly open to trying that kind of approach in Tests. Essentially, Bazball is both. England are trying to win matches as quickly as possible, completely unconcerned by how it might look if that attempt goes wrong. James Anderson, England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, has had the best year of his life in Test cricket (45 wickets at 17.62). He’ll turn 41 during the fifth Ashes Test. He explained the combination of mindset and tactics at play: “When I came back into the team it was more about trying to push your boundaries as a player - go into practice thinking, ‘How far can I push myself?’. That’s been particularly evident in the batters, they’ve tried so many different things to really impose themselves on the opposition, and certainly for the young guys that freedom to go and express themselves has worked an absolute treat. “The same thing has happened with the bowlers. It’s only a slight shift, and it might sound strange, but they only want to think about taking 20 wickets. In the past, my job might have been, ‘Right let’s keep the run rate under 2.5 an over for the next hour’, so my job would then be not necessarily defensive, but I’d have a fairly orthodox field, I’d just try to be relentlessly accurate for a period of time. Now there isn’t that sort of feeling. “The run rate is irrelevant to Ben in particular. He’s like, ‘I don’t care how many runs you go for, I want 20 wickets as quickly as possible’. You’re constantly thinking as a bowler then, about ‘How am I taking my next wicket’. We’ve been setting, not necessarily strange fields, but fields we’ve not necessarily set in the past, or I certainly wouldn’t have, and looking for that attacking option.” England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow is a key figure in the Bazball revolution. Credit: Artwork: Matt Davidson All this is aided by another strand of the Bazball picture. In the Twenty20 age, so the thinking goes, the experience of Test cricket has to be fun for the players. One manifestation of this is the amount of golf they are playing. Another is the fact that England have created an environment in which there is far less trepidation - Moeen Ali’s acceptance of a call out of retirement, after struggling with the mental and physical weight of Test cricket before his 2021 exit , is the latest example. The most obvious manifestation of Bazball is in England’s phenomenally fast scoring over the past year - near enough to five runs an over when remarkably few teams over nearly 150 years of Test cricket have accumulated their runs at better than three an over. For example, the great West Indies side scored at 3.5 an over in 1984, its fastest year of scoring. In the early 2000s, Steve Waugh’s dominant Australians upped the tempo, but with far more orthodox methods than England have been using. They have been led by a combination of experience and youth. Jonny Bairstow was the initial flag bearer, peeling off a series of centuries in England last summer that demonstrated total commitment and clarity about going on the attack - regardless of whether opponents maintained a disciplined off stump line to him or not. Other younger men, notably Ben Duckett and Harry Brook, have followed suit with thrilling effect. In the case of Duckett, he is opening the batting in a way few have done before when watchfulness was an opener’s modus operandi. Duckett has let just eight of 605 balls through to the wicketkeeper since he was recalled to England’s Test team. It’s white ball batting against a red one. Jimmy Anderson is in career-best form at age 40. Credit: Artwork: Matt Davidson But the bowling, too, has been far more proactive. Stokes and his bowlers shuffle their fields, their lengths and plans constantly, tailoring things to opponents with rare agility in an era of pre-packaged plans concocted in between sessions with coaches. In doing so, England’s collective strike rate among bowlers has dropped from taking a wicket around every 60 balls to just over 51 balls - close to the mark set by the world leaders Australia and India. Opening batter Ben Duckett has let just eight of 605 balls through to the wicketkeeper since he was recalled to England’s Test team. Says Anderson: “An example of that is we’ll potentially keep four or five catchers in the slips and not have an extra cover, whereas in the past we’d be, ‘Oh we’ll put an extra cover in because it’s not doing too much, to keep the runs down a little bit’. Ben would much rather extra catchers than worrying too much about the odd four here and there. It’s amazing how we’ve changed the mindset to try to be a little bit more attacking, the economy rate has actually stayed at a reasonable level.” Put simply, England’s Bazballers are more focused on taking 20 wickets as quickly as possible than they are with saving runs, as the table below shows. Short answer? Yes, thus far. Bazball started with some victories chasing hefty fourth innings totals on good batting tracks against New Zealand and India. But Stokes and McCullum recalibrated after their first defeat against South Africa to find success on far more lively surfaces against the Proteas, where the ball seamed and swung far more prominently. In Pakistan, without Bairstow at their disposal after he broke his leg on the golf course, England’s approach went into overdrive with even faster scoring devised to buy time to bowl the hosts out twice. In fact, England’s Bazballers have produced three of the top 10 fastest run rates for completed innings in Test history. And on pitches as dead as that prepared in Rawalpindi ( where Australia’s bowlers more or less raised the white flag earlier during a bore draw the same year ), Stokes’ cheeky plans and fields, including plenty of use of bouncers in the hope of drawing out the risky hook shot, had the Englishmen finding ways to take 20 wickets in the most inhospitable conditions possible. If there was any kind of indicator that Bazball might eventually run out of steam, it came in New Zealand on England’s most recent tour. After marching to victory in the first of two Tests, England were narrowly beaten in the second in Wellington after the Black Caps made the most of their accumulated knowledge to not be spooked by their proactive opposition. Instead, they made as many runs as possible, scoring at their own pace, and then put England under pressure to reach a target when time had begun to become a factor. Australia’s analysts will have taken note. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Australia’s Test team have gone through quite a few emotions upon finding their vanquished 2021-22 Ashes quarry had rejuvenated themselves. In Sri Lanka last year, there were a few sniggers and joking mentions of “Bazball” in the nets, before the term “Ronball” , a reference to head coach Andrew McDonald (aka, “Ronny”), was glimpsed on a piece of paper in the team viewing area during the Adelaide Test against the West Indies. Ahead of the England tour, numerous members of the Australian squad were quizzed on their thoughts about a year of Bazball. Steve Smith weighed in, too, after the Australians demolished India’s batting in English conditions in the first innings of the World Test Championship at the Oval , an immediate precursor to the Ashes. “I think it will be difficult on this kind of wicket that’s up and down and seaming around,” he said. “It’s not easy to defend, let alone come out and swing,” Smith said. For decades, it was customary for a bowler or wicketkeeper to be sent out late in a day’s play to protect the wicket of the next incoming specialist batter. But under Bazball, that nightwatchman role is turned on its head - Stuart Broad may be sent out with a licence to slog. The concept isn’t entirely new - in one-day games in the 1980s and 1990s, the likes of Craig McDermott and Shane Warne were sent out as a “pinch-hitter” to swing for the fences ahead of recognised batters. But it suits Broad, a provocative figure as far as Australia is concerned , down to the ground. “We are looking at every situation we are going to find ourselves in and what the positive thing to do is,” Stokes said last year. “For example, we renamed what the nightwatchman is all about. We called it Nighthawk. That was Broady. He was going out with half an hour left to play to try to literally slog. That’s where we are at the moment, it’s awesome.” If you ask Stokes, there will be no deviation whatsoever. He and McCullum are utterly committed to the new plan of attack, and to rein it in now would be to contradict the whole philosophy - after all, if you are all about ignoring the possible consequences of failure, it would be disingenuous to turn back in the midst of the biggest series of all. “We’ll keep doing the same things we’ve done,” Stokes told Sky commentator and former England captain Nasser Hussain recently . “There’s no point changing what we’ve done over the last year, just because we’re now coming into an Ashes series. “Every player knows the Ashes is where everything just ramps up a little bit. But we’ll keep sticking to what we do. Me and Baz have been around enough, our senior players have been around enough to understand that and make sure those little things don’t creep in. “I’m glad I’ve actually managed to captain 12 games before stepping into the Ashes as captain. I’ve got a lot of things to be able to look back on under pressure or different situations within games. But the Ashes is always something every English or Australian cricketer really looks forward to.” In other words, buckle up. Sports news, results and expert commentary.

World Cup-winning Australian captain Waugh’s assessment comes after the likes of Sourav Ganguly, Ricky Ponting and Sanjay Manjrekar expressed their surprise at the Indian team management’s decision to take to the field at The Oval without senior off-spinner Ashwin, currently the world’s number one bowler in Tests. Waugh recalled how Australia made a similar error in the fifth Test at The Oval in 2019, a match which England won by 145 runs after Tim Paine opted to bowl first. “We made the same blunder four years ago in the Ashes. The Oval is always tricky,” Waugh was quoted as saying by AAP. “It looks green on top but underneath it is crumbly and a bit dry. You can get lulled into the overcast sky and green pitch and think it is going to do everything. As soon as the sun comes out it is totally different and dries out quickly. “I do think (India) have picked the wrong side. Spin will play a big part in this Test match and it is going to be up and down.” Waugh added that he would picked Ashwin for his batting, let alone his bowling. “I would have picked Ashwin for his batting, let alone his bowling. That is why I can’t believe he isn’t playing because he has got five Test centuries as well. It is very strange.” India’s leading wicket-taker in the 2021-2023 WTC cycle, Ashwin lost out to Ravindra Jadeja, who is playing as the only spinner in the team. The Indian team said Ashwin was not considered for selection in the playing XI owing to the conditions at the Oval. Batting first, Australia put up 469 after centuries by Steve Smith and Travis Head and then had India in trouble at 151 for five at stumps on the second day. Ashwin has 474 Test wickets and could have asked some probing questions to the Australian batters, especially the left-handers, with his variations on a pitch that was also offering variable bounce.

Australia closed the day at 123/4 in 44 overs, with Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green unbeaten at 41(118)* and 7(27)* respectively. At the beginning of the day, Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur’s partnership laid the groundwork for the Indians to fight back after having their backs against the wall for the better part of two days. Speedster Umesh Yadav set the tone for the Indians quite early in the third session, as he dismissed Usman Khawaja cheaply (13 off 39 balls). The left-hander knicked a wide delivered wide outside off-stump and KS Bharat dived low to take a fine catch. Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith once again settled Australian nerves, as they kept the scoreboard ticking over. But India managed to find a breakthrough after 16 overs, with the centurion from the first innings failing to make his mark this time. Brought into the attack, left-armer Jadeja sent back the former Australia skipper for the eighth time in his career. Jadeja brought his experience to the fore yet again as he dismissed another centurion from the first innings, Travis Head. In the first ball of the 37th over, Head was dropped by Umesh Yadav on the boundary line and the ball went for a six. On the second ball of that over, Head regained his composure and defended it for a dot ball. However, on the third ball, Jadeja dismissed Head after he lobbed a catch at him. This was the final Australian wicket to fall for the day as Cameron Green and Labuschagne survived the final ball. Before tea, Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur managed to reignite India’s hope of making a comeback in the WTC final, Australian bowlers once again showcased their prowess, with skipper Pat Cummins dismissing Rahane at the beginning of the second session. Rahane, who was in sight of what would have been a fine century on his return to the Indian red-ball team, fell for 89 (129). The right-hander, who had survived some close calls and anxious moments, eventually ran out of luck as Cameron Green took a stunning catch to send him back to the pavillion. Umesh tried to play a cameo but Cummins made short work of him. Yadav fell for a score of 5(11). Thakur soon followed Rahane back to the shed as in trying to clear the boundary, he edged to wicketkeeper Alex Carey behind the stumps. Thakur’s counter-attacking knock came to an end for 51(109). With Thakur gone, Shami went after the Australian pacers, striking two consecutive boundaries in the 67th over off Boland. His attacking knock was, however, short-lived as he was dismissed by the pacer for 13 (11). The fall of this wicket saw the Indians being rolled over for 296 in 69.4 overs, trailing Australia by 173 runs. The Australian left-handed opening duo of David Warner and Usman Khawaja stepped up to build on their 173-run advantage. However, the Aussies were rocked early as Siraj drew first blood, dismissing Warner for a score of 1(8). Marnus Labuschagne and Khwaja, however, survived the initial torrid spell, to take the Aussies to 23/1 in 11 overs. The Australians started the first session of Day 3 in the same way as they did on Day 2, with Boland getting a delivery to sneak past the defence of Indian wicketkeeper-batsman KS Bharat and striking timber. Bharat fell on the second ball of Day 3 at a score of 5 off 15 balls. The strapping right-armer got a good-length delivery to tailback sharply at Bharat, dislodging his off peg. After the fall of Bharat’s wicket, Rahane and Thakur went about rebuilding the Indian innings. Rahane brought up his 26th Test half-century, under tough and testing circumstances, in the 47th over. Thakur, who has played enterprising knocks for his country in the red-ball format, fought fire with fire as the Aussies threw everything at him. However, the cricketing gods seemed to be smiling on him, as he survived some anxious moments. In the final over of the first session, Shardul was adjudged LBW to skipper Cummins. However, even as the onfield decision was sent to the third umpire for review, Cummins was found to have stepped over the blowing mark. The ball was eventually adjudged a no-ball. In the next over, bowled by Mitchell Starc, Shardul knocked a delivery. which fell marginally short of Australian wicketkeeper Alex Carey. Even Rahane had his share of good fortune during the first session as he survived a strong LBW shout in the 49th over, which was turned down by the on-field umpire but was sent up to the third umpire for a referral. He edged the next delivery but it flew over the first slip and raced to the fence. On the third ball, he stroked a delightful drive to bring up two consecutive boundaries. In the final overs of the first session, he tried to play a drive but ended up edging to the first slip. However, the catch fell short of David Warner, who was standing in the first slip. At the close of play in the first session, India was still trailing the Australians by 209 runs. Brief scores: Australia 123/4 (Marnus Labuschagne 41(118)*, Steve smith 34(47) and Ravindra Jadeja 2/25) vs India.

The findings of the study, conducted by the University of Nottingham, support previous research that former footballers may be at higher risk of neurocognitive disease. The new report states that 2.8 percent of retired professional footballers in their study reported medically diagnosed dementia and other neurodegenerative disease compared to 0.9 percent of the general population. Dr Charlotte Cowie, the FA’s head of medicine, said: “The FOCUS study worked with an established group of former professional footballers that were participating in research and was able to review their brain health, and it supports the previous findings in the FIELD study which suggest an increased risk for neurodegenerative disease in former professional footballers than in the general population. “This is an extremely complex area of our game, but we are committed to working collectively with our stakeholders to help grow our knowledge in this area through further medical and expert analysis.\" The Football Association has been criticised by campaigners for not doing enough to aid former players now suffering from neurocognitive disease. But it said it had introduced “industry-leading\" concussion guidelines which has restricted heading practice in training and banned deliberate headers from under-12s level. “The FA has led the way in taking steps to help reduce potential risk factors within the game (including) establishing industry-leading concussion guidelines,\" the FA said in a statement. Awareness about concussion in sport has grown since America’s National Football League agreed to a $1 billion settlement in 2015 to resolve thousands of lawsuits by former players suffering from neurological problems. This has prompted a number of sports around the world, including football, rugby union, rugby league and cricket, to strengthen their concussion protocols.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 18:18:08","image_url":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/06/football-players-header-afp-16863345663x2.jpg","source_id":"news18","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Marnus Labuschagne घोड़े बेचकर सो रहे थे, मोहम्मद सिराज ने नींद में डाली खलल, मजबूरी में बैटिंग करने आना पड़ा","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/cricket-news/marnus-labuschagne-caught-sleeping-with-pads-on-wtc-final-day-3-watch-video/articleshow/100883840.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WTC Final: अजिंक्य रहाणे और शार्दुल ठाकुर की अर्धशतकीय पारियों और दोनों के बीच सातवें विकेट के लिए 109 रन की साझेदारी से भारत विश्व टेस्ट चैम्पियनशिप फाइनल के तीसरे दिन शुक्रवार को कुछ हद तक वापसी करने में सफल रहा।","content":"ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने भारत के खिलाफ विश्व टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप (डब्ल्यूटीसी) के फाइनल के तीसरे दिन अपनी दूसरी पारी में पहली पारी में चार विकेट पर 123 रन बनाए। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने पहली पारी में 469 रन बनाए, जिसके जवाब में भारत की पारी 296 रन पर सिमटी। दिन का खेल खत्म होने पर मार्नस लाबुशेन 41 और कैमरन ग्रीन सात रन बनाकर खेल खेल रहे थे। ऑस्ट्रेलिया अब भारत से 296 रन से आगे है। ऑस्ट्रेलिया की दूसरी पारी के दौरान एक मजेदार घटना देखने को मिली, जब मार्नस लाबुशेन घोड़े बेचकर सो रहे थे, तभी पहला विकेट गिरने के बाद उन्हें हड़बड़ाकर उठते देखा गया। दिलचस्प वीडियो इंटरनेट पर वायरल है। दरअसल, भारत को 296 रन पर ऑलआउट करने के बाद ऑस्ट्रेलिया को 173 रन की लीड मिली। दूसरी पारी में उस्मान ख्वाजा और डेविड वार्नर एकबार फिर मोर्चा संभालने क्रीज पर उतरे। मार्नस लाबुशेन तीसरे नंबर पर अपनी बारी का इंतजार कर रहे थे। वह पैडअप होकर ड्रेसिंग रूम की बालकनी में बैठे-बैठे ही सो गए। कैमरामैन ने उन पर फोकर किया। कमेंट्री बॉक्स में बैठे सौरव गांगुली और हरभजन सिंह लाबुशेन की नींद पर ही बात कर रहे थे, तभी वार्नर को सिराज ने निपटा दिया। वार्नर के आउट होते ही लाबुशेन हड़बड़ी में उठे और फिर मैदान के भीतर गए। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने दूसरी पारी में चार विकेट पर 120 रन बनाकर अपनी स्थिति काफी मजबूत कर ली। भारत को मैच में बने रहने के लिए ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बाकी बचे छह विकेट जल्दी चटकाने होंगे और फिर बल्लेबाजों से प्रभावी प्रदर्शन की उम्मीद करनी होगी। इससे पहले रहाणे ने अपनी 129 गेंद की शानदार पारी में 11 चौके और एक छक्का लगाया तो वहीं शारदुल 109 गेंद की पारी में छह चौके जड़े। ओवल मैदान पर शारदुल ने अपनी तीसरी पारी में तीसरा अर्धशतक लगाया। भारतीय गेंदबाजों ने दूसरी पारी में शानदार गेंदबाजी की। मोहम्मद सिराज (41 रन पर एक विकेट) ने दूसरी पारी के चौथे ओवर में डेविड वॉर्नर (एक रन) को चलता करने के बाद दो बार लाबुशेन को छकाया। दोनों बार गेंद लाबुशेन के शरीर पर लगी। उमेश यादव (21 रन पर एक विकेट) ने उस्मान ख्वाजा की 13 रन की पारी को विकेट के पीछे भरत के हाथों कैच कराकर खत्म किया। स्मिथ बड़ा शॉट खेलने के चक्कर में गच्चा गए और शार्दुल ने जडेजा की बॉल पर कैच पकड़ने में कोई गलती नहीं की।","pubDate":"2023-06-09 18:07:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"WTC Final: रोहित शर्मा की अगले 2 दिन बढ़ेगी टेंशन, बारिश फाइनल में डालेगी खलल, देखें कैसा रहेगा मौसम का हाल?","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/news/sports/cricket-wtc-final-2023-london-weather-update-4th-and-5th-day-india-vs-australia-the-oval-6471341.html","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WTC Final 2023 Weather Forecast : वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल के शुरुआती 3 दिन टीम इंडिया के लिए उतार-चढ़ाव भरे रहे हैं. अब अगले दो दिन रोहित ब्रिगेड को डबल जोर लगाने की जरूरत है. टीम इंडिया के लिए 10 और 11 जून को बारिश बड़ी मुसीबत बनकर सामने आ सकती है.","content":"वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल के आखिरी दो दिन रोहित शर्मा की टेंशन बढ़ सकती है.

The first half of Day 3, saw impressive contributions from Ajinkya Rahane (89) and Shardul Thakur (51) to help India reach a total of 296 in their first innings, avoiding the follow-on after lunch on day three but handing Australia a 173-run lead going into their second dig. Thakur scored three half-centuries in three innings at The Oval before leaving for a lively 51. The all-rounder’s century puts him in exclusive company as one of only three players in the game’s history to record three successive 50-plus scores at the south London venue. “Well, cricket is a funny game. You can never say what is the right total and this one-off game, especially ICC finals, you never know, I mean, who can handle the pressure better out there, one good partnership when you can even chase down 450 or maybe more than that,” Shardul Thakur said in a post-match press conference. “Last year England chased 400 here and they did not lose too many wickets. So that’s a positive sign for us. Whatever they put up on the board, it’s too early to make any predictions. We see a lot of times in Test cricket that game changes within an hour. So yes, we like to be optimistic tomorrow going on the field. And yeah, we’ll take it on from there,” Shardul added. At the beginning of the day, Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur’s partnership laid the groundwork for India to fight back after having their backs against the wall for the better part of two days. When asked why Ajinkya Rahane did not field after reaching 89, Thakur revealed that he got hit on the finger while batting, but that it doesn’t appear that awful. “Rahane got hurt in his finger and he is getting it treated. It does not look too bad and he will certainly come out to bat. We just spoke to each other and Rahane guided me well as we were also the last recognized pair. Ajinkya Rahane has performed well for India on many occasions. He has struck many tons and has been involved in big partnerships. He has performed in England, Australia and South Africa. He has got experience,” the India all-rounder added. Thakur described the wicket as “underprepared”. “There is an area where the ball is lifting up. There is a crack over there. You have to be careful and watchful. If it bounces then good luck to the batter. Ball was doing a bit. The pitch was under-prepared as the ball was bouncing as well as keeping low. Travis Head came and swung his bat and got some quick runs. Maybe we could have bowled some more bouncers to him,” Thakur said. Coming to the match, Australia lead the ICC World Test Championship Final by 296 runs going into day four, but counterattacking half-centuries from Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur were followed by a superb bowling performance to give India a glimmer of hope after a thrilling day’s play. Australia closed the day at 123/4 in 44 overs, with Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green unbeaten at 41(118)* and 7(27)* respectively.

Rahane, who made a memorable 89 in his comeback Test after 18 months, hoped that the finger injury he sustained on Thursday would not affect his batting in the second innings. \"Don't think it will affect [my] batting [in India's second innings],\" Rahane told the broadcaster at the end of the third day's play. Rahane faced 129 balls and struck 11 fours and a six during his stay in the middle. His 109-run partnership for the seventh wicket with Shardul Thakur (51 off 109) kept India in the game but Australia still managed to take a massive 173-run first-innings lead. At stumps, Australia extended their lead to 296 runs by reaching 123 for four in 44 overs in their second innings. \"Happy with the way I batted. Had a good today. We were looking to get 320-330 but overall we had a good day. Bowling wise we bowled well. Everyone chipped in.\" Referring to Cameron Green's incredible catch to dismiss him, Rahane said, \"That was a really good catch. We all know he's a really good fielder. Has a big reach.\" He had no qualms in admitting that Australia have their nose ahead. \"Australia slightly ahead in the game. For us it's important to be in the moment, play session by session. First one hour will be crucial tomorrow. We know funny things can happen. Jadeja bowled really well, footmarks helped him against the left-hander. Still feel wicket will help seam bowlers,\" Rahane said. Rahane was struck on his right hand's index finger off a Pat Cummins bouncer on the second day of the match. He immediately felt pain and called on the physio for treatment. Thakur also said Rahane will \"definitely bat\" in the second innings. \"He [Rahane] got a bad blow on his finger. It does not look too bad, it is being assessed. He did not go out in the field as it would have been risky and he had already fractured the same finger previously.

With every minute of resistance, the decibel level from the crowd increased. At the stroke of lunch, the loudest roar came when Pat Cummins kicked the ball. Cummins was understandably angry, having been called for a no-ball when he had Shardul trapped plumb in front. The Indian flag filled the stands, as the 25,170-strong crowd took delight in Australia’s agony. The atmosphere at The Oval was electric, in stark contrast to the sullen faces at the start of play. Rahane (89, 129b, 11x4, 1x6) and Shardul (51, 109b, 6x4) put on 109 runs for the seventh wicket, raising India’s hopes of salvaging an honourable draw. The duo’s heroics helped India avoid the follow-on and finish with 296. Australia moved to 123 for four at close, an overall lead of 296 runs. Cummins’ men continue to sit in the driver’s seat, but the Indians have shown the stomach for a fight. It was a memorable comeback for Rahane, who last played a Test around 18 months ago. He was all class, hitting shots all around the ground. He reached his fifty with a powerful hook shot off Cummins which sailed into the stands over fine-leg. When off-spinner Nathan Lyon was brought into the attack, Rahane came into his own. He cut the short balls, and strode well forward to punish anything full. The Mumbai batter made a strong case for cementing his spot in the eleven. Shardul was not as flamboyant with his strokeplay, but more than made up with grit. Shardul copped back-to-back blows to the arm, which only strengthened his resolve. The 31-year-old recorded his third consecutive Test fifty at this venue. Both Rahane and Shardul were lucky to benefit from a dropped catch each. Cameron Green, who had put one down earlier, pulled off a stunning one-handed grab at gully to end Rahane’s stay. The carnival ended for the spectators, who rose for one final applause as Rahane walked back. Green then scalped Shardul with a length delivery outside off which took the edge. Australia’s second essay started shakily, with David Warner snapped up by wicketkeeper K.S. Bharat off Mohammed Siraj in the fourth over. Usman Khawaja, out for a duck in the first innings, disappointed again. The southpaw flung his bat at a wide ball from Umesh and offered Bharat another catch. Steve Smith (34, 47b, 3x4) had a ‘brain fade’ moment when he charged at Ravindra Jadeja and attempted a wild slog. The shot, completely out of character for this batter of high pedigree, ballooned to Shardul at point. Travis Head took one chance too many. A heavy-handed drive gave Jadeja a simple return catch. Marnus Labuschagne (41 n.o., 118b, 4x4) held firm. He received a couple of snorters from Siraj, but with the use of soft hands, managed to drop the ball gently to the ground. There was a lesson here for Virat Kohli, who went hard at a rising delivery and spooned a catch to slip on Thursday. The fate of the match now depends on how the Indian batters fare. Rahane and Shardul have shown the way for the rest to follow.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 19:12:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Behind the scenes of Bazball, England’s Ashes game changer","link":"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/behind-the-scenes-of-bazball-england-s-ashes-game-changer-20230605-p5de2u.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Daniel Brettig and Tom Decent"],"video_url":null,"description":"It is the revolutionary method that has lifted England from 2021-22 Ashes flunks to genuine contenders.","content":"Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Success, as they say, has many fathers. In this case, England’s bold new approach to Test cricket was born out of some years of mediocrity and worse by the team then led by Joe Root, the appointment of Ben Stokes as captain, and the decision of England performance boss Rob Key to choose Brendon McCullum as Stokes’ coaching offsider. “Bazball”, the term first coined by ESPNcricinfo’s Andrew Miller, embodied the fact that England were playing with the sort of verve McCullum (whose middle name is Barry, hence the nickname “Baz”) demonstrated in his final years as an international cricketer. In 2016 McCullum had clubbed the fastest-ever Test hundred against Australia in Christchurch - and taken from the philosophy he articulated later that same year in his MCC Cowdrey Lecture at Lord’s . McCullum spoke of playing the game without fear or inhibition about the possible consequences of failure. That attitude had stemmed, he said, from the traumatic days after Phillip Hughes’ death in 2014, when New Zealand were in the middle of a Test match against Pakistan. “It was so strange, and yet it felt so right, that after Phil’s death we didn’t really care any more about the result,” McCullum had said. “Because nothing we could or couldn’t do on the field really mattered in comparison to what had happened to Phil. Our perspective changed completely for the rest of my time playing Test cricket for New Zealand, and we were a much better side as a result.” England are now playing with that very freedom, which brings us to another thread. In white-ball cricket, led by former captain Eoin Morgan, England had broken their self-imposed shackles as early as 2015, leading to a fearless ODI and Twenty20 combination that now hold the World Cups in both formats . A deep well of white-ball talent, particularly with the bat, was particularly open to trying that kind of approach in Tests. Essentially, Bazball is both. England are trying to win matches as quickly as possible, completely unconcerned by how it might look if that attempt goes wrong. James Anderson, England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, has had the best year of his life in Test cricket (45 wickets at 17.62). He’ll turn 41 during the fifth Ashes Test. He explained the combination of mindset and tactics at play: “When I came back into the team it was more about trying to push your boundaries as a player - go into practice thinking, ‘How far can I push myself?’. That’s been particularly evident in the batters, they’ve tried so many different things to really impose themselves on the opposition, and certainly for the young guys that freedom to go and express themselves has worked an absolute treat. “The same thing has happened with the bowlers. It’s only a slight shift, and it might sound strange, but they only want to think about taking 20 wickets. In the past, my job might have been, ‘Right let’s keep the run rate under 2.5 an over for the next hour’, so my job would then be not necessarily defensive, but I’d have a fairly orthodox field, I’d just try to be relentlessly accurate for a period of time. Now there isn’t that sort of feeling. “The run rate is irrelevant to Ben in particular. He’s like, ‘I don’t care how many runs you go for, I want 20 wickets as quickly as possible’. You’re constantly thinking as a bowler then, about ‘How am I taking my next wicket’. We’ve been setting, not necessarily strange fields, but fields we’ve not necessarily set in the past, or I certainly wouldn’t have, and looking for that attacking option.” England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow is a key figure in the Bazball revolution. Credit: Artwork: Matt Davidson All this is aided by another strand of the Bazball picture. In the Twenty20 age, so the thinking goes, the experience of Test cricket has to be fun for the players. One manifestation of this is the amount of golf they are playing. Another is the fact that England have created an environment in which there is far less trepidation - Moeen Ali’s acceptance of a call out of retirement, after struggling with the mental and physical weight of Test cricket before his 2021 exit , is the latest example. The most obvious manifestation of Bazball is in England’s phenomenally fast scoring over the past year - near enough to five runs an over when remarkably few teams over nearly 150 years of Test cricket have accumulated their runs at better than three an over. For example, the great West Indies side scored at 3.5 an over in 1984, its fastest year of scoring. In the early 2000s, Steve Waugh’s dominant Australians upped the tempo, but with far more orthodox methods than England have been using. They have been led by a combination of experience and youth. Jonny Bairstow was the initial flag bearer, peeling off a series of centuries in England last summer that demonstrated total commitment and clarity about going on the attack - regardless of whether opponents maintained a disciplined off stump line to him or not. Other younger men, notably Ben Duckett and Harry Brook, have followed suit with thrilling effect. In the case of Duckett, he is opening the batting in a way few have done before when watchfulness was an opener’s modus operandi. Duckett has let just eight of 605 balls through to the wicketkeeper since he was recalled to England’s Test team. It’s white ball batting against a red one. Jimmy Anderson is in career-best form at age 40. Credit: Artwork: Matt Davidson But the bowling, too, has been far more proactive. Stokes and his bowlers shuffle their fields, their lengths and plans constantly, tailoring things to opponents with rare agility in an era of pre-packaged plans concocted in between sessions with coaches. In doing so, England’s collective strike rate among bowlers has dropped from taking a wicket around every 60 balls to just over 51 balls - close to the mark set by the world leaders Australia and India. Opening batter Ben Duckett has let just eight of 605 balls through to the wicketkeeper since he was recalled to England’s Test team. Says Anderson: “An example of that is we’ll potentially keep four or five catchers in the slips and not have an extra cover, whereas in the past we’d be, ‘Oh we’ll put an extra cover in because it’s not doing too much, to keep the runs down a little bit’. Ben would much rather extra catchers than worrying too much about the odd four here and there. It’s amazing how we’ve changed the mindset to try to be a little bit more attacking, the economy rate has actually stayed at a reasonable level.” Put simply, England’s Bazballers are more focused on taking 20 wickets as quickly as possible than they are with saving runs, as the table below shows. Short answer? Yes, thus far. Bazball started with some victories chasing hefty fourth innings totals on good batting tracks against New Zealand and India. But Stokes and McCullum recalibrated after their first defeat against South Africa to find success on far more lively surfaces against the Proteas, where the ball seamed and swung far more prominently. In Pakistan, without Bairstow at their disposal after he broke his leg on the golf course, England’s approach went into overdrive with even faster scoring devised to buy time to bowl the hosts out twice. In fact, England’s Bazballers have produced three of the top 10 fastest run rates for completed innings in Test history. And on pitches as dead as that prepared in Rawalpindi ( where Australia’s bowlers more or less raised the white flag earlier during a bore draw the same year ), Stokes’ cheeky plans and fields, including plenty of use of bouncers in the hope of drawing out the risky hook shot, had the Englishmen finding ways to take 20 wickets in the most inhospitable conditions possible. If there was any kind of indicator that Bazball might eventually run out of steam, it came in New Zealand on England’s most recent tour. After marching to victory in the first of two Tests, England were narrowly beaten in the second in Wellington after the Black Caps made the most of their accumulated knowledge to not be spooked by their proactive opposition. Instead, they made as many runs as possible, scoring at their own pace, and then put England under pressure to reach a target when time had begun to become a factor. Australia’s analysts will have taken note. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Australia’s Test team have gone through quite a few emotions upon finding their vanquished 2021-22 Ashes quarry had rejuvenated themselves. In Sri Lanka last year, there were a few sniggers and joking mentions of “Bazball” in the nets, before the term “Ronball” , a reference to head coach Andrew McDonald (aka, “Ronny”), was glimpsed on a piece of paper in the team viewing area during the Adelaide Test against the West Indies. Ahead of the England tour, numerous members of the Australian squad were quizzed on their thoughts about a year of Bazball. Steve Smith weighed in, too, after the Australians demolished India’s batting in English conditions in the first innings of the World Test Championship at the Oval , an immediate precursor to the Ashes. “I think it will be difficult on this kind of wicket that’s up and down and seaming around,” he said. “It’s not easy to defend, let alone come out and swing,” Smith said. For decades, it was customary for a bowler or wicketkeeper to be sent out late in a day’s play to protect the wicket of the next incoming specialist batter. But under Bazball, that nightwatchman role is turned on its head - Stuart Broad may be sent out with a licence to slog. The concept isn’t entirely new - in one-day games in the 1980s and 1990s, the likes of Craig McDermott and Shane Warne were sent out as a “pinch-hitter” to swing for the fences ahead of recognised batters. But it suits Broad, a provocative figure as far as Australia is concerned , down to the ground. “We are looking at every situation we are going to find ourselves in and what the positive thing to do is,” Stokes said last year. “For example, we renamed what the nightwatchman is all about. We called it Nighthawk. That was Broady. He was going out with half an hour left to play to try to literally slog. That’s where we are at the moment, it’s awesome.” If you ask Stokes, there will be no deviation whatsoever. He and McCullum are utterly committed to the new plan of attack, and to rein it in now would be to contradict the whole philosophy - after all, if you are all about ignoring the possible consequences of failure, it would be disingenuous to turn back in the midst of the biggest series of all. “We’ll keep doing the same things we’ve done,” Stokes told Sky commentator and former England captain Nasser Hussain recently . “There’s no point changing what we’ve done over the last year, just because we’re now coming into an Ashes series. “Every player knows the Ashes is where everything just ramps up a little bit. But we’ll keep sticking to what we do. Me and Baz have been around enough, our senior players have been around enough to understand that and make sure those little things don’t creep in. “I’m glad I’ve actually managed to captain 12 games before stepping into the Ashes as captain. I’ve got a lot of things to be able to look back on under pressure or different situations within games. But the Ashes is always something every English or Australian cricketer really looks forward to.” In other words, buckle up. Sports news, results and expert commentary.

World Cup-winning Australian captain Waugh’s assessment comes after the likes of Sourav Ganguly, Ricky Ponting and Sanjay Manjrekar expressed their surprise at the Indian team management’s decision to take to the field at The Oval without senior off-spinner Ashwin, currently the world’s number one bowler in Tests. Waugh recalled how Australia made a similar error in the fifth Test at The Oval in 2019, a match which England won by 145 runs after Tim Paine opted to bowl first. “We made the same blunder four years ago in the Ashes. The Oval is always tricky,” Waugh was quoted as saying by AAP. “It looks green on top but underneath it is crumbly and a bit dry. You can get lulled into the overcast sky and green pitch and think it is going to do everything. As soon as the sun comes out it is totally different and dries out quickly. “I do think (India) have picked the wrong side. Spin will play a big part in this Test match and it is going to be up and down.” Waugh added that he would picked Ashwin for his batting, let alone his bowling. “I would have picked Ashwin for his batting, let alone his bowling. That is why I can’t believe he isn’t playing because he has got five Test centuries as well. It is very strange.” India’s leading wicket-taker in the 2021-2023 WTC cycle, Ashwin lost out to Ravindra Jadeja, who is playing as the only spinner in the team. The Indian team said Ashwin was not considered for selection in the playing XI owing to the conditions at the Oval. Batting first, Australia put up 469 after centuries by Steve Smith and Travis Head and then had India in trouble at 151 for five at stumps on the second day. Ashwin has 474 Test wickets and could have asked some probing questions to the Australian batters, especially the left-handers, with his variations on a pitch that was also offering variable bounce.

Australia closed the day at 123/4 in 44 overs, with Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green unbeaten at 41(118)* and 7(27)* respectively. At the beginning of the day, Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur’s partnership laid the groundwork for the Indians to fight back after having their backs against the wall for the better part of two days. Speedster Umesh Yadav set the tone for the Indians quite early in the third session, as he dismissed Usman Khawaja cheaply (13 off 39 balls). The left-hander knicked a wide delivered wide outside off-stump and KS Bharat dived low to take a fine catch. Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith once again settled Australian nerves, as they kept the scoreboard ticking over. But India managed to find a breakthrough after 16 overs, with the centurion from the first innings failing to make his mark this time. Brought into the attack, left-armer Jadeja sent back the former Australia skipper for the eighth time in his career. Jadeja brought his experience to the fore yet again as he dismissed another centurion from the first innings, Travis Head. In the first ball of the 37th over, Head was dropped by Umesh Yadav on the boundary line and the ball went for a six. On the second ball of that over, Head regained his composure and defended it for a dot ball. However, on the third ball, Jadeja dismissed Head after he lobbed a catch at him. This was the final Australian wicket to fall for the day as Cameron Green and Labuschagne survived the final ball. Before tea, Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur managed to reignite India’s hope of making a comeback in the WTC final, Australian bowlers once again showcased their prowess, with skipper Pat Cummins dismissing Rahane at the beginning of the second session. Rahane, who was in sight of what would have been a fine century on his return to the Indian red-ball team, fell for 89 (129). The right-hander, who had survived some close calls and anxious moments, eventually ran out of luck as Cameron Green took a stunning catch to send him back to the pavillion. Umesh tried to play a cameo but Cummins made short work of him. Yadav fell for a score of 5(11). Thakur soon followed Rahane back to the shed as in trying to clear the boundary, he edged to wicketkeeper Alex Carey behind the stumps. Thakur’s counter-attacking knock came to an end for 51(109). With Thakur gone, Shami went after the Australian pacers, striking two consecutive boundaries in the 67th over off Boland. His attacking knock was, however, short-lived as he was dismissed by the pacer for 13 (11). The fall of this wicket saw the Indians being rolled over for 296 in 69.4 overs, trailing Australia by 173 runs. The Australian left-handed opening duo of David Warner and Usman Khawaja stepped up to build on their 173-run advantage. However, the Aussies were rocked early as Siraj drew first blood, dismissing Warner for a score of 1(8). Marnus Labuschagne and Khwaja, however, survived the initial torrid spell, to take the Aussies to 23/1 in 11 overs. The Australians started the first session of Day 3 in the same way as they did on Day 2, with Boland getting a delivery to sneak past the defence of Indian wicketkeeper-batsman KS Bharat and striking timber. Bharat fell on the second ball of Day 3 at a score of 5 off 15 balls. The strapping right-armer got a good-length delivery to tailback sharply at Bharat, dislodging his off peg. After the fall of Bharat’s wicket, Rahane and Thakur went about rebuilding the Indian innings. Rahane brought up his 26th Test half-century, under tough and testing circumstances, in the 47th over. Thakur, who has played enterprising knocks for his country in the red-ball format, fought fire with fire as the Aussies threw everything at him. However, the cricketing gods seemed to be smiling on him, as he survived some anxious moments. In the final over of the first session, Shardul was adjudged LBW to skipper Cummins. However, even as the onfield decision was sent to the third umpire for review, Cummins was found to have stepped over the blowing mark. The ball was eventually adjudged a no-ball. In the next over, bowled by Mitchell Starc, Shardul knocked a delivery. which fell marginally short of Australian wicketkeeper Alex Carey. Even Rahane had his share of good fortune during the first session as he survived a strong LBW shout in the 49th over, which was turned down by the on-field umpire but was sent up to the third umpire for a referral. He edged the next delivery but it flew over the first slip and raced to the fence. On the third ball, he stroked a delightful drive to bring up two consecutive boundaries. In the final overs of the first session, he tried to play a drive but ended up edging to the first slip. However, the catch fell short of David Warner, who was standing in the first slip. At the close of play in the first session, India was still trailing the Australians by 209 runs. Brief scores: Australia 123/4 (Marnus Labuschagne 41(118)*, Steve smith 34(47) and Ravindra Jadeja 2/25) vs India.

The findings of the study, conducted by the University of Nottingham, support previous research that former footballers may be at higher risk of neurocognitive disease. The new report states that 2.8 percent of retired professional footballers in their study reported medically diagnosed dementia and other neurodegenerative disease compared to 0.9 percent of the general population. Dr Charlotte Cowie, the FA’s head of medicine, said: “The FOCUS study worked with an established group of former professional footballers that were participating in research and was able to review their brain health, and it supports the previous findings in the FIELD study which suggest an increased risk for neurodegenerative disease in former professional footballers than in the general population. “This is an extremely complex area of our game, but we are committed to working collectively with our stakeholders to help grow our knowledge in this area through further medical and expert analysis.\" The Football Association has been criticised by campaigners for not doing enough to aid former players now suffering from neurocognitive disease. But it said it had introduced “industry-leading\" concussion guidelines which has restricted heading practice in training and banned deliberate headers from under-12s level. “The FA has led the way in taking steps to help reduce potential risk factors within the game (including) establishing industry-leading concussion guidelines,\" the FA said in a statement. Awareness about concussion in sport has grown since America’s National Football League agreed to a $1 billion settlement in 2015 to resolve thousands of lawsuits by former players suffering from neurological problems. This has prompted a number of sports around the world, including football, rugby union, rugby league and cricket, to strengthen their concussion protocols.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 18:18:08","image_url":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/06/football-players-header-afp-16863345663x2.jpg","source_id":"news18","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Marnus Labuschagne घोड़े बेचकर सो रहे थे, मोहम्मद सिराज ने नींद में डाली खलल, मजबूरी में बैटिंग करने आना पड़ा","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/cricket-news/marnus-labuschagne-caught-sleeping-with-pads-on-wtc-final-day-3-watch-video/articleshow/100883840.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WTC Final: अजिंक्य रहाणे और शार्दुल ठाकुर की अर्धशतकीय पारियों और दोनों के बीच सातवें विकेट के लिए 109 रन की साझेदारी से भारत विश्व टेस्ट चैम्पियनशिप फाइनल के तीसरे दिन शुक्रवार को कुछ हद तक वापसी करने में सफल रहा।","content":"ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने भारत के खिलाफ विश्व टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप (डब्ल्यूटीसी) के फाइनल के तीसरे दिन अपनी दूसरी पारी में पहली पारी में चार विकेट पर 123 रन बनाए। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने पहली पारी में 469 रन बनाए, जिसके जवाब में भारत की पारी 296 रन पर सिमटी। दिन का खेल खत्म होने पर मार्नस लाबुशेन 41 और कैमरन ग्रीन सात रन बनाकर खेल खेल रहे थे। ऑस्ट्रेलिया अब भारत से 296 रन से आगे है। ऑस्ट्रेलिया की दूसरी पारी के दौरान एक मजेदार घटना देखने को मिली, जब मार्नस लाबुशेन घोड़े बेचकर सो रहे थे, तभी पहला विकेट गिरने के बाद उन्हें हड़बड़ाकर उठते देखा गया। दिलचस्प वीडियो इंटरनेट पर वायरल है। दरअसल, भारत को 296 रन पर ऑलआउट करने के बाद ऑस्ट्रेलिया को 173 रन की लीड मिली। दूसरी पारी में उस्मान ख्वाजा और डेविड वार्नर एकबार फिर मोर्चा संभालने क्रीज पर उतरे। मार्नस लाबुशेन तीसरे नंबर पर अपनी बारी का इंतजार कर रहे थे। वह पैडअप होकर ड्रेसिंग रूम की बालकनी में बैठे-बैठे ही सो गए। कैमरामैन ने उन पर फोकर किया। कमेंट्री बॉक्स में बैठे सौरव गांगुली और हरभजन सिंह लाबुशेन की नींद पर ही बात कर रहे थे, तभी वार्नर को सिराज ने निपटा दिया। वार्नर के आउट होते ही लाबुशेन हड़बड़ी में उठे और फिर मैदान के भीतर गए। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने दूसरी पारी में चार विकेट पर 120 रन बनाकर अपनी स्थिति काफी मजबूत कर ली। भारत को मैच में बने रहने के लिए ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बाकी बचे छह विकेट जल्दी चटकाने होंगे और फिर बल्लेबाजों से प्रभावी प्रदर्शन की उम्मीद करनी होगी। इससे पहले रहाणे ने अपनी 129 गेंद की शानदार पारी में 11 चौके और एक छक्का लगाया तो वहीं शारदुल 109 गेंद की पारी में छह चौके जड़े। ओवल मैदान पर शारदुल ने अपनी तीसरी पारी में तीसरा अर्धशतक लगाया। भारतीय गेंदबाजों ने दूसरी पारी में शानदार गेंदबाजी की। मोहम्मद सिराज (41 रन पर एक विकेट) ने दूसरी पारी के चौथे ओवर में डेविड वॉर्नर (एक रन) को चलता करने के बाद दो बार लाबुशेन को छकाया। दोनों बार गेंद लाबुशेन के शरीर पर लगी। उमेश यादव (21 रन पर एक विकेट) ने उस्मान ख्वाजा की 13 रन की पारी को विकेट के पीछे भरत के हाथों कैच कराकर खत्म किया। स्मिथ बड़ा शॉट खेलने के चक्कर में गच्चा गए और शार्दुल ने जडेजा की बॉल पर कैच पकड़ने में कोई गलती नहीं की।","pubDate":"2023-06-09 18:07:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"WTC Final: रोहित शर्मा की अगले 2 दिन बढ़ेगी टेंशन, बारिश फाइनल में डालेगी खलल, देखें कैसा रहेगा मौसम का हाल?","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/news/sports/cricket-wtc-final-2023-london-weather-update-4th-and-5th-day-india-vs-australia-the-oval-6471341.html","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WTC Final 2023 Weather Forecast : वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल के शुरुआती 3 दिन टीम इंडिया के लिए उतार-चढ़ाव भरे रहे हैं. अब अगले दो दिन रोहित ब्रिगेड को डबल जोर लगाने की जरूरत है. टीम इंडिया के लिए 10 और 11 जून को बारिश बड़ी मुसीबत बनकर सामने आ सकती है.","content":"वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल के आखिरी दो दिन रोहित शर्मा की टेंशन बढ़ सकती है.

The first half of Day 3, saw impressive contributions from Ajinkya Rahane (89) and Shardul Thakur (51) to help India reach a total of 296 in their first innings, avoiding the follow-on after lunch on day three but handing Australia a 173-run lead going into their second dig. Thakur scored three half-centuries in three innings at The Oval before leaving for a lively 51. The all-rounder’s century puts him in exclusive company as one of only three players in the game’s history to record three successive 50-plus scores at the south London venue. “Well, cricket is a funny game. You can never say what is the right total and this one-off game, especially ICC finals, you never know, I mean, who can handle the pressure better out there, one good partnership when you can even chase down 450 or maybe more than that,” Shardul Thakur said in a post-match press conference. “Last year England chased 400 here and they did not lose too many wickets. So that’s a positive sign for us. Whatever they put up on the board, it’s too early to make any predictions. We see a lot of times in Test cricket that game changes within an hour. So yes, we like to be optimistic tomorrow going on the field. And yeah, we’ll take it on from there,” Shardul added. At the beginning of the day, Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur’s partnership laid the groundwork for India to fight back after having their backs against the wall for the better part of two days. When asked why Ajinkya Rahane did not field after reaching 89, Thakur revealed that he got hit on the finger while batting, but that it doesn’t appear that awful. “Rahane got hurt in his finger and he is getting it treated. It does not look too bad and he will certainly come out to bat. We just spoke to each other and Rahane guided me well as we were also the last recognized pair. Ajinkya Rahane has performed well for India on many occasions. He has struck many tons and has been involved in big partnerships. He has performed in England, Australia and South Africa. He has got experience,” the India all-rounder added. Thakur described the wicket as “underprepared”. “There is an area where the ball is lifting up. There is a crack over there. You have to be careful and watchful. If it bounces then good luck to the batter. Ball was doing a bit. The pitch was under-prepared as the ball was bouncing as well as keeping low. Travis Head came and swung his bat and got some quick runs. Maybe we could have bowled some more bouncers to him,” Thakur said. Coming to the match, Australia lead the ICC World Test Championship Final by 296 runs going into day four, but counterattacking half-centuries from Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur were followed by a superb bowling performance to give India a glimmer of hope after a thrilling day’s play. Australia closed the day at 123/4 in 44 overs, with Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green unbeaten at 41(118)* and 7(27)* respectively.

Rahane faced 129 balls and struck 11 fours and a six during his stay in the middle. His 109-run partnership for the seventh wicket with Shardul Thakur (51 off 109) kept India in the game but Australia still managed to take a massive 173-run first-innings lead. At stumps, Australia extended their lead to 296 runs by reaching 123 for four in 44 overs in their second innings. \"Happy with the way I batted. Had a good today. We were looking to get 320-330 but overall we had a good day. Bowling wise we bowled well. Everyone chipped in.\" Referring to Cameron Green's incredible catch to dismiss him, Rahane said, \"That was a really good catch. We all know he's a really good fielder. Has a big reach.\" He had no qualms in admitting that Australia have their nose ahead. \"Australia slightly ahead in the game. For us it's important to be in the moment, play session by session. First one hour will be crucial tomorrow. We know funny things can happen. Jadeja bowled really well, footmarks helped him against the left-hander. Still feel wicket will help seam bowlers,\" Rahane said. Rahane was struck on his right hand's index finger off a Pat Cummins bouncer on the second day of the match. He immediately felt pain and called on the physio for treatment. Thakur also said Rahane will \"definitely bat\" in the second innings. \"He [Rahane] got a bad blow on his finger. It does not look too bad, it is being assessed. He did not go out in the field as it would have been risky and he had already fractured the same finger previously. He will definitely bat.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-09 19:25:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WTC Final 2023: Rahane, Shardul help India live to fight another day","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wtc-final-2023-rahane-shardul-help-india-live-to-fight-another-day/article66952007.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The duo’s heroics not only enable the team avoid the follow-on, but also raise hopes of salvaging an honourable draw; Australia finishes the third day on 123 for four for an overall lead of 296","content":"The Indians were expected to capitulate without a fight, but Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur had other ideas. With every minute of resistance, the decibel level from the crowd increased. At the stroke of lunch, the loudest roar came when Pat Cummins kicked the ball. Cummins was understandably angry, having been called for a no-ball when he had Shardul trapped plumb in front. The Indian flag filled the stands, as the 25,170-strong crowd took delight in Australia’s agony. The atmosphere at The Oval was electric, in stark contrast to the sullen faces at the start of play. Rahane (89, 129b, 11x4, 1x6) and Shardul (51, 109b, 6x4) put on 109 runs for the seventh wicket, raising India’s hopes of salvaging an honourable draw. The duo’s heroics helped India avoid the follow-on and finish with 296. Australia moved to 123 for four at close, an overall lead of 296 runs. Cummins’ men continue to sit in the driver’s seat, but the Indians have shown the stomach for a fight. It was a memorable comeback for Rahane, who last played a Test around 18 months ago. He was all class, hitting shots all around the ground. He reached his fifty with a powerful hook shot off Cummins which sailed into the stands over fine-leg. When off-spinner Nathan Lyon was brought into the attack, Rahane came into his own. He cut the short balls, and strode well forward to punish anything full. The Mumbai batter made a strong case for cementing his spot in the eleven. Shardul was not as flamboyant with his strokeplay, but more than made up with grit. Shardul copped back-to-back blows to the arm, which only strengthened his resolve. The 31-year-old recorded his third consecutive Test fifty at this venue. Both Rahane and Shardul were lucky to benefit from a dropped catch each. Cameron Green, who had put one down earlier, pulled off a stunning one-handed grab at gully to end Rahane’s stay. The carnival ended for the spectators, who rose for one final applause as Rahane walked back. Green then scalped Shardul with a length delivery outside off which took the edge. Australia’s second essay started shakily, with David Warner snapped up by wicketkeeper K.S. Bharat off Mohammed Siraj in the fourth over. Usman Khawaja, out for a duck in the first innings, disappointed again. The southpaw flung his bat at a wide ball from Umesh and offered Bharat another catch. Steve Smith (34, 47b, 3x4) had a ‘brain fade’ moment when he charged at Ravindra Jadeja and attempted a wild slog. The shot, completely out of character for this batter of high pedigree, ballooned to Shardul at point. Travis Head took one chance too many. A heavy-handed drive gave Jadeja a simple return catch. Marnus Labuschagne (41 n.o., 118b, 4x4) held firm. He received a couple of snorters from Siraj, but with the use of soft hands, managed to drop the ball gently to the ground. There was a lesson here for Virat Kohli, who went hard at a rising delivery and spooned a catch to slip on Thursday. The fate of the match now depends on how the Indian batters fare. Rahane and Shardul have shown the way for the rest to follow.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 19:12:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Behind the scenes of Bazball, England’s Ashes game changer","link":"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/behind-the-scenes-of-bazball-england-s-ashes-game-changer-20230605-p5de2u.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Daniel Brettig and Tom Decent"],"video_url":null,"description":"It is the revolutionary method that has lifted England from 2021-22 Ashes flunks to genuine contenders.","content":"Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Success, as they say, has many fathers. In this case, England’s bold new approach to Test cricket was born out of some years of mediocrity and worse by the team then led by Joe Root, the appointment of Ben Stokes as captain, and the decision of England performance boss Rob Key to choose Brendon McCullum as Stokes’ coaching offsider. “Bazball”, the term first coined by ESPNcricinfo’s Andrew Miller, embodied the fact that England were playing with the sort of verve McCullum (whose middle name is Barry, hence the nickname “Baz”) demonstrated in his final years as an international cricketer. In 2016 McCullum had clubbed the fastest-ever Test hundred against Australia in Christchurch - and taken from the philosophy he articulated later that same year in his MCC Cowdrey Lecture at Lord’s . McCullum spoke of playing the game without fear or inhibition about the possible consequences of failure. That attitude had stemmed, he said, from the traumatic days after Phillip Hughes’ death in 2014, when New Zealand were in the middle of a Test match against Pakistan. “It was so strange, and yet it felt so right, that after Phil’s death we didn’t really care any more about the result,” McCullum had said. “Because nothing we could or couldn’t do on the field really mattered in comparison to what had happened to Phil. Our perspective changed completely for the rest of my time playing Test cricket for New Zealand, and we were a much better side as a result.” England are now playing with that very freedom, which brings us to another thread. In white-ball cricket, led by former captain Eoin Morgan, England had broken their self-imposed shackles as early as 2015, leading to a fearless ODI and Twenty20 combination that now hold the World Cups in both formats . A deep well of white-ball talent, particularly with the bat, was particularly open to trying that kind of approach in Tests. Essentially, Bazball is both. England are trying to win matches as quickly as possible, completely unconcerned by how it might look if that attempt goes wrong. James Anderson, England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, has had the best year of his life in Test cricket (45 wickets at 17.62). He’ll turn 41 during the fifth Ashes Test. He explained the combination of mindset and tactics at play: “When I came back into the team it was more about trying to push your boundaries as a player - go into practice thinking, ‘How far can I push myself?’. That’s been particularly evident in the batters, they’ve tried so many different things to really impose themselves on the opposition, and certainly for the young guys that freedom to go and express themselves has worked an absolute treat. “The same thing has happened with the bowlers. It’s only a slight shift, and it might sound strange, but they only want to think about taking 20 wickets. In the past, my job might have been, ‘Right let’s keep the run rate under 2.5 an over for the next hour’, so my job would then be not necessarily defensive, but I’d have a fairly orthodox field, I’d just try to be relentlessly accurate for a period of time. Now there isn’t that sort of feeling. “The run rate is irrelevant to Ben in particular. He’s like, ‘I don’t care how many runs you go for, I want 20 wickets as quickly as possible’. You’re constantly thinking as a bowler then, about ‘How am I taking my next wicket’. We’ve been setting, not necessarily strange fields, but fields we’ve not necessarily set in the past, or I certainly wouldn’t have, and looking for that attacking option.” England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow is a key figure in the Bazball revolution. Credit: Artwork: Matt Davidson All this is aided by another strand of the Bazball picture. In the Twenty20 age, so the thinking goes, the experience of Test cricket has to be fun for the players. One manifestation of this is the amount of golf they are playing. Another is the fact that England have created an environment in which there is far less trepidation - Moeen Ali’s acceptance of a call out of retirement, after struggling with the mental and physical weight of Test cricket before his 2021 exit , is the latest example. The most obvious manifestation of Bazball is in England’s phenomenally fast scoring over the past year - near enough to five runs an over when remarkably few teams over nearly 150 years of Test cricket have accumulated their runs at better than three an over. For example, the great West Indies side scored at 3.5 an over in 1984, its fastest year of scoring. In the early 2000s, Steve Waugh’s dominant Australians upped the tempo, but with far more orthodox methods than England have been using. They have been led by a combination of experience and youth. Jonny Bairstow was the initial flag bearer, peeling off a series of centuries in England last summer that demonstrated total commitment and clarity about going on the attack - regardless of whether opponents maintained a disciplined off stump line to him or not. Other younger men, notably Ben Duckett and Harry Brook, have followed suit with thrilling effect. In the case of Duckett, he is opening the batting in a way few have done before when watchfulness was an opener’s modus operandi. Duckett has let just eight of 605 balls through to the wicketkeeper since he was recalled to England’s Test team. It’s white ball batting against a red one. Jimmy Anderson is in career-best form at age 40. Credit: Artwork: Matt Davidson But the bowling, too, has been far more proactive. Stokes and his bowlers shuffle their fields, their lengths and plans constantly, tailoring things to opponents with rare agility in an era of pre-packaged plans concocted in between sessions with coaches. In doing so, England’s collective strike rate among bowlers has dropped from taking a wicket around every 60 balls to just over 51 balls - close to the mark set by the world leaders Australia and India. Opening batter Ben Duckett has let just eight of 605 balls through to the wicketkeeper since he was recalled to England’s Test team. Says Anderson: “An example of that is we’ll potentially keep four or five catchers in the slips and not have an extra cover, whereas in the past we’d be, ‘Oh we’ll put an extra cover in because it’s not doing too much, to keep the runs down a little bit’. Ben would much rather extra catchers than worrying too much about the odd four here and there. It’s amazing how we’ve changed the mindset to try to be a little bit more attacking, the economy rate has actually stayed at a reasonable level.” Put simply, England’s Bazballers are more focused on taking 20 wickets as quickly as possible than they are with saving runs, as the table below shows. Short answer? Yes, thus far. Bazball started with some victories chasing hefty fourth innings totals on good batting tracks against New Zealand and India. But Stokes and McCullum recalibrated after their first defeat against South Africa to find success on far more lively surfaces against the Proteas, where the ball seamed and swung far more prominently. In Pakistan, without Bairstow at their disposal after he broke his leg on the golf course, England’s approach went into overdrive with even faster scoring devised to buy time to bowl the hosts out twice. In fact, England’s Bazballers have produced three of the top 10 fastest run rates for completed innings in Test history. And on pitches as dead as that prepared in Rawalpindi ( where Australia’s bowlers more or less raised the white flag earlier during a bore draw the same year ), Stokes’ cheeky plans and fields, including plenty of use of bouncers in the hope of drawing out the risky hook shot, had the Englishmen finding ways to take 20 wickets in the most inhospitable conditions possible. If there was any kind of indicator that Bazball might eventually run out of steam, it came in New Zealand on England’s most recent tour. After marching to victory in the first of two Tests, England were narrowly beaten in the second in Wellington after the Black Caps made the most of their accumulated knowledge to not be spooked by their proactive opposition. Instead, they made as many runs as possible, scoring at their own pace, and then put England under pressure to reach a target when time had begun to become a factor. Australia’s analysts will have taken note. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Australia’s Test team have gone through quite a few emotions upon finding their vanquished 2021-22 Ashes quarry had rejuvenated themselves. In Sri Lanka last year, there were a few sniggers and joking mentions of “Bazball” in the nets, before the term “Ronball” , a reference to head coach Andrew McDonald (aka, “Ronny”), was glimpsed on a piece of paper in the team viewing area during the Adelaide Test against the West Indies. Ahead of the England tour, numerous members of the Australian squad were quizzed on their thoughts about a year of Bazball. Steve Smith weighed in, too, after the Australians demolished India’s batting in English conditions in the first innings of the World Test Championship at the Oval , an immediate precursor to the Ashes. “I think it will be difficult on this kind of wicket that’s up and down and seaming around,” he said. “It’s not easy to defend, let alone come out and swing,” Smith said. For decades, it was customary for a bowler or wicketkeeper to be sent out late in a day’s play to protect the wicket of the next incoming specialist batter. But under Bazball, that nightwatchman role is turned on its head - Stuart Broad may be sent out with a licence to slog. The concept isn’t entirely new - in one-day games in the 1980s and 1990s, the likes of Craig McDermott and Shane Warne were sent out as a “pinch-hitter” to swing for the fences ahead of recognised batters. But it suits Broad, a provocative figure as far as Australia is concerned , down to the ground. “We are looking at every situation we are going to find ourselves in and what the positive thing to do is,” Stokes said last year. “For example, we renamed what the nightwatchman is all about. We called it Nighthawk. That was Broady. He was going out with half an hour left to play to try to literally slog. That’s where we are at the moment, it’s awesome.” If you ask Stokes, there will be no deviation whatsoever. He and McCullum are utterly committed to the new plan of attack, and to rein it in now would be to contradict the whole philosophy - after all, if you are all about ignoring the possible consequences of failure, it would be disingenuous to turn back in the midst of the biggest series of all. “We’ll keep doing the same things we’ve done,” Stokes told Sky commentator and former England captain Nasser Hussain recently . “There’s no point changing what we’ve done over the last year, just because we’re now coming into an Ashes series. “Every player knows the Ashes is where everything just ramps up a little bit. But we’ll keep sticking to what we do. Me and Baz have been around enough, our senior players have been around enough to understand that and make sure those little things don’t creep in. “I’m glad I’ve actually managed to captain 12 games before stepping into the Ashes as captain. I’ve got a lot of things to be able to look back on under pressure or different situations within games. But the Ashes is always something every English or Australian cricketer really looks forward to.” In other words, buckle up. Sports news, results and expert commentary.

World Cup-winning Australian captain Waugh’s assessment comes after the likes of Sourav Ganguly, Ricky Ponting and Sanjay Manjrekar expressed their surprise at the Indian team management’s decision to take to the field at The Oval without senior off-spinner Ashwin, currently the world’s number one bowler in Tests. Waugh recalled how Australia made a similar error in the fifth Test at The Oval in 2019, a match which England won by 145 runs after Tim Paine opted to bowl first. “We made the same blunder four years ago in the Ashes. The Oval is always tricky,” Waugh was quoted as saying by AAP. “It looks green on top but underneath it is crumbly and a bit dry. You can get lulled into the overcast sky and green pitch and think it is going to do everything. As soon as the sun comes out it is totally different and dries out quickly. “I do think (India) have picked the wrong side. Spin will play a big part in this Test match and it is going to be up and down.” Waugh added that he would picked Ashwin for his batting, let alone his bowling. “I would have picked Ashwin for his batting, let alone his bowling. That is why I can’t believe he isn’t playing because he has got five Test centuries as well. It is very strange.” India’s leading wicket-taker in the 2021-2023 WTC cycle, Ashwin lost out to Ravindra Jadeja, who is playing as the only spinner in the team. The Indian team said Ashwin was not considered for selection in the playing XI owing to the conditions at the Oval. Batting first, Australia put up 469 after centuries by Steve Smith and Travis Head and then had India in trouble at 151 for five at stumps on the second day. Ashwin has 474 Test wickets and could have asked some probing questions to the Australian batters, especially the left-handers, with his variations on a pitch that was also offering variable bounce.

Australia closed the day at 123/4 in 44 overs, with Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green unbeaten at 41(118)* and 7(27)* respectively. At the beginning of the day, Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur’s partnership laid the groundwork for the Indians to fight back after having their backs against the wall for the better part of two days. Speedster Umesh Yadav set the tone for the Indians quite early in the third session, as he dismissed Usman Khawaja cheaply (13 off 39 balls). The left-hander knicked a wide delivered wide outside off-stump and KS Bharat dived low to take a fine catch. Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith once again settled Australian nerves, as they kept the scoreboard ticking over. But India managed to find a breakthrough after 16 overs, with the centurion from the first innings failing to make his mark this time. Brought into the attack, left-armer Jadeja sent back the former Australia skipper for the eighth time in his career. Jadeja brought his experience to the fore yet again as he dismissed another centurion from the first innings, Travis Head. In the first ball of the 37th over, Head was dropped by Umesh Yadav on the boundary line and the ball went for a six. On the second ball of that over, Head regained his composure and defended it for a dot ball. However, on the third ball, Jadeja dismissed Head after he lobbed a catch at him. This was the final Australian wicket to fall for the day as Cameron Green and Labuschagne survived the final ball. Before tea, Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur managed to reignite India’s hope of making a comeback in the WTC final, Australian bowlers once again showcased their prowess, with skipper Pat Cummins dismissing Rahane at the beginning of the second session. Rahane, who was in sight of what would have been a fine century on his return to the Indian red-ball team, fell for 89 (129). The right-hander, who had survived some close calls and anxious moments, eventually ran out of luck as Cameron Green took a stunning catch to send him back to the pavillion. Umesh tried to play a cameo but Cummins made short work of him. Yadav fell for a score of 5(11). Thakur soon followed Rahane back to the shed as in trying to clear the boundary, he edged to wicketkeeper Alex Carey behind the stumps. Thakur’s counter-attacking knock came to an end for 51(109). With Thakur gone, Shami went after the Australian pacers, striking two consecutive boundaries in the 67th over off Boland. His attacking knock was, however, short-lived as he was dismissed by the pacer for 13 (11). The fall of this wicket saw the Indians being rolled over for 296 in 69.4 overs, trailing Australia by 173 runs. The Australian left-handed opening duo of David Warner and Usman Khawaja stepped up to build on their 173-run advantage. However, the Aussies were rocked early as Siraj drew first blood, dismissing Warner for a score of 1(8). Marnus Labuschagne and Khwaja, however, survived the initial torrid spell, to take the Aussies to 23/1 in 11 overs. The Australians started the first session of Day 3 in the same way as they did on Day 2, with Boland getting a delivery to sneak past the defence of Indian wicketkeeper-batsman KS Bharat and striking timber. Bharat fell on the second ball of Day 3 at a score of 5 off 15 balls. The strapping right-armer got a good-length delivery to tailback sharply at Bharat, dislodging his off peg. After the fall of Bharat’s wicket, Rahane and Thakur went about rebuilding the Indian innings. Rahane brought up his 26th Test half-century, under tough and testing circumstances, in the 47th over. Thakur, who has played enterprising knocks for his country in the red-ball format, fought fire with fire as the Aussies threw everything at him. However, the cricketing gods seemed to be smiling on him, as he survived some anxious moments. In the final over of the first session, Shardul was adjudged LBW to skipper Cummins. However, even as the onfield decision was sent to the third umpire for review, Cummins was found to have stepped over the blowing mark. The ball was eventually adjudged a no-ball. In the next over, bowled by Mitchell Starc, Shardul knocked a delivery. which fell marginally short of Australian wicketkeeper Alex Carey. Even Rahane had his share of good fortune during the first session as he survived a strong LBW shout in the 49th over, which was turned down by the on-field umpire but was sent up to the third umpire for a referral. He edged the next delivery but it flew over the first slip and raced to the fence. On the third ball, he stroked a delightful drive to bring up two consecutive boundaries. In the final overs of the first session, he tried to play a drive but ended up edging to the first slip. However, the catch fell short of David Warner, who was standing in the first slip. At the close of play in the first session, India was still trailing the Australians by 209 runs. Brief scores: Australia 123/4 (Marnus Labuschagne 41(118)*, Steve smith 34(47) and Ravindra Jadeja 2/25) vs India.

Dr Charlotte Cowie, the FA’s head of medicine, said: “The FOCUS study worked with an established group of former professional footballers that were participating in research and was able to review their brain health, and it supports the previous findings in the FIELD study which suggest an increased risk for neurodegenerative disease in former professional footballers than in the general population. “This is an extremely complex area of our game, but we are committed to working collectively with our stakeholders to help grow our knowledge in this area through further medical and expert analysis.\" The Football Association has been criticised by campaigners for not doing enough to aid former players now suffering from neurocognitive disease. But it said it had introduced “industry-leading\" concussion guidelines which has restricted heading practice in training and banned deliberate headers from under-12s level. “The FA has led the way in taking steps to help reduce potential risk factors within the game (including) establishing industry-leading concussion guidelines,\" the FA said in a statement. Awareness about concussion in sport has grown since America’s National Football League agreed to a $1 billion settlement in 2015 to resolve thousands of lawsuits by former players suffering from neurological problems. This has prompted a number of sports around the world, including football, rugby union, rugby league and cricket, to strengthen their concussion protocols.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 18:18:08","image_url":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/06/football-players-header-afp-16863345663x2.jpg","source_id":"news18","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Marnus Labuschagne घोड़े बेचकर सो रहे थे, मोहम्मद सिराज ने नींद में डाली खलल, मजबूरी में बैटिंग करने आना पड़ा","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/cricket-news/marnus-labuschagne-caught-sleeping-with-pads-on-wtc-final-day-3-watch-video/articleshow/100883840.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WTC Final: अजिंक्य रहाणे और शार्दुल ठाकुर की अर्धशतकीय पारियों और दोनों के बीच सातवें विकेट के लिए 109 रन की साझेदारी से भारत विश्व टेस्ट चैम्पियनशिप फाइनल के तीसरे दिन शुक्रवार को कुछ हद तक वापसी करने में सफल रहा।","content":"ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने भारत के खिलाफ विश्व टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप (डब्ल्यूटीसी) के फाइनल के तीसरे दिन अपनी दूसरी पारी में पहली पारी में चार विकेट पर 123 रन बनाए। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने पहली पारी में 469 रन बनाए, जिसके जवाब में भारत की पारी 296 रन पर सिमटी। दिन का खेल खत्म होने पर मार्नस लाबुशेन 41 और कैमरन ग्रीन सात रन बनाकर खेल खेल रहे थे। ऑस्ट्रेलिया अब भारत से 296 रन से आगे है। ऑस्ट्रेलिया की दूसरी पारी के दौरान एक मजेदार घटना देखने को मिली, जब मार्नस लाबुशेन घोड़े बेचकर सो रहे थे, तभी पहला विकेट गिरने के बाद उन्हें हड़बड़ाकर उठते देखा गया। दिलचस्प वीडियो इंटरनेट पर वायरल है। दरअसल, भारत को 296 रन पर ऑलआउट करने के बाद ऑस्ट्रेलिया को 173 रन की लीड मिली। दूसरी पारी में उस्मान ख्वाजा और डेविड वार्नर एकबार फिर मोर्चा संभालने क्रीज पर उतरे। मार्नस लाबुशेन तीसरे नंबर पर अपनी बारी का इंतजार कर रहे थे। वह पैडअप होकर ड्रेसिंग रूम की बालकनी में बैठे-बैठे ही सो गए। कैमरामैन ने उन पर फोकर किया। कमेंट्री बॉक्स में बैठे सौरव गांगुली और हरभजन सिंह लाबुशेन की नींद पर ही बात कर रहे थे, तभी वार्नर को सिराज ने निपटा दिया। वार्नर के आउट होते ही लाबुशेन हड़बड़ी में उठे और फिर मैदान के भीतर गए। ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने दूसरी पारी में चार विकेट पर 120 रन बनाकर अपनी स्थिति काफी मजबूत कर ली। भारत को मैच में बने रहने के लिए ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बाकी बचे छह विकेट जल्दी चटकाने होंगे और फिर बल्लेबाजों से प्रभावी प्रदर्शन की उम्मीद करनी होगी। इससे पहले रहाणे ने अपनी 129 गेंद की शानदार पारी में 11 चौके और एक छक्का लगाया तो वहीं शारदुल 109 गेंद की पारी में छह चौके जड़े। ओवल मैदान पर शारदुल ने अपनी तीसरी पारी में तीसरा अर्धशतक लगाया। भारतीय गेंदबाजों ने दूसरी पारी में शानदार गेंदबाजी की। मोहम्मद सिराज (41 रन पर एक विकेट) ने दूसरी पारी के चौथे ओवर में डेविड वॉर्नर (एक रन) को चलता करने के बाद दो बार लाबुशेन को छकाया। दोनों बार गेंद लाबुशेन के शरीर पर लगी। उमेश यादव (21 रन पर एक विकेट) ने उस्मान ख्वाजा की 13 रन की पारी को विकेट के पीछे भरत के हाथों कैच कराकर खत्म किया। स्मिथ बड़ा शॉट खेलने के चक्कर में गच्चा गए और शार्दुल ने जडेजा की बॉल पर कैच पकड़ने में कोई गलती नहीं की।","pubDate":"2023-06-09 18:07:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"WTC Final: रोहित शर्मा की अगले 2 दिन बढ़ेगी टेंशन, बारिश फाइनल में डालेगी खलल, देखें कैसा रहेगा मौसम का हाल?","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/news/sports/cricket-wtc-final-2023-london-weather-update-4th-and-5th-day-india-vs-australia-the-oval-6471341.html","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WTC Final 2023 Weather Forecast : वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल के शुरुआती 3 दिन टीम इंडिया के लिए उतार-चढ़ाव भरे रहे हैं. अब अगले दो दिन रोहित ब्रिगेड को डबल जोर लगाने की जरूरत है. टीम इंडिया के लिए 10 और 11 जून को बारिश बड़ी मुसीबत बनकर सामने आ सकती है.","content":"वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल के आखिरी दो दिन रोहित शर्मा की टेंशन बढ़ सकती है. (AFP) नई दिल्ली. वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल (WTC Final 2023) टीम इंडिया के लिए अभी तक चुनौतियों से भरा रहा है, फिर चाहे बैटिंग की बात करें या बॉलिंग की. तीन दिन का खेल खत्म हो चुका है, ऑस्ट्रेलिया ने मैच में पकड़ बना रखी है. लेकिन चौथे दिन भारत के सामने एक और चुनौती देखने को मिल सकती है. हालांकि, टीम इंडिया अभी गेम में बनी हुई है लेकिन चौथे दिन बारिश रोहित ब्रिगेड की उम्मीदों पर पानी फेर सकती है. अगले दो दिन फाइनल पर बारिश का साया देखने को मिल सकता है. फाइनल की शुरुआत टीम इंडिया ने शानदार तरीके से की थी. लेकिन स्टीव स्मिथ और ट्रेविस हेड भारत के सामने दीवार बने और दोनों प्लेयर्स ने शतकीय पारियां खेलीं. हालांकि, दूसरे दिन भारत ने शादनदार वापसी की और ऑस्ट्रेलिया को 469 रन पर रोक दिया. लेकिन बैटिंग का हाल बेहद खराब देखने को मिला. अजिंक्य रहाणे और शार्दुल ठाकुर ने अहम अर्धशतकों के दम पर टीम इंडिया को जैसे-तैसे संकट से उबारा है. अब तीसरे दिन कंगारू टीम ने 4 विकेट खोकर 123 रन बना लिए हैं और भारत से 296 रन आगे है. भारतीय गेंदबाज ऑस्ट्रेलिया को जल्दी समेटने के लिए जद्दोजहत कर रहे हैं लेकिन 10 तारीख को बारिश टीम इंडिया के लिए बड़ी मुसीबत बन सकती है. कितने प्रतिशत हैं बारिश के आसार?
