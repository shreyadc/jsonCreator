He averaged 43.67 in tests when he was dropped after a series in South Africa in 1995-96.“It’s a sad day... At the time, in the 80s and 90s, he was England’s best batter,” a tearful Kevan James, Smith’s former Hampshire teammate, told BBC Radio Solent.“He was a super player, particularly of fast bowling in an era where the West Indies had all these fast bowlers. He was one of the few England batters who stood up to them and basically gave as good as he got.”Smith was the brother of fellow England international Chris Smith, who played his last test at Leeds two years before Robin’s England debut at the same ground in 1988.Nicknamed “The Judge” for having curly hair like a judge’s wig, Robin Smith scored 175 against West Indies in Antigua in 1994, the same test in which Brian Lara made a record-breaking 375 runs.Smith also hit an unbeaten 167 against Australia in 1993, which remained the highest innings by an England player in an ODI until 2016, when Alex Hales made 171 against Pakistan.“Robin Smith was a player who stood toe to toe with some of the quickest bowlers in the world, meeting spells of hostile fast bowling with a defiant smile and an incredible resilience,” said England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chair Richard Thompson.“He did so in a way that gave England fans enormous pride, and no shortage of

He averaged 43.67 in tests when he was dropped after a series in South Africa in 1995-96.“It’s a sad day... At the time, in the 80s and 90s, he was England’s best batter,” a tearful Kevan James, Smith’s former Hampshire teammate, told BBC Radio Solent.“He was a super player, particularly of fast bowling in an era where the West Indies had all these fast bowlers. He was one of the few England batters who stood up to them and basically gave as good as he got.”Smith was the brother of fellow England international Chris Smith, who played his last test at Leeds two years before Robin’s England debut at the same ground in 1988.Nicknamed “The Judge” for having curly hair like a judge’s wig, Robin Smith scored 175 against West Indies in Antigua in 1994, the same test in which Brian Lara made a record-breaking 375 runs.Smith also hit an unbeaten 167 against Australia in 1993, which remained the highest innings by an England player in an ODI until 2016, when Alex Hales made 171 against Pakistan.“Robin Smith was a player who stood toe to toe with some of the quickest bowlers in the world, meeting spells of hostile fast bowling with a defiant smile and an incredible resilience,” said England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chair Richard Thompson.“He did so in a way that gave England fans enormous pride, and no shortage of entertainment.”","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["none@none.com
