If nothing miraculous happens, the visitors will finally taste victory for the first time in this series. A Test win India is rare with the hosts having lost only 2 matches at home in the last 2 years. The two teams to beat them were England in 2021 and Australia themselves back in 2017. If the 3rd loss indeed goes down on Friday, India will only have their top order collapse to blame with only Cheteshwar Pujara the lone resistance against a lethal Nathan Lyon, who ended up taking 8 wickets in the 2nd innings. Pujara‚Äôs 59 was the sole beacon of light in the Indian innings as both openers and Shubman Gill fell cheaply, followed by , and Srikar Bharat. Pujara was ultimately snared by Lyon as took a blinder to dismiss him as India ultimately skittled at 163. Our Senior cricket writer is covering the third Test at Indore. India have just the 76 runs to defend on day three morning. The lowest target defended in this country is 107, in that famous meeting between the hosts and their current visitors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2004. They sure have the resources to pull off a wonder of a result even though Australia sure start as favorites. While on commentary, former Aussie opener Matthew Hayden said, ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs an absolute desert. It is so dry. No way spinners should come to bowl in the sixth over. This is the reason I don‚Äôt like these kinds of surfaces. It shouldn‚Äôt be keeping this low and turning so much on Day 1. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether Australia wins this Test or India. These kinds of surfaces are not good for Test cricket.‚Äù ‚ÄúI cannot believe a player of his class has gone that long without a hundred,‚Äù former Test batter Mark Waugh said on Fox Cricket. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been in good touch recently, he‚Äôs batted well in one-day cricket. I know it‚Äôs not Test match cricket, but the signs have been there in his last three innings in Test cricket that he‚Äôs actually playing pretty well. Umesh Yadav made the stumps cartwheel twice on day two of the third Test, while also completing 100 Test wickets at home, and it was a sight for sore eyes. What. A. Delivery! was on üî• this morning, knocking down the off stump twice! üí™üèª Watch 's reply LIVE in the 3rd MasterCard Test on Star Sports & Disney+Hotstar! -Nathan Lyon second in the list for most wickets by an away bowler in India (53 in 10 matches). -Umesh Yadav becomes only the 5th Indian quick to register 100 Test wickets at home. 13th time Lyon got Pujara out in Tests - the most an Indian batter has got out to any bowler. He also equalled Richie Benaud's tally of most five-wicket hauls (5) vs India in India. Only the 1st time since January 2019, Jadeja has got dismissed for a single digit score twice in a Test. Only the 2nd time India got bundled out under 200 twice in a Test since 1978. Also the second fewest overs (93.5) batted by India in a Test in which they've been bowled out twice. \"Pujara‚Äôs dismissal, I‚Äôve just looked at it, that‚Äôs one of the greatest catches in the history of cricket, that‚Äôs as good as it gets. With his old cobbler‚Äôs back, he had a deteriorating disk, but that just takes me back to Mark Waugh. It‚Äôd be Bobby Simpson, it‚Äôd be every best slips fielder in the history of cricket, they would have loved to have taken that catch,\" the former Australia keeper batter told SENQ Breakfast. During India‚Äôs second innings on day two, skipper Rohit Sharma was caught on camera in a rather animated mood, seemingly unhappy with his batters‚Äô approach in the middle as he conversed with Ishan Kishan in the dressing room. From what it could be understood from Rohit‚Äôs gestures, he seemingly wasn‚Äôt very happy with the conservative approach of the batters and sent Kishan to relay the message in the middle during break. For years Umesh Yadav's father, Tilak toiled in the dark while putting his health at risk breathing in coal dust, writes our senior cricket writer, Devendra Pandey. Umesh, who grabbed three wickets on Thursday morning to help India mount a comeback in the game, had lost his father only last week. A father whose back breaking work and happiness was linked to Umesh's cricket career. ‚ÄúIn cricket anything can happen. We will try our best and bowl tight lines. It is not an easy wicket, whether it is our batters or theirs. It is not easy to step out and hit. ‚ÄúThe ball is keeping low as well, so you can‚Äôt be sure about stepping out. The runs are less but we will stick to tight lines and push as much as we can,‚Äù said Umesh, who picked up three wickets on Thursday to help India dismiss Australia early in the first session. 10/119: Ajaz Patel, Mumbai 2021/22 8/50: Nathan Lyon, Bangalore 2016/17 8/64: Lance Klusener, Kolkata 1996/97 Sandip G, our man on the ground in Indore, writes on the dramatic day two of the Indore Test that saw 16 wickets falling across two innings and Nathan Lyon picking an 8-fer, inspiring Australia to set themselves a total of 76 to chase and win the first Test of the 2023 Border Gavaskar Trophy. Cheteshwar Pujara, the man who brought some semblance of respectability to the Indian innings on Thursday, said that the secret of negotiating turn and bounce on a pitch like the one at Indore was trusting your defence. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tough pitch to bat on. It‚Äôs not easy, you need to trust your defence, make sure you need to get to the pitch or, if it‚Äôs short, play off the back foot,‚Äù said Pujara. Asked about the strategy needed on this track, Pujara said: \"You need to attack and defend, a mix, on this pitch. If you keep defending, one ball will bounce and hit your glove. My aim was to be a bit more positive, try and score as many as possible.‚Äù He scored nearly half of India‚Äôs second-innings runs. Just when Pujara had started to appear threatening to the Australians, Steve Smith took a blinder to dismiss him on Thursday. It would not be an over exaggeration to state that the catch was the turning point of Day 2, and could be of the match as well since Pujara was batting with composure. India suffered a humbling batting collapse against Australia in 3rd Test at Indore, a section of fans in the stands at Holkar Stadium started a chant for Rishabh Pant. Pant suffered a horrific accident in December 30, which required him to undergo lengthy treatment. it will also mean he will miss a lot of international cricket this year. While fans in the stadiums are missing Pant, it didn't help that his replacement, Srikar Bharat, has had a forgettable series so far: scoring 8, 6, 23, 17 and 3 in 5 innings. Sandip G, our man on the ground in Indore, writes that Lyon's dismantling of Rohit Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja on Thursday shows why he is the greatest of all time. He also points out that while Shane Warne has just the one five-wicket haul in India, Lyon already has five in the country. Nathan Lyon was incredible on Thursday, taking eight Indian wickets in 23.3 overs while conceding just 64 runs. Barring Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer, he was behind all of the Indian specialist batters going back to the hut on Thursday. The 35-year-old is playing in his 118th Test and has taken 479 wickets. A fighting 59-run knock from Cheteshwar Pujara was the saving grace for the hosts in the second innings as they collapsed for a paltry 163 runs in the second innings. In the first, they had managed to score just 109 runs. Australia, who scored 197 in their first innings, need just 76 runs to win. Pujara patiently stitched together his innings, using up 142 balls to make his score before perishing to a ball from Nathan Lyon. For most of their time in India, the visiting Australian side has been staring down the barrel, losing both the first two Tests in three days. But in Indore, at long last, things have gone their way and they now find themselves needing just 76 runs to claim a back-to-the-wall victory. it won't help them regain the Border Gavaskar Trophy, but it will be some consolation to make the series 2-1 and put pressure on the hosts going to Ahmedabad. Right then. Here's a bit of recap. On day two of the third Test match, India manage to bundle Australia out for 197, giving away only 40 runs to their total of day one. With Australia leading by 88 runs, India could only manage a lead of 75 of their own as Nathan Lyon (8/64) ran through the Indian lineup, the hosts being dismissed for 163. Another day three finish on cards, the only question, do India have something out of this world on the cards to defend a total of 76?","pubDate":"2023-03-03 01:30:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Horror injury blow for Aussie ODI hopeful","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/daniel-hughes-suffers-suspected-calf-tear-in-huge-blow-to-odi-hopes/news-story/5505797e67173c58c51b1c242b7ce17f","keywords":["Breaking News","Cricket news and galleries","National Breaking News","NewsWire","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australian one-day hopeful Daniel Hughes has been forced out of his side‚Äôs Sheffield Shield clash against Victoria after scans confirmed a torn calf muscle.","content":"Cricket Don't miss out on the headlines from Cricket.

Australian one-day hopeful Daniel Hughes has been forced out of his side‚Äôs Sheffield Shield clash against Victoria after scans confirmed a torn calf muscle. The 34-year-old pulled up after taking off for a single and was unable to put any weight back on his leg, forcing him to retire hurt on 22 amid a difficult first few hours for NSW. Hughes may have been called upon to join the Australian one-day side in India if David Warner was not cleared fit to play, but the injury is almost certainly a fatal blow to his hopes of a national callup. The left-hander had been in career-best form, leading the run-scoring in the Marsh Cup with 548 runs at an average of 78, including four centuries. Daniel Hughes had to be helped off Lavington Sports Ground in Albury after he suffered a suspected calf tear while batting on day one of NSW‚Äôs Sheffield Shield match against Victoria. Picture: Albert Perez / Getty Images Victoria‚Äôs young fast bowlers caused problems on day one of the Shield fixture in Albury, with Mitch Perry claiming 4-24 and Fergus O‚ÄôNeill also picking up two wickets as NSW was bowled out for 203. Chris Green was again the first innings‚Äô topscorer for the Blues with 52, and put on 57 for the eighth wicket with Trent Copeland to steer them away from trouble at 7-136. Copeland removed Travis Dean before stumps to leave the Vics 1-15 in reply. At the Gabba, another impressive cameo with the bat from Ben Manenti took South Australia into a strong position against Queensland after it had slumped to 6-111 earlier in the day. Ben Manenti has been in fine form with the bat this season for the Redbacks. Picture: Chris Hyde / Getty Images The 25-year-old, who has nailed down a spot in the Redbacks side after moving from NSW via Tasmania, struck 88 from 101 balls to stamp his all-round credentials before he was dismissed by Xavier Bartlett late on day one. The innings carried the off-spinner into fifth on the Sheffield Shield leading run-scorers‚Äô list at stumps, with 534 runs at 49. South Australia was 7-227 after 67 overs, with Bartlett and Michael Neser each claiming three wickets and Jake Lehmann earlier making an important 65 at better than a run-a-ball, after coming to the crease at 3-33. Just before tea in Perth, Tasmania was 4-139 after winning the toss and electing to bat, with openers Tim Ward and Caleb Jewell both dismissed in the 40s.

Followed categories will be added to My News. Australia will arrive in England refreshed and ready to continue their peerless record in international cricket ahead of the Ashes in June, coach Shelley Nitschke says. A dozen members of Australia‚Äôs winning T20 World Cup squad have arrived in India for the inaugural Women‚Äôs Premier League that begins on Sunday, but Nitschke said their impressive ability to switch off from cricket would hold them in good stead despite the whirlwind trip overseas. Meg Lanning was named as the third Australian captain of the five WPL franchises on Wednesday when she was appointed skipper of the Delhi Capitals, with Beth Mooney taking the reins at the Gujarat Giants and Alyssa Healy in charge of the Uttar Pradesh Warriorz. The timing of the tournament auction, wedged between Australia‚Äôs first and second World Cup group games, was awkward, but the discipline of the side to switch their focus back to the task at hand showed that the players would not be burned out from the WPL ahead of a big northern summer, Nitschke said. Meg Lanning with Delhi Capitals chief executive AS Sundaresan and head coach Jonathan Batty after being named the inaugural captain of the WPL franchise. Picture: Indranil Mukherjee / AFP ‚ÄúWhile the World Cup was going on, there was an element of talking about (the WPL) but not wanting to get too caught up,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere was still getting the job done in South Africa, and then once that was finished, among the celebrations that focus started to shift ‚Ä¶ credit to them for keeping their eyes on the prize. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a testament to them and also probably contributes to some of our success ‚Äì when you‚Äôre in tournaments, it‚Äôs that ability to switch off but then knowing that when you need to be on, you‚Äôre on.‚Äù Nitschke said she was not concerned by the how the tight WPL schedule ‚Äì 22 games played in 23 days ‚Äì might wear down Australia‚Äôs players following a packed fixture in South Africa.

His defiance was ended by a moment of brilliance from Steve Smith, at leg slip, topping off a great day out for him as a captain. Marshalling his resources expertly, Smith did not allow the game to drift away and kept making changes to his bowling attack to not allow the batters to get on top. His moves paid off well when Shreyas Iyer, who had counterattacked with a 27-ball 26 against the spinners, fell as soon as the pacer was brought on, with Usman Khawaja taking a sharp chance at midwicket. This stemmed any momentum that India had a little into the third session, before the lower order capitulated on a raging turner, with the innings ending eerily similar to how it started with Mohammad Siraj swinging wildly against Lyon to be bowled. It had started in similar fashion with Lyon getting past a wildly swinging Shubman Gill in the first over after the Lunch break. While Rohit Sharma kept Pujara company for 58 balls, he too copped one that shot through a tad low from Lyon and was out LBW, with DRS too going against his wishful call. Virat Kohli had a nervy stay in the middle getting past a few close shaves, but on 13 after he had slapped a short ball from Matthew Kuhnemann to the cover boundary, he tried to pull one and was trapped LBW again. The trend continued minutes before Tea, when Lyon ended Ravindra Jadeja‚Äôs dogged 36-ball stay getting him out LBW with the aid of a review. All through this, Pujara managed to be more confident with his footwork drilling a couple of drives to keep the scoreboard ticking along and shaving off the deficit, and briefly along with Iyer India threatened to take a significant lead, with the No.3 registering his 35th Test fifty in the process. However it all came to a rapid halt thanks to some relentlessly accurate spin bowling from Australia. Earlier in the day, despite a collapse that saw Australia lose their last six wickets for 11 runs, the visitors finished with a possibly pivotal lead of 88 runs. Starting the day with a lead of 47, Cameron Green and Peter Handscomb made it Australia‚Äôs first hour seeing it out without much problem. India opted to start with their two left-arm spinners after a brief spell from Mohammed Siraj in that hour and it did not yield the desired results. Both Handscomb and Green used their long reach to smother the spin and defend confidently, and ground the attack out while adding 30 invaluable runs through that hour. However, things took a drastic turn after R Ashwin and Umesh Yadav started operating in tandem in the second hour. Ashwin was the first to get the breakthrough having Handscomb caught at short leg and breaking a stoic partnership worth 40 in 134 balls. In the next over Umesh hit Green on the backfoot and had an LBW decision upheld by the barest of margins as the batter reviewed. This was followed by a demolition job of the tail with Umesh sending the stumps flying to send back Todd Murphy and Mitchell Starc, while Ashwin cleaned up Lyon who missed a big sweep. The collapse saw Australia lose six wickets in less than half an hour, giving India a slight opening but Lyon and Co. ensured that there was no let-up. Australia Published on By Nalanda will have a slight edge over their arch rivals Ananda when the two teams meet in the 93rd Battle of the Maroons at the SSC ground over the weekend (March 4-5). Nalanda do not have the two Sri Lanka Under 19 team members who played key roles during the last season and helped record a historic Big Match victory. But under Chanul Athukorala‚Äôs captaincy Nalanda‚Äôs balance outfit have done well and can challenge any formidable team. One could only get misled if they judge the strength by their tournament standings. They have a strong top order batting line up with wicketkeeper batsman Rusiru Vilochana leading from the front. Vilochana is among the leading batsmen in the tournament, having over 1000 runs against his name. He scored two centuries this season and his 1194 runs have come at an average of 54.3 runs. Yasiru Samarakoon who opens batting has over 500 runs for the season, while Sadew Samarasinghe (over 600runs), Kushmitha Silva (over 400 runs) and Eranga Jayakody (over 500 runs) have all contributed with the bat. Spin trio of Minod Caldera, Sajitha Vithanage and Janula Indusara are the key strike bowlers for Nalanda, while skipper Athukorala shares the new ball duties with Thisara Dewdunu. Off spinner Caldera is their leading wicket taker after having taken 46 wickets this season. Left-arm spinners Vithanage (39 wickets) and Indusara have accounted for more than 60 wickets together. Ananda encountered fluctuating fortunes this season. They entered the first term as an unbeaten team with two outright victories under their belt. Then followed four consecutive defeats. They suffered defeats at the hands of St. Anthony‚Äôs Katugastota (innings and 79 runs), Trinity (by seven wickets), Mahinda (by seven wickets) and Richmond (by 112 runs). That was something unprecedented. But the team led by Nethma Samaraweera have managed to overcome the setback. They concluded the season with a morale boosting victory against Dharmaraja (by nine wickets). Ananda will rely heavily on wicketkeeper batsman Viduna Wijebandara, Iruth Gimshan and Kithma Sithmal for runs as a largely inexperienced side take the field. They are the only players to have aggregated over 400 runs among batsmen who played more than 12 matches this season. There is hope on the likes of Dinada Athalage who have shown promise during the limited opportunities he got. In the bowling department, spinners Kithma Sithmal, Ashinsa Nainayaka, Ayesh Shashimal and Isuru Ayesh are the bowlers to watch. While Sithmal is their leading wicket taker with over 40 wickets against his name, Nainayake, Shashimal and Ayesh have accounted for over 90 wickets together. Their pace attack is spearheaded by skipper Samaraweera and Yehan Gunasinghe. Ananda lead the Big Match tally 12-7. They last won in 2003 under the captaincy of D. Kularatne. Nalanda are the holders of the trophy after registering a historic victory under the captaincy of Dineth Samaraweera last year. Published on By Dawid Malan played the best innings of his ODI career to steer England to a tense three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Mirpur and further his case for inclusion in their World Cup defence in India later this year. England made tough work of a target of 210, slipping to 65 for 4 and 161 for 7 as Bangladesh‚Äôs spinners squeezed the life out of their chase. But Malan, batting at No. 3, saw them home with eight balls to spare, adding an unbroken 51 for the eighth wicket with Adil Rashid to seal the win. Malan has been a peripheral member of England‚Äôs 50-over set-up for most of his career but has taken every opportunity that has come his way in the past nine months. He has now hit hundreds in each of the last four bilateral ODI series he has featured in; given the circumstances, this innings was the pick of them. This fixture started barely 24 hours after the remarkable climax of England‚Äôs Test against New Zealand in Wellington, some 7,000 miles away from Dhaka. They fielded completely separate sides ‚Äì though Will Jacks, an unused squad member at the Basin Reserve, flew to Bangladesh on the second day of the Test, and won his first ODI cap. Joe Root, England‚Äôs leading scorer at the 2019 World Cup, was among those unavailable due to the fixture clash and is nailed on to bat at No. 3 when the schedule allows him to return to the ODI side. Yet Malan is also an experienced opener and, at this stage, looks as strong a candidate as any to fulfil that role alongside Jonny Bairstow. It was not easy-going for Malan, who battled his way to 50 off 92 at the second drinks break as England desperately looked to survive, in particular against the threatening Mehidy Hasan Miraz. But he relieved the scoring pressure after the interval, crashing Mehidy over cover and then lofting him for a straight six, eventually guiding them across the line by working Najmul Hassan Shanto through midwicket. Shanto had top-scored for Bangladesh with a gritty, 82-ball 58 from No. 3 ‚Äì an innings that was not dissimilar to Malan‚Äôs. He extended his recent Bangladesh Premier League form ‚Äì he was the league‚Äôs top-scorer ‚Äì with his maiden ODI half-century, an overdue landmark in his 16th innings. Bangladesh struggled to build partnerships throughout their innings, with Shanto and Mahmadullah combining for Bangladesh‚Äôs only 50-run stand. England shared wickets around, with their three seamers and three spinners both accounting for five batters between them. Tamim Iqbal opted to bat first and made a bright start, hitting four early boundaries after surviving a chance when Chris Woakes put down a caught-and-bowled opportunity in the first over. Litton Das, his opening partner, pulled Woakes for six over square leg as Bangladesh raced to 33 for 0 in 4.4 overs, but was trapped lbw by the next ball he faced. Shanto was also reprieved early, dropped by a sprawling Jason Roy at backward point, but hit his next two balls for four and settled into a rhythm on a slow, low pitch.Mark Wood, playing his first ODI since July 2021, bowled the final over of the initial powerplay and struck with his third ball to remove Tamim. He breached the 90mph/145kph mark with his second ball, then rushed Tamim with his third, a back-of-a-length ball which bounced appreciably; Bangladesh‚Äôs captain could only fend onto his own stumps, via his elbow. Adil Rashid had Mushfiqur Rahim caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep, and Bangladesh were 106 for 4 when Shakib Al Hasan was cleaned up by Moeen Ali. Shanto continued to accumulate, but after reverse-sweeping Rashid for four, he pulled Rashid‚Äôs googly straight to Roy at short midwicket to fall for 58. When Mahmudullah strangled Wood down the leg side, Bangladesh were in danger of being bowled out. Jacks took his maiden ODI wicket when Afif Hossain pulled tamely to mid-on, and Mehidy Hasan edged Archer behind cheaply. Taskin Ahmed hit Rashid for six and then four to ensure Bangladesh would post something competitive before he strangled Archer down the leg side, with Taijul skying a return catch to Moeen to end the innings with 16 balls unused. England struggled for fluency in the chase, and lost Roy in the first over as he chipped to mid-off while looking to hit Shakib over his head. Phil Salt‚Äôs scratchy innings came to an end when Taijul‚Äôs arm ball skidded into his leg stump via his pad and when James Vince was stumped charging the same bowler, England were in trouble at 45 for 3. Soon after, Malan survived a tight lbw shout on review, with ball-tracking predicting Taijul‚Äôs offbreak would have clipped leg stump rather than hitting it flush. Tamim attacked just before the first drinks break, bringing Taskin back into the attack and posting Shanto at slip in the 17th over. He was rewarded immediately, as Jos Buttler steered a back-of-a-length ball straight to the close catcher, bringing Jacks in at No. 6 on debut. Jacks, playing his first List A game since 2019, struggled early on but a flurry of boundaries took scoring pressure off Malan, who was battling hard against Mehidy‚Äôs offbreaks. But Jacks holed out to midwicket for a flashy 26, and when Mehidy‚Äôs final ball skidded into Moeen‚Äôs stumps after a 38-run stand with Malan, England were wobbling. Woakes chipped Taijul to mid-on with 49 runs required and three wickets left, but Rashid proved the perfect foil for Malan. He calmly rotated the strike as Malan opted to attack; with Mustafizur Rahman proving expensive, Tamim eventually ran out of options as England snuck home. Bangladesh ( ) Published on By There were no surprises in the 13 New Zealand named for their two-Test series against Sri Lanka that begins on March 9. All 13 players who featured in their recent 1-1 draw with England were named, with the omissions from that squad being the uncapped seamer Jacob Duffy, legspinner Ish Sodhi, and the injured Kyle Jamieson. Tim Southee will lead the squad that is coming off the high of becoming only the fourth team to win after following on, in a dramatic game which they snatched by one run in Wellington to level the series against England. The batting will continue to be anchored by Kane Williamson, with Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Devon Conway, Daryl Mitchell and Will Young for support. Tom Blundell will continue behind the wicket, with Michael Bracewell the key in the spin department. Neil Wagner, fresh off his signature short-ball exploits against England, will spearhead the pacers along with Southee, the line-up including Matt Henry, Blair Tickner and Scott Kuggeleijn. Jamieson, who was withdrawn from the squad initially named for that England series, is due to undergo back surgery for an injury that has kept him out of international cricket since June 2022. The out-of-contract Trent Boult, who‚Äôs focusing on playing franchise T20 cricket, continues to remain unselected. The two Tests against Sri Lanka are part of the World Test Championship, and while defending champions New Zealand are out of contention for the final, Sri Lanka need to sweep the series 2-0 to have a shot at making the title bout. The first Test will be played in Christchurch, followed by the second in Wellington from March 17.

Nalanda do not have the two Sri Lanka Under 19 team members who played key roles during the last season and helped record a historic Big Match victory. But under Chanul Athukorala‚Äôs captaincy Nalanda‚Äôs balance outfit have done well and can challenge any formidable team. One could only get misled if they judge the strength by their tournament standings. They have a strong top order batting line up with wicketkeeper batsman Rusiru Vilochana leading from the front. Vilochana is among the leading batsmen in the tournament, having over 1000 runs against his name. He scored two centuries this season and his 1194 runs have come at an average of 54.3 runs. Yasiru Samarakoon who opens batting has over 500 runs for the season, while Sadew Samarasinghe (over 600runs), Kushmitha Silva (over 400 runs) and Eranga Jayakody (over 500 runs) have all contributed with the bat. Spin trio of Minod Caldera, Sajitha Vithanage and Janula Indusara are the key strike bowlers for Nalanda, while skipper Athukorala shares the new ball duties with Thisara Dewdunu. Off spinner Caldera is their leading wicket taker after having taken 46 wickets this season. Left-arm spinners Vithanage (39 wickets) and Indusara have accounted for more than 60 wickets together. Ananda encountered fluctuating fortunes this season. They entered the first term as an unbeaten team with two outright victories under their belt. Then followed four consecutive defeats. They suffered defeats at the hands of St. Anthony‚Äôs Katugastota (innings and 79 runs), Trinity (by seven wickets), Mahinda (by seven wickets) and Richmond (by 112 runs). That was something unprecedented. But the team led by Nethma Samaraweera have managed to overcome the setback. They concluded the season with a morale boosting victory against Dharmaraja (by nine wickets). Ananda will rely heavily on wicketkeeper batsman Viduna Wijebandara, Iruth Gimshan and Kithma Sithmal for runs as a largely inexperienced side take the field. They are the only players to have aggregated over 400 runs among batsmen who played more than 12 matches this season. There is hope on the likes of Dinada Athalage who have shown promise during the limited opportunities he got. In the bowling department, spinners Kithma Sithmal, Ashinsa Nainayaka, Ayesh Shashimal and Isuru Ayesh are the bowlers to watch. While Sithmal is their leading wicket taker with over 40 wickets against his name, Nainayake, Shashimal and Ayesh have accounted for over 90 wickets together. Their pace attack is spearheaded by skipper Samaraweera and Yehan Gunasinghe. Ananda lead the Big Match tally 12-7. They last won in 2003 under the captaincy of D. Kularatne. Nalanda are the holders of the trophy after registering a historic victory under the captaincy of Dineth Samaraweera last year. Published on By Nathan Lyon led the way with the ball for Australia picking up a magnificent 8-64, his second-best Test figures, as India were bowled out for just 163, setting Australia a target of 76 to seal a famous win.For India, Cheteshwar Pujara led the way with a masterclass on a spinning pitch, scoring 59 and dragging India along with him even as he kept losing partners at the other end. His defiance was ended by a moment of brilliance from Steve Smith, at leg slip, topping off a great day out for him as a captain. Marshalling his resources expertly, Smith did not allow the game to drift away and kept making changes to his bowling attack to not allow the batters to get on top. His moves paid off well when Shreyas Iyer, who had counterattacked with a 27-ball 26 against the spinners, fell as soon as the pacer was brought on, with Usman Khawaja taking a sharp chance at midwicket. This stemmed any momentum that India had a little into the third session, before the lower order capitulated on a raging turner, with the innings ending eerily similar to how it started with Mohammad Siraj swinging wildly against Lyon to be bowled. It had started in similar fashion with Lyon getting past a wildly swinging Shubman Gill in the first over after the Lunch break. While Rohit Sharma kept Pujara company for 58 balls, he too copped one that shot through a tad low from Lyon and was out LBW, with DRS too going against his wishful call. Virat Kohli had a nervy stay in the middle getting past a few close shaves, but on 13 after he had slapped a short ball from Matthew Kuhnemann to the cover boundary, he tried to pull one and was trapped LBW again. The trend continued minutes before Tea, when Lyon ended Ravindra Jadeja‚Äôs dogged 36-ball stay getting him out LBW with the aid of a review. All through this, Pujara managed to be more confident with his footwork drilling a couple of drives to keep the scoreboard ticking along and shaving off the deficit, and briefly along with Iyer India threatened to take a significant lead, with the No.3 registering his 35th Test fifty in the process. However it all came to a rapid halt thanks to some relentlessly accurate spin bowling from Australia. Earlier in the day, despite a collapse that saw Australia lose their last six wickets for 11 runs, the visitors finished with a possibly pivotal lead of 88 runs. Starting the day with a lead of 47, Cameron Green and Peter Handscomb made it Australia‚Äôs first hour seeing it out without much problem. India opted to start with their two left-arm spinners after a brief spell from Mohammed Siraj in that hour and it did not yield the desired results. Both Handscomb and Green used their long reach to smother the spin and defend confidently, and ground the attack out while adding 30 invaluable runs through that hour. However, things took a drastic turn after R Ashwin and Umesh Yadav started operating in tandem in the second hour. Ashwin was the first to get the breakthrough having Handscomb caught at short leg and breaking a stoic partnership worth 40 in 134 balls. In the next over Umesh hit Green on the backfoot and had an LBW decision upheld by the barest of margins as the batter reviewed. This was followed by a demolition job of the tail with Umesh sending the stumps flying to send back Todd Murphy and Mitchell Starc, while Ashwin cleaned up Lyon who missed a big sweep. The collapse saw Australia lose six wickets in less than half an hour, giving India a slight opening but Lyon and Co. ensured that there was no let-up. Australia Published on By Dawid Malan played the best innings of his ODI career to steer England to a tense three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Mirpur and further his case for inclusion in their World Cup defence in India later this year. England made tough work of a target of 210, slipping to 65 for 4 and 161 for 7 as Bangladesh‚Äôs spinners squeezed the life out of their chase. But Malan, batting at No. 3, saw them home with eight balls to spare, adding an unbroken 51 for the eighth wicket with Adil Rashid to seal the win. Malan has been a peripheral member of England‚Äôs 50-over set-up for most of his career but has taken every opportunity that has come his way in the past nine months. He has now hit hundreds in each of the last four bilateral ODI series he has featured in; given the circumstances, this innings was the pick of them. This fixture started barely 24 hours after the remarkable climax of England‚Äôs Test against New Zealand in Wellington, some 7,000 miles away from Dhaka. They fielded completely separate sides ‚Äì though Will Jacks, an unused squad member at the Basin Reserve, flew to Bangladesh on the second day of the Test, and won his first ODI cap. Joe Root, England‚Äôs leading scorer at the 2019 World Cup, was among those unavailable due to the fixture clash and is nailed on to bat at No. 3 when the schedule allows him to return to the ODI side. Yet Malan is also an experienced opener and, at this stage, looks as strong a candidate as any to fulfil that role alongside Jonny Bairstow. It was not easy-going for Malan, who battled his way to 50 off 92 at the second drinks break as England desperately looked to survive, in particular against the threatening Mehidy Hasan Miraz. But he relieved the scoring pressure after the interval, crashing Mehidy over cover and then lofting him for a straight six, eventually guiding them across the line by working Najmul Hassan Shanto through midwicket. Shanto had top-scored for Bangladesh with a gritty, 82-ball 58 from No. 3 ‚Äì an innings that was not dissimilar to Malan‚Äôs. He extended his recent Bangladesh Premier League form ‚Äì he was the league‚Äôs top-scorer ‚Äì with his maiden ODI half-century, an overdue landmark in his 16th innings. Bangladesh struggled to build partnerships throughout their innings, with Shanto and Mahmadullah combining for Bangladesh‚Äôs only 50-run stand. England shared wickets around, with their three seamers and three spinners both accounting for five batters between them. Tamim Iqbal opted to bat first and made a bright start, hitting four early boundaries after surviving a chance when Chris Woakes put down a caught-and-bowled opportunity in the first over. Litton Das, his opening partner, pulled Woakes for six over square leg as Bangladesh raced to 33 for 0 in 4.4 overs, but was trapped lbw by the next ball he faced. Shanto was also reprieved early, dropped by a sprawling Jason Roy at backward point, but hit his next two balls for four and settled into a rhythm on a slow, low pitch.Mark Wood, playing his first ODI since July 2021, bowled the final over of the initial powerplay and struck with his third ball to remove Tamim. He breached the 90mph/145kph mark with his second ball, then rushed Tamim with his third, a back-of-a-length ball which bounced appreciably; Bangladesh‚Äôs captain could only fend onto his own stumps, via his elbow. Adil Rashid had Mushfiqur Rahim caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep, and Bangladesh were 106 for 4 when Shakib Al Hasan was cleaned up by Moeen Ali. Shanto continued to accumulate, but after reverse-sweeping Rashid for four, he pulled Rashid‚Äôs googly straight to Roy at short midwicket to fall for 58. When Mahmudullah strangled Wood down the leg side, Bangladesh were in danger of being bowled out. Jacks took his maiden ODI wicket when Afif Hossain pulled tamely to mid-on, and Mehidy Hasan edged Archer behind cheaply. Taskin Ahmed hit Rashid for six and then four to ensure Bangladesh would post something competitive before he strangled Archer down the leg side, with Taijul skying a return catch to Moeen to end the innings with 16 balls unused.

All 13 players who featured in their recent 1-1 draw with England were named, with the omissions from that squad being the uncapped seamer Jacob Duffy, legspinner Ish Sodhi, and the injured Kyle Jamieson. Tim Southee will lead the squad that is coming off the high of becoming only the fourth team to win after following on, in a dramatic game which they snatched by one run in Wellington to level the series against England. The batting will continue to be anchored by Kane Williamson, with Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Devon Conway, Daryl Mitchell and Will Young for support. Tom Blundell will continue behind the wicket, with Michael Bracewell the key in the spin department. Neil Wagner, fresh off his signature short-ball exploits against England, will spearhead the pacers along with Southee, the line-up including Matt Henry, Blair Tickner and Scott Kuggeleijn. Jamieson, who was withdrawn from the squad initially named for that England series, is due to undergo back surgery for an injury that has kept him out of international cricket since June 2022. The out-of-contract Trent Boult, who‚Äôs focusing on playing franchise T20 cricket, continues to remain unselected. The two Tests against Sri Lanka are part of the World Test Championship, and while defending champions New Zealand are out of contention for the final, Sri Lanka need to sweep the series 2-0 to have a shot at making the title bout. The first Test will be played in Christchurch, followed by the second in Wellington from March 17. New Zealand Test squad to face Sri Lanka: ( ) Published on By Nathan Lyon led the way with the ball for Australia picking up a magnificent 8-64, his second-best Test figures, as India were bowled out for just 163, setting Australia a target of 76 to seal a famous win.For India, Cheteshwar Pujara led the way with a masterclass on a spinning pitch, scoring 59 and dragging India along with him even as he kept losing partners at the other end. His defiance was ended by a moment of brilliance from Steve Smith, at leg slip, topping off a great day out for him as a captain. Marshalling his resources expertly, Smith did not allow the game to drift away and kept making changes to his bowling attack to not allow the batters to get on top. His moves paid off well when Shreyas Iyer, who had counterattacked with a 27-ball 26 against the spinners, fell as soon as the pacer was brought on, with Usman Khawaja taking a sharp chance at midwicket. This stemmed any momentum that India had a little into the third session, before the lower order capitulated on a raging turner, with the innings ending eerily similar to how it started with Mohammad Siraj swinging wildly against Lyon to be bowled. It had started in similar fashion with Lyon getting past a wildly swinging Shubman Gill in the first over after the Lunch break. While Rohit Sharma kept Pujara company for 58 balls, he too copped one that shot through a tad low from Lyon and was out LBW, with DRS too going against his wishful call. Virat Kohli had a nervy stay in the middle getting past a few close shaves, but on 13 after he had slapped a short ball from Matthew Kuhnemann to the cover boundary, he tried to pull one and was trapped LBW again. The trend continued minutes before Tea, when Lyon ended Ravindra Jadeja‚Äôs dogged 36-ball stay getting him out LBW with the aid of a review. All through this, Pujara managed to be more confident with his footwork drilling a couple of drives to keep the scoreboard ticking along and shaving off the deficit, and briefly along with Iyer India threatened to take a significant lead, with the No.3 registering his 35th Test fifty in the process. However it all came to a rapid halt thanks to some relentlessly accurate spin bowling from Australia. Earlier in the day, despite a collapse that saw Australia lose their last six wickets for 11 runs, the visitors finished with a possibly pivotal lead of 88 runs. Starting the day with a lead of 47, Cameron Green and Peter Handscomb made it Australia‚Äôs first hour seeing it out without much problem. India opted to start with their two left-arm spinners after a brief spell from Mohammed Siraj in that hour and it did not yield the desired results. Both Handscomb and Green used their long reach to smother the spin and defend confidently, and ground the attack out while adding 30 invaluable runs through that hour. However, things took a drastic turn after R Ashwin and Umesh Yadav started operating in tandem in the second hour. Ashwin was the first to get the breakthrough having Handscomb caught at short leg and breaking a stoic partnership worth 40 in 134 balls. In the next over Umesh hit Green on the backfoot and had an LBW decision upheld by the barest of margins as the batter reviewed. This was followed by a demolition job of the tail with Umesh sending the stumps flying to send back Todd Murphy and Mitchell Starc, while Ashwin cleaned up Lyon who missed a big sweep. The collapse saw Australia lose six wickets in less than half an hour, giving India a slight opening but Lyon and Co. ensured that there was no let-up. Australia Published on By Nalanda will have a slight edge over their arch rivals Ananda when the two teams meet in the 93rd Battle of the Maroons at the SSC ground over the weekend (March 4-5). Nalanda do not have the two Sri Lanka Under 19 team members who played key roles during the last season and helped record a historic Big Match victory. But under Chanul Athukorala‚Äôs captaincy Nalanda‚Äôs balance outfit have done well and can challenge any formidable team. One could only get misled if they judge the strength by their tournament standings. They have a strong top order batting line up with wicketkeeper batsman Rusiru Vilochana leading from the front. Vilochana is among the leading batsmen in the tournament, having over 1000 runs against his name. He scored two centuries this season and his 1194 runs have come at an average of 54.3 runs. Yasiru Samarakoon who opens batting has over 500 runs for the season, while Sadew Samarasinghe (over 600runs), Kushmitha Silva (over 400 runs) and Eranga Jayakody (over 500 runs) have all contributed with the bat. Spin trio of Minod Caldera, Sajitha Vithanage and Janula Indusara are the key strike bowlers for Nalanda, while skipper Athukorala shares the new ball duties with Thisara Dewdunu. Off spinner Caldera is their leading wicket taker after having taken 46 wickets this season. Left-arm spinners Vithanage (39 wickets) and Indusara have accounted for more than 60 wickets together. Ananda encountered fluctuating fortunes this season. They entered the first term as an unbeaten team with two outright victories under their belt. Then followed four consecutive defeats. They suffered defeats at the hands of St. Anthony‚Äôs Katugastota (innings and 79 runs), Trinity (by seven wickets), Mahinda (by seven wickets) and Richmond (by 112 runs). That was something unprecedented. But the team led by Nethma Samaraweera have managed to overcome the setback. They concluded the season with a morale boosting victory against Dharmaraja (by nine wickets). Ananda will rely heavily on wicketkeeper batsman Viduna Wijebandara, Iruth Gimshan and Kithma Sithmal for runs as a largely inexperienced side take the field. They are the only players to have aggregated over 400 runs among batsmen who played more than 12 matches this season. There is hope on the likes of Dinada Athalage who have shown promise during the limited opportunities he got. In the bowling department, spinners Kithma Sithmal, Ashinsa Nainayaka, Ayesh Shashimal and Isuru Ayesh are the bowlers to watch. While Sithmal is their leading wicket taker with over 40 wickets against his name, Nainayake, Shashimal and Ayesh have accounted for over 90 wickets together. Their pace attack is spearheaded by skipper Samaraweera and Yehan Gunasinghe. Ananda lead the Big Match tally 12-7. They last won in 2003 under the captaincy of D. Kularatne. Nalanda are the holders of the trophy after registering a historic victory under the captaincy of Dineth Samaraweera last year. Published on By Dawid Malan played the best innings of his ODI career to steer England to a tense three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Mirpur and further his case for inclusion in their World Cup defence in India later this year. England made tough work of a target of 210, slipping to 65 for 4 and 161 for 7 as Bangladesh‚Äôs spinners squeezed the life out of their chase. But Malan, batting at No. 3, saw them home with eight balls to spare, adding an unbroken 51 for the eighth wicket with Adil Rashid to seal the win. Malan has been a peripheral member of England‚Äôs 50-over set-up for most of his career but has taken every opportunity that has come his way in the past nine months. He has now hit hundreds in each of the last four bilateral ODI series he has featured in; given the circumstances, this innings was the pick of them. This fixture started barely 24 hours after the remarkable climax of England‚Äôs Test against New Zealand in Wellington, some 7,000 miles away from Dhaka. They fielded completely separate sides ‚Äì though Will Jacks, an unused squad member at the Basin Reserve, flew to Bangladesh on the second day of the Test, and won his first ODI cap. Joe Root, England‚Äôs leading scorer at the 2019 World Cup, was among those unavailable due to the fixture clash and is nailed on to bat at No. 3 when the schedule allows him to return to the ODI side. Yet Malan is also an experienced opener and, at this stage, looks as strong a candidate as any to fulfil that role alongside Jonny Bairstow. It was not easy-going for Malan, who battled his way to 50 off 92 at the second drinks break as England desperately looked to survive, in particular against the threatening Mehidy Hasan Miraz. But he relieved the scoring pressure after the interval, crashing Mehidy over cover and then lofting him for a straight six, eventually guiding them across the line by working Najmul Hassan Shanto through midwicket. Shanto had top-scored for Bangladesh with a gritty, 82-ball 58 from No. 3 ‚Äì an innings that was not dissimilar to Malan‚Äôs. He extended his recent Bangladesh Premier League form ‚Äì he was the league‚Äôs top-scorer ‚Äì with his maiden ODI half-century, an overdue landmark in his 16th innings. Bangladesh struggled to build partnerships throughout their innings, with Shanto and Mahmadullah combining for Bangladesh‚Äôs only 50-run stand. England shared wickets around, with their three seamers and three spinners both accounting for five batters between them. Tamim Iqbal opted to bat first and made a bright start, hitting four early boundaries after surviving a chance when Chris Woakes put down a caught-and-bowled opportunity in the first over. Litton Das, his opening partner, pulled Woakes for six over square leg as Bangladesh raced to 33 for 0 in 4.4 overs, but was trapped lbw by the next ball he faced. Shanto was also reprieved early, dropped by a sprawling Jason Roy at backward point, but hit his next two balls for four and settled into a rhythm on a slow, low pitch.Mark Wood, playing his first ODI since July 2021, bowled the final over of the initial powerplay and struck with his third ball to remove Tamim. He breached the 90mph/145kph mark with his second ball, then rushed Tamim with his third, a back-of-a-length ball which bounced appreciably; Bangladesh‚Äôs captain could only fend onto his own stumps, via his elbow. Adil Rashid had Mushfiqur Rahim caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep, and Bangladesh were 106 for 4 when Shakib Al Hasan was cleaned up by Moeen Ali. Shanto continued to accumulate, but after reverse-sweeping Rashid for four, he pulled Rashid‚Äôs googly straight to Roy at short midwicket to fall for 58. When Mahmudullah strangled Wood down the leg side, Bangladesh were in danger of being bowled out. Jacks took his maiden ODI wicket when Afif Hossain pulled tamely to mid-on, and Mehidy Hasan edged Archer behind cheaply. Taskin Ahmed hit Rashid for six and then four to ensure Bangladesh would post something competitive before he strangled Archer down the leg side, with Taijul skying a return catch to Moeen to end the innings with 16 balls unused. England struggled for fluency in the chase, and lost Roy in the first over as he chipped to mid-off while looking to hit Shakib over his head. Phil Salt‚Äôs scratchy innings came to an end when Taijul‚Äôs arm ball skidded into his leg stump via his pad and when James Vince was stumped charging the same bowler, England were in trouble at 45 for 3. Soon after, Malan survived a tight lbw shout on review, with ball-tracking predicting Taijul‚Äôs offbreak would have clipped leg stump rather than hitting it flush. Tamim attacked just before the first drinks break, bringing Taskin back into the attack and posting Shanto at slip in the 17th over. He was rewarded immediately, as Jos Buttler steered a back-of-a-length ball straight to the close catcher, bringing Jacks in at No. 6 on debut. Jacks, playing his first List A game since 2019, struggled early on but a flurry of boundaries took scoring pressure off Malan, who was battling hard against Mehidy‚Äôs offbreaks. But Jacks holed out to midwicket for a flashy 26, and when Mehidy‚Äôs final ball skidded into Moeen‚Äôs stumps after a 38-run stand with Malan, England were wobbling. Woakes chipped Taijul to mid-on with 49 runs required and three wickets left, but Rashid proved the perfect foil for Malan. He calmly rotated the strike as Malan opted to attack; with Mustafizur Rahman proving expensive, Tamim eventually ran out of options as England snuck home.

Brook, 24, made Test history by scoring more prolifically across his first nine innings (809) than any other player and hitting 20 sixes along the way. He also showed off his skills with the ball, by getting his maiden test wicket by dismissing New Zealand's Kane Williamson in Wellington. And as part of a new ambassadorial role with Major League Baseball Europe, he will test his big-hitting prowess at a St Louis Cardinals camp in Florida this weekend. 'I‚Äôm intrigued to see how different it is to cricket and what similarities there are too ‚Äì will a home run feel as good as hitting a six?! Harry Brook will switch his sporting attention to Major League Baseball ahead of matches in London this summer I‚Äôm also excited to learn from how other professional sportspeople go about their game and see if there are any transferable skills between batting in baseball and cricket,‚Äô Brook said, in a MLB release. Fellow England star and management stablemate Issy Wong is also involved in promoting the sport in the UK and specifically matches between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs at the London Stadium on June 24-25. Each of them will don MLB stickers on their bats going forward, including at the Indian Premier League and Women‚Äôs Premier League later this month. The MLB games will be first to be played in London since 2019, when the New York Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox. Further matches were then curtailed by COVID-19 pandemic and re-arranged for the summer of 2023.

Rashid ‚Äî on videolink from Bangladesh on Thursday, where England are playing a one-day international series ‚Äî was cross-examined for almost two hours during the Cricket Discipline Commission hearing into allegations of racism at Yorkshire. And the 35-year-old said: ‚ÄòHe (Vaughan) said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too many of you lot‚Äù, followed by words to the effect of, ‚ÄúWe need to have a word‚Äù. I am certain he used the phrase, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too many of you lot‚Äù.‚Äô Rashid‚Äôs witness statement added: ‚ÄòMichael made an ill-judged comment. I heard it. I do not believe that he is racist or that this was said with any bad intention, but it was said.‚Äô Rashid described the comment as ‚Äòbad humour‚Äô. Adil Rashid has confirmed that former England captain Michael Vaughan did make a 'you lot' comment to a group of Yorkshire's Asian players The England spinner also denied that he was pressured to come forward by former team-mate Azeem Rafiq Vaughan categorically denies the allegation and the ECB charge that he caused prejudice or disrepute to cricket. Rashid was one of four players of Asian heritage playing that day, alongside Azeem Rafiq, Ajmal Shahzad and Rana Naveed-Ul-Hasan, and repeatedly confirmed to Christopher Stoner KC ‚Äî Vaughan‚Äôs lawyer ‚Äî that the 2005 Ashes-winning captain made the comment. Rashid was also shown a statement from former Yorkshire bowler Shahzad which said: ‚ÄòI think Adil is being pressurised. I think there are a lot of things that you guys (the ECB) may not be aware of that are happening and it‚Äôs quite murky.‚Äô Rashid, who co-owned a fish and chip shop with Rafiq between 2020 and 2021, denied Shahzad‚Äôs claim, saying: ‚ÄòI did feel pressured by the situation generally. Ajmal speculates that I may have felt under pressure to support Azeem because of a shared interest we had in a fish and chip shop. I am not supporting Azeem because he is a friend or because of any shared business interest.‚Äô He added: ‚ÄòI am giving evidence based on what I heard.‚Äô Rashid was asked about the witness statement of Liz Neto ‚Äî Yorkshire‚Äôs former head of HR ‚Äî who stated that Rashid telephoned her on more than one occasion, appearing distressed and indicating that he felt pressured. She quoted Rashid as saying: ‚ÄòNo matter how many times you tell me I heard it Azeem, I cannot remember hearing it.‚Äô Rashid denied making those comments. He was also asked about the specific words Vaughan allegedly used in 2009, responding: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs too many of you lot, we need to do something about it.‚Äô ‚ÄòJust so you are aware, that is not what is alleged,‚Äô Stoner replied, pointing out the alleged phrase was actually: ‚ÄòThere is too many of you lot, we need to have a word about it.‚Äô ‚ÄòThis is the reality isn‚Äôt it, Mr Rashid?‚Äô Stoner continued. ‚ÄòYou have no clear recollection of what was said on June 22, 2009.‚Äô The long-awaited racism hearing began on Wednesday, with Rashid corroborating Rafiq's claim on the second day In the afternoon session, Rafiq stood by his account of events. ‚ÄòIt made me angry at the time, it has throughout the years and it does today,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòThis man (Vaughan) was a hero of mine. It did cause me upset and anger. ‚ÄòI was a young cricketer, wanting to make my way. When you do speak up, your life and career can be destroyed. The fear of that never allowed me to speak up. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got two choices ‚Äî try and be a professional cricketer and progress or pay the consequences of speaking out against an Ashes-winning England captain.‚Äô The hearing continues on Friday.

If nothing miraculous happens, the visitors will finally taste victory for the first time in this series. A Test win India is rare with the hosts having lost only 2 matches at home in the last 2 years. The two teams to beat them were England in 2021 and Australia themselves back in 2017. If the 3rd loss indeed goes down on Friday, India will only have their top order collapse to blame with only Cheteshwar Pujara the lone resistance against a lethal Nathan Lyon, who ended up taking 8 wickets in the 2nd innings. Pujara‚Äôs 59 was the sole beacon of light in the Indian innings as both openers and Shubman Gill fell cheaply, followed by , and Srikar Bharat. Pujara was ultimately snared by Lyon as took a blinder to dismiss him as India ultimately skittled at 163. Our Senior cricket writer is covering the third Test at Indore. India have just the 76 runs to defend on day three morning. The lowest target defended in this country is 107, in that famous meeting between the hosts and their current visitors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2004. They sure have the resources to pull off a wonder of a result even though Australia sure start as favorites. While on commentary, former Aussie opener Matthew Hayden said, ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs an absolute desert. It is so dry. No way spinners should come to bowl in the sixth over. This is the reason I don‚Äôt like these kinds of surfaces. It shouldn‚Äôt be keeping this low and turning so much on Day 1. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether Australia wins this Test or India. These kinds of surfaces are not good for Test cricket.‚Äù ‚ÄúI cannot believe a player of his class has gone that long without a hundred,‚Äù former Test batter Mark Waugh said on Fox Cricket. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been in good touch recently, he‚Äôs batted well in one-day cricket. I know it‚Äôs not Test match cricket, but the signs have been there in his last three innings in Test cricket that he‚Äôs actually playing pretty well. Umesh Yadav made the stumps cartwheel twice on day two of the third Test, while also completing 100 Test wickets at home, and it was a sight for sore eyes. What. A. Delivery! was on üî• this morning, knocking down the off stump twice! üí™üèª Watch 's reply LIVE in the 3rd MasterCard Test on Star Sports & Disney+Hotstar! -Nathan Lyon second in the list for most wickets by an away bowler in India (53 in 10 matches). -Umesh Yadav becomes only the 5th Indian quick to register 100 Test wickets at home. 13th time Lyon got Pujara out in Tests - the most an Indian batter has got out to any bowler. He also equalled Richie Benaud's tally of most five-wicket hauls (5) vs India in India. Only the 1st time since January 2019, Jadeja has got dismissed for a single digit score twice in a Test. Only the 2nd time India got bundled out under 200 twice in a Test since 1978. Also the second fewest overs (93.5) batted by India in a Test in which they've been bowled out twice. \"Pujara‚Äôs dismissal, I‚Äôve just looked at it, that‚Äôs one of the greatest catches in the history of cricket, that‚Äôs as good as it gets. With his old cobbler‚Äôs back, he had a deteriorating disk, but that just takes me back to Mark Waugh. It‚Äôd be Bobby Simpson, it‚Äôd be every best slips fielder in the history of cricket, they would have loved to have taken that catch,\" the former Australia keeper batter told SENQ Breakfast. During India‚Äôs second innings on day two, skipper Rohit Sharma was caught on camera in a rather animated mood, seemingly unhappy with his batters‚Äô approach in the middle as he conversed with Ishan Kishan in the dressing room. From what it could be understood from Rohit‚Äôs gestures, he seemingly wasn‚Äôt very happy with the conservative approach of the batters and sent Kishan to relay the message in the middle during break. For years Umesh Yadav's father, Tilak toiled in the dark while putting his health at risk breathing in coal dust, writes our senior cricket writer, Devendra Pandey. Umesh, who grabbed three wickets on Thursday morning to help India mount a comeback in the game, had lost his father only last week. A father whose back breaking work and happiness was linked to Umesh's cricket career. ‚ÄúIn cricket anything can happen. We will try our best and bowl tight lines. It is not an easy wicket, whether it is our batters or theirs. It is not easy to step out and hit. ‚ÄúThe ball is keeping low as well, so you can‚Äôt be sure about stepping out. The runs are less but we will stick to tight lines and push as much as we can,‚Äù said Umesh, who picked up three wickets on Thursday to help India dismiss Australia early in the first session. 10/119: Ajaz Patel, Mumbai 2021/22 8/50: Nathan Lyon, Bangalore 2016/17 8/64: Lance Klusener, Kolkata 1996/97 Sandip G, our man on the ground in Indore, writes on the dramatic day two of the Indore Test that saw 16 wickets falling across two innings and Nathan Lyon picking an 8-fer, inspiring Australia to set themselves a total of 76 to chase and win the first Test of the 2023 Border Gavaskar Trophy. Cheteshwar Pujara, the man who brought some semblance of respectability to the Indian innings on Thursday, said that the secret of negotiating turn and bounce on a pitch like the one at Indore was trusting your defence. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tough pitch to bat on. It‚Äôs not easy, you need to trust your defence, make sure you need to get to the pitch or, if it‚Äôs short, play off the back foot,‚Äù said Pujara. Asked about the strategy needed on this track, Pujara said: \"You need to attack and defend, a mix, on this pitch. If you keep defending, one ball will bounce and hit your glove. My aim was to be a bit more positive, try and score as many as possible.‚Äù He scored nearly half of India‚Äôs second-innings runs. Just when Pujara had started to appear threatening to the Australians, Steve Smith took a blinder to dismiss him on Thursday. It would not be an over exaggeration to state that the catch was the turning point of Day 2, and could be of the match as well since Pujara was batting with composure. India suffered a humbling batting collapse against Australia in 3rd Test at Indore, a section of fans in the stands at Holkar Stadium started a chant for Rishabh Pant. Pant suffered a horrific accident in December 30, which required him to undergo lengthy treatment. it will also mean he will miss a lot of international cricket this year. While fans in the stadiums are missing Pant, it didn't help that his replacement, Srikar Bharat, has had a forgettable series so far: scoring 8, 6, 23, 17 and 3 in 5 innings. Sandip G, our man on the ground in Indore, writes that Lyon's dismantling of Rohit Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja on Thursday shows why he is the greatest of all time. He also points out that while Shane Warne has just the one five-wicket haul in India, Lyon already has five in the country. Nathan Lyon was incredible on Thursday, taking eight Indian wickets in 23.3 overs while conceding just 64 runs. Barring Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer, he was behind all of the Indian specialist batters going back to the hut on Thursday. The 35-year-old is playing in his 118th Test and has taken 479 wickets. A fighting 59-run knock from Cheteshwar Pujara was the saving grace for the hosts in the second innings as they collapsed for a paltry 163 runs in the second innings. In the first, they had managed to score just 109 runs. Australia, who scored 197 in their first innings, need just 76 runs to win. Pujara patiently stitched together his innings, using up 142 balls to make his score before perishing to a ball from Nathan Lyon. For most of their time in India, the visiting Australian side has been staring down the barrel, losing both the first two Tests in three days. But in Indore, at long last, things have gone their way and they now find themselves needing just 76 runs to claim a back-to-the-wall victory. it won't help them regain the Border Gavaskar Trophy, but it will be some consolation to make the series 2-1 and put pressure on the hosts going to Ahmedabad. Right then. Here's a bit of recap. On day two of the third Test match, India manage to bundle Australia out for 197, giving away only 40 runs to their total of day one. With Australia leading by 88 runs, India could only manage a lead of 75 of their own as Nathan Lyon (8/64) ran through the Indian lineup, the hosts being dismissed for 163. Another day three finish on cards, the only question, do India have something out of this world on the cards to defend a total of 76?","pubDate":"2023-03-03 01:30:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Horror injury blow for Aussie ODI hopeful","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/daniel-hughes-suffers-suspected-calf-tear-in-huge-blow-to-odi-hopes/news-story/5505797e67173c58c51b1c242b7ce17f","keywords":["Breaking News","Cricket news and galleries","National Breaking News","NewsWire","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australian one-day hopeful Daniel Hughes has been forced out of his side‚Äôs Sheffield Shield clash against Victoria after scans confirmed a torn calf muscle.","content":"Cricket Don't miss out on the headlines from Cricket.

Australian one-day hopeful Daniel Hughes has been forced out of his side‚Äôs Sheffield Shield clash against Victoria after scans confirmed a torn calf muscle. The 34-year-old pulled up after taking off for a single and was unable to put any weight back on his leg, forcing him to retire hurt on 22 amid a difficult first few hours for NSW. Hughes may have been called upon to join the Australian one-day side in India if David Warner was not cleared fit to play, but the injury is almost certainly a fatal blow to his hopes of a national callup. The left-hander had been in career-best form, leading the run-scoring in the Marsh Cup with 548 runs at an average of 78, including four centuries. Daniel Hughes had to be helped off Lavington Sports Ground in Albury after he suffered a suspected calf tear while batting on day one of NSW‚Äôs Sheffield Shield match against Victoria. Picture: Albert Perez / Getty Images Victoria‚Äôs young fast bowlers caused problems on day one of the Shield fixture in Albury, with Mitch Perry claiming 4-24 and Fergus O‚ÄôNeill also picking up two wickets as NSW was bowled out for 203. Chris Green was again the first innings‚Äô topscorer for the Blues with 52, and put on 57 for the eighth wicket with Trent Copeland to steer them away from trouble at 7-136. Copeland removed Travis Dean before stumps to leave the Vics 1-15 in reply. At the Gabba, another impressive cameo with the bat from Ben Manenti took South Australia into a strong position against Queensland after it had slumped to 6-111 earlier in the day. Ben Manenti has been in fine form with the bat this season for the Redbacks. Picture: Chris Hyde / Getty Images The 25-year-old, who has nailed down a spot in the Redbacks side after moving from NSW via Tasmania, struck 88 from 101 balls to stamp his all-round credentials before he was dismissed by Xavier Bartlett late on day one. The innings carried the off-spinner into fifth on the Sheffield Shield leading run-scorers‚Äô list at stumps, with 534 runs at 49. South Australia was 7-227 after 67 overs, with Bartlett and Michael Neser each claiming three wickets and Jake Lehmann earlier making an important 65 at better than a run-a-ball, after coming to the crease at 3-33. Just before tea in Perth, Tasmania was 4-139 after winning the toss and electing to bat, with openers Tim Ward and Caleb Jewell both dismissed in the 40s.

Followed categories will be added to My News. Australia will arrive in England refreshed and ready to continue their peerless record in international cricket ahead of the Ashes in June, coach Shelley Nitschke says. A dozen members of Australia‚Äôs winning T20 World Cup squad have arrived in India for the inaugural Women‚Äôs Premier League that begins on Sunday, but Nitschke said their impressive ability to switch off from cricket would hold them in good stead despite the whirlwind trip overseas. Meg Lanning was named as the third Australian captain of the five WPL franchises on Wednesday when she was appointed skipper of the Delhi Capitals, with Beth Mooney taking the reins at the Gujarat Giants and Alyssa Healy in charge of the Uttar Pradesh Warriorz. The timing of the tournament auction, wedged between Australia‚Äôs first and second World Cup group games, was awkward, but the discipline of the side to switch their focus back to the task at hand showed that the players would not be burned out from the WPL ahead of a big northern summer, Nitschke said. Meg Lanning with Delhi Capitals chief executive AS Sundaresan and head coach Jonathan Batty after being named the inaugural captain of the WPL franchise. Picture: Indranil Mukherjee / AFP ‚ÄúWhile the World Cup was going on, there was an element of talking about (the WPL) but not wanting to get too caught up,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere was still getting the job done in South Africa, and then once that was finished, among the celebrations that focus started to shift ‚Ä¶ credit to them for keeping their eyes on the prize. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a testament to them and also probably contributes to some of our success ‚Äì when you‚Äôre in tournaments, it‚Äôs that ability to switch off but then knowing that when you need to be on, you‚Äôre on.‚Äù Nitschke said she was not concerned by the how the tight WPL schedule ‚Äì 22 games played in 23 days ‚Äì might wear down Australia‚Äôs players following a packed fixture in South Africa. Australia coach Shelley Nitschke (right) says a key reason for Australia‚Äôs ongoing success is the players‚Äô ability to switch focus after celebrating their wins.

His defiance was ended by a moment of brilliance from Steve Smith, at leg slip, topping off a great day out for him as a captain. Marshalling his resources expertly, Smith did not allow the game to drift away and kept making changes to his bowling attack to not allow the batters to get on top. His moves paid off well when Shreyas Iyer, who had counterattacked with a 27-ball 26 against the spinners, fell as soon as the pacer was brought on, with Usman Khawaja taking a sharp chance at midwicket. This stemmed any momentum that India had a little into the third session, before the lower order capitulated on a raging turner, with the innings ending eerily similar to how it started with Mohammad Siraj swinging wildly against Lyon to be bowled. It had started in similar fashion with Lyon getting past a wildly swinging Shubman Gill in the first over after the Lunch break. While Rohit Sharma kept Pujara company for 58 balls, he too copped one that shot through a tad low from Lyon and was out LBW, with DRS too going against his wishful call. Virat Kohli had a nervy stay in the middle getting past a few close shaves, but on 13 after he had slapped a short ball from Matthew Kuhnemann to the cover boundary, he tried to pull one and was trapped LBW again. The trend continued minutes before Tea, when Lyon ended Ravindra Jadeja‚Äôs dogged 36-ball stay getting him out LBW with the aid of a review. All through this, Pujara managed to be more confident with his footwork drilling a couple of drives to keep the scoreboard ticking along and shaving off the deficit, and briefly along with Iyer India threatened to take a significant lead, with the No.3 registering his 35th Test fifty in the process. However it all came to a rapid halt thanks to some relentlessly accurate spin bowling from Australia. Earlier in the day, despite a collapse that saw Australia lose their last six wickets for 11 runs, the visitors finished with a possibly pivotal lead of 88 runs. Starting the day with a lead of 47, Cameron Green and Peter Handscomb made it Australia‚Äôs first hour seeing it out without much problem. India opted to start with their two left-arm spinners after a brief spell from Mohammed Siraj in that hour and it did not yield the desired results. Both Handscomb and Green used their long reach to smother the spin and defend confidently, and ground the attack out while adding 30 invaluable runs through that hour. However, things took a drastic turn after R Ashwin and Umesh Yadav started operating in tandem in the second hour. Ashwin was the first to get the breakthrough having Handscomb caught at short leg and breaking a stoic partnership worth 40 in 134 balls. In the next over Umesh hit Green on the backfoot and had an LBW decision upheld by the barest of margins as the batter reviewed. This was followed by a demolition job of the tail with Umesh sending the stumps flying to send back Todd Murphy and Mitchell Starc, while Ashwin cleaned up Lyon who missed a big sweep. The collapse saw Australia lose six wickets in less than half an hour, giving India a slight opening but Lyon and Co. ensured that there was no let-up. Australia Published on By Nalanda will have a slight edge over their arch rivals Ananda when the two teams meet in the 93rd Battle of the Maroons at the SSC ground over the weekend (March 4-5). Nalanda do not have the two Sri Lanka Under 19 team members who played key roles during the last season and helped record a historic Big Match victory. But under Chanul Athukorala‚Äôs captaincy Nalanda‚Äôs balance outfit have done well and can challenge any formidable team. One could only get misled if they judge the strength by their tournament standings. They have a strong top order batting line up with wicketkeeper batsman Rusiru Vilochana leading from the front. Vilochana is among the leading batsmen in the tournament, having over 1000 runs against his name. He scored two centuries this season and his 1194 runs have come at an average of 54.3 runs. Yasiru Samarakoon who opens batting has over 500 runs for the season, while Sadew Samarasinghe (over 600runs), Kushmitha Silva (over 400 runs) and Eranga Jayakody (over 500 runs) have all contributed with the bat. Spin trio of Minod Caldera, Sajitha Vithanage and Janula Indusara are the key strike bowlers for Nalanda, while skipper Athukorala shares the new ball duties with Thisara Dewdunu. Off spinner Caldera is their leading wicket taker after having taken 46 wickets this season. Left-arm spinners Vithanage (39 wickets) and Indusara have accounted for more than 60 wickets together. Ananda encountered fluctuating fortunes this season. They entered the first term as an unbeaten team with two outright victories under their belt. Then followed four consecutive defeats. They suffered defeats at the hands of St. Anthony‚Äôs Katugastota (innings and 79 runs), Trinity (by seven wickets), Mahinda (by seven wickets) and Richmond (by 112 runs). That was something unprecedented. But the team led by Nethma Samaraweera have managed to overcome the setback. They concluded the season with a morale boosting victory against Dharmaraja (by nine wickets). Ananda will rely heavily on wicketkeeper batsman Viduna Wijebandara, Iruth Gimshan and Kithma Sithmal for runs as a largely inexperienced side take the field. They are the only players to have aggregated over 400 runs among batsmen who played more than 12 matches this season. There is hope on the likes of Dinada Athalage who have shown promise during the limited opportunities he got. In the bowling department, spinners Kithma Sithmal, Ashinsa Nainayaka, Ayesh Shashimal and Isuru Ayesh are the bowlers to watch. While Sithmal is their leading wicket taker with over 40 wickets against his name, Nainayake, Shashimal and Ayesh have accounted for over 90 wickets together. Their pace attack is spearheaded by skipper Samaraweera and Yehan Gunasinghe. Ananda lead the Big Match tally 12-7. They last won in 2003 under the captaincy of D. Kularatne. Nalanda are the holders of the trophy after registering a historic victory under the captaincy of Dineth Samaraweera last year. Published on By Dawid Malan played the best innings of his ODI career to steer England to a tense three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Mirpur and further his case for inclusion in their World Cup defence in India later this year. England made tough work of a target of 210, slipping to 65 for 4 and 161 for 7 as Bangladesh‚Äôs spinners squeezed the life out of their chase. But Malan, batting at No. 3, saw them home with eight balls to spare, adding an unbroken 51 for the eighth wicket with Adil Rashid to seal the win. Malan has been a peripheral member of England‚Äôs 50-over set-up for most of his career but has taken every opportunity that has come his way in the past nine months. He has now hit hundreds in each of the last four bilateral ODI series he has featured in; given the circumstances, this innings was the pick of them. This fixture started barely 24 hours after the remarkable climax of England‚Äôs Test against New Zealand in Wellington, some 7,000 miles away from Dhaka. They fielded completely separate sides ‚Äì though Will Jacks, an unused squad member at the Basin Reserve, flew to Bangladesh on the second day of the Test, and won his first ODI cap. Joe Root, England‚Äôs leading scorer at the 2019 World Cup, was among those unavailable due to the fixture clash and is nailed on to bat at No. 3 when the schedule allows him to return to the ODI side. Yet Malan is also an experienced opener and, at this stage, looks as strong a candidate as any to fulfil that role alongside Jonny Bairstow. It was not easy-going for Malan, who battled his way to 50 off 92 at the second drinks break as England desperately looked to survive, in particular against the threatening Mehidy Hasan Miraz. But he relieved the scoring pressure after the interval, crashing Mehidy over cover and then lofting him for a straight six, eventually guiding them across the line by working Najmul Hassan Shanto through midwicket. Shanto had top-scored for Bangladesh with a gritty, 82-ball 58 from No. 3 ‚Äì an innings that was not dissimilar to Malan‚Äôs. He extended his recent Bangladesh Premier League form ‚Äì he was the league‚Äôs top-scorer ‚Äì with his maiden ODI half-century, an overdue landmark in his 16th innings. Bangladesh struggled to build partnerships throughout their innings, with Shanto and Mahmadullah combining for Bangladesh‚Äôs only 50-run stand. England shared wickets around, with their three seamers and three spinners both accounting for five batters between them. Tamim Iqbal opted to bat first and made a bright start, hitting four early boundaries after surviving a chance when Chris Woakes put down a caught-and-bowled opportunity in the first over. Litton Das, his opening partner, pulled Woakes for six over square leg as Bangladesh raced to 33 for 0 in 4.4 overs, but was trapped lbw by the next ball he faced. Shanto was also reprieved early, dropped by a sprawling Jason Roy at backward point, but hit his next two balls for four and settled into a rhythm on a slow, low pitch.Mark Wood, playing his first ODI since July 2021, bowled the final over of the initial powerplay and struck with his third ball to remove Tamim. He breached the 90mph/145kph mark with his second ball, then rushed Tamim with his third, a back-of-a-length ball which bounced appreciably; Bangladesh‚Äôs captain could only fend onto his own stumps, via his elbow. Adil Rashid had Mushfiqur Rahim caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep, and Bangladesh were 106 for 4 when Shakib Al Hasan was cleaned up by Moeen Ali. Shanto continued to accumulate, but after reverse-sweeping Rashid for four, he pulled Rashid‚Äôs googly straight to Roy at short midwicket to fall for 58. When Mahmudullah strangled Wood down the leg side, Bangladesh were in danger of being bowled out. Jacks took his maiden ODI wicket when Afif Hossain pulled tamely to mid-on, and Mehidy Hasan edged Archer behind cheaply. Taskin Ahmed hit Rashid for six and then four to ensure Bangladesh would post something competitive before he strangled Archer down the leg side, with Taijul skying a return catch to Moeen to end the innings with 16 balls unused. England struggled for fluency in the chase, and lost Roy in the first over as he chipped to mid-off while looking to hit Shakib over his head. Phil Salt‚Äôs scratchy innings came to an end when Taijul‚Äôs arm ball skidded into his leg stump via his pad and when James Vince was stumped charging the same bowler, England were in trouble at 45 for 3. Soon after, Malan survived a tight lbw shout on review, with ball-tracking predicting Taijul‚Äôs offbreak would have clipped leg stump rather than hitting it flush. Tamim attacked just before the first drinks break, bringing Taskin back into the attack and posting Shanto at slip in the 17th over. He was rewarded immediately, as Jos Buttler steered a back-of-a-length ball straight to the close catcher, bringing Jacks in at No. 6 on debut. Jacks, playing his first List A game since 2019, struggled early on but a flurry of boundaries took scoring pressure off Malan, who was battling hard against Mehidy‚Äôs offbreaks. But Jacks holed out to midwicket for a flashy 26, and when Mehidy‚Äôs final ball skidded into Moeen‚Äôs stumps after a 38-run stand with Malan, England were wobbling. Woakes chipped Taijul to mid-on with 49 runs required and three wickets left, but Rashid proved the perfect foil for Malan. He calmly rotated the strike as Malan opted to attack; with Mustafizur Rahman proving expensive, Tamim eventually ran out of options as England snuck home. Bangladesh ( ) Published on By There were no surprises in the 13 New Zealand named for their two-Test series against Sri Lanka that begins on March 9. All 13 players who featured in their recent 1-1 draw with England were named, with the omissions from that squad being the uncapped seamer Jacob Duffy, legspinner Ish Sodhi, and the injured Kyle Jamieson. Tim Southee will lead the squad that is coming off the high of becoming only the fourth team to win after following on, in a dramatic game which they snatched by one run in Wellington to level the series against England. The batting will continue to be anchored by Kane Williamson, with Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Devon Conway, Daryl Mitchell and Will Young for support. Tom Blundell will continue behind the wicket, with Michael Bracewell the key in the spin department. Neil Wagner, fresh off his signature short-ball exploits against England, will spearhead the pacers along with Southee, the line-up including Matt Henry, Blair Tickner and Scott Kuggeleijn. Jamieson, who was withdrawn from the squad initially named for that England series, is due to undergo back surgery for an injury that has kept him out of international cricket since June 2022. The out-of-contract Trent Boult, who‚Äôs focusing on playing franchise T20 cricket, continues to remain unselected. The two Tests against Sri Lanka are part of the World Test Championship, and while defending champions New Zealand are out of contention for the final, Sri Lanka need to sweep the series 2-0 to have a shot at making the title bout. The first Test will be played in Christchurch, followed by the second in Wellington from March 17.

Their pace attack is spearheaded by skipper Samaraweera and Yehan Gunasinghe. Ananda lead the Big Match tally 12-7. They last won in 2003 under the captaincy of D. Kularatne. Nalanda are the holders of the trophy after registering a historic victory under the captaincy of Dineth Samaraweera last year. Published on By Nathan Lyon led the way with the ball for Australia picking up a magnificent 8-64, his second-best Test figures, as India were bowled out for just 163, setting Australia a target of 76 to seal a famous win.For India, Cheteshwar Pujara led the way with a masterclass on a spinning pitch, scoring 59 and dragging India along with him even as he kept losing partners at the other end. His defiance was ended by a moment of brilliance from Steve Smith, at leg slip, topping off a great day out for him as a captain. Marshalling his resources expertly, Smith did not allow the game to drift away and kept making changes to his bowling attack to not allow the batters to get on top. His moves paid off well when Shreyas Iyer, who had counterattacked with a 27-ball 26 against the spinners, fell as soon as the pacer was brought on, with Usman Khawaja taking a sharp chance at midwicket. This stemmed any momentum that India had a little into the third session, before the lower order capitulated on a raging turner, with the innings ending eerily similar to how it started with Mohammad Siraj swinging wildly against Lyon to be bowled. It had started in similar fashion with Lyon getting past a wildly swinging Shubman Gill in the first over after the Lunch break. While Rohit Sharma kept Pujara company for 58 balls, he too copped one that shot through a tad low from Lyon and was out LBW, with DRS too going against his wishful call. Virat Kohli had a nervy stay in the middle getting past a few close shaves, but on 13 after he had slapped a short ball from Matthew Kuhnemann to the cover boundary, he tried to pull one and was trapped LBW again. The trend continued minutes before Tea, when Lyon ended Ravindra Jadeja‚Äôs dogged 36-ball stay getting him out LBW with the aid of a review. All through this, Pujara managed to be more confident with his footwork drilling a couple of drives to keep the scoreboard ticking along and shaving off the deficit, and briefly along with Iyer India threatened to take a significant lead, with the No.3 registering his 35th Test fifty in the process. However it all came to a rapid halt thanks to some relentlessly accurate spin bowling from Australia. Earlier in the day, despite a collapse that saw Australia lose their last six wickets for 11 runs, the visitors finished with a possibly pivotal lead of 88 runs. Starting the day with a lead of 47, Cameron Green and Peter Handscomb made it Australia‚Äôs first hour seeing it out without much problem. India opted to start with their two left-arm spinners after a brief spell from Mohammed Siraj in that hour and it did not yield the desired results. Both Handscomb and Green used their long reach to smother the spin and defend confidently, and ground the attack out while adding 30 invaluable runs through that hour. However, things took a drastic turn after R Ashwin and Umesh Yadav started operating in tandem in the second hour. Ashwin was the first to get the breakthrough having Handscomb caught at short leg and breaking a stoic partnership worth 40 in 134 balls. In the next over Umesh hit Green on the backfoot and had an LBW decision upheld by the barest of margins as the batter reviewed. This was followed by a demolition job of the tail with Umesh sending the stumps flying to send back Todd Murphy and Mitchell Starc, while Ashwin cleaned up Lyon who missed a big sweep. The collapse saw Australia lose six wickets in less than half an hour, giving India a slight opening but Lyon and Co. ensured that there was no let-up. Australia Published on By Dawid Malan played the best innings of his ODI career to steer England to a tense three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Mirpur and further his case for inclusion in their World Cup defence in India later this year. England made tough work of a target of 210, slipping to 65 for 4 and 161 for 7 as Bangladesh‚Äôs spinners squeezed the life out of their chase. But Malan, batting at No. 3, saw them home with eight balls to spare, adding an unbroken 51 for the eighth wicket with Adil Rashid to seal the win. Malan has been a peripheral member of England‚Äôs 50-over set-up for most of his career but has taken every opportunity that has come his way in the past nine months. He has now hit hundreds in each of the last four bilateral ODI series he has featured in; given the circumstances, this innings was the pick of them. This fixture started barely 24 hours after the remarkable climax of England‚Äôs Test against New Zealand in Wellington, some 7,000 miles away from Dhaka. They fielded completely separate sides ‚Äì though Will Jacks, an unused squad member at the Basin Reserve, flew to Bangladesh on the second day of the Test, and won his first ODI cap. Joe Root, England‚Äôs leading scorer at the 2019 World Cup, was among those unavailable due to the fixture clash and is nailed on to bat at No. 3 when the schedule allows him to return to the ODI side. Yet Malan is also an experienced opener and, at this stage, looks as strong a candidate as any to fulfil that role alongside Jonny Bairstow. It was not easy-going for Malan, who battled his way to 50 off 92 at the second drinks break as England desperately looked to survive, in particular against the threatening Mehidy Hasan Miraz. But he relieved the scoring pressure after the interval, crashing Mehidy over cover and then lofting him for a straight six, eventually guiding them across the line by working Najmul Hassan Shanto through midwicket. Shanto had top-scored for Bangladesh with a gritty, 82-ball 58 from No. 3 ‚Äì an innings that was not dissimilar to Malan‚Äôs. He extended his recent Bangladesh Premier League form ‚Äì he was the league‚Äôs top-scorer ‚Äì with his maiden ODI half-century, an overdue landmark in his 16th innings. Bangladesh struggled to build partnerships throughout their innings, with Shanto and Mahmadullah combining for Bangladesh‚Äôs only 50-run stand. England shared wickets around, with their three seamers and three spinners both accounting for five batters between them. Tamim Iqbal opted to bat first and made a bright start, hitting four early boundaries after surviving a chance when Chris Woakes put down a caught-and-bowled opportunity in the first over. Litton Das, his opening partner, pulled Woakes for six over square leg as Bangladesh raced to 33 for 0 in 4.4 overs, but was trapped lbw by the next ball he faced. Shanto was also reprieved early, dropped by a sprawling Jason Roy at backward point, but hit his next two balls for four and settled into a rhythm on a slow, low pitch.Mark Wood, playing his first ODI since July 2021, bowled the final over of the initial powerplay and struck with his third ball to remove Tamim. He breached the 90mph/145kph mark with his second ball, then rushed Tamim with his third, a back-of-a-length ball which bounced appreciably; Bangladesh‚Äôs captain could only fend onto his own stumps, via his elbow. Adil Rashid had Mushfiqur Rahim caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep, and Bangladesh were 106 for 4 when Shakib Al Hasan was cleaned up by Moeen Ali. Shanto continued to accumulate, but after reverse-sweeping Rashid for four, he pulled Rashid‚Äôs googly straight to Roy at short midwicket to fall for 58. When Mahmudullah strangled Wood down the leg side, Bangladesh were in danger of being bowled out. Jacks took his maiden ODI wicket when Afif Hossain pulled tamely to mid-on, and Mehidy Hasan edged Archer behind cheaply. Taskin Ahmed hit Rashid for six and then four to ensure Bangladesh would post something competitive before he strangled Archer down the leg side, with Taijul skying a return catch to Moeen to end the innings with 16 balls unused. England struggled for fluency in the chase, and lost Roy in the first over as he chipped to mid-off while looking to hit Shakib over his head. Phil Salt‚Äôs scratchy innings came to an end when Taijul‚Äôs arm ball skidded into his leg stump via his pad and when James Vince was stumped charging the same bowler, England were in trouble at 45 for 3. Soon after, Malan survived a tight lbw shout on review, with ball-tracking predicting Taijul‚Äôs offbreak would have clipped leg stump rather than hitting it flush. Tamim attacked just before the first drinks break, bringing Taskin back into the attack and posting Shanto at slip in the 17th over. He was rewarded immediately, as Jos Buttler steered a back-of-a-length ball straight to the close catcher, bringing Jacks in at No. 6 on debut. Jacks, playing his first List A game since 2019, struggled early on but a flurry of boundaries took scoring pressure off Malan, who was battling hard against Mehidy‚Äôs offbreaks. But Jacks holed out to midwicket for a flashy 26, and when Mehidy‚Äôs final ball skidded into Moeen‚Äôs stumps after a 38-run stand with Malan, England were wobbling. Woakes chipped Taijul to mid-on with 49 runs required and three wickets left, but Rashid proved the perfect foil for Malan. He calmly rotated the strike as Malan opted to attack; with Mustafizur Rahman proving expensive, Tamim eventually ran out of options as England snuck home. Bangladesh ( ) Published on By There were no surprises in the 13 New Zealand named for their two-Test series against Sri Lanka that begins on March 9. All 13 players who featured in their recent 1-1 draw with England were named, with the omissions from that squad being the uncapped seamer Jacob Duffy, legspinner Ish Sodhi, and the injured Kyle Jamieson. Tim Southee will lead the squad that is coming off the high of becoming only the fourth team to win after following on, in a dramatic game which they snatched by one run in Wellington to level the series against England. The batting will continue to be anchored by Kane Williamson, with Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Devon Conway, Daryl Mitchell and Will Young for support. Tom Blundell will continue behind the wicket, with Michael Bracewell the key in the spin department. Neil Wagner, fresh off his signature short-ball exploits against England, will spearhead the pacers along with Southee, the line-up including Matt Henry, Blair Tickner and Scott Kuggeleijn. Jamieson, who was withdrawn from the squad initially named for that England series, is due to undergo back surgery for an injury that has kept him out of international cricket since June 2022. The out-of-contract Trent Boult, who‚Äôs focusing on playing franchise T20 cricket, continues to remain unselected. The two Tests against Sri Lanka are part of the World Test Championship, and while defending champions New Zealand are out of contention for the final, Sri Lanka need to sweep the series 2-0 to have a shot at making the title bout. The first Test will be played in Christchurch, followed by the second in Wellington from March 17.

Australia Published on By Nalanda will have a slight edge over their arch rivals Ananda when the two teams meet in the 93rd Battle of the Maroons at the SSC ground over the weekend (March 4-5). Nalanda do not have the two Sri Lanka Under 19 team members who played key roles during the last season and helped record a historic Big Match victory. But under Chanul Athukorala‚Äôs captaincy Nalanda‚Äôs balance outfit have done well and can challenge any formidable team. One could only get misled if they judge the strength by their tournament standings. They have a strong top order batting line up with wicketkeeper batsman Rusiru Vilochana leading from the front. Vilochana is among the leading batsmen in the tournament, having over 1000 runs against his name. He scored two centuries this season and his 1194 runs have come at an average of 54.3 runs. Yasiru Samarakoon who opens batting has over 500 runs for the season, while Sadew Samarasinghe (over 600runs), Kushmitha Silva (over 400 runs) and Eranga Jayakody (over 500 runs) have all contributed with the bat. Spin trio of Minod Caldera, Sajitha Vithanage and Janula Indusara are the key strike bowlers for Nalanda, while skipper Athukorala shares the new ball duties with Thisara Dewdunu. Off spinner Caldera is their leading wicket taker after having taken 46 wickets this season. Left-arm spinners Vithanage (39 wickets) and Indusara have accounted for more than 60 wickets together. Ananda encountered fluctuating fortunes this season. They entered the first term as an unbeaten team with two outright victories under their belt. Then followed four consecutive defeats. They suffered defeats at the hands of St. Anthony‚Äôs Katugastota (innings and 79 runs), Trinity (by seven wickets), Mahinda (by seven wickets) and Richmond (by 112 runs). That was something unprecedented. But the team led by Nethma Samaraweera have managed to overcome the setback. They concluded the season with a morale boosting victory against Dharmaraja (by nine wickets). Ananda will rely heavily on wicketkeeper batsman Viduna Wijebandara, Iruth Gimshan and Kithma Sithmal for runs as a largely inexperienced side take the field. They are the only players to have aggregated over 400 runs among batsmen who played more than 12 matches this season. There is hope on the likes of Dinada Athalage who have shown promise during the limited opportunities he got. In the bowling department, spinners Kithma Sithmal, Ashinsa Nainayaka, Ayesh Shashimal and Isuru Ayesh are the bowlers to watch. While Sithmal is their leading wicket taker with over 40 wickets against his name, Nainayake, Shashimal and Ayesh have accounted for over 90 wickets together.

That was something unprecedented. But the team led by Nethma Samaraweera have managed to overcome the setback. They concluded the season with a morale boosting victory against Dharmaraja (by nine wickets). Ananda will rely heavily on wicketkeeper batsman Viduna Wijebandara, Iruth Gimshan and Kithma Sithmal for runs as a largely inexperienced side take the field. They are the only players to have aggregated over 400 runs among batsmen who played more than 12 matches this season. There is hope on the likes of Dinada Athalage who have shown promise during the limited opportunities he got. In the bowling department, spinners Kithma Sithmal, Ashinsa Nainayaka, Ayesh Shashimal and Isuru Ayesh are the bowlers to watch. While Sithmal is their leading wicket taker with over 40 wickets against his name, Nainayake, Shashimal and Ayesh have accounted for over 90 wickets together. Their pace attack is spearheaded by skipper Samaraweera and Yehan Gunasinghe. Ananda lead the Big Match tally 12-7. They last won in 2003 under the captaincy of D. Kularatne. Nalanda are the holders of the trophy after registering a historic victory under the captaincy of Dineth Samaraweera last year. Published on By Dawid Malan played the best innings of his ODI career to steer England to a tense three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Mirpur and further his case for inclusion in their World Cup defence in India later this year. England made tough work of a target of 210, slipping to 65 for 4 and 161 for 7 as Bangladesh‚Äôs spinners squeezed the life out of their chase. But Malan, batting at No. 3, saw them home with eight balls to spare, adding an unbroken 51 for the eighth wicket with Adil Rashid to seal the win. Malan has been a peripheral member of England‚Äôs 50-over set-up for most of his career but has taken every opportunity that has come his way in the past nine months. He has now hit hundreds in each of the last four bilateral ODI series he has featured in; given the circumstances, this innings was the pick of them. This fixture started barely 24 hours after the remarkable climax of England‚Äôs Test against New Zealand in Wellington, some 7,000 miles away from Dhaka. They fielded completely separate sides ‚Äì though Will Jacks, an unused squad member at the Basin Reserve, flew to Bangladesh on the second day of the Test, and won his first ODI cap. Joe Root, England‚Äôs leading scorer at the 2019 World Cup, was among those unavailable due to the fixture clash and is nailed on to bat at No. 3 when the schedule allows him to return to the ODI side. Yet Malan is also an experienced opener and, at this stage, looks as strong a candidate as any to fulfil that role alongside Jonny Bairstow. It was not easy-going for Malan, who battled his way to 50 off 92 at the second drinks break as England desperately looked to survive, in particular against the threatening Mehidy Hasan Miraz. But he relieved the scoring pressure after the interval, crashing Mehidy over cover and then lofting him for a straight six, eventually guiding them across the line by working Najmul Hassan Shanto through midwicket. Shanto had top-scored for Bangladesh with a gritty, 82-ball 58 from No. 3 ‚Äì an innings that was not dissimilar to Malan‚Äôs. He extended his recent Bangladesh Premier League form ‚Äì he was the league‚Äôs top-scorer ‚Äì with his maiden ODI half-century, an overdue landmark in his 16th innings. Bangladesh struggled to build partnerships throughout their innings, with Shanto and Mahmadullah combining for Bangladesh‚Äôs only 50-run stand. England shared wickets around, with their three seamers and three spinners both accounting for five batters between them. Tamim Iqbal opted to bat first and made a bright start, hitting four early boundaries after surviving a chance when Chris Woakes put down a caught-and-bowled opportunity in the first over. Litton Das, his opening partner, pulled Woakes for six over square leg as Bangladesh raced to 33 for 0 in 4.4 overs, but was trapped lbw by the next ball he faced. Shanto was also reprieved early, dropped by a sprawling Jason Roy at backward point, but hit his next two balls for four and settled into a rhythm on a slow, low pitch.Mark Wood, playing his first ODI since July 2021, bowled the final over of the initial powerplay and struck with his third ball to remove Tamim. He breached the 90mph/145kph mark with his second ball, then rushed Tamim with his third, a back-of-a-length ball which bounced appreciably; Bangladesh‚Äôs captain could only fend onto his own stumps, via his elbow. Adil Rashid had Mushfiqur Rahim caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep, and Bangladesh were 106 for 4 when Shakib Al Hasan was cleaned up by Moeen Ali. Shanto continued to accumulate, but after reverse-sweeping Rashid for four, he pulled Rashid‚Äôs googly straight to Roy at short midwicket to fall for 58. When Mahmudullah strangled Wood down the leg side, Bangladesh were in danger of being bowled out. Jacks took his maiden ODI wicket when Afif Hossain pulled tamely to mid-on, and Mehidy Hasan edged Archer behind cheaply. Taskin Ahmed hit Rashid for six and then four to ensure Bangladesh would post something competitive before he strangled Archer down the leg side, with Taijul skying a return catch to Moeen to end the innings with 16 balls unused. England struggled for fluency in the chase, and lost Roy in the first over as he chipped to mid-off while looking to hit Shakib over his head. Phil Salt‚Äôs scratchy innings came to an end when Taijul‚Äôs arm ball skidded into his leg stump via his pad and when James Vince was stumped charging the same bowler, England were in trouble at 45 for 3. Soon after, Malan survived a tight lbw shout on review, with ball-tracking predicting Taijul‚Äôs offbreak would have clipped leg stump rather than hitting it flush. Tamim attacked just before the first drinks break, bringing Taskin back into the attack and posting Shanto at slip in the 17th over. He was rewarded immediately, as Jos Buttler steered a back-of-a-length ball straight to the close catcher, bringing Jacks in at No. 6 on debut. Jacks, playing his first List A game since 2019, struggled early on but a flurry of boundaries took scoring pressure off Malan, who was battling hard against Mehidy‚Äôs offbreaks. But Jacks holed out to midwicket for a flashy 26, and when Mehidy‚Äôs final ball skidded into Moeen‚Äôs stumps after a 38-run stand with Malan, England were wobbling. Woakes chipped Taijul to mid-on with 49 runs required and three wickets left, but Rashid proved the perfect foil for Malan. He calmly rotated the strike as Malan opted to attack; with Mustafizur Rahman proving expensive, Tamim eventually ran out of options as England snuck home.

Brook, 24, made Test history by scoring more prolifically across his first nine innings (809) than any other player and hitting 20 sixes along the way. He also showed off his skills with the ball, by getting his maiden test wicket by dismissing New Zealand's Kane Williamson in Wellington. And as part of a new ambassadorial role with Major League Baseball Europe, he will test his big-hitting prowess at a St Louis Cardinals camp in Florida this weekend. 'I‚Äôm intrigued to see how different it is to cricket and what similarities there are too ‚Äì will a home run feel as good as hitting a six?! Harry Brook will switch his sporting attention to Major League Baseball ahead of matches in London this summer I‚Äôm also excited to learn from how other professional sportspeople go about their game and see if there are any transferable skills between batting in baseball and cricket,‚Äô Brook said, in a MLB release. Fellow England star and management stablemate Issy Wong is also involved in promoting the sport in the UK and specifically matches between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs at the London Stadium on June 24-25. Each of them will don MLB stickers on their bats going forward, including at the Indian Premier League and Women‚Äôs Premier League later this month. The MLB games will be first to be played in London since 2019, when the New York Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox. Further matches were then curtailed by COVID-19 pandemic and re-arranged for the summer of 2023.

Rashid ‚Äî on videolink from Bangladesh on Thursday, where England are playing a one-day international series ‚Äî was cross-examined for almost two hours during the Cricket Discipline Commission hearing into allegations of racism at Yorkshire. And the 35-year-old said: ‚ÄòHe (Vaughan) said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too many of you lot‚Äù, followed by words to the effect of, ‚ÄúWe need to have a word‚Äù. I am certain he used the phrase, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too many of you lot‚Äù.‚Äô Rashid‚Äôs witness statement added: ‚ÄòMichael made an ill-judged comment. I heard it. I do not believe that he is racist or that this was said with any bad intention, but it was said.‚Äô Rashid described the comment as ‚Äòbad humour‚Äô. Adil Rashid has confirmed that former England captain Michael Vaughan did make a 'you lot' comment to a group of Yorkshire's Asian players The England spinner also denied that he was pressured to come forward by former team-mate Azeem Rafiq Vaughan categorically denies the allegation and the ECB charge that he caused prejudice or disrepute to cricket. Rashid was one of four players of Asian heritage playing that day, alongside Azeem Rafiq, Ajmal Shahzad and Rana Naveed-Ul-Hasan, and repeatedly confirmed to Christopher Stoner KC ‚Äî Vaughan‚Äôs lawyer ‚Äî that the 2005 Ashes-winning captain made the comment. Rashid was also shown a statement from former Yorkshire bowler Shahzad which said: ‚ÄòI think Adil is being pressurised. I think there are a lot of things that you guys (the ECB) may not be aware of that are happening and it‚Äôs quite murky.‚Äô Rashid, who co-owned a fish and chip shop with Rafiq between 2020 and 2021, denied Shahzad‚Äôs claim, saying: ‚ÄòI did feel pressured by the situation generally. Ajmal speculates that I may have felt under pressure to support Azeem because of a shared interest we had in a fish and chip shop. I am not supporting Azeem because he is a friend or because of any shared business interest.‚Äô He added: ‚ÄòI am giving evidence based on what I heard.‚Äô Rashid was asked about the witness statement of Liz Neto ‚Äî Yorkshire‚Äôs former head of HR ‚Äî who stated that Rashid telephoned her on more than one occasion, appearing distressed and indicating that he felt pressured. She quoted Rashid as saying: ‚ÄòNo matter how many times you tell me I heard it Azeem, I cannot remember hearing it.‚Äô Rashid denied making those comments. He was also asked about the specific words Vaughan allegedly used in 2009, responding: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs too many of you lot, we need to do something about it.‚Äô ‚ÄòJust so you are aware, that is not what is alleged,‚Äô Stoner replied, pointing out the alleged phrase was actually: ‚ÄòThere is too many of you lot, we need to have a word about it.‚Äô ‚ÄòThis is the reality isn‚Äôt it, Mr Rashid?‚Äô Stoner continued. ‚ÄòYou have no clear recollection of what was said on June 22, 2009.‚Äô The long-awaited racism hearing began on Wednesday, with Rashid corroborating Rafiq's claim on the second day In the afternoon session, Rafiq stood by his account of events. ‚ÄòIt made me angry at the time, it has throughout the years and it does today,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòThis man (Vaughan) was a hero of mine. It did cause me upset and anger. ‚ÄòI was a young cricketer, wanting to make my way. When you do speak up, your life and career can be destroyed. The fear of that never allowed me to speak up. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got two choices ‚Äî try and be a professional cricketer and progress or pay the consequences of speaking out against an Ashes-winning England captain.‚Äô The hearing continues on Friday.

If nothing miraculous happens, the visitors will finally taste victory for the first time in this series. A Test win India is rare with the hosts having lost only 2 matches at home in the last 2 years. The two teams to beat them were England in 2021 and Australia themselves back in 2017. If the 3rd loss indeed goes down on Friday, India will only have their top order collapse to blame with only Cheteshwar Pujara the lone resistance against a lethal Nathan Lyon, who ended up taking 8 wickets in the 2nd innings. Pujara‚Äôs 59 was the sole beacon of light in the Indian innings as both openers and Shubman Gill fell cheaply, followed by , and Srikar Bharat. Pujara was ultimately snared by Lyon as took a blinder to dismiss him as India ultimately skittled at 163. Our Senior cricket writer is covering the third Test at Indore. India have just the 76 runs to defend on day three morning. The lowest target defended in this country is 107, in that famous meeting between the hosts and their current visitors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2004. They sure have the resources to pull off a wonder of a result even though Australia sure start as favorites. While on commentary, former Aussie opener Matthew Hayden said, ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs an absolute desert. It is so dry. No way spinners should come to bowl in the sixth over. This is the reason I don‚Äôt like these kinds of surfaces. It shouldn‚Äôt be keeping this low and turning so much on Day 1. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether Australia wins this Test or India. These kinds of surfaces are not good for Test cricket.‚Äù ‚ÄúI cannot believe a player of his class has gone that long without a hundred,‚Äù former Test batter Mark Waugh said on Fox Cricket. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been in good touch recently, he‚Äôs batted well in one-day cricket. I know it‚Äôs not Test match cricket, but the signs have been there in his last three innings in Test cricket that he‚Äôs actually playing pretty well. Umesh Yadav made the stumps cartwheel twice on day two of the third Test, while also completing 100 Test wickets at home, and it was a sight for sore eyes. What. A. Delivery! was on üî• this morning, knocking down the off stump twice! üí™üèª Watch 's reply LIVE in the 3rd MasterCard Test on Star Sports & Disney+Hotstar! -Nathan Lyon second in the list for most wickets by an away bowler in India (53 in 10 matches). -Umesh Yadav becomes only the 5th Indian quick to register 100 Test wickets at home. 13th time Lyon got Pujara out in Tests - the most an Indian batter has got out to any bowler. He also equalled Richie Benaud's tally of most five-wicket hauls (5) vs India in India. Only the 1st time since January 2019, Jadeja has got dismissed for a single digit score twice in a Test. Only the 2nd time India got bundled out under 200 twice in a Test since 1978. Also the second fewest overs (93.5) batted by India in a Test in which they've been bowled out twice. \"Pujara‚Äôs dismissal, I‚Äôve just looked at it, that‚Äôs one of the greatest catches in the history of cricket, that‚Äôs as good as it gets. With his old cobbler‚Äôs back, he had a deteriorating disk, but that just takes me back to Mark Waugh. It‚Äôd be Bobby Simpson, it‚Äôd be every best slips fielder in the history of cricket, they would have loved to have taken that catch,\" the former Australia keeper batter told SENQ Breakfast. During India‚Äôs second innings on day two, skipper Rohit Sharma was caught on camera in a rather animated mood, seemingly unhappy with his batters‚Äô approach in the middle as he conversed with Ishan Kishan in the dressing room. From what it could be understood from Rohit‚Äôs gestures, he seemingly wasn‚Äôt very happy with the conservative approach of the batters and sent Kishan to relay the message in the middle during break. For years Umesh Yadav's father, Tilak toiled in the dark while putting his health at risk breathing in coal dust, writes our senior cricket writer, Devendra Pandey. Umesh, who grabbed three wickets on Thursday morning to help India mount a comeback in the game, had lost his father only last week. A father whose back breaking work and happiness was linked to Umesh's cricket career. ‚ÄúIn cricket anything can happen. We will try our best and bowl tight lines. It is not an easy wicket, whether it is our batters or theirs. It is not easy to step out and hit. ‚ÄúThe ball is keeping low as well, so you can‚Äôt be sure about stepping out. The runs are less but we will stick to tight lines and push as much as we can,‚Äù said Umesh, who picked up three wickets on Thursday to help India dismiss Australia early in the first session. 10/119: Ajaz Patel, Mumbai 2021/22 8/50: Nathan Lyon, Bangalore 2016/17 8/64: Lance Klusener, Kolkata 1996/97 Sandip G, our man on the ground in Indore, writes on the dramatic day two of the Indore Test that saw 16 wickets falling across two innings and Nathan Lyon picking an 8-fer, inspiring Australia to set themselves a total of 76 to chase and win the first Test of the 2023 Border Gavaskar Trophy. Cheteshwar Pujara, the man who brought some semblance of respectability to the Indian innings on Thursday, said that the secret of negotiating turn and bounce on a pitch like the one at Indore was trusting your defence. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tough pitch to bat on. It‚Äôs not easy, you need to trust your defence, make sure you need to get to the pitch or, if it‚Äôs short, play off the back foot,‚Äù said Pujara. Asked about the strategy needed on this track, Pujara said: \"You need to attack and defend, a mix, on this pitch. If you keep defending, one ball will bounce and hit your glove. My aim was to be a bit more positive, try and score as many as possible.‚Äù He scored nearly half of India‚Äôs second-innings runs. Just when Pujara had started to appear threatening to the Australians, Steve Smith took a blinder to dismiss him on Thursday. It would not be an over exaggeration to state that the catch was the turning point of Day 2, and could be of the match as well since Pujara was batting with composure. India suffered a humbling batting collapse against Australia in 3rd Test at Indore, a section of fans in the stands at Holkar Stadium started a chant for Rishabh Pant. Pant suffered a horrific accident in December 30, which required him to undergo lengthy treatment. it will also mean he will miss a lot of international cricket this year. While fans in the stadiums are missing Pant, it didn't help that his replacement, Srikar Bharat, has had a forgettable series so far: scoring 8, 6, 23, 17 and 3 in 5 innings. Sandip G, our man on the ground in Indore, writes that Lyon's dismantling of Rohit Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja on Thursday shows why he is the greatest of all time. He also points out that while Shane Warne has just the one five-wicket haul in India, Lyon already has five in the country. Nathan Lyon was incredible on Thursday, taking eight Indian wickets in 23.3 overs while conceding just 64 runs. Barring Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer, he was behind all of the Indian specialist batters going back to the hut on Thursday. The 35-year-old is playing in his 118th Test and has taken 479 wickets. A fighting 59-run knock from Cheteshwar Pujara was the saving grace for the hosts in the second innings as they collapsed for a paltry 163 runs in the second innings. In the first, they had managed to score just 109 runs. Australia, who scored 197 in their first innings, need just 76 runs to win. Pujara patiently stitched together his innings, using up 142 balls to make his score before perishing to a ball from Nathan Lyon. For most of their time in India, the visiting Australian side has been staring down the barrel, losing both the first two Tests in three days. But in Indore, at long last, things have gone their way and they now find themselves needing just 76 runs to claim a back-to-the-wall victory. it won't help them regain the Border Gavaskar Trophy, but it will be some consolation to make the series 2-1 and put pressure on the hosts going to Ahmedabad. Right then. Here's a bit of recap. On day two of the third Test match, India manage to bundle Australia out for 197, giving away only 40 runs to their total of day one. With Australia leading by 88 runs, India could only manage a lead of 75 of their own as Nathan Lyon (8/64) ran through the Indian lineup, the hosts being dismissed for 163.

Followed categories will be added to My News. Australian one-day hopeful Daniel Hughes has been forced out of his side‚Äôs Sheffield Shield clash against Victoria after scans confirmed a torn calf muscle. The 34-year-old pulled up after taking off for a single and was unable to put any weight back on his leg, forcing him to retire hurt on 22 amid a difficult first few hours for NSW. Hughes may have been called upon to join the Australian one-day side in India if David Warner was not cleared fit to play, but the injury is almost certainly a fatal blow to his hopes of a national callup. The left-hander had been in career-best form, leading the run-scoring in the Marsh Cup with 548 runs at an average of 78, including four centuries. Daniel Hughes had to be helped off Lavington Sports Ground in Albury after he suffered a suspected calf tear while batting on day one of NSW‚Äôs Sheffield Shield match against Victoria. Picture: Albert Perez / Getty Images Victoria‚Äôs young fast bowlers caused problems on day one of the Shield fixture in Albury, with Mitch Perry claiming 4-24 and Fergus O‚ÄôNeill also picking up two wickets as NSW was bowled out for 203. Chris Green was again the first innings‚Äô topscorer for the Blues with 52, and put on 57 for the eighth wicket with Trent Copeland to steer them away from trouble at 7-136. Copeland removed Travis Dean before stumps to leave the Vics 1-15 in reply. At the Gabba, another impressive cameo with the bat from Ben Manenti took South Australia into a strong position against Queensland after it had slumped to 6-111 earlier in the day. Ben Manenti has been in fine form with the bat this season for the Redbacks. Picture: Chris Hyde / Getty Images The 25-year-old, who has nailed down a spot in the Redbacks side after moving from NSW via Tasmania, struck 88 from 101 balls to stamp his all-round credentials before he was dismissed by Xavier Bartlett late on day one. The innings carried the off-spinner into fifth on the Sheffield Shield leading run-scorers‚Äô list at stumps, with 534 runs at 49. South Australia was 7-227 after 67 overs, with Bartlett and Michael Neser each claiming three wickets and Jake Lehmann earlier making an important 65 at better than a run-a-ball, after coming to the crease at 3-33. Just before tea in Perth, Tasmania was 4-139 after winning the toss and electing to bat, with openers Tim Ward and Caleb Jewell both dismissed in the 40s. Charlie Stobo had 2-20, as captain Mitch Marsh returned to the Western Australian side as a specialist batter.

Followed categories will be added to My News. Australia will arrive in England refreshed and ready to continue their peerless record in international cricket ahead of the Ashes in June, coach Shelley Nitschke says. A dozen members of Australia‚Äôs winning T20 World Cup squad have arrived in India for the inaugural Women‚Äôs Premier League that begins on Sunday, but Nitschke said their impressive ability to switch off from cricket would hold them in good stead despite the whirlwind trip overseas. Meg Lanning was named as the third Australian captain of the five WPL franchises on Wednesday when she was appointed skipper of the Delhi Capitals, with Beth Mooney taking the reins at the Gujarat Giants and Alyssa Healy in charge of the Uttar Pradesh Warriorz. The timing of the tournament auction, wedged between Australia‚Äôs first and second World Cup group games, was awkward, but the discipline of the side to switch their focus back to the task at hand showed that the players would not be burned out from the WPL ahead of a big northern summer, Nitschke said. Meg Lanning with Delhi Capitals chief executive AS Sundaresan and head coach Jonathan Batty after being named the inaugural captain of the WPL franchise. Picture: Indranil Mukherjee / AFP ‚ÄúWhile the World Cup was going on, there was an element of talking about (the WPL) but not wanting to get too caught up,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere was still getting the job done in South Africa, and then once that was finished, among the celebrations that focus started to shift ‚Ä¶ credit to them for keeping their eyes on the prize. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a testament to them and also probably contributes to some of our success ‚Äì when you‚Äôre in tournaments, it‚Äôs that ability to switch off but then knowing that when you need to be on, you‚Äôre on.‚Äù Nitschke said she was not concerned by the how the tight WPL schedule ‚Äì 22 games played in 23 days ‚Äì might wear down Australia‚Äôs players following a packed fixture in South Africa. Australia coach Shelley Nitschke (right) says a key reason for Australia‚Äôs ongoing success is the players‚Äô ability to switch focus after celebrating their wins. Picture: Marco Longari / AFP ‚ÄúI think some of them are pretty weary ‚Äì it‚Äôs been a tiring World Cup, and the round games were pretty close together,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôve done enough training ‚Ä¶ a lot of them will just be playing the game and taking the time in between the games to recuperate for the next one. ‚ÄúThey all know how to manage themselves, and luckily it‚Äôs a reasonably quick turnaround to the tournament as well.‚Äù A break in April would be an ‚Äúimportant refresh time for all of us‚Äù ahead of the Ashes Test match in Nottingham on June 22, Nitschke said. ‚ÄúMaybe a bit of beach time ‚Äì not sure about fishing, but certainly time to down the tools for a while,‚Äù she said.

His defiance was ended by a moment of brilliance from Steve Smith, at leg slip, topping off a great day out for him as a captain. Marshalling his resources expertly, Smith did not allow the game to drift away and kept making changes to his bowling attack to not allow the batters to get on top. His moves paid off well when Shreyas Iyer, who had counterattacked with a 27-ball 26 against the spinners, fell as soon as the pacer was brought on, with Usman Khawaja taking a sharp chance at midwicket. This stemmed any momentum that India had a little into the third session, before the lower order capitulated on a raging turner, with the innings ending eerily similar to how it started with Mohammad Siraj swinging wildly against Lyon to be bowled. It had started in similar fashion with Lyon getting past a wildly swinging Shubman Gill in the first over after the Lunch break. While Rohit Sharma kept Pujara company for 58 balls, he too copped one that shot through a tad low from Lyon and was out LBW, with DRS too going against his wishful call. Virat Kohli had a nervy stay in the middle getting past a few close shaves, but on 13 after he had slapped a short ball from Matthew Kuhnemann to the cover boundary, he tried to pull one and was trapped LBW again. The trend continued minutes before Tea, when Lyon ended Ravindra Jadeja‚Äôs dogged 36-ball stay getting him out LBW with the aid of a review. All through this, Pujara managed to be more confident with his footwork drilling a couple of drives to keep the scoreboard ticking along and shaving off the deficit, and briefly along with Iyer India threatened to take a significant lead, with the No.3 registering his 35th Test fifty in the process. However it all came to a rapid halt thanks to some relentlessly accurate spin bowling from Australia. Earlier in the day, despite a collapse that saw Australia lose their last six wickets for 11 runs, the visitors finished with a possibly pivotal lead of 88 runs. Starting the day with a lead of 47, Cameron Green and Peter Handscomb made it Australia‚Äôs first hour seeing it out without much problem. India opted to start with their two left-arm spinners after a brief spell from Mohammed Siraj in that hour and it did not yield the desired results. Both Handscomb and Green used their long reach to smother the spin and defend confidently, and ground the attack out while adding 30 invaluable runs through that hour. However, things took a drastic turn after R Ashwin and Umesh Yadav started operating in tandem in the second hour. Ashwin was the first to get the breakthrough having Handscomb caught at short leg and breaking a stoic partnership worth 40 in 134 balls. In the next over Umesh hit Green on the backfoot and had an LBW decision upheld by the barest of margins as the batter reviewed. This was followed by a demolition job of the tail with Umesh sending the stumps flying to send back Todd Murphy and Mitchell Starc, while Ashwin cleaned up Lyon who missed a big sweep. The collapse saw Australia lose six wickets in less than half an hour, giving India a slight opening but Lyon and Co. ensured that there was no let-up. Australia Published on By Nalanda will have a slight edge over their arch rivals Ananda when the two teams meet in the 93rd Battle of the Maroons at the SSC ground over the weekend (March 4-5). Nalanda do not have the two Sri Lanka Under 19 team members who played key roles during the last season and helped record a historic Big Match victory. But under Chanul Athukorala‚Äôs captaincy Nalanda‚Äôs balance outfit have done well and can challenge any formidable team. One could only get misled if they judge the strength by their tournament standings. They have a strong top order batting line up with wicketkeeper batsman Rusiru Vilochana leading from the front. Vilochana is among the leading batsmen in the tournament, having over 1000 runs against his name. He scored two centuries this season and his 1194 runs have come at an average of 54.3 runs. Yasiru Samarakoon who opens batting has over 500 runs for the season, while Sadew Samarasinghe (over 600runs), Kushmitha Silva (over 400 runs) and Eranga Jayakody (over 500 runs) have all contributed with the bat. Spin trio of Minod Caldera, Sajitha Vithanage and Janula Indusara are the key strike bowlers for Nalanda, while skipper Athukorala shares the new ball duties with Thisara Dewdunu. Off spinner Caldera is their leading wicket taker after having taken 46 wickets this season. Left-arm spinners Vithanage (39 wickets) and Indusara have accounted for more than 60 wickets together. Ananda encountered fluctuating fortunes this season. They entered the first term as an unbeaten team with two outright victories under their belt. Then followed four consecutive defeats. They suffered defeats at the hands of St. Anthony‚Äôs Katugastota (innings and 79 runs), Trinity (by seven wickets), Mahinda (by seven wickets) and Richmond (by 112 runs). That was something unprecedented. But the team led by Nethma Samaraweera have managed to overcome the setback. They concluded the season with a morale boosting victory against Dharmaraja (by nine wickets). Ananda will rely heavily on wicketkeeper batsman Viduna Wijebandara, Iruth Gimshan and Kithma Sithmal for runs as a largely inexperienced side take the field. They are the only players to have aggregated over 400 runs among batsmen who played more than 12 matches this season. There is hope on the likes of Dinada Athalage who have shown promise during the limited opportunities he got. In the bowling department, spinners Kithma Sithmal, Ashinsa Nainayaka, Ayesh Shashimal and Isuru Ayesh are the bowlers to watch. While Sithmal is their leading wicket taker with over 40 wickets against his name, Nainayake, Shashimal and Ayesh have accounted for over 90 wickets together. Their pace attack is spearheaded by skipper Samaraweera and Yehan Gunasinghe. Ananda lead the Big Match tally 12-7. They last won in 2003 under the captaincy of D. Kularatne. Nalanda are the holders of the trophy after registering a historic victory under the captaincy of Dineth Samaraweera last year. Published on By Dawid Malan played the best innings of his ODI career to steer England to a tense three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Mirpur and further his case for inclusion in their World Cup defence in India later this year. England made tough work of a target of 210, slipping to 65 for 4 and 161 for 7 as Bangladesh‚Äôs spinners squeezed the life out of their chase. But Malan, batting at No. 3, saw them home with eight balls to spare, adding an unbroken 51 for the eighth wicket with Adil Rashid to seal the win. Malan has been a peripheral member of England‚Äôs 50-over set-up for most of his career but has taken every opportunity that has come his way in the past nine months. He has now hit hundreds in each of the last four bilateral ODI series he has featured in; given the circumstances, this innings was the pick of them. This fixture started barely 24 hours after the remarkable climax of England‚Äôs Test against New Zealand in Wellington, some 7,000 miles away from Dhaka. They fielded completely separate sides ‚Äì though Will Jacks, an unused squad member at the Basin Reserve, flew to Bangladesh on the second day of the Test, and won his first ODI cap. Joe Root, England‚Äôs leading scorer at the 2019 World Cup, was among those unavailable due to the fixture clash and is nailed on to bat at No. 3 when the schedule allows him to return to the ODI side. Yet Malan is also an experienced opener and, at this stage, looks as strong a candidate as any to fulfil that role alongside Jonny Bairstow. It was not easy-going for Malan, who battled his way to 50 off 92 at the second drinks break as England desperately looked to survive, in particular against the threatening Mehidy Hasan Miraz. But he relieved the scoring pressure after the interval, crashing Mehidy over cover and then lofting him for a straight six, eventually guiding them across the line by working Najmul Hassan Shanto through midwicket. Shanto had top-scored for Bangladesh with a gritty, 82-ball 58 from No. 3 ‚Äì an innings that was not dissimilar to Malan‚Äôs. He extended his recent Bangladesh Premier League form ‚Äì he was the league‚Äôs top-scorer ‚Äì with his maiden ODI half-century, an overdue landmark in his 16th innings. Bangladesh struggled to build partnerships throughout their innings, with Shanto and Mahmadullah combining for Bangladesh‚Äôs only 50-run stand. England shared wickets around, with their three seamers and three spinners both accounting for five batters between them. Tamim Iqbal opted to bat first and made a bright start, hitting four early boundaries after surviving a chance when Chris Woakes put down a caught-and-bowled opportunity in the first over. Litton Das, his opening partner, pulled Woakes for six over square leg as Bangladesh raced to 33 for 0 in 4.4 overs, but was trapped lbw by the next ball he faced. Shanto was also reprieved early, dropped by a sprawling Jason Roy at backward point, but hit his next two balls for four and settled into a rhythm on a slow, low pitch.Mark Wood, playing his first ODI since July 2021, bowled the final over of the initial powerplay and struck with his third ball to remove Tamim. He breached the 90mph/145kph mark with his second ball, then rushed Tamim with his third, a back-of-a-length ball which bounced appreciably; Bangladesh‚Äôs captain could only fend onto his own stumps, via his elbow. Adil Rashid had Mushfiqur Rahim caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep, and Bangladesh were 106 for 4 when Shakib Al Hasan was cleaned up by Moeen Ali. Shanto continued to accumulate, but after reverse-sweeping Rashid for four, he pulled Rashid‚Äôs googly straight to Roy at short midwicket to fall for 58. When Mahmudullah strangled Wood down the leg side, Bangladesh were in danger of being bowled out. Jacks took his maiden ODI wicket when Afif Hossain pulled tamely to mid-on, and Mehidy Hasan edged Archer behind cheaply. Taskin Ahmed hit Rashid for six and then four to ensure Bangladesh would post something competitive before he strangled Archer down the leg side, with Taijul skying a return catch to Moeen to end the innings with 16 balls unused. England struggled for fluency in the chase, and lost Roy in the first over as he chipped to mid-off while looking to hit Shakib over his head. Phil Salt‚Äôs scratchy innings came to an end when Taijul‚Äôs arm ball skidded into his leg stump via his pad and when James Vince was stumped charging the same bowler, England were in trouble at 45 for 3. Soon after, Malan survived a tight lbw shout on review, with ball-tracking predicting Taijul‚Äôs offbreak would have clipped leg stump rather than hitting it flush. Tamim attacked just before the first drinks break, bringing Taskin back into the attack and posting Shanto at slip in the 17th over. He was rewarded immediately, as Jos Buttler steered a back-of-a-length ball straight to the close catcher, bringing Jacks in at No. 6 on debut. Jacks, playing his first List A game since 2019, struggled early on but a flurry of boundaries took scoring pressure off Malan, who was battling hard against Mehidy‚Äôs offbreaks. But Jacks holed out to midwicket for a flashy 26, and when Mehidy‚Äôs final ball skidded into Moeen‚Äôs stumps after a 38-run stand with Malan, England were wobbling. Woakes chipped Taijul to mid-on with 49 runs required and three wickets left, but Rashid proved the perfect foil for Malan. He calmly rotated the strike as Malan opted to attack; with Mustafizur Rahman proving expensive, Tamim eventually ran out of options as England snuck home. Bangladesh ( ) Published on By There were no surprises in the 13 New Zealand named for their two-Test series against Sri Lanka that begins on March 9. All 13 players who featured in their recent 1-1 draw with England were named, with the omissions from that squad being the uncapped seamer Jacob Duffy, legspinner Ish Sodhi, and the injured Kyle Jamieson. Tim Southee will lead the squad that is coming off the high of becoming only the fourth team to win after following on, in a dramatic game which they snatched by one run in Wellington to level the series against England. The batting will continue to be anchored by Kane Williamson, with Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Devon Conway, Daryl Mitchell and Will Young for support. Tom Blundell will continue behind the wicket, with Michael Bracewell the key in the spin department. Neil Wagner, fresh off his signature short-ball exploits against England, will spearhead the pacers along with Southee, the line-up including Matt Henry, Blair Tickner and Scott Kuggeleijn. Jamieson, who was withdrawn from the squad initially named for that England series, is due to undergo back surgery for an injury that has kept him out of international cricket since June 2022. The out-of-contract Trent Boult, who‚Äôs focusing on playing franchise T20 cricket, continues to remain unselected. The two Tests against Sri Lanka are part of the World Test Championship, and while defending champions New Zealand are out of contention for the final, Sri Lanka need to sweep the series 2-0 to have a shot at making the title bout. The first Test will be played in Christchurch, followed by the second in Wellington from March 17.

Shanto was also reprieved early, dropped by a sprawling Jason Roy at backward point, but hit his next two balls for four and settled into a rhythm on a slow, low pitch.Mark Wood, playing his first ODI since July 2021, bowled the final over of the initial powerplay and struck with his third ball to remove Tamim. He breached the 90mph/145kph mark with his second ball, then rushed Tamim with his third, a back-of-a-length ball which bounced appreciably; Bangladesh‚Äôs captain could only fend onto his own stumps, via his elbow. Adil Rashid had Mushfiqur Rahim caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep, and Bangladesh were 106 for 4 when Shakib Al Hasan was cleaned up by Moeen Ali. Shanto continued to accumulate, but after reverse-sweeping Rashid for four, he pulled Rashid‚Äôs googly straight to Roy at short midwicket to fall for 58. When Mahmudullah strangled Wood down the leg side, Bangladesh were in danger of being bowled out. Jacks took his maiden ODI wicket when Afif Hossain pulled tamely to mid-on, and Mehidy Hasan edged Archer behind cheaply. Taskin Ahmed hit Rashid for six and then four to ensure Bangladesh would post something competitive before he strangled Archer down the leg side, with Taijul skying a return catch to Moeen to end the innings with 16 balls unused. England struggled for fluency in the chase, and lost Roy in the first over as he chipped to mid-off while looking to hit Shakib over his head. Phil Salt‚Äôs scratchy innings came to an end when Taijul‚Äôs arm ball skidded into his leg stump via his pad and when James Vince was stumped charging the same bowler, England were in trouble at 45 for 3. Soon after, Malan survived a tight lbw shout on review, with ball-tracking predicting Taijul‚Äôs offbreak would have clipped leg stump rather than hitting it flush. Tamim attacked just before the first drinks break, bringing Taskin back into the attack and posting Shanto at slip in the 17th over. He was rewarded immediately, as Jos Buttler steered a back-of-a-length ball straight to the close catcher, bringing Jacks in at No. 6 on debut. Jacks, playing his first List A game since 2019, struggled early on but a flurry of boundaries took scoring pressure off Malan, who was battling hard against Mehidy‚Äôs offbreaks. But Jacks holed out to midwicket for a flashy 26, and when Mehidy‚Äôs final ball skidded into Moeen‚Äôs stumps after a 38-run stand with Malan, England were wobbling. Woakes chipped Taijul to mid-on with 49 runs required and three wickets left, but Rashid proved the perfect foil for Malan. He calmly rotated the strike as Malan opted to attack; with Mustafizur Rahman proving expensive, Tamim eventually ran out of options as England snuck home. Bangladesh ( ) Published on By There were no surprises in the 13 New Zealand named for their two-Test series against Sri Lanka that begins on March 9. All 13 players who featured in their recent 1-1 draw with England were named, with the omissions from that squad being the uncapped seamer Jacob Duffy, legspinner Ish Sodhi, and the injured Kyle Jamieson. Tim Southee will lead the squad that is coming off the high of becoming only the fourth team to win after following on, in a dramatic game which they snatched by one run in Wellington to level the series against England. The batting will continue to be anchored by Kane Williamson, with Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Devon Conway, Daryl Mitchell and Will Young for support. Tom Blundell will continue behind the wicket, with Michael Bracewell the key in the spin department. Neil Wagner, fresh off his signature short-ball exploits against England, will spearhead the pacers along with Southee, the line-up including Matt Henry, Blair Tickner and Scott Kuggeleijn. Jamieson, who was withdrawn from the squad initially named for that England series, is due to undergo back surgery for an injury that has kept him out of international cricket since June 2022. The out-of-contract Trent Boult, who‚Äôs focusing on playing franchise T20 cricket, continues to remain unselected. The two Tests against Sri Lanka are part of the World Test Championship, and while defending champions New Zealand are out of contention for the final, Sri Lanka need to sweep the series 2-0 to have a shot at making the title bout. The first Test will be played in Christchurch, followed by the second in Wellington from March 17.

England made tough work of a target of 210, slipping to 65 for 4 and 161 for 7 as Bangladesh‚Äôs spinners squeezed the life out of their chase. But Malan, batting at No. 3, saw them home with eight balls to spare, adding an unbroken 51 for the eighth wicket with Adil Rashid to seal the win. Malan has been a peripheral member of England‚Äôs 50-over set-up for most of his career but has taken every opportunity that has come his way in the past nine months. He has now hit hundreds in each of the last four bilateral ODI series he has featured in; given the circumstances, this innings was the pick of them. This fixture started barely 24 hours after the remarkable climax of England‚Äôs Test against New Zealand in Wellington, some 7,000 miles away from Dhaka. They fielded completely separate sides ‚Äì though Will Jacks, an unused squad member at the Basin Reserve, flew to Bangladesh on the second day of the Test, and won his first ODI cap. Joe Root, England‚Äôs leading scorer at the 2019 World Cup, was among those unavailable due to the fixture clash and is nailed on to bat at No. 3 when the schedule allows him to return to the ODI side. Yet Malan is also an experienced opener and, at this stage, looks as strong a candidate as any to fulfil that role alongside Jonny Bairstow. It was not easy-going for Malan, who battled his way to 50 off 92 at the second drinks break as England desperately looked to survive, in particular against the threatening Mehidy Hasan Miraz. But he relieved the scoring pressure after the interval, crashing Mehidy over cover and then lofting him for a straight six, eventually guiding them across the line by working Najmul Hassan Shanto through midwicket. Shanto had top-scored for Bangladesh with a gritty, 82-ball 58 from No. 3 ‚Äì an innings that was not dissimilar to Malan‚Äôs. He extended his recent Bangladesh Premier League form ‚Äì he was the league‚Äôs top-scorer ‚Äì with his maiden ODI half-century, an overdue landmark in his 16th innings. Bangladesh struggled to build partnerships throughout their innings, with Shanto and Mahmadullah combining for Bangladesh‚Äôs only 50-run stand. England shared wickets around, with their three seamers and three spinners both accounting for five batters between them.

Bangladesh ( ) Published on By Nathan Lyon led the way with the ball for Australia picking up a magnificent 8-64, his second-best Test figures, as India were bowled out for just 163, setting Australia a target of 76 to seal a famous win.For India, Cheteshwar Pujara led the way with a masterclass on a spinning pitch, scoring 59 and dragging India along with him even as he kept losing partners at the other end. His defiance was ended by a moment of brilliance from Steve Smith, at leg slip, topping off a great day out for him as a captain. Marshalling his resources expertly, Smith did not allow the game to drift away and kept making changes to his bowling attack to not allow the batters to get on top. His moves paid off well when Shreyas Iyer, who had counterattacked with a 27-ball 26 against the spinners, fell as soon as the pacer was brought on, with Usman Khawaja taking a sharp chance at midwicket. This stemmed any momentum that India had a little into the third session, before the lower order capitulated on a raging turner, with the innings ending eerily similar to how it started with Mohammad Siraj swinging wildly against Lyon to be bowled. It had started in similar fashion with Lyon getting past a wildly swinging Shubman Gill in the first over after the Lunch break. While Rohit Sharma kept Pujara company for 58 balls, he too copped one that shot through a tad low from Lyon and was out LBW, with DRS too going against his wishful call. Virat Kohli had a nervy stay in the middle getting past a few close shaves, but on 13 after he had slapped a short ball from Matthew Kuhnemann to the cover boundary, he tried to pull one and was trapped LBW again. The trend continued minutes before Tea, when Lyon ended Ravindra Jadeja‚Äôs dogged 36-ball stay getting him out LBW with the aid of a review. All through this, Pujara managed to be more confident with his footwork drilling a couple of drives to keep the scoreboard ticking along and shaving off the deficit, and briefly along with Iyer India threatened to take a significant lead, with the No.3 registering his 35th Test fifty in the process. However it all came to a rapid halt thanks to some relentlessly accurate spin bowling from Australia. Earlier in the day, despite a collapse that saw Australia lose their last six wickets for 11 runs, the visitors finished with a possibly pivotal lead of 88 runs. Starting the day with a lead of 47, Cameron Green and Peter Handscomb made it Australia‚Äôs first hour seeing it out without much problem. India opted to start with their two left-arm spinners after a brief spell from Mohammed Siraj in that hour and it did not yield the desired results. Both Handscomb and Green used their long reach to smother the spin and defend confidently, and ground the attack out while adding 30 invaluable runs through that hour. However, things took a drastic turn after R Ashwin and Umesh Yadav started operating in tandem in the second hour. Ashwin was the first to get the breakthrough having Handscomb caught at short leg and breaking a stoic partnership worth 40 in 134 balls. In the next over Umesh hit Green on the backfoot and had an LBW decision upheld by the barest of margins as the batter reviewed. This was followed by a demolition job of the tail with Umesh sending the stumps flying to send back Todd Murphy and Mitchell Starc, while Ashwin cleaned up Lyon who missed a big sweep. The collapse saw Australia lose six wickets in less than half an hour, giving India a slight opening but Lyon and Co. ensured that there was no let-up. Australia Published on By Nalanda will have a slight edge over their arch rivals Ananda when the two teams meet in the 93rd Battle of the Maroons at the SSC ground over the weekend (March 4-5). Nalanda do not have the two Sri Lanka Under 19 team members who played key roles during the last season and helped record a historic Big Match victory. But under Chanul Athukorala‚Äôs captaincy Nalanda‚Äôs balance outfit have done well and can challenge any formidable team. One could only get misled if they judge the strength by their tournament standings. They have a strong top order batting line up with wicketkeeper batsman Rusiru Vilochana leading from the front. Vilochana is among the leading batsmen in the tournament, having over 1000 runs against his name. He scored two centuries this season and his 1194 runs have come at an average of 54.3 runs. Yasiru Samarakoon who opens batting has over 500 runs for the season, while Sadew Samarasinghe (over 600runs), Kushmitha Silva (over 400 runs) and Eranga Jayakody (over 500 runs) have all contributed with the bat. Spin trio of Minod Caldera, Sajitha Vithanage and Janula Indusara are the key strike bowlers for Nalanda, while skipper Athukorala shares the new ball duties with Thisara Dewdunu. Off spinner Caldera is their leading wicket taker after having taken 46 wickets this season. Left-arm spinners Vithanage (39 wickets) and Indusara have accounted for more than 60 wickets together. Ananda encountered fluctuating fortunes this season. They entered the first term as an unbeaten team with two outright victories under their belt. Then followed four consecutive defeats. They suffered defeats at the hands of St. Anthony‚Äôs Katugastota (innings and 79 runs), Trinity (by seven wickets), Mahinda (by seven wickets) and Richmond (by 112 runs). That was something unprecedented. But the team led by Nethma Samaraweera have managed to overcome the setback. They concluded the season with a morale boosting victory against Dharmaraja (by nine wickets). Ananda will rely heavily on wicketkeeper batsman Viduna Wijebandara, Iruth Gimshan and Kithma Sithmal for runs as a largely inexperienced side take the field. They are the only players to have aggregated over 400 runs among batsmen who played more than 12 matches this season. There is hope on the likes of Dinada Athalage who have shown promise during the limited opportunities he got. In the bowling department, spinners Kithma Sithmal, Ashinsa Nainayaka, Ayesh Shashimal and Isuru Ayesh are the bowlers to watch. While Sithmal is their leading wicket taker with over 40 wickets against his name, Nainayake, Shashimal and Ayesh have accounted for over 90 wickets together. Their pace attack is spearheaded by skipper Samaraweera and Yehan Gunasinghe. Ananda lead the Big Match tally 12-7. They last won in 2003 under the captaincy of D. Kularatne. Nalanda are the holders of the trophy after registering a historic victory under the captaincy of Dineth Samaraweera last year.

Published on By Dawid Malan played the best innings of his ODI career to steer England to a tense three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Mirpur and further his case for inclusion in their World Cup defence in India later this year. England made tough work of a target of 210, slipping to 65 for 4 and 161 for 7 as Bangladesh‚Äôs spinners squeezed the life out of their chase. But Malan, batting at No. 3, saw them home with eight balls to spare, adding an unbroken 51 for the eighth wicket with Adil Rashid to seal the win. Malan has been a peripheral member of England‚Äôs 50-over set-up for most of his career but has taken every opportunity that has come his way in the past nine months. He has now hit hundreds in each of the last four bilateral ODI series he has featured in; given the circumstances, this innings was the pick of them. This fixture started barely 24 hours after the remarkable climax of England‚Äôs Test against New Zealand in Wellington, some 7,000 miles away from Dhaka. They fielded completely separate sides ‚Äì though Will Jacks, an unused squad member at the Basin Reserve, flew to Bangladesh on the second day of the Test, and won his first ODI cap. Joe Root, England‚Äôs leading scorer at the 2019 World Cup, was among those unavailable due to the fixture clash and is nailed on to bat at No. 3 when the schedule allows him to return to the ODI side. Yet Malan is also an experienced opener and, at this stage, looks as strong a candidate as any to fulfil that role alongside Jonny Bairstow. It was not easy-going for Malan, who battled his way to 50 off 92 at the second drinks break as England desperately looked to survive, in particular against the threatening Mehidy Hasan Miraz. But he relieved the scoring pressure after the interval, crashing Mehidy over cover and then lofting him for a straight six, eventually guiding them across the line by working Najmul Hassan Shanto through midwicket.

Bangladesh struggled to build partnerships throughout their innings, with Shanto and Mahmadullah combining for Bangladesh‚Äôs only 50-run stand. England shared wickets around, with their three seamers and three spinners both accounting for five batters between them. Tamim Iqbal opted to bat first and made a bright start, hitting four early boundaries after surviving a chance when Chris Woakes put down a caught-and-bowled opportunity in the first over. Litton Das, his opening partner, pulled Woakes for six over square leg as Bangladesh raced to 33 for 0 in 4.4 overs, but was trapped lbw by the next ball he faced. Shanto was also reprieved early, dropped by a sprawling Jason Roy at backward point, but hit his next two balls for four and settled into a rhythm on a slow, low pitch.Mark Wood, playing his first ODI since July 2021, bowled the final over of the initial powerplay and struck with his third ball to remove Tamim. He breached the 90mph/145kph mark with his second ball, then rushed Tamim with his third, a back-of-a-length ball which bounced appreciably; Bangladesh‚Äôs captain could only fend onto his own stumps, via his elbow. Adil Rashid had Mushfiqur Rahim caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep, and Bangladesh were 106 for 4 when Shakib Al Hasan was cleaned up by Moeen Ali. Shanto continued to accumulate, but after reverse-sweeping Rashid for four, he pulled Rashid‚Äôs googly straight to Roy at short midwicket to fall for 58. When Mahmudullah strangled Wood down the leg side, Bangladesh were in danger of being bowled out. Jacks took his maiden ODI wicket when Afif Hossain pulled tamely to mid-on, and Mehidy Hasan edged Archer behind cheaply. Taskin Ahmed hit Rashid for six and then four to ensure Bangladesh would post something competitive before he strangled Archer down the leg side, with Taijul skying a return catch to Moeen to end the innings with 16 balls unused. England struggled for fluency in the chase, and lost Roy in the first over as he chipped to mid-off while looking to hit Shakib over his head. Phil Salt‚Äôs scratchy innings came to an end when Taijul‚Äôs arm ball skidded into his leg stump via his pad and when James Vince was stumped charging the same bowler, England were in trouble at 45 for 3. Soon after, Malan survived a tight lbw shout on review, with ball-tracking predicting Taijul‚Äôs offbreak would have clipped leg stump rather than hitting it flush. Tamim attacked just before the first drinks break, bringing Taskin back into the attack and posting Shanto at slip in the 17th over. He was rewarded immediately, as Jos Buttler steered a back-of-a-length ball straight to the close catcher, bringing Jacks in at No. 6 on debut. Jacks, playing his first List A game since 2019, struggled early on but a flurry of boundaries took scoring pressure off Malan, who was battling hard against Mehidy‚Äôs offbreaks. But Jacks holed out to midwicket for a flashy 26, and when Mehidy‚Äôs final ball skidded into Moeen‚Äôs stumps after a 38-run stand with Malan, England were wobbling. Woakes chipped Taijul to mid-on with 49 runs required and three wickets left, but Rashid proved the perfect foil for Malan. He calmly rotated the strike as Malan opted to attack; with Mustafizur Rahman proving expensive, Tamim eventually ran out of options as England snuck home.

Brook, 24, made Test history by scoring more prolifically across his first nine innings (809) than any other player and hitting 20 sixes along the way. He also showed off his skills with the ball, by getting his maiden test wicket by dismissing New Zealand's Kane Williamson in Wellington. And as part of a new ambassadorial role with Major League Baseball Europe, he will test his big-hitting prowess at a St Louis Cardinals camp in Florida this weekend. 'I‚Äôm intrigued to see how different it is to cricket and what similarities there are too ‚Äì will a home run feel as good as hitting a six?! Harry Brook will switch his sporting attention to Major League Baseball ahead of matches in London this summer I‚Äôm also excited to learn from how other professional sportspeople go about their game and see if there are any transferable skills between batting in baseball and cricket,‚Äô Brook said, in a MLB release. Fellow England star and management stablemate Issy Wong is also involved in promoting the sport in the UK and specifically matches between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs at the London Stadium on June 24-25. Each of them will don MLB stickers on their bats going forward, including at the Indian Premier League and Women‚Äôs Premier League later this month. The MLB games will be first to be played in London since 2019, when the New York Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox. Further matches were then curtailed by COVID-19 pandemic and re-arranged for the summer of 2023. Brook was one of the stars of the show for England during their test series against New Zealand Share or comment on this article: Harry Brook swaps Bazball for baseball as he takes on ambassadorial role with Major League Baseball e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Rashid ‚Äî on videolink from Bangladesh on Thursday, where England are playing a one-day international series ‚Äî was cross-examined for almost two hours during the Cricket Discipline Commission hearing into allegations of racism at Yorkshire. And the 35-year-old said: ‚ÄòHe (Vaughan) said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too many of you lot‚Äù, followed by words to the effect of, ‚ÄúWe need to have a word‚Äù. I am certain he used the phrase, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too many of you lot‚Äù.‚Äô Rashid‚Äôs witness statement added: ‚ÄòMichael made an ill-judged comment. I heard it. I do not believe that he is racist or that this was said with any bad intention, but it was said.‚Äô Rashid described the comment as ‚Äòbad humour‚Äô. Adil Rashid has confirmed that former England captain Michael Vaughan did make a 'you lot' comment to a group of Yorkshire's Asian players The England spinner also denied that he was pressured to come forward by former team-mate Azeem Rafiq Vaughan categorically denies the allegation and the ECB charge that he caused prejudice or disrepute to cricket. Rashid was one of four players of Asian heritage playing that day, alongside Azeem Rafiq, Ajmal Shahzad and Rana Naveed-Ul-Hasan, and repeatedly confirmed to Christopher Stoner KC ‚Äî Vaughan‚Äôs lawyer ‚Äî that the 2005 Ashes-winning captain made the comment. Rashid was also shown a statement from former Yorkshire bowler Shahzad which said: ‚ÄòI think Adil is being pressurised. I think there are a lot of things that you guys (the ECB) may not be aware of that are happening and it‚Äôs quite murky.‚Äô Rashid, who co-owned a fish and chip shop with Rafiq between 2020 and 2021, denied Shahzad‚Äôs claim, saying: ‚ÄòI did feel pressured by the situation generally. Ajmal speculates that I may have felt under pressure to support Azeem because of a shared interest we had in a fish and chip shop. I am not supporting Azeem because he is a friend or because of any shared business interest.‚Äô He added: ‚ÄòI am giving evidence based on what I heard.‚Äô Rashid was asked about the witness statement of Liz Neto ‚Äî Yorkshire‚Äôs former head of HR ‚Äî who stated that Rashid telephoned her on more than one occasion, appearing distressed and indicating that he felt pressured. She quoted Rashid as saying: ‚ÄòNo matter how many times you tell me I heard it Azeem, I cannot remember hearing it.‚Äô Rashid denied making those comments. He was also asked about the specific words Vaughan allegedly used in 2009, responding: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs too many of you lot, we need to do something about it.‚Äô ‚ÄòJust so you are aware, that is not what is alleged,‚Äô Stoner replied, pointing out the alleged phrase was actually: ‚ÄòThere is too many of you lot, we need to have a word about it.‚Äô ‚ÄòThis is the reality isn‚Äôt it, Mr Rashid?‚Äô Stoner continued. ‚ÄòYou have no clear recollection of what was said on June 22, 2009.‚Äô The long-awaited racism hearing began on Wednesday, with Rashid corroborating Rafiq's claim on the second day In the afternoon session, Rafiq stood by his account of events. ‚ÄòIt made me angry at the time, it has throughout the years and it does today,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòThis man (Vaughan) was a hero of mine. It did cause me upset and anger. ‚ÄòI was a young cricketer, wanting to make my way. When you do speak up, your life and career can be destroyed. The fear of that never allowed me to speak up. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got two choices ‚Äî try and be a professional cricketer and progress or pay the consequences of speaking out against an Ashes-winning England captain.‚Äô The hearing continues on Friday.
