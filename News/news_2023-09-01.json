Bevan headline changes at Cricket NSW","link":"https://www.blayneychronicle.com.au/story/8331956/watson-bevan-headline-changes-at-cricket-nsw/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Shane Watson and Michael Bevan have been called in as coaching consultants to help turn around Cricket NSW's on-field woes as the state attempts to rebound from its lowest ebb in 84 years. Winless in the Sheffield Shield last season for the first time since 1938-39, Cricket NSW unveiled a raft of changes and a back-to-the-future mantra on Friday morning. Included in those is Moises Henriques' confirmation as an all-formats captain, taking over from Kurtis Patterson after he was dropped for the final round of the Shield last summer. Henriques has captained NSW on 20 occasions in the Sheffield Shield in the past, but this appointment marks his first full-time ascension to the role. Watson and Bevan will both take on jobs as consultants to coach Greg Shipperd, who himself was rushed into the top job midway through last summer after the axing of Phil Jaques. Bevan will act as a batting coach, while Watson will provide mentoring and mindset coaching for players. Former Test bowlers Stuart Clark and Geoff Lawson have also been appointed selectors, joining Shipperd, NSW performance boss Greg Mail and David Freedman on the panel. \"No one at Cricket NSW was happy with what happened last season and we have now taken steps to turn things around, with the aim to build consistent success,\" CEO Lee Germon said. \"All of these guys come with extremely accomplished resumes and they have NSW cricket and the Blues in their DNA. That will bring a renewed edge to our structure and the playing group. \"The program is now being led by Greg Mail and Greg Shipperd and the playing squad, led by Moises (Henriques), have knuckled down in the off-season and are determined to challenge for titles. \"Now, by bringing in the collective experience and world-class skills of Michael Bevan and Shane Watson, we have added to our off-field support structure.\" NSW have already made on-field moves to turn around their form with all Sheffield Shield fixtures to be played in Sydney this summer with three at the SCG and two at the state's new base at Olympic Park. NSW also endured their worst women's season in history last summer, finishing sixth after their run of 24 straight finals was ended in the previous campaign.

In a statement, the ECB said the change will be effective immediately, beginning with this weekтАЩs white-ball series against Sri Lanka. The increase in womenтАЩs match fees was recommended in the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC) report, which found a significant pay gap existed between men and women. According to the report, which was released at the end of June, women received 25 percent of the menтАЩs fees for white-ball formats. For Test cricket, the figure dropped to 15 percent. Payments vary depending on where the opposition sit in a five-tier system тАФ Australia are the only team currently in the top tier тАФ devised by the ECB. Test matches are far more lucrative than white-ball internationals. This summer, each of the players in the menтАЩs squad earned ┬г15 000 for each of the five Tests against Australia. That meant England womenтАЩs players received ┬г2,250 for their only Test in the WomenтАЩs Ashes and less than ┬г1 000 for white-balls international тАФ the menтАЩs, by comparison earned around ┬г3 500. The ICEC report, which also highlighted racism, sexism and elitism pervaded the game in England, found the average salary for England womenтАЩs players was 20,6 percent of that of an England men player. The England womenтАЩs captainтАЩs allowance, meanwhile, was less than a third of that awarded to the menтАЩs captain. тАЬItтАЩs really important that we continue to drive the womenтАЩs game forward and itтАЩs fantastic to see equal match fees for England Women and England Men,тАЭ England WomenтАЩs captain Heather Knight said. тАЬThe direction of travel for the womenтАЩs game has always been the most important thing, creating a sustainable product that people want to watch and play, and IтАЩm sure this will make cricket an increasingly attractive sport to girls and young women as we continue to grow the game.тАЩ The increase in match fees comes on the back of a successful summer for womenтАЩs cricket, with the WomenтАЩs Ashes series attracting a combined 110 000 fans through the turnstiles. England set new womenтАЩs international attendance records at Edgbaston, the Kia Oval and LordтАЩs and sold out matches at Taunton, Bristol and Hampshire in their series against Australia. The Aussies retained the Ashes after winning the only Test, but England won both the T20 and ODI series in thrilling fashion. ECB chief executive Richard Gould said: тАЬWe are currently considering all the recommendations made by the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket, but equalising match fees is one immediate step we are pleased to make now. тАЬWe all want cricket to be the team sport of choice for female athletes, and with the investments we are making тАФ and increasingly lucrative opportunities around the world тАФ we are seeing cricketers become some of the highest earning female athletes in UK team sports. тАЬHowever, we know there is still much further to go as we ultimately strive for equality across the game.тАЭ The additional investment follows increases to domestic salary pots this year, while salaries for womenтАЩs players in The Hundred more than doubled last year. Gould said the ECB will тАЬcontinue to invest ahead of revenuesтАЭ in the coming years, adding it would place particular focus on growing the womenтАЩs game.","pubDate":"2023-08-31 22:06:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"businessweeklyzw","source_priority":383660,"country":["zimbabwe"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"100990cf6723291a4b493e568bcfc859","title":"Cricket Cranes retain East Africa T20 Cup In Kigali","link":"https://kawowo.com/2023/09/01/cricket-cranes-retain-east-africa-t20-cup-in-kigali/","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Denis Musali"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Cricket Cranes were dominant in the two-week tournament that featured Tanzania and hosts Rwanda.

The defending champions only dropped one game against Tanzania picking up a possible 11 wins from the 12 games. In a series in which the Cricket Cranes were the highest ranked team in the tournament and were expected to dominate the other two teams. All the three sides are preparing for the T20 World Cup Qualifiers in November this year the series was a perfect tournament to rest their squads. Coach Laurence Mahatlane should be happy with the shift his boys were able to put in. With Juma Miyagi and Cosmas Kyewuta long injury concerns Ceylon Lions fast blower David Wabwire was given a test of international cricket and despite having the extra pace needs to tighten up the line and length if he is going to be successful in the short version. Roger Mukasa got a lot of games under his belt and he got enough runs to justify his place at the top of the order. You wish he had converted the starts he was able to get but an in-form Roger Mukasa is good for the Cricket Cranes. Simon Ssesazi started slowly but eventually finished as the leading runs scorer in the tournament. Ronald Lutaaya lacked consistency but he showed that he belongs and has the skill to survive at that level. Ronak Patel got runs whenever he got a chance to play and his skills of field manipulation in the middle order might be a great option for the team at the qualifiers. Alpesh Ramjani got wickets and also scored runs and his all-round game should give him the confidence going forward. Kenneth Waiswa picked up the MVP crown and he needed a series like this one to remind people of his potential. He dominated bowlers when he got a crack and also picked up wickets with his medium pacers. There was a comeback of Jonathan Sebanja and when he got a chance he made the most of it. Cyrus Kakuru is a very good wicketkeeper but itтАЩs the run still missing and between now and the qualifiers is enough time for him to work on his skills. Pascal Murungi didnтАЩt get a lot of playing time mostly because the other all-rounders ahead of him were doing well but he is one for the future. The focus for the Cricket Cranes is the T20 World Cup Qualifiers in Namibia.","pubDate":"2023-08-31 21:14:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"kawowo","source_priority":2240457,"country":["uganda"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bae99a3f183acef6331736ec419d38a7","title":"EXCLUSIVE: Yorkshire are considering SELLING Headingley to raise funds as the cash-strapped county struggle to secure ┬г20m investment to ensure their survival... with the famous ground valued at ┬г23m","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12466077/Yorkshire-considering-SELLING-Headingley-raise-funds-cash-strapped-county-struggle-secure-20m-investment-ensure-survival-famous-ground-valued-23m.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"EXCLUSIVE BY MATT HUGHES: Yorkshire are considering selling their iconic Headingley ground to raise funds to ensure the cash-strapped county's survival.","content":"EXCLUSIVE: Yorkshire are considering SELLING Headingley to raise funds as the cash-strapped county struggle to secure ┬г20m investment to ensure their survival... with the famous ground valued at ┬г23m Yorkshire have yet to receive formal offers for the ground, their home since 1981 The ground has regularly hosted England Test matches, including in the Ashes By Matt Hughes For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:10 BST, 31 August 2023 e-mail 9 View comments Yorkshire are considering selling their iconic Headingley ground to ensure the cash-strapped countyтАЩs survival. The club have been seeking around ┬г20million in investment since December but have yet to secure the funding despite interest from potential partners including Mike Ashley, IPL franchises and a Saudi prince. Another option being pondered by Yorkshire is to sell Headingley and lease it back in a model that has been used successfully by several football clubs including Aston Villa. They recently had the stadium valued at around ┬г23m by a real estate company. Yorkshire have yet to receive formal offers for the ground that has been their home since 1891, but expect considerable interest given HeadingleyтАЩs worldwide fame. Sources have told Mail Sport that Yorkshire would only sell Headingley if they could secure a 10-year lease which included the option to buy it back. Yorkshire are considering selling Headingley, which has been valued at ┬г23million Yorkshire are understood to have rejected several bids to buy the club outright because they want to ensure they remain controlled by their members. The sale of Headingley would provide funds needed to pay off the ┬г15.9m owed to the family trust of former chairman Colin Graves, as well as years of running costs. Yorkshire have been beset by financial problems since losing most of their sponsors and incurring costs of around ┬г3.5m following the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal two years ago. The clubтАЩs most recent published accounts showed losses of ┬г2.2m, with Yorkshire conceding that they faced a battle for survival. Income generated by this summerтАЩs Ashes Test enabled them to pay their bills and get through the season, but they face further issues in October when a repayment of ┬г500,000 is due to the Colin Graves Trust. Talks with numerous investors over refinancing the Graves family loan have yet to produce a deal due to the high interest rates Yorkshire have been quoted, with AshleyтАЩs proposal тАФ which would see the former Newcastle owner gain branding and retail rights at Headingley тАФ thought to be the most advanced. Yorkshire bought Headingley in 2005 from the Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Company in a deal that resulted in the club gaining a 15-year international match-staging deal from the ECB. The purchase cost them ┬г12m, so almost doubling their money in 18 years would be a good return. Yorkshire chief executive Stephen Vaughan told Mail Sport: тАШWe are making strong progress on securing the long-term future of Yorkshire County Cricket Club and look forward to announcing positive developments shortly.тАЩ The iconic ground hosted the third Ashes Test between England and Australia this summer Share or comment on this article: EXCLUSIVE: Yorkshire are considering SELLING Headingley to raise funds as the cash-strapped county struggle to secure ┬г20m investment to ensure their survival... with the famous ground valued at ┬г23m e-mail Add comment Comments 9 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have been moderated in advance.

England smashed it to all parts during their 17 overs, Alice Capsey top-scoring with 51 off 27 balls to take the hosts to an imposing total of 186-4. Sri Lanka got their reply underway but the rain intervened to turn this into a six-over game. There werenтАЩt too many scares for England as they closed out the game pretty comfortably, even with de SilvaтАЩs three consecutive fours in that final over. On we go to the next T20I, at Chelmsford on Saturday. 17m ago 21.45 BST England win by 12 runs (DLS) De Silva swings across the line to pick up four off Kate Cross, and then a full toss is carved over point for four more! Game on? De Silva then advances down the pitch to drive through extra cover for another boundary тАУ thatтАЩs three on the bounce! A pull shot brings one before a wide follows. Gunaratne picks up three to give de Silva one more hit. And thereтАЩs a run-out shout as de Silva wants to scamper for a quick single before tuning backтАж and after several replays, sheтАЩs given out, her bat still in the air. ThatтАЩs that. England go 1-0 up in this three-match T20I series. 24m ago 21.37 BST 5th over: Sri Lanka 38-2 (de Silva 5, Gunaratne) Nilakshi de Silva emerges but the game is pretty much gone now as Dean runs through the rest of her over. Sri Lanka need 30 from six balls. 26m ago 21.35 BST WICKET! Perera lbw Dean 0 (Sri Lanka 33-2) Another one falls. Hasini Perera, the new batter, tries to sweep Charlie Dean but misses out and thatтАЩs plumb. Sri Lanka review but itтАЩs wasted. 29m ago 21.33 BST WICKET! Athapaththu c Jones b Gaur 15 (Sri Lanka 32-1) Sri Lanka need to go all guns blazing and Gunaratne begins by running two. Athapaththu then gets on strike and immediately launches Gaur over wide long-on for six! It was full from Gaur and a beautiful swing of the bat from Athapaththu. Gaur responds with a sharp bouncer and then a wicket! Athapaththu swings hard across the line but can only land an edge that finds Jones behind the stumps. 4th over: Sri Lanka 32-1 (Gunaratne 13) Sri Lanka need 36 from 12 balls. 35m ago 21.27 BST WeтАЩre getting back out there now for a 9.29pm re-start.

That is a gloomy looking evening in Hove. Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock Updated at 21.02 BST 1h ago 20.45 BST 3rd over: Sri Lanka 23-0 (Gunaratne 10, Athapaththu 9) Danielle Gibson takes over from the other end and Athapaththu is off the mark with a boundary. Then thereтАЩs a bit of fortune from the left-hander as she goes for a big swing, a thick edge flying to the third-man boundary for four more. 1h ago 20.41 BST 2nd over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Athapaththu 0, Gunaratne 9) Now this is exciting тАУ here comes 17-year-old Mahika Gaur. Not an ideal start as a leg-side wide beats Amy JonesтАЩ fingertips and Sri Lanka collect three. And then a great riposte: swinging in to the right-hander and an lbw shout, but itтАЩs a touch high. Gunaratne then goes for a full-blooded swipe but misses out. Some decent movement for Gaur. Gunaratne tucks into the next delivery, though, driving an overpitched ball through point for four. Knight opts for a review, thinking thereтАЩs a little tickle off the bat down the leg side on the way to Jones тАУ but no dice. And the rain begins to fallтАж 1h ago 20.35 BST 1st over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Gunaratne 5, Athapaththu 0) Lovely timing from Gunaratne as Cross goes a touch too wide, punching off the backfoot through point for four. This is a comeback of sorts for Cross, her first T20I since December 2019, and she bowls a tighter line to the left-handed Athapaththu. 2h ago 20.31 BST Kate Cross will open up for England тАУ letтАЩs play! 2h ago 20.28 BST As mentioned earlier, Alice CapseyтАЩs rather special. Alice Capsey now has two out of four of England's fastest T20I fifties having made her T20I debut 13 months ago #ENGvSL тАФ Katya Witney (@KatyaWitney) August 31, 2023 2h ago 20.21 BST Sri Lanka need 187 from 17 overs to win 17th over: England 186-4 (Knight 23, Jones 4) PrabodhaniтАЩs left-arm seam will close out the innings and Knight greets her with a powerful straight drive for four. A wide follows that evades the keeper and runs all the way to the boundary. ItтАЩs quiet after that, but England have made more than enough noise, going at close to 11 an over. 2h ago 20.15 BST 16th over: England 171-4 (Knight 16, Jones 1) With one over to go, Knight has Amy Jones alongside her for a final smash. 2h ago 20.14 BST WICKET! Capsey b Athapaththu 51 (England 169-4) Knight reverse-sweeps Athapaththu past backward point for four but when Capsey tries the same shot, sheтАЩs bowled. Oh well, that was still some knock from the teenager. Alice Capsey is out for 51 scintillating runs. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA Updated at 20.26 BST 2h ago 20.10 BST Fifty for Alice Capsey! 15th over: England 162-3 (Knight 8, Capsey 51) Sri Lanka waste a review before Knight thumps Prabodhani over mid-off for four. SheтАЩs watched Capsey smack it about, now she wants some of that for herself. Capsey then gets a full toss that she slaps away to the leg side to move to 47. And then another boundary to close the over, taking Capsey to a half-century off just 26 balls. SheтАЩs a special, special talent. Alice Capsey acknowledges her brilliant fifty. Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images Updated at 20.23 BST 2h ago 20.04 BST 14th over: England 145-3 (Capsey 42, Knight 2) Capsey tries a funky reverse-swat off RanaweeraтАЩs left-arm spin but fails to make contact. She makes up for it the very next ball with a dance down the pitch and an almighty smack over deep midwicket for six. And then she repeats the trick, this time staying in her crease for the big olтАЩ slog-sweep. A front-foot no ball is up next before Capsey hits her third six of the over, again over deep midwicket! A full toss follows and Capsey is probably annoyed with herself for not making it four. 2h ago 19.59 BST 13th over: England 123-3 (Capsey 21, Knight 2) The boundaries resume as Capsey slogs Athapaththu to wide long-on for four. 2h ago 19.56 BST 12th over: England 116-3 (Capsey 15, Knight 1) Quality work from Dilhari as Heather Knight joins Capsey out in the middle. 2h ago 19.53 BST WICKET! Kemp st Sanjeewani b Dilhari 20 (England 113-3) Dilhari strikes with a smart bit of bowling, launching one flat and wide as Kemp advances out of her crease but loses all shape reaching for the ball. The keeper does the rest as Kemp tumbles onto the ground. Freya Kemp is smartly stumped by Anushka Sanjeewani. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters Updated at 20.04 BST 2h ago 19.50 BST 11th over: England 112-2 (Capsey 13, Kemp 20) Kemp goes big, slog-sweeping Kumari for six over midwicket. And then Kemp goes down the pitchтАж and itтАЩs dropped at long-off, with the ball then bobbling away for four. KempтАЩs fine over continues with a flick behind square on the leg side that runs away for another boundary. 2h ago 19.46 BST Some numbers for ya: Today's 77 run opening stand between Wyatt and Bouchier was the highest opening partnership for England in T20Is since Wyatt and Beaumont put on 82 for the first wicket against Australia in Adelaide (Jan 22) and their 16th highest of all time #ENGvSL тАФ The CricViz Analyst (@cricvizanalyst) August 31, 2023 2h ago 19.45 BST 10th over: England 94-2 (Kemp 3, Capsey 12) DilhariтАЩs very much in this game, darting the ball in and racing across the turf any time she needs to field off her bowling. But Capsey still finds a way to the boundary, cutting through point off the final ball of the over. 2h ago 19.42 BST 9th over: England 86-2 (Capsey 6, Kemp 1) Good fun was that Wyatt innings, but she wouldтАЩve been eyeing up a really big one. Instead, itтАЩs now Freya Kemp out there with Capsey. Sri Lanka are beginning to find their way in this game. 2h ago 19.40 BST WICKET! Wyatt b Ranaweera 48 (England 84-2) Ranaweera continues and strikes! ItтАЩs Wyatt who goes now. She backs away to the leg side to try and drive through off тАУ but makes no contact and the ball rattles the stumps. 2h ago 19.37 BST 8th over: England 82-1 (Wyatt 47, Capsey 4) Good over from Dilhari, whoтАЩs unlucky to concede a boundary from the final ball; Alice Capsey sees flight and goes for the drive outside off, with an outside edge running away for four. 2h ago 19.35 BST WICKET! Bouchier run out Dilhari 22 (England 77-1) The bowling changes keep on coming for Sri Lanka, with Kavisha Dilhari coming on to bowl her tweakers. She starts well, bowling with accuracyтАж and then a quality bit of work in the field! Dilhari fields off her own bowling, picking up at short mid-on before launching a throw at the non-strikerтАЩs stumps to run out Bouchier. Just the one stump to aim at and she nailed it. 3h ago 19.31 BST 7th over: England 75-0 (Bouchier 21, Wyatt 46) Inoka RanaweeraтАЩs left-arm spin enters the game and now itтАЩs BouchierтАЩs turn тАУ she gets on one knee and sweeps hard all the way for six. Meanwhile, bit random, but thereтАЩs a cardboard cutout of Roger Daltrey at Hove thatтАЩs got Butch chuckling. 3h ago 19.27 BST 6th over: England 66-0 (Bouchier 13, Wyatt 45) PrabodhaniтАЩs left-arm seam returns and WyattтАЩs fun continues тАУ she drives hard at a wider one and finds the gap behind point to move to 40. A direct hit at the stumps leads to overthrows to the boundary, making life even tougher for Sri Lanka. 3h ago 19.21 BST 5th over: England 55-0 (Bouchier 11, Wyatt 36) Athapaththu continues and tosses one up wide outside offтАж and the unstoppable Wyatt thwacks through the covers for another boundary, her sixth four of the innings. Danielle Wyatt smacks another boundary. Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock Updated at 19.30 BST 3h ago 19.19 BST 4th over: England 50-0 (Wyatt 32, Bouchier 11) Right-arm quick Kawya Kavindi steps into the attack andтАж begins with a wide. A full toss is then dispatched by Wyatt to midwicket for another four. A good comeback from Kavindi, though, as she swings and nips the ball away from WyattтАЩs attempted drive. A bouncer follows before Wyatt cuts over point to move into the thirties. A leg-side wide is up next before the next ball flies even wider down leg, past the keeper and to the boundary. Tough first over this for the 20-year-old, playing just her fifth T20I. Bouchier picks up two to get England to 50 in no time. 3h ago 19.12 BST 3rd over: England 32-0 (Wyatt 23, Bouchier 9) Athapaththu brings herself on to calm things down with some offies and does just that, conceding only four. 3h ago 19.10 BST 2nd over: England 28-0 (Bouchier 6, Wyatt 22) Left-arm spinner Sugandika Kumari takes over from the other end and drags one down тАУ Wyatt punishes it with a pull for a one-bounce four. Kumari then goes short again two balls later; this time, Wyatt sends it all the way for six, easy as you like. Better from Kumari as she fizzes one through, but Wyatt still manages to get out a late cut, the ball travelling for another boundary. Rapid start from Wyatt and England. 3h ago 19.04 BST 1st over: England 12-0 (Wyatt 6, Bouchier 6) Left-arm seamer Udeshika Prabodhani takes the new ball and gets a bit of early swing: Bouchier knocks through midwicket for a single to start. Wyatt gets a full toss and drives through the covers for four тАУ tidy. Three singles follow before Bouchier stretches out to loft the ball down the ground for her first boundary. 3h ago 18.59 BST Right then, Sri Lanka are out there, as are Danni Wyatt and Maia Bouchier. LetтАЩs play! 3h ago 18.41 BST Some other news from England: Lauren Bell is missing tonightтАЩs game and the second T20I because of illness. 3h ago 18.39 BST Sri LankaтАЩs XI: Harshitha Samarawickrama, Chamari Athapaththu (c), Nilakshi de Silva, Vishmi Gunaratne, Kavisha Dilhari, Anushka Sanjeewani (wk), Inoka Ranaweera, Sugandika Kumari, Udeshika Prabodhani, Hasini Perera, Kawya Kavindi 3h ago 18.35 BST EnglandтАЩs XI: We bat first in Hove! ЁЯТк An England debut for Mahika Gaur ЁЯзв #EnglandCricket | #ENGvSL тАФ England Cricket (@englandcricket) August 31, 2023 3h ago 18.34 BST Sri Lanka win the toss and choose to bowl first Chamari Athapaththu puts England into bat. Heather Knight says she wouldтАЩve done the same and confirms that Kate Cross is in for her first T20I since 2019. 4h ago 18.23 BST Mahika GaurтАЩs been presented with her cap by Kate Cross , a special moment for the 17-year-old quick. Looks like her family are out there too to take it in. Updated at 18.24 BST 4h ago 18.13 BST Game on! These covers will soon be off! ЁЯЩМ All set for a 1900 (UK) start here, playing 17 overs per side. #EnglandCricket | #ENGvSL pic.twitter.com/mkpZ52DNiB тАФ England Cricket (@englandcricket) August 31, 2023 Updated at 18.15 BST 4h ago 18.10 BST Right, maybe this is something to keep us busy for now: anyone fancy picking their England XI for the first game of the 2024 WomenтАЩs T20 World Cup? Send тАШem in. 4h ago 17.59 BST Some movement of the covers, with an inspection scheduled for 6pm. 4h ago 17.56 BST Naturally, thereтАЩs quite a bit of attention on Mahika Gaur . Worth noting that her England debut wonтАЩt be her international one тАУ she played for the UAE as a 12-year-old (!!!!!). Twelve. Twelve . DoesnтАЩt really relate to Gaur, but this video still comes to mind. 4h ago 17.47 BST Ugh, hopefully it clears up. Anyway, the pundits тАУ Butcher, Beaumont and Greenway тАУ have been singing the praises of Danni Wyatt, who was EnglandтАЩs leading run-scorer in the Ashes T20Is and then had an excellent Hundred too. She was class in the final: 4h ago 17.36 BST So Tammy BeaumontтАЩs on punditry duties for Sky. SheтАЩs certainly got a strong case to be in the playing XI today, having had a terrific summer for England in other forms before smashing a historic ton in The Hundred for Welsh Fire. By the way, the toss has been delayed. Looking rather gloomy at Hove with a bit of light rain in the air. 4h ago 17.33 BST ICYMI, this series also marks another beginning: EnglandтАЩs women will now be paid the same as the men when it comes to match fees. England Women to get match-fee parity with men after success of Ashes Read more 5h ago 17.30 BST Preamble Hello folks and welcome to the coverage of the opening T20I between England and Sri Lanka at Hove! ItтАЩs a new beginning for Heather KnightтАЩs side; an Ashes cycle has come to a close and thereтАЩs a bit of experimentation at play, with the next big thing on the horizon next yearтАЩs T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. Sophia DunkleyтАЩs been given a rest for both the T20Is and ODIs, as was Sophie Ecclestone before she dislocated her shoulder. Nat Sciver-Brunt has also been granted a break from these three T20Is, but sheтАЩll be back for the 50-over stuff. So who are the new kids on the block? Mahika Gaur, just 17, is a tall left-arm quick who has been picked on raw promise, while Bess Heath, the 22-year-old batter for Northern Diamonds, is capable of giving the ball a more than decent whack in the middle order. Both are uncapped; both are in for the two legs of Sri LankaтАЩs visit. With Dunkley away, Maia Bouchier will step up to partner Danni Wyatt at the top of the order in these T20Is, and sheтАЩs been hitting them well: 268 runs at 38.28 while striking at 135 helped Southern Brave to Hundred glory after their two previous runners-up finishes. ItтАЩs not been the most gorgeous day at Hove and the forecast isnтАЩt amazing, but letтАЩs just hope, eh. HereтАЩs to getting a game on, and a good one, too. IтАЩll be here to take you through to the close. Drop me an email/DM to chat about whatever you fancy! Gates are now open for spectators - the rain is now very light and the Grounds Team are ready to get to work once the rain stops. ЁЯПЯ Further updates will be made on our live blog.

Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Shane Watson and Michael Bevan have been called in as coaching consultants to help turn around Cricket NSW's on-field woes as the state attempts to rebound from its lowest ebb in 84 years. Winless in the Sheffield Shield last season for the first time since 1938-39, Cricket NSW unveiled a raft of changes and a back-to-the-future mantra on Friday morning. Included in those is Moises Henriques' confirmation as an all-formats captain, taking over from Kurtis Patterson after he was dropped for the final round of the Shield last summer. Henriques has captained NSW on 20 occasions in the Sheffield Shield in the past, but this appointment marks his first full-time ascension to the role. Watson and Bevan will both take on jobs as consultants to coach Greg Shipperd, who himself was rushed into the top job midway through last summer after the axing of Phil Jaques. Bevan will act as a batting coach, while Watson will provide mentoring and mindset coaching for players. Former Test bowlers Stuart Clark and Geoff Lawson have also been appointed selectors, joining Shipperd, NSW performance boss Greg Mail and David Freedman on the panel. \"No one at Cricket NSW was happy with what happened last season and we have now taken steps to turn things around, with the aim to build consistent success,\" CEO Lee Germon said. \"All of these guys come with extremely accomplished resumes and they have NSW cricket and the Blues in their DNA. That will bring a renewed edge to our structure and the playing group. \"The program is now being led by Greg Mail and Greg Shipperd and the playing squad, led by Moises (Henriques), have knuckled down in the off-season and are determined to challenge for titles. \"Now, by bringing in the collective experience and world-class skills of Michael Bevan and Shane Watson, we have added to our off-field support structure.\" NSW have already made on-field moves to turn around their form with all Sheffield Shield fixtures to be played in Sydney this summer with three at the SCG and two at the state's new base at Olympic Park. NSW also endured their worst women's season in history last summer, finishing sixth after their run of 24 straight finals was ended in the previous campaign.

In a statement, the ECB said the change will be effective immediately, beginning with this weekтАЩs white-ball series against Sri Lanka. The increase in womenтАЩs match fees was recommended in the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC) report, which found a significant pay gap existed between men and women. According to the report, which was released at the end of June, women received 25 percent of the menтАЩs fees for white-ball formats. For Test cricket, the figure dropped to 15 percent. Payments vary depending on where the opposition sit in a five-tier system тАФ Australia are the only team currently in the top tier тАФ devised by the ECB. Test matches are far more lucrative than white-ball internationals. This summer, each of the players in the menтАЩs squad earned ┬г15 000 for each of the five Tests against Australia. That meant England womenтАЩs players received ┬г2,250 for their only Test in the WomenтАЩs Ashes and less than ┬г1 000 for white-balls international тАФ the menтАЩs, by comparison earned around ┬г3 500. The ICEC report, which also highlighted racism, sexism and elitism pervaded the game in England, found the average salary for England womenтАЩs players was 20,6 percent of that of an England men player. The England womenтАЩs captainтАЩs allowance, meanwhile, was less than a third of that awarded to the menтАЩs captain. тАЬItтАЩs really important that we continue to drive the womenтАЩs game forward and itтАЩs fantastic to see equal match fees for England Women and England Men,тАЭ England WomenтАЩs captain Heather Knight said. тАЬThe direction of travel for the womenтАЩs game has always been the most important thing, creating a sustainable product that people want to watch and play, and IтАЩm sure this will make cricket an increasingly attractive sport to girls and young women as we continue to grow the game.тАЩ The increase in match fees comes on the back of a successful summer for womenтАЩs cricket, with the WomenтАЩs Ashes series attracting a combined 110 000 fans through the turnstiles. England set new womenтАЩs international attendance records at Edgbaston, the Kia Oval and LordтАЩs and sold out matches at Taunton, Bristol and Hampshire in their series against Australia. The Aussies retained the Ashes after winning the only Test, but England won both the T20 and ODI series in thrilling fashion. ECB chief executive Richard Gould said: тАЬWe are currently considering all the recommendations made by the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket, but equalising match fees is one immediate step we are pleased to make now. тАЬWe all want cricket to be the team sport of choice for female athletes, and with the investments we are making тАФ and increasingly lucrative opportunities around the world тАФ we are seeing cricketers become some of the highest earning female athletes in UK team sports. тАЬHowever, we know there is still much further to go as we ultimately strive for equality across the game.тАЭ The additional investment follows increases to domestic salary pots this year, while salaries for womenтАЩs players in The Hundred more than doubled last year. Gould said the ECB will тАЬcontinue to invest ahead of revenuesтАЭ in the coming years, adding it would place particular focus on growing the womenтАЩs game.","pubDate":"2023-08-31 22:06:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"businessweeklyzw","source_priority":383660,"country":["zimbabwe"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"100990cf6723291a4b493e568bcfc859","title":"Cricket Cranes retain East Africa T20 Cup In Kigali","link":"https://kawowo.com/2023/09/01/cricket-cranes-retain-east-africa-t20-cup-in-kigali/","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Denis Musali"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Cricket Cranes were dominant in the two-week tournament that featured Tanzania and hosts Rwanda.

The defending champions only dropped one game against Tanzania picking up a possible 11 wins from the 12 games. In a series in which the Cricket Cranes were the highest ranked team in the tournament and were expected to dominate the other two teams. All the three sides are preparing for the T20 World Cup Qualifiers in November this year the series was a perfect tournament to rest their squads. Coach Laurence Mahatlane should be happy with the shift his boys were able to put in. With Juma Miyagi and Cosmas Kyewuta long injury concerns Ceylon Lions fast blower David Wabwire was given a test of international cricket and despite having the extra pace needs to tighten up the line and length if he is going to be successful in the short version. Roger Mukasa got a lot of games under his belt and he got enough runs to justify his place at the top of the order. You wish he had converted the starts he was able to get but an in-form Roger Mukasa is good for the Cricket Cranes. Simon Ssesazi started slowly but eventually finished as the leading runs scorer in the tournament. Ronald Lutaaya lacked consistency but he showed that he belongs and has the skill to survive at that level. Ronak Patel got runs whenever he got a chance to play and his skills of field manipulation in the middle order might be a great option for the team at the qualifiers. Alpesh Ramjani got wickets and also scored runs and his all-round game should give him the confidence going forward. Kenneth Waiswa picked up the MVP crown and he needed a series like this one to remind people of his potential. He dominated bowlers when he got a crack and also picked up wickets with his medium pacers. There was a comeback of Jonathan Sebanja and when he got a chance he made the most of it. Cyrus Kakuru is a very good wicketkeeper but itтАЩs the run still missing and between now and the qualifiers is enough time for him to work on his skills. Pascal Murungi didnтАЩt get a lot of playing time mostly because the other all-rounders ahead of him were doing well but he is one for the future. The focus for the Cricket Cranes is the T20 World Cup Qualifiers in Namibia.","pubDate":"2023-08-31 21:14:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"kawowo","source_priority":2240457,"country":["uganda"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bae99a3f183acef6331736ec419d38a7","title":"EXCLUSIVE: Yorkshire are considering SELLING Headingley to raise funds as the cash-strapped county struggle to secure ┬г20m investment to ensure their survival... with the famous ground valued at ┬г23m","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12466077/Yorkshire-considering-SELLING-Headingley-raise-funds-cash-strapped-county-struggle-secure-20m-investment-ensure-survival-famous-ground-valued-23m.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"EXCLUSIVE BY MATT HUGHES: Yorkshire are considering selling their iconic Headingley ground to raise funds to ensure the cash-strapped county's survival.","content":"EXCLUSIVE: Yorkshire are considering SELLING Headingley to raise funds as the cash-strapped county struggle to secure ┬г20m investment to ensure their survival... with the famous ground valued at ┬г23m Yorkshire have yet to receive formal offers for the ground, their home since 1981 The ground has regularly hosted England Test matches, including in the Ashes By Matt Hughes For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:10 BST, 31 August 2023 e-mail 9 View comments Yorkshire are considering selling their iconic Headingley ground to ensure the cash-strapped countyтАЩs survival. The club have been seeking around ┬г20million in investment since December but have yet to secure the funding despite interest from potential partners including Mike Ashley, IPL franchises and a Saudi prince. Another option being pondered by Yorkshire is to sell Headingley and lease it back in a model that has been used successfully by several football clubs including Aston Villa. They recently had the stadium valued at around ┬г23m by a real estate company. Yorkshire have yet to receive formal offers for the ground that has been their home since 1891, but expect considerable interest given HeadingleyтАЩs worldwide fame. Sources have told Mail Sport that Yorkshire would only sell Headingley if they could secure a 10-year lease which included the option to buy it back. Yorkshire are considering selling Headingley, which has been valued at ┬г23million Yorkshire are understood to have rejected several bids to buy the club outright because they want to ensure they remain controlled by their members. The sale of Headingley would provide funds needed to pay off the ┬г15.9m owed to the family trust of former chairman Colin Graves, as well as years of running costs. Yorkshire have been beset by financial problems since losing most of their sponsors and incurring costs of around ┬г3.5m following the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal two years ago. The clubтАЩs most recent published accounts showed losses of ┬г2.2m, with Yorkshire conceding that they faced a battle for survival. Income generated by this summerтАЩs Ashes Test enabled them to pay their bills and get through the season, but they face further issues in October when a repayment of ┬г500,000 is due to the Colin Graves Trust. Talks with numerous investors over refinancing the Graves family loan have yet to produce a deal due to the high interest rates Yorkshire have been quoted, with AshleyтАЩs proposal тАФ which would see the former Newcastle owner gain branding and retail rights at Headingley тАФ thought to be the most advanced. Yorkshire bought Headingley in 2005 from the Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Company in a deal that resulted in the club gaining a 15-year international match-staging deal from the ECB. The purchase cost them ┬г12m, so almost doubling their money in 18 years would be a good return. Yorkshire chief executive Stephen Vaughan told Mail Sport: тАШWe are making strong progress on securing the long-term future of Yorkshire County Cricket Club and look forward to announcing positive developments shortly.тАЩ The iconic ground hosted the third Ashes Test between England and Australia this summer Share or comment on this article: EXCLUSIVE: Yorkshire are considering SELLING Headingley to raise funds as the cash-strapped county struggle to secure ┬г20m investment to ensure their survival... with the famous ground valued at ┬г23m e-mail Add comment Comments 9 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have been moderated in advance.

Not an ideal start as a leg-side wide beats Amy JonesтАЩ fingertips and Sri Lanka collect three. And then a great riposte: swinging in to the right-hander and an lbw shout, but itтАЩs a touch high. Gunaratne then goes for a full-blooded swipe but misses out. Some decent movement for Gaur. Gunaratne tucks into the next delivery, though, driving an overpitched ball through point for four. Knight opts for a review, thinking thereтАЩs a little tickle off the bat down the leg side on the way to Jones тАУ but no dice. And the rain begins to fallтАж 1h ago 20.35 BST 1st over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Gunaratne 5, Athapaththu 0) Lovely timing from Gunaratne as Cross goes a touch too wide, punching off the backfoot through point for four. This is a comeback of sorts for Cross, her first T20I since December 2019, and she bowls a tighter line to the left-handed Athapaththu. 2h ago 20.31 BST Kate Cross will open up for England тАУ letтАЩs play! 2h ago 20.28 BST As mentioned earlier, Alice CapseyтАЩs rather special. Alice Capsey now has two out of four of England's fastest T20I fifties having made her T20I debut 13 months ago #ENGvSL тАФ Katya Witney (@KatyaWitney) August 31, 2023 2h ago 20.21 BST Sri Lanka need 187 from 17 overs to win 17th over: England 186-4 (Knight 23, Jones 4) PrabodhaniтАЩs left-arm seam will close out the innings and Knight greets her with a powerful straight drive for four. A wide follows that evades the keeper and runs all the way to the boundary. ItтАЩs quiet after that, but England have made more than enough noise, going at close to 11 an over. 2h ago 20.15 BST 16th over: England 171-4 (Knight 16, Jones 1) With one over to go, Knight has Amy Jones alongside her for a final smash. 2h ago 20.14 BST WICKET! Capsey b Athapaththu 51 (England 169-4) Knight reverse-sweeps Athapaththu past backward point for four but when Capsey tries the same shot, sheтАЩs bowled. Oh well, that was still some knock from the teenager. Alice Capsey is out for 51 scintillating runs. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA Updated at 20.26 BST 2h ago 20.10 BST Fifty for Alice Capsey! 15th over: England 162-3 (Knight 8, Capsey 51) Sri Lanka waste a review before Knight thumps Prabodhani over mid-off for four. SheтАЩs watched Capsey smack it about, now she wants some of that for herself. Capsey then gets a full toss that she slaps away to the leg side to move to 47. And then another boundary to close the over, taking Capsey to a half-century off just 26 balls. SheтАЩs a special, special talent. Alice Capsey acknowledges her brilliant fifty. Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images Updated at 20.23 BST 2h ago 20.04 BST 14th over: England 145-3 (Capsey 42, Knight 2) Capsey tries a funky reverse-swat off RanaweeraтАЩs left-arm spin but fails to make contact. She makes up for it the very next ball with a dance down the pitch and an almighty smack over deep midwicket for six. And then she repeats the trick, this time staying in her crease for the big olтАЩ slog-sweep. A front-foot no ball is up next before Capsey hits her third six of the over, again over deep midwicket! A full toss follows and Capsey is probably annoyed with herself for not making it four. 2h ago 19.59 BST 13th over: England 123-3 (Capsey 21, Knight 2) The boundaries resume as Capsey slogs Athapaththu to wide long-on for four. 2h ago 19.56 BST 12th over: England 116-3 (Capsey 15, Knight 1) Quality work from Dilhari as Heather Knight joins Capsey out in the middle. 2h ago 19.53 BST WICKET! Kemp st Sanjeewani b Dilhari 20 (England 113-3) Dilhari strikes with a smart bit of bowling, launching one flat and wide as Kemp advances out of her crease but loses all shape reaching for the ball. The keeper does the rest as Kemp tumbles onto the ground. Freya Kemp is smartly stumped by Anushka Sanjeewani. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters Updated at 20.04 BST 2h ago 19.50 BST 11th over: England 112-2 (Capsey 13, Kemp 20) Kemp goes big, slog-sweeping Kumari for six over midwicket. And then Kemp goes down the pitchтАж and itтАЩs dropped at long-off, with the ball then bobbling away for four. KempтАЩs fine over continues with a flick behind square on the leg side that runs away for another boundary. 2h ago 19.46 BST Some numbers for ya: Today's 77 run opening stand between Wyatt and Bouchier was the highest opening partnership for England in T20Is since Wyatt and Beaumont put on 82 for the first wicket against Australia in Adelaide (Jan 22) and their 16th highest of all time #ENGvSL тАФ The CricViz Analyst (@cricvizanalyst) August 31, 2023 2h ago 19.45 BST 10th over: England 94-2 (Kemp 3, Capsey 12) DilhariтАЩs very much in this game, darting the ball in and racing across the turf any time she needs to field off her bowling. But Capsey still finds a way to the boundary, cutting through point off the final ball of the over. 2h ago 19.42 BST 9th over: England 86-2 (Capsey 6, Kemp 1) Good fun was that Wyatt innings, but she wouldтАЩve been eyeing up a really big one. Instead, itтАЩs now Freya Kemp out there with Capsey. Sri Lanka are beginning to find their way in this game. 2h ago 19.40 BST WICKET! Wyatt b Ranaweera 48 (England 84-2) Ranaweera continues and strikes! ItтАЩs Wyatt who goes now. She backs away to the leg side to try and drive through off тАУ but makes no contact and the ball rattles the stumps. 2h ago 19.37 BST 8th over: England 82-1 (Wyatt 47, Capsey 4) Good over from Dilhari, whoтАЩs unlucky to concede a boundary from the final ball; Alice Capsey sees flight and goes for the drive outside off, with an outside edge running away for four. 2h ago 19.35 BST WICKET! Bouchier run out Dilhari 22 (England 77-1) The bowling changes keep on coming for Sri Lanka, with Kavisha Dilhari coming on to bowl her tweakers. She starts well, bowling with accuracyтАж and then a quality bit of work in the field! Dilhari fields off her own bowling, picking up at short mid-on before launching a throw at the non-strikerтАЩs stumps to run out Bouchier. Just the one stump to aim at and she nailed it. 3h ago 19.31 BST 7th over: England 75-0 (Bouchier 21, Wyatt 46) Inoka RanaweeraтАЩs left-arm spin enters the game and now itтАЩs BouchierтАЩs turn тАУ she gets on one knee and sweeps hard all the way for six. Meanwhile, bit random, but thereтАЩs a cardboard cutout of Roger Daltrey at Hove thatтАЩs got Butch chuckling. 3h ago 19.27 BST 6th over: England 66-0 (Bouchier 13, Wyatt 45) PrabodhaniтАЩs left-arm seam returns and WyattтАЩs fun continues тАУ she drives hard at a wider one and finds the gap behind point to move to 40. A direct hit at the stumps leads to overthrows to the boundary, making life even tougher for Sri Lanka. 3h ago 19.21 BST 5th over: England 55-0 (Bouchier 11, Wyatt 36) Athapaththu continues and tosses one up wide outside offтАж and the unstoppable Wyatt thwacks through the covers for another boundary, her sixth four of the innings. Danielle Wyatt smacks another boundary. Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock Updated at 19.30 BST 3h ago 19.19 BST 4th over: England 50-0 (Wyatt 32, Bouchier 11) Right-arm quick Kawya Kavindi steps into the attack andтАж begins with a wide. A full toss is then dispatched by Wyatt to midwicket for another four. A good comeback from Kavindi, though, as she swings and nips the ball away from WyattтАЩs attempted drive. A bouncer follows before Wyatt cuts over point to move into the thirties. A leg-side wide is up next before the next ball flies even wider down leg, past the keeper and to the boundary. Tough first over this for the 20-year-old, playing just her fifth T20I. Bouchier picks up two to get England to 50 in no time. 3h ago 19.12 BST 3rd over: England 32-0 (Wyatt 23, Bouchier 9) Athapaththu brings herself on to calm things down with some offies and does just that, conceding only four. 3h ago 19.10 BST 2nd over: England 28-0 (Bouchier 6, Wyatt 22) Left-arm spinner Sugandika Kumari takes over from the other end and drags one down тАУ Wyatt punishes it with a pull for a one-bounce four. Kumari then goes short again two balls later; this time, Wyatt sends it all the way for six, easy as you like. Better from Kumari as she fizzes one through, but Wyatt still manages to get out a late cut, the ball travelling for another boundary. Rapid start from Wyatt and England. 3h ago 19.04 BST 1st over: England 12-0 (Wyatt 6, Bouchier 6) Left-arm seamer Udeshika Prabodhani takes the new ball and gets a bit of early swing: Bouchier knocks through midwicket for a single to start. Wyatt gets a full toss and drives through the covers for four тАУ tidy. Three singles follow before Bouchier stretches out to loft the ball down the ground for her first boundary. 3h ago 18.59 BST Right then, Sri Lanka are out there, as are Danni Wyatt and Maia Bouchier. LetтАЩs play! 3h ago 18.41 BST Some other news from England: Lauren Bell is missing tonightтАЩs game and the second T20I because of illness. 3h ago 18.39 BST Sri LankaтАЩs XI: Harshitha Samarawickrama, Chamari Athapaththu (c), Nilakshi de Silva, Vishmi Gunaratne, Kavisha Dilhari, Anushka Sanjeewani (wk), Inoka Ranaweera, Sugandika Kumari, Udeshika Prabodhani, Hasini Perera, Kawya Kavindi 3h ago 18.35 BST EnglandтАЩs XI: We bat first in Hove! ЁЯТк An England debut for Mahika Gaur ЁЯзв #EnglandCricket | #ENGvSL тАФ England Cricket (@englandcricket) August 31, 2023 3h ago 18.34 BST Sri Lanka win the toss and choose to bowl first Chamari Athapaththu puts England into bat. Heather Knight says she wouldтАЩve done the same and confirms that Kate Cross is in for her first T20I since 2019. 4h ago 18.23 BST Mahika GaurтАЩs been presented with her cap by Kate Cross , a special moment for the 17-year-old quick. Looks like her family are out there too to take it in. Updated at 18.24 BST 4h ago 18.13 BST Game on! These covers will soon be off! ЁЯЩМ All set for a 1900 (UK) start here, playing 17 overs per side. #EnglandCricket | #ENGvSL pic.twitter.com/mkpZ52DNiB тАФ England Cricket (@englandcricket) August 31, 2023 Updated at 18.15 BST 4h ago 18.10 BST Right, maybe this is something to keep us busy for now: anyone fancy picking their England XI for the first game of the 2024 WomenтАЩs T20 World Cup? Send тАШem in. 4h ago 17.59 BST Some movement of the covers, with an inspection scheduled for 6pm. 4h ago 17.56 BST Naturally, thereтАЩs quite a bit of attention on Mahika Gaur . Worth noting that her England debut wonтАЩt be her international one тАУ she played for the UAE as a 12-year-old (!!!!!). Twelve. Twelve . DoesnтАЩt really relate to Gaur, but this video still comes to mind. 4h ago 17.47 BST Ugh, hopefully it clears up. Anyway, the pundits тАУ Butcher, Beaumont and Greenway тАУ have been singing the praises of Danni Wyatt, who was EnglandтАЩs leading run-scorer in the Ashes T20Is and then had an excellent Hundred too. She was class in the final: 4h ago 17.36 BST So Tammy BeaumontтАЩs on punditry duties for Sky. SheтАЩs certainly got a strong case to be in the playing XI today, having had a terrific summer for England in other forms before smashing a historic ton in The Hundred for Welsh Fire. By the way, the toss has been delayed. Looking rather gloomy at Hove with a bit of light rain in the air. 4h ago 17.33 BST ICYMI, this series also marks another beginning: EnglandтАЩs women will now be paid the same as the men when it comes to match fees. England Women to get match-fee parity with men after success of Ashes Read more 5h ago 17.30 BST Preamble Hello folks and welcome to the coverage of the opening T20I between England and Sri Lanka at Hove! ItтАЩs a new beginning for Heather KnightтАЩs side; an Ashes cycle has come to a close and thereтАЩs a bit of experimentation at play, with the next big thing on the horizon next yearтАЩs T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. Sophia DunkleyтАЩs been given a rest for both the T20Is and ODIs, as was Sophie Ecclestone before she dislocated her shoulder. Nat Sciver-Brunt has also been granted a break from these three T20Is, but sheтАЩll be back for the 50-over stuff. So who are the new kids on the block? Mahika Gaur, just 17, is a tall left-arm quick who has been picked on raw promise, while Bess Heath, the 22-year-old batter for Northern Diamonds, is capable of giving the ball a more than decent whack in the middle order. Both are uncapped; both are in for the two legs of Sri LankaтАЩs visit. With Dunkley away, Maia Bouchier will step up to partner Danni Wyatt at the top of the order in these T20Is, and sheтАЩs been hitting them well: 268 runs at 38.28 while striking at 135 helped Southern Brave to Hundred glory after their two previous runners-up finishes. ItтАЩs not been the most gorgeous day at Hove and the forecast isnтАЩt amazing, but letтАЩs just hope, eh. HereтАЩs to getting a game on, and a good one, too. IтАЩll be here to take you through to the close. Drop me an email/DM to chat about whatever you fancy! Gates are now open for spectators - the rain is now very light and the Grounds Team are ready to get to work once the rain stops. ЁЯПЯ Further updates will be made on our live blog.

Bevan headline changes at Cricket NSW","link":"https://www.blayneychronicle.com.au/story/8331956/watson-bevan-headline-changes-at-cricket-nsw/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Shane Watson and Michael Bevan have been called in as coaching consultants to help turn around Cricket NSW's on-field woes as the state attempts to rebound from its lowest ebb in 84 years. Winless in the Sheffield Shield last season for the first time since 1938-39, Cricket NSW unveiled a raft of changes and a back-to-the-future mantra on Friday morning. Included in those is Moises Henriques' confirmation as an all-formats captain, taking over from Kurtis Patterson after he was dropped for the final round of the Shield last summer. Henriques has captained NSW on 20 occasions in the Sheffield Shield in the past, but this appointment marks his first full-time ascension to the role. Watson and Bevan will both take on jobs as consultants to coach Greg Shipperd, who himself was rushed into the top job midway through last summer after the axing of Phil Jaques. Bevan will act as a batting coach, while Watson will provide mentoring and mindset coaching for players. Former Test bowlers Stuart Clark and Geoff Lawson have also been appointed selectors, joining Shipperd, NSW performance boss Greg Mail and David Freedman on the panel. \"No one at Cricket NSW was happy with what happened last season and we have now taken steps to turn things around, with the aim to build consistent success,\" CEO Lee Germon said. \"All of these guys come with extremely accomplished resumes and they have NSW cricket and the Blues in their DNA. That will bring a renewed edge to our structure and the playing group. \"The program is now being led by Greg Mail and Greg Shipperd and the playing squad, led by Moises (Henriques), have knuckled down in the off-season and are determined to challenge for titles. \"Now, by bringing in the collective experience and world-class skills of Michael Bevan and Shane Watson, we have added to our off-field support structure.\" NSW have already made on-field moves to turn around their form with all Sheffield Shield fixtures to be played in Sydney this summer with three at the SCG and two at the state's new base at Olympic Park.

In a statement, the ECB said the change will be effective immediately, beginning with this weekтАЩs white-ball series against Sri Lanka. The increase in womenтАЩs match fees was recommended in the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC) report, which found a significant pay gap existed between men and women. According to the report, which was released at the end of June, women received 25 percent of the menтАЩs fees for white-ball formats. For Test cricket, the figure dropped to 15 percent. Payments vary depending on where the opposition sit in a five-tier system тАФ Australia are the only team currently in the top tier тАФ devised by the ECB. Test matches are far more lucrative than white-ball internationals. This summer, each of the players in the menтАЩs squad earned ┬г15 000 for each of the five Tests against Australia. That meant England womenтАЩs players received ┬г2,250 for their only Test in the WomenтАЩs Ashes and less than ┬г1 000 for white-balls international тАФ the menтАЩs, by comparison earned around ┬г3 500. The ICEC report, which also highlighted racism, sexism and elitism pervaded the game in England, found the average salary for England womenтАЩs players was 20,6 percent of that of an England men player. The England womenтАЩs captainтАЩs allowance, meanwhile, was less than a third of that awarded to the menтАЩs captain. тАЬItтАЩs really important that we continue to drive the womenтАЩs game forward and itтАЩs fantastic to see equal match fees for England Women and England Men,тАЭ England WomenтАЩs captain Heather Knight said. тАЬThe direction of travel for the womenтАЩs game has always been the most important thing, creating a sustainable product that people want to watch and play, and IтАЩm sure this will make cricket an increasingly attractive sport to girls and young women as we continue to grow the game.тАЩ The increase in match fees comes on the back of a successful summer for womenтАЩs cricket, with the WomenтАЩs Ashes series attracting a combined 110 000 fans through the turnstiles. England set new womenтАЩs international attendance records at Edgbaston, the Kia Oval and LordтАЩs and sold out matches at Taunton, Bristol and Hampshire in their series against Australia. The Aussies retained the Ashes after winning the only Test, but England won both the T20 and ODI series in thrilling fashion. ECB chief executive Richard Gould said: тАЬWe are currently considering all the recommendations made by the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket, but equalising match fees is one immediate step we are pleased to make now. тАЬWe all want cricket to be the team sport of choice for female athletes, and with the investments we are making тАФ and increasingly lucrative opportunities around the world тАФ we are seeing cricketers become some of the highest earning female athletes in UK team sports. тАЬHowever, we know there is still much further to go as we ultimately strive for equality across the game.тАЭ The additional investment follows increases to domestic salary pots this year, while salaries for womenтАЩs players in The Hundred more than doubled last year. Gould said the ECB will тАЬcontinue to invest ahead of revenuesтАЭ in the coming years, adding it would place particular focus on growing the womenтАЩs game.","pubDate":"2023-08-31 22:06:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"businessweeklyzw","source_priority":383660,"country":["zimbabwe"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"100990cf6723291a4b493e568bcfc859","title":"Cricket Cranes retain East Africa T20 Cup In Kigali","link":"https://kawowo.com/2023/09/01/cricket-cranes-retain-east-africa-t20-cup-in-kigali/","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Denis Musali"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Cricket Cranes were dominant in the two-week tournament that featured Tanzania and hosts Rwanda.

The defending champions only dropped one game against Tanzania picking up a possible 11 wins from the 12 games. In a series in which the Cricket Cranes were the highest ranked team in the tournament and were expected to dominate the other two teams. All the three sides are preparing for the T20 World Cup Qualifiers in November this year the series was a perfect tournament to rest their squads. Coach Laurence Mahatlane should be happy with the shift his boys were able to put in. With Juma Miyagi and Cosmas Kyewuta long injury concerns Ceylon Lions fast blower David Wabwire was given a test of international cricket and despite having the extra pace needs to tighten up the line and length if he is going to be successful in the short version. Roger Mukasa got a lot of games under his belt and he got enough runs to justify his place at the top of the order. You wish he had converted the starts he was able to get but an in-form Roger Mukasa is good for the Cricket Cranes. Simon Ssesazi started slowly but eventually finished as the leading runs scorer in the tournament. Ronald Lutaaya lacked consistency but he showed that he belongs and has the skill to survive at that level. Ronak Patel got runs whenever he got a chance to play and his skills of field manipulation in the middle order might be a great option for the team at the qualifiers. Alpesh Ramjani got wickets and also scored runs and his all-round game should give him the confidence going forward. Kenneth Waiswa picked up the MVP crown and he needed a series like this one to remind people of his potential. He dominated bowlers when he got a crack and also picked up wickets with his medium pacers. There was a comeback of Jonathan Sebanja and when he got a chance he made the most of it. Cyrus Kakuru is a very good wicketkeeper but itтАЩs the run still missing and between now and the qualifiers is enough time for him to work on his skills. Pascal Murungi didnтАЩt get a lot of playing time mostly because the other all-rounders ahead of him were doing well but he is one for the future. The focus for the Cricket Cranes is the T20 World Cup Qualifiers in Namibia.","pubDate":"2023-08-31 21:14:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"kawowo","source_priority":2240457,"country":["uganda"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bae99a3f183acef6331736ec419d38a7","title":"EXCLUSIVE: Yorkshire are considering SELLING Headingley to raise funds as the cash-strapped county struggle to secure ┬г20m investment to ensure their survival... with the famous ground valued at ┬г23m","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12466077/Yorkshire-considering-SELLING-Headingley-raise-funds-cash-strapped-county-struggle-secure-20m-investment-ensure-survival-famous-ground-valued-23m.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"EXCLUSIVE BY MATT HUGHES: Yorkshire are considering selling their iconic Headingley ground to raise funds to ensure the cash-strapped county's survival.","content":"EXCLUSIVE: Yorkshire are considering SELLING Headingley to raise funds as the cash-strapped county struggle to secure ┬г20m investment to ensure their survival... with the famous ground valued at ┬г23m Yorkshire have yet to receive formal offers for the ground, their home since 1981 The ground has regularly hosted England Test matches, including in the Ashes By Matt Hughes For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:10 BST, 31 August 2023 e-mail 9 View comments Yorkshire are considering selling their iconic Headingley ground to ensure the cash-strapped countyтАЩs survival. The club have been seeking around ┬г20million in investment since December but have yet to secure the funding despite interest from potential partners including Mike Ashley, IPL franchises and a Saudi prince. Another option being pondered by Yorkshire is to sell Headingley and lease it back in a model that has been used successfully by several football clubs including Aston Villa. They recently had the stadium valued at around ┬г23m by a real estate company. Yorkshire have yet to receive formal offers for the ground that has been their home since 1891, but expect considerable interest given HeadingleyтАЩs worldwide fame. Sources have told Mail Sport that Yorkshire would only sell Headingley if they could secure a 10-year lease which included the option to buy it back. Yorkshire are considering selling Headingley, which has been valued at ┬г23million Yorkshire are understood to have rejected several bids to buy the club outright because they want to ensure they remain controlled by their members. The sale of Headingley would provide funds needed to pay off the ┬г15.9m owed to the family trust of former chairman Colin Graves, as well as years of running costs. Yorkshire have been beset by financial problems since losing most of their sponsors and incurring costs of around ┬г3.5m following the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal two years ago. The clubтАЩs most recent published accounts showed losses of ┬г2.2m, with Yorkshire conceding that they faced a battle for survival. Income generated by this summerтАЩs Ashes Test enabled them to pay their bills and get through the season, but they face further issues in October when a repayment of ┬г500,000 is due to the Colin Graves Trust. Talks with numerous investors over refinancing the Graves family loan have yet to produce a deal due to the high interest rates Yorkshire have been quoted, with AshleyтАЩs proposal тАФ which would see the former Newcastle owner gain branding and retail rights at Headingley тАФ thought to be the most advanced. Yorkshire bought Headingley in 2005 from the Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Company in a deal that resulted in the club gaining a 15-year international match-staging deal from the ECB. The purchase cost them ┬г12m, so almost doubling their money in 18 years would be a good return. Yorkshire chief executive Stephen Vaughan told Mail Sport: тАШWe are making strong progress on securing the long-term future of Yorkshire County Cricket Club and look forward to announcing positive developments shortly.тАЩ The iconic ground hosted the third Ashes Test between England and Australia this summer Share or comment on this article: EXCLUSIVE: Yorkshire are considering SELLING Headingley to raise funds as the cash-strapped county struggle to secure ┬г20m investment to ensure their survival... with the famous ground valued at ┬г23m e-mail Add comment Comments 9 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have been moderated in advance.

England smashed it to all parts during their 17 overs, Alice Capsey top-scoring with 51 off 27 balls to take the hosts to an imposing total of 186-4. Sri Lanka got their reply underway but the rain intervened to turn this into a six-over game. There werenтАЩt too many scares for England as they closed out the game pretty comfortably, even with de SilvaтАЩs three consecutive fours in that final over. On we go to the next T20I, at Chelmsford on Saturday. 17m ago 21.45 BST England win by 12 runs (DLS) De Silva swings across the line to pick up four off Kate Cross, and then a full toss is carved over point for four more! Game on? De Silva then advances down the pitch to drive through extra cover for another boundary тАУ thatтАЩs three on the bounce! A pull shot brings one before a wide follows. Gunaratne picks up three to give de Silva one more hit. And thereтАЩs a run-out shout as de Silva wants to scamper for a quick single before tuning backтАж and after several replays, sheтАЩs given out, her bat still in the air. ThatтАЩs that. England go 1-0 up in this three-match T20I series. 24m ago 21.37 BST 5th over: Sri Lanka 38-2 (de Silva 5, Gunaratne) Nilakshi de Silva emerges but the game is pretty much gone now as Dean runs through the rest of her over. Sri Lanka need 30 from six balls. 26m ago 21.35 BST WICKET! Perera lbw Dean 0 (Sri Lanka 33-2) Another one falls. Hasini Perera, the new batter, tries to sweep Charlie Dean but misses out and thatтАЩs plumb. Sri Lanka review but itтАЩs wasted. 29m ago 21.33 BST WICKET! Athapaththu c Jones b Gaur 15 (Sri Lanka 32-1) Sri Lanka need to go all guns blazing and Gunaratne begins by running two. Athapaththu then gets on strike and immediately launches Gaur over wide long-on for six! It was full from Gaur and a beautiful swing of the bat from Athapaththu. Gaur responds with a sharp bouncer and then a wicket! Athapaththu swings hard across the line but can only land an edge that finds Jones behind the stumps. 4th over: Sri Lanka 32-1 (Gunaratne 13) Sri Lanka need 36 from 12 balls. 35m ago 21.27 BST WeтАЩre getting back out there now for a 9.29pm re-start. Mahika GaurтАЩs got the ball. Charles Dagnall on comms says itтАЩs drizzling againтАж Updated at 21.28 BST 36m ago 21.26 BST Sri Lanka need 68 from six overs OK, weтАЩre gonna have a six-over game!

Still no news on whatтАЩs happening. 1h ago 21.03 BST Looks like the covers are coming off, so maybe we do still have a game on here. WeтАЩve had 3.1 overs of the Sri Lanka innings so 11 more balls are required to ensure a result. 1h ago 20.52 BST The view from the ground. Not pretty. Wet. pic.twitter.com/IJSMvGse5u тАФ Nick Friend (@NickFriend1) August 31, 2023 1h ago 20.46 BST The rain is getting noticeable heavier and the players are heading off. Ugh. That is a gloomy looking evening in Hove. Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock Updated at 21.02 BST 1h ago 20.45 BST 3rd over: Sri Lanka 23-0 (Gunaratne 10, Athapaththu 9) Danielle Gibson takes over from the other end and Athapaththu is off the mark with a boundary. Then thereтАЩs a bit of fortune from the left-hander as she goes for a big swing, a thick edge flying to the third-man boundary for four more. 1h ago 20.41 BST 2nd over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Athapaththu 0, Gunaratne 9) Now this is exciting тАУ here comes 17-year-old Mahika Gaur. Not an ideal start as a leg-side wide beats Amy JonesтАЩ fingertips and Sri Lanka collect three. And then a great riposte: swinging in to the right-hander and an lbw shout, but itтАЩs a touch high. Gunaratne then goes for a full-blooded swipe but misses out. Some decent movement for Gaur. Gunaratne tucks into the next delivery, though, driving an overpitched ball through point for four. Knight opts for a review, thinking thereтАЩs a little tickle off the bat down the leg side on the way to Jones тАУ but no dice. And the rain begins to fallтАж 1h ago 20.35 BST 1st over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Gunaratne 5, Athapaththu 0) Lovely timing from Gunaratne as Cross goes a touch too wide, punching off the backfoot through point for four. This is a comeback of sorts for Cross, her first T20I since December 2019, and she bowls a tighter line to the left-handed Athapaththu. 2h ago 20.31 BST Kate Cross will open up for England тАУ letтАЩs play! 2h ago 20.28 BST As mentioned earlier, Alice CapseyтАЩs rather special. Alice Capsey now has two out of four of England's fastest T20I fifties having made her T20I debut 13 months ago #ENGvSL тАФ Katya Witney (@KatyaWitney) August 31, 2023 2h ago 20.21 BST Sri Lanka need 187 from 17 overs to win 17th over: England 186-4 (Knight 23, Jones 4) PrabodhaniтАЩs left-arm seam will close out the innings and Knight greets her with a powerful straight drive for four. A wide follows that evades the keeper and runs all the way to the boundary. ItтАЩs quiet after that, but England have made more than enough noise, going at close to 11 an over. 2h ago 20.15 BST 16th over: England 171-4 (Knight 16, Jones 1) With one over to go, Knight has Amy Jones alongside her for a final smash. 2h ago 20.14 BST WICKET! Capsey b Athapaththu 51 (England 169-4) Knight reverse-sweeps Athapaththu past backward point for four but when Capsey tries the same shot, sheтАЩs bowled. Oh well, that was still some knock from the teenager. Alice Capsey is out for 51 scintillating runs. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA Updated at 20.26 BST 2h ago 20.10 BST Fifty for Alice Capsey! 15th over: England 162-3 (Knight 8, Capsey 51) Sri Lanka waste a review before Knight thumps Prabodhani over mid-off for four. SheтАЩs watched Capsey smack it about, now she wants some of that for herself. Capsey then gets a full toss that she slaps away to the leg side to move to 47. And then another boundary to close the over, taking Capsey to a half-century off just 26 balls. SheтАЩs a special, special talent. Alice Capsey acknowledges her brilliant fifty. Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images Updated at 20.23 BST 2h ago 20.04 BST 14th over: England 145-3 (Capsey 42, Knight 2) Capsey tries a funky reverse-swat off RanaweeraтАЩs left-arm spin but fails to make contact. She makes up for it the very next ball with a dance down the pitch and an almighty smack over deep midwicket for six. And then she repeats the trick, this time staying in her crease for the big olтАЩ slog-sweep. A front-foot no ball is up next before Capsey hits her third six of the over, again over deep midwicket! A full toss follows and Capsey is probably annoyed with herself for not making it four. 2h ago 19.59 BST 13th over: England 123-3 (Capsey 21, Knight 2) The boundaries resume as Capsey slogs Athapaththu to wide long-on for four. 2h ago 19.56 BST 12th over: England 116-3 (Capsey 15, Knight 1) Quality work from Dilhari as Heather Knight joins Capsey out in the middle. 2h ago 19.53 BST WICKET! Kemp st Sanjeewani b Dilhari 20 (England 113-3) Dilhari strikes with a smart bit of bowling, launching one flat and wide as Kemp advances out of her crease but loses all shape reaching for the ball. The keeper does the rest as Kemp tumbles onto the ground. Freya Kemp is smartly stumped by Anushka Sanjeewani. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters Updated at 20.04 BST 2h ago 19.50 BST 11th over: England 112-2 (Capsey 13, Kemp 20) Kemp goes big, slog-sweeping Kumari for six over midwicket. And then Kemp goes down the pitchтАж and itтАЩs dropped at long-off, with the ball then bobbling away for four. KempтАЩs fine over continues with a flick behind square on the leg side that runs away for another boundary. 2h ago 19.46 BST Some numbers for ya: Today's 77 run opening stand between Wyatt and Bouchier was the highest opening partnership for England in T20Is since Wyatt and Beaumont put on 82 for the first wicket against Australia in Adelaide (Jan 22) and their 16th highest of all time #ENGvSL тАФ The CricViz Analyst (@cricvizanalyst) August 31, 2023 2h ago 19.45 BST 10th over: England 94-2 (Kemp 3, Capsey 12) DilhariтАЩs very much in this game, darting the ball in and racing across the turf any time she needs to field off her bowling. But Capsey still finds a way to the boundary, cutting through point off the final ball of the over. 2h ago 19.42 BST 9th over: England 86-2 (Capsey 6, Kemp 1) Good fun was that Wyatt innings, but she wouldтАЩve been eyeing up a really big one. Instead, itтАЩs now Freya Kemp out there with Capsey. Sri Lanka are beginning to find their way in this game. 2h ago 19.40 BST WICKET! Wyatt b Ranaweera 48 (England 84-2) Ranaweera continues and strikes! ItтАЩs Wyatt who goes now. She backs away to the leg side to try and drive through off тАУ but makes no contact and the ball rattles the stumps. 2h ago 19.37 BST 8th over: England 82-1 (Wyatt 47, Capsey 4) Good over from Dilhari, whoтАЩs unlucky to concede a boundary from the final ball; Alice Capsey sees flight and goes for the drive outside off, with an outside edge running away for four. 2h ago 19.35 BST WICKET! Bouchier run out Dilhari 22 (England 77-1) The bowling changes keep on coming for Sri Lanka, with Kavisha Dilhari coming on to bowl her tweakers. She starts well, bowling with accuracyтАж and then a quality bit of work in the field! Dilhari fields off her own bowling, picking up at short mid-on before launching a throw at the non-strikerтАЩs stumps to run out Bouchier. Just the one stump to aim at and she nailed it. 3h ago 19.31 BST 7th over: England 75-0 (Bouchier 21, Wyatt 46) Inoka RanaweeraтАЩs left-arm spin enters the game and now itтАЩs BouchierтАЩs turn тАУ she gets on one knee and sweeps hard all the way for six. Meanwhile, bit random, but thereтАЩs a cardboard cutout of Roger Daltrey at Hove thatтАЩs got Butch chuckling. 3h ago 19.27 BST 6th over: England 66-0 (Bouchier 13, Wyatt 45) PrabodhaniтАЩs left-arm seam returns and WyattтАЩs fun continues тАУ she drives hard at a wider one and finds the gap behind point to move to 40. A direct hit at the stumps leads to overthrows to the boundary, making life even tougher for Sri Lanka. 3h ago 19.21 BST 5th over: England 55-0 (Bouchier 11, Wyatt 36) Athapaththu continues and tosses one up wide outside offтАж and the unstoppable Wyatt thwacks through the covers for another boundary, her sixth four of the innings. Danielle Wyatt smacks another boundary. Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock Updated at 19.30 BST 3h ago 19.19 BST 4th over: England 50-0 (Wyatt 32, Bouchier 11) Right-arm quick Kawya Kavindi steps into the attack andтАж begins with a wide. A full toss is then dispatched by Wyatt to midwicket for another four. A good comeback from Kavindi, though, as she swings and nips the ball away from WyattтАЩs attempted drive. A bouncer follows before Wyatt cuts over point to move into the thirties. A leg-side wide is up next before the next ball flies even wider down leg, past the keeper and to the boundary. Tough first over this for the 20-year-old, playing just her fifth T20I. Bouchier picks up two to get England to 50 in no time. 3h ago 19.12 BST 3rd over: England 32-0 (Wyatt 23, Bouchier 9) Athapaththu brings herself on to calm things down with some offies and does just that, conceding only four. 3h ago 19.10 BST 2nd over: England 28-0 (Bouchier 6, Wyatt 22) Left-arm spinner Sugandika Kumari takes over from the other end and drags one down тАУ Wyatt punishes it with a pull for a one-bounce four. Kumari then goes short again two balls later; this time, Wyatt sends it all the way for six, easy as you like. Better from Kumari as she fizzes one through, but Wyatt still manages to get out a late cut, the ball travelling for another boundary. Rapid start from Wyatt and England. 3h ago 19.04 BST 1st over: England 12-0 (Wyatt 6, Bouchier 6) Left-arm seamer Udeshika Prabodhani takes the new ball and gets a bit of early swing: Bouchier knocks through midwicket for a single to start. Wyatt gets a full toss and drives through the covers for four тАУ tidy. Three singles follow before Bouchier stretches out to loft the ball down the ground for her first boundary. 3h ago 18.59 BST Right then, Sri Lanka are out there, as are Danni Wyatt and Maia Bouchier. LetтАЩs play! 3h ago 18.41 BST Some other news from England: Lauren Bell is missing tonightтАЩs game and the second T20I because of illness. 3h ago 18.39 BST Sri LankaтАЩs XI: Harshitha Samarawickrama, Chamari Athapaththu (c), Nilakshi de Silva, Vishmi Gunaratne, Kavisha Dilhari, Anushka Sanjeewani (wk), Inoka Ranaweera, Sugandika Kumari, Udeshika Prabodhani, Hasini Perera, Kawya Kavindi 3h ago 18.35 BST EnglandтАЩs XI: We bat first in Hove!

Heather Knight says she wouldтАЩve done the same and confirms that Kate Cross is in for her first T20I since 2019. 4h ago 18.23 BST Mahika GaurтАЩs been presented with her cap by Kate Cross , a special moment for the 17-year-old quick. Looks like her family are out there too to take it in. Updated at 18.24 BST 4h ago 18.13 BST Game on! These covers will soon be off! ЁЯЩМ All set for a 1900 (UK) start here, playing 17 overs per side. #EnglandCricket | #ENGvSL pic.twitter.com/mkpZ52DNiB тАФ England Cricket (@englandcricket) August 31, 2023 Updated at 18.15 BST 4h ago 18.10 BST Right, maybe this is something to keep us busy for now: anyone fancy picking their England XI for the first game of the 2024 WomenтАЩs T20 World Cup? Send тАШem in. 4h ago 17.59 BST Some movement of the covers, with an inspection scheduled for 6pm. 4h ago 17.56 BST Naturally, thereтАЩs quite a bit of attention on Mahika Gaur . Worth noting that her England debut wonтАЩt be her international one тАУ she played for the UAE as a 12-year-old (!!!!!). Twelve. Twelve . DoesnтАЩt really relate to Gaur, but this video still comes to mind. 4h ago 17.47 BST Ugh, hopefully it clears up. Anyway, the pundits тАУ Butcher, Beaumont and Greenway тАУ have been singing the praises of Danni Wyatt, who was EnglandтАЩs leading run-scorer in the Ashes T20Is and then had an excellent Hundred too. She was class in the final: 4h ago 17.36 BST So Tammy BeaumontтАЩs on punditry duties for Sky. SheтАЩs certainly got a strong case to be in the playing XI today, having had a terrific summer for England in other forms before smashing a historic ton in The Hundred for Welsh Fire. By the way, the toss has been delayed. Looking rather gloomy at Hove with a bit of light rain in the air. 4h ago 17.33 BST ICYMI, this series also marks another beginning: EnglandтАЩs women will now be paid the same as the men when it comes to match fees. England Women to get match-fee parity with men after success of Ashes Read more 5h ago 17.30 BST Preamble Hello folks and welcome to the coverage of the opening T20I between England and Sri Lanka at Hove! ItтАЩs a new beginning for Heather KnightтАЩs side; an Ashes cycle has come to a close and thereтАЩs a bit of experimentation at play, with the next big thing on the horizon next yearтАЩs T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. Sophia DunkleyтАЩs been given a rest for both the T20Is and ODIs, as was Sophie Ecclestone before she dislocated her shoulder. Nat Sciver-Brunt has also been granted a break from these three T20Is, but sheтАЩll be back for the 50-over stuff. So who are the new kids on the block? Mahika Gaur, just 17, is a tall left-arm quick who has been picked on raw promise, while Bess Heath, the 22-year-old batter for Northern Diamonds, is capable of giving the ball a more than decent whack in the middle order. Both are uncapped; both are in for the two legs of Sri LankaтАЩs visit. With Dunkley away, Maia Bouchier will step up to partner Danni Wyatt at the top of the order in these T20Is, and sheтАЩs been hitting them well: 268 runs at 38.28 while striking at 135 helped Southern Brave to Hundred glory after their two previous runners-up finishes. ItтАЩs not been the most gorgeous day at Hove and the forecast isnтАЩt amazing, but letтАЩs just hope, eh. HereтАЩs to getting a game on, and a good one, too. IтАЩll be here to take you through to the close. Drop me an email/DM to chat about whatever you fancy! Gates are now open for spectators - the rain is now very light and the Grounds Team are ready to get to work once the rain stops. ЁЯПЯ Further updates will be made on our live blog.
