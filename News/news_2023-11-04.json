The second round of Pakistan Cup 2023-24 was played at four venues across three cities – Rawalpindi, AJK and Abbottabad – in the country. Karachi Whites banked on their decision to field first and dismissed FATA for 155 in 36.2 overs at Shoaib Akhtar Cricket Stadium. Mohammad Sarwar Afridi was the lone fighter for his side, producing a gritty half-century (53, 68b, 2x4s, 3x6s). Mohammad Farooq, who scored 23 from 43 including two fours and a six, was the second-highest run-getter in the innings. Veterans Anwar Ali and Sohail Khan grabbed three wickets each. Danish Aziz also got two wickets to his name and bowled three maidens in his eight-over spell. In return, Karachi Blues completed the target in 31.1 overs, while losing four wickets. Omair Bin Yousuf top-scored (41, 57b, 6x4s) for his team. His efforts were complemented by Asad Shafiq (37 not out, 67b, 4x4s). Irfanullah Shah took two wickets while Sameen Gul and captain Khushdil Shah had a wicket each to their name. In another second-round Pakistan Cup fixture, half-centuries by Zain Abbas, Sharoon Siraj and Haseebullah helped Multan to a six-wicket win against Lahore Whites. Multan won the toss and opted to field first against Lahore Whites at Abbottabad Cricket Stadium. Lahore Whites were bowled out for 266 in 44.1 overs. Tayyab Tahir (74, 86b, 6x4s, 4x6s) and Aamer Jamal (74, 53b, 7x4s, 4x6s) scored the bulk of the runs for their side. Captain Saad Naseem chipped in with 22 off 19 deliveries, including two boundaries and a maximum. Pacer Mohammad Imran registered a four-wicket haul while left-arm wrist-spinner Faisal Akram grabbed two wickets. It took Multan 39.2 overs to chase the target, getting to 270 at the expense of four wickets. Haseebullah (70, 96, 5x4s, 1×6), Zain Abbas (69, 67b, 6x4s, 1×6) and Sharoon Siraj (55 not out, 44b, 7x4s, 1×6) were crucial to Multan’s smooth sailing to the target. Kamran Afzal got two wickets while Mohammad Faiq and Ahmed Bashir grabbed a wicket each. Hunain Shah’s heroics with the ball allowed Lahore Blues to obtain a 94-run victory over Faisalabad in the second round of the Pakistan Cup. After being put in to bat first, Lahore Blues got to 241-6 in the stipulated 45 overs. Junaid Ali (47 not out, 48b, 4x4s, 1×6) and Umar Siddiq (46, 41b, 8x4s, 1×6) were the high scorers for the side. Umaid Asif (41 not out, 28b, 4x4s, 1×6) and Hussain Talat (39, 63b, 2x4s) also chipped in. Faisalabad captain Faheem Ashraf returned with three wickets while Mohammad Ali and Arham Nawab picked up a wicket apiece. In turn, Faisalabad were dismissed for 149 in 36.2 overs courtesy of a six-wicket haul by Hunain Shah. Faisalabad batters had no answers for the questions asked by the right-arm pacer falling 94 short of Lahore Blues’ total. Faheem was the only batter offering resistance, producing 40 from 57 including five boundaries. Mohammad Faizan (30, 38b, 4x4s) was the other contributor with the bat. The second round of the Pakistan Cup 2023 was graced with a thriller as Peshawar snatched a one-run victory from Rawalpindi. Peshawar scored 212-9 in the allotted 45 overs after Rawalpindi decided to bowl first at Mirpur Cricket Stadium. Nabi Gul hit 47 from 48 including five boundaries and a maximum, and was the top-scorer for the side. He was supported by Sajid Khan (38, 34b, 5x4s, 1×6) and Kamran Ghulam (36, 69b, 2x4s, 1×6). Spinner Mubasir Khan and pacer Jahandad Khan returned with three scalps each. Zeeshan Malik (83, 110b, 7x4s, 1×6) and Haider Ali (63, 65b, 11x4s) allowed Rawalpindi to get into a comfortable position while chasing 213. However, a counterattack by the Peshawar bowlers swung the game back in their favour. Kamran Ghulam took a four-fer, while pacer Abbas Afridi had three wickets to his name. Mohammad Imran took the last wicket to fall as Rawalpindi fell two runs short of the target as the side was dismissed for 211 in 41.3 overs.

In a media release, the Minister said that SLC and the national selectors should take responsibility for a disastrous World Cup campaign that was exacerbated by Thursday’s defeat. “Sri Lanka officials have no moral, ethical right to remain in office. They should..resign from their posts,” the Minister has said. He also said that the non-inclusion of senior cricketers like Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal had an effect on Sri Lanka’s World Cup campaign. “The victimization of Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal by not including them in the World Cup squad also had an effect on Sri Lanka’s debacle at the World Cup,” he claimed. “It is a joke that SLC is defending the selectors and its executive committee.” In a separate letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Sports Minister highlighted SLC’s association with brands that have links to Betting and Gambling companies. “The Sri Lanka Cricket Board's present leadership has made choices that have resulted in considerable damage to the organization. Various Sri Lankan players have faced allegations of involvement in match-fixing schemes, and there has been a public backlash against Sri Lanka Cricket's perceived promotion of a culture of betting and gambling,” he wrote. “The organization's decision to allow such entities to participate in the Lanka Premier League has been met with criticism as Betting and Gambling is a strictly restrained business while promoting related activities is illegal by several acts of Parliament,” the Minister’s letter to the President read. The letter came after SLC themselves wrote to the President complaining that several of its activities have been hindered by inaction from the Sports Minister. In their letter, SLC said that the Minister had not yet given necessary approvals required to conduct the Under 19 World Cup and a franchise-based T10 league, in Sri Lanka.","pubDate":"2023-11-03 18:20:51","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_d0dabb6a74.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"231999edd885fb14f0fbc6343498f79f","title":"Second Unofficial Test ends in a draw at Dambulla","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Second-Unofficial-Test-ends-in-a-draw-at-Dambulla/315-270562","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The second Unofficial Test between the Sri Lanka Emerging Team and the visiting Bangladesh Emerging Team ended in a draw at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium today.","content":"The second Unofficial Test between the Sri Lanka Emerging Team and the visiting Bangladesh Emerging Team ended in a draw at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium today.

KOLKATA: Eden Gardens, Kolkata, the country's oldest cricket stadium is steeped in history. Playing at the venue in itself is like etching one's name in the history books. For South Africa, which will take on India in their World Cup match here on Sunday, the facility, however, holds way too much significance. It all (re)started here for the Proteas. After facing a lengthy two-decade ban due to apartheid, South Africa were finally readmitted into international cricket in the early 90s. Late Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was then BCCI secretary, played a pivotal role in arranging a short tour comprising three ODIs with the first fixture scheduled in the City of Joy on November 10, 1991. South African team in Eden Gardens in 1991. (Photo | ICC Facebook page) On their arrival at the Dum Dum Airport in the city, which was then called Calcutta, the team led by 42-year-old Clive Rice was welcomed by a huge gathering that queued up to wave flags and shower flower petals throughout the 15-mile journey to the hotel. The tourists lost the series 1-2 but Rice, who passed away in 2015, perfectly summed up the tour, \"I know how Neil Armstrong felt when he stood on the moon.\" Since the historic tour, South Africa had played six matches — three Tests and as many ODIs including a 2011 World Cup match against Ireland — at the venue. Like the pre-ban era, they became a force to reckon with in the last 32 years. Amid many highs, they have also witnessed quite a few heartbreaks, especially in the ICC events including the World Cups. Given their show in the ongoing World Cup so far, South Africa comprising 15 members — eight of whom were not even born when Rice and his men boarded a worn-out 707 Boeing to India — once again are title contenders. They also enjoy a slight edge over India as far as the premier tournament is concerned winning three including the 2011 contest held in Nagpur and losing two. Temba Bavuma and Co would not only like to swell that margin further but also mark an end to their barren run in the tournament when they play the hosts here at the venue, where their predecessors started their nation's cricketing journey in the post-apartheid era. \"Yes, I think South Africa are playing well enough to reach the semifinals and to challenge to win the World Cup. They certainly can beat anyone on their day but I think India are still favourites,\" Jimmy Cook, who was part of the 1991 touring squad and entered the record books when he became the first South African batter to face a white ball in international cricket, told this daily. South African cricketer Jimmy Cook. (Special arrangement) Presently a coach with the Gary Kirsten Cricket Academy in Oman, the 70-year-old former right-hand batter, who scored 17 runs before being trapped by Javagal Srinath in the match, still remembers the first ball he faced. \"The noise grew louder as Kapil Dev ran in to bowl the first ball but my routine of staying calm and focussing on the ball did not change so I just followed my tried and trusted routine.\" The enormity of the occasion meant Cook must be eager to take the strike but he wanted approval from fellow opener Andrew Hudson, which he got as the latter was nervous. \"(Andrew) Hudson was very nervous going out to bat so I asked if he wanted to face the first ball but he was shaking so much that he declined!\" The pressure seemed to have got the better of Hudson as he was dismissed off the third ball he faced for a duck with Kapil claiming the wicket. As many as 10 South African players including skipper Rice made their ODI debut in the match except for wicketkeeper-batter Kepler Wessels, who had played for Australia in the past. Cook is still amazed by the hospitality the team received during that short tour. \"It was a very memorable tour with many highlights. The reception we received everywhere was incredible and the fans always gave us a great welcome. The firecrackers going off after wickets and boundaries at the matches was a new experience for all of us. Although we lost the series 2-1 it was a great return to International cricket and gave us the opportunity to play against some truly great Indian cricketers.\" Incidentally, Cook's son Ryan is the coach of the Netherlands competing at the World Cup. The Dutch had shocked South Africa earlier in the tournament. But the coaching responsibilities mean the senior Cook wouldn't be able to visit India again to watch either Proteas or the Dutch in action from the stands. \"I have not been back to India since that tour but will be watching both South Africa and the Netherlands play their matches in between my coaching duties,\" he signed off. Cook might not be around this time but South Africa certainly are. And it would be a poetic ending, if Bavuma, the first black African captain of the team, holds the trophy aloft in the country, the land of Mahatma Gandhi, where it all 'restarted' for them.","content":"KOLKATA: Eden Gardens, Kolkata, the country's oldest cricket stadium is steeped in history. Playing at the venue in itself is like etching one's name in the history books. For South Africa, which will take on India in their World Cup match here on Sunday, the facility, however, holds way too much significance. It all (re)started here for the Proteas. After facing a lengthy two-decade ban due to apartheid, South Africa were finally readmitted into international cricket in the early 90s. Late Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was then BCCI secretary, played a pivotal role in arranging a short tour comprising three ODIs with the first fixture scheduled in the City of Joy on November 10, 1991. On their arrival at the Dum Dum Airport in the city, which was then called Calcutta, the team led by 42-year-old Clive Rice was welcomed by a huge gathering that queued up to wave flags and shower flower petals throughout the 15-mile journey to the hotel. The tourists lost the series 1-2 but Rice, who passed away in 2015, perfectly summed up the tour, \"I know how Neil Armstrong felt when he stood on the moon.\" Since the historic tour, South Africa had played six matches — three Tests and as many ODIs including a 2011 World Cup match against Ireland — at the venue. Like the pre-ban era, they became a force to reckon with in the last 32 years. Amid many highs, they have also witnessed quite a few heartbreaks, especially in the ICC events including the World Cups. Given their show in the ongoing World Cup so far, South Africa comprising 15 members — eight of whom were not even born when Rice and his men boarded a worn-out 707 Boeing to India — once again are title contenders. They also enjoy a slight edge over India as far as the premier tournament is concerned winning three including the 2011 contest held in Nagpur and losing two. Temba Bavuma and Co would not only like to swell that margin further but also mark an end to their barren run in the tournament when they play the hosts here at the venue, where their predecessors started their nation's cricketing journey in the post-apartheid era. \"Yes, I think South Africa are playing well enough to reach the semifinals and to challenge to win the World Cup. They certainly can beat anyone on their day but I think India are still favourites,\" Jimmy Cook, who was part of the 1991 touring squad and entered the record books when he became the first South African batter to face a white ball in international cricket, told this daily. Presently a coach with the Gary Kirsten Cricket Academy in Oman, the 70-year-old former right-hand batter, who scored 17 runs before being trapped by Javagal Srinath in the match, still remembers the first ball he faced. \"The noise grew louder as Kapil Dev ran in to bowl the first ball but my routine of staying calm and focussing on the ball did not change so I just followed my tried and trusted routine.\" The enormity of the occasion meant Cook must be eager to take the strike but he wanted approval from fellow opener Andrew Hudson, which he got as the latter was nervous. \"(Andrew) Hudson was very nervous going out to bat so I asked if he wanted to face the first ball but he was shaking so much that he declined!\" The pressure seemed to have got the better of Hudson as he was dismissed off the third ball he faced for a duck with Kapil claiming the wicket.

The Netherlands won the toss and opted to bat but were undone by seeing four of their batsmen run-out. The Dutch recovered from seeing 39-year-old opener Wesley Barresi dismissed by spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman in the first over. Max O'Dowd and Colin Ackermann put on 70 for the second wicket when a series of run-outs put them on the back foot. O'Dowd was on 42 when he was beaten by a direct hit by Azmatullah Omarzai from fine leg. With the score on 92-2, Ackermann (29) failed to make his ground when Ikram Alikhil whipped off the bails from a smart throw by Rashid Khan. On the next delivery, skipper Scott Edwards swept, lost sight of the ball and as he wandered aimlessly out of his crease Alikhil ran him out without scoring. Mohammad Nabi and teenage wrist spinner Noor Ahmad then sent back Bas de Leede, Saqib Zulfiqar and Logan van Beek thanks to three pieces of smart work by wicketkeeper Alikhil. Sybrand Engelbrecht had made 58 with six fours when he became the fourth run-out of the innings, failing to beat Nabi's throw from midwicket. That left the Dutch on 152-8 before they went on to be bowled out after 46.3 overs. Nabi was the pick of the bowlers with the veteran off-spinner taking 3-28. Afghanistan have three wins so far, over defending champions England, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Victory against the Dutch would take them to eight points, the same as Australia and New Zealand, who currently occupy two of the semi-final qualifying places. India have already made sure of a last-four spot with South Africa almost certain to join them. The Dutch need to win on Friday to have any chance of keeping their campaign alive after two victories in six games.

Even on wickets that are presumed dead or batting friendly, he has been extracting movement like a tornado. It is only poetic that Mohammed Shami, basking in glory of his recent success, gets ready to play his first World Cup match in the city that nurtured him. He was only 16 when he shifted from Uttar Pradesh, where his career was going nowhere, to Kolkata maidans, sometimes earning as little as Rs 500 per match. Now, seen as a colossal figure in the Indian bowling armoury, suddenly India's fortunes seem to depend on his bowling ever more. Shami is spewing fire, literally, almost like what legendary New Zealand all-rounder Richard Hadlee once said about his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan while comparing their bowling philosophies, 'in see(ing) every ball as like a bullet. There are six balls in an over, and six bullets in a chamber. Each one is a chance to hit.' Overlooked for the first four matches as Rohit Sharma and Co. sought 'balance' with the bat and ball, the 33-year-old Shami returned for the crucial New Zealand match in Dharamsala and walked away with five wickets becoming the first Indian bowler to claim two five-fors in the World Cup. The figures of 10/0/54/5, which restricted the Kiwis to 273, also fetched the speedster the Player of the Match award. Brought on as the first change bowler by captain in the ninth over, Shami struck the first ball as Kiwi opener Will Young played it on to the stumps. It was a trademark Shami delivery with a very upright seam, close to off stump and extracting movement off the surface to nip back in. He then went on to claim four more wickets including two in a row to bundle out previous edition finalists, who once were threatening to breach the 300-run mark, with ease. The pacer from Uttar Pradesh, who played domestic cricket for Bengal, was in line for a hat-trick when he cleaned up English batters - Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow - in successive deliveries in the next match in Lucknow. Shami repeated the feat against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium as he claimed wickets of Charith Asalanka and Dushan Hemantha in two straight deliveries of his first over. He went on to claim another five-for, second of this edition, to once again bag the Player of the Match trophy. Former India player Gautam Gambhir heaped praise on the bowler after that successful outing against the defending champions. \"Ever since his (Shami) comeback in this lineup, it's a completely different bowling lineup now and this was probably the best spell that I have seen from a fast bowler, bowling while chasing. It was incredible. Fast bowling of the highest quality. The pace, the lengths, the seam position, everything,\" Gambhir said while speaking to official broadcaster Star Sports. Since his debut in the format more than 10 years ago, Shami is apparently enjoying his best phase in ODIs in 2023. In 15 matches he has played this year till India's World Cup contest against Sri Lanka, he has claimed 33 wickets including three five-fors with a strike rate of 19.2, his best since debut. Overall, he is second among the pacers with best strike rate and minimum 100 wickets in ODIs after Shaheen Shah Afridi from Pakistan while Aussie Mitchell Starc is third. Afridi is at the top with a strike rate of 25.2 followed by Shami (26) and Starc (26.4). But he is way ahead of the duo if their shows in the ODI World Cup are compared. Shami tops the list of fast bowlers with best strike rate and minimum 20 wickets in the showpiece event with the SR of 15.7. Shaheen is at a distant second with the SR of 20.2 followed by Starc's 21.8. Having 45 wickets in 14 matches in World Cup, Shami is already the country's leading wicket-taker in the quadrennial event. He now will hope to cement his legacy further when he plays his first World Cup match in Kolkata, the city where he started his career as a professional cricketer 17 years ago. Only 16 when he left Uttar Pradesh, Shami went through the grind on the Kolkata maidans receiving a meagre Rs 500 per match at times and sharing a small dingy room with four or five people. The hard work paid off as taking a note of his performances in the club cricket, he was eventually drafted into the Ranji squad of 15 in 2010 by then Bengal chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee. \"That day I was watching a first division league match between Town Club and Suburban Club. Shami was playing for Town Club and his team was fielding. He was bowling with the wind and extremely well,\" Banerjee told this daily recalling the time when he first saw the potential in the pacer. \"His seam position was perfect, the ball was moving either side and he got four wickets before lunch. At the break, I called Town Club captain Shafi Ahmed and told him let Shami bowl against the wind on resumption. Against the wind, he bowled with the same pace, more or less same movement and wonderful bounce. He got two more wickets. That evening, we had a selection meeting to pick a team for the Ranji Trophy. Straightaway I called Shami in the 15-member squad. Lot of people were surprised as they did not know who Shami was. I took the responsibility and told other selectors that he is one of the finest bowlers, let him play Ranji this season and rest, as they say, is history,\" Banerjee, who had also served as the national selector, added. So what makes his special and quick was the response from the Ranji-winning wicketkeeper-batter of Bengal, \"His smooth run up and seam position, which is the best in the World at the moment. After Glenn McGrath, I have never seen a seam position like this. And of course his right length. These are his plus points.\" Fittingly, Shami made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in 2013, which coincidentally was also the maiden match in the longest format for Rohit Sharma, India's incumbent captain. He had played five matches at the Eden Gardens including four Tests and an ODI, which was played against Sri Lanka earlier this year in January albeit he had a forgettable day on the field as he leaked 43 runs from his seven overs without any success. Banerjee and a lot more like him, who had seen Shami's rise out of nowhere, will be in the stands to cheer him up when the bowler takes the field on Sunday. Hopefully, they will get to watch the same pacer, who once impressed them with his smooth run-up, upright seam position and lot of wickets.

The second round of Pakistan Cup 2023-24 was played at four venues across three cities – Rawalpindi, AJK and Abbottabad – in the country. Karachi Whites banked on their decision to field first and dismissed FATA for 155 in 36.2 overs at Shoaib Akhtar Cricket Stadium. Mohammad Sarwar Afridi was the lone fighter for his side, producing a gritty half-century (53, 68b, 2x4s, 3x6s). Mohammad Farooq, who scored 23 from 43 including two fours and a six, was the second-highest run-getter in the innings. Veterans Anwar Ali and Sohail Khan grabbed three wickets each. Danish Aziz also got two wickets to his name and bowled three maidens in his eight-over spell. In return, Karachi Blues completed the target in 31.1 overs, while losing four wickets. Omair Bin Yousuf top-scored (41, 57b, 6x4s) for his team. His efforts were complemented by Asad Shafiq (37 not out, 67b, 4x4s). Irfanullah Shah took two wickets while Sameen Gul and captain Khushdil Shah had a wicket each to their name. In another second-round Pakistan Cup fixture, half-centuries by Zain Abbas, Sharoon Siraj and Haseebullah helped Multan to a six-wicket win against Lahore Whites. Multan won the toss and opted to field first against Lahore Whites at Abbottabad Cricket Stadium. Lahore Whites were bowled out for 266 in 44.1 overs. Tayyab Tahir (74, 86b, 6x4s, 4x6s) and Aamer Jamal (74, 53b, 7x4s, 4x6s) scored the bulk of the runs for their side. Captain Saad Naseem chipped in with 22 off 19 deliveries, including two boundaries and a maximum. Pacer Mohammad Imran registered a four-wicket haul while left-arm wrist-spinner Faisal Akram grabbed two wickets. It took Multan 39.2 overs to chase the target, getting to 270 at the expense of four wickets. Haseebullah (70, 96, 5x4s, 1×6), Zain Abbas (69, 67b, 6x4s, 1×6) and Sharoon Siraj (55 not out, 44b, 7x4s, 1×6) were crucial to Multan’s smooth sailing to the target. Kamran Afzal got two wickets while Mohammad Faiq and Ahmed Bashir grabbed a wicket each. Hunain Shah’s heroics with the ball allowed Lahore Blues to obtain a 94-run victory over Faisalabad in the second round of the Pakistan Cup. After being put in to bat first, Lahore Blues got to 241-6 in the stipulated 45 overs. Junaid Ali (47 not out, 48b, 4x4s, 1×6) and Umar Siddiq (46, 41b, 8x4s, 1×6) were the high scorers for the side. Umaid Asif (41 not out, 28b, 4x4s, 1×6) and Hussain Talat (39, 63b, 2x4s) also chipped in. Faisalabad captain Faheem Ashraf returned with three wickets while Mohammad Ali and Arham Nawab picked up a wicket apiece. In turn, Faisalabad were dismissed for 149 in 36.2 overs courtesy of a six-wicket haul by Hunain Shah. Faisalabad batters had no answers for the questions asked by the right-arm pacer falling 94 short of Lahore Blues’ total. Faheem was the only batter offering resistance, producing 40 from 57 including five boundaries. Mohammad Faizan (30, 38b, 4x4s) was the other contributor with the bat. The second round of the Pakistan Cup 2023 was graced with a thriller as Peshawar snatched a one-run victory from Rawalpindi. Peshawar scored 212-9 in the allotted 45 overs after Rawalpindi decided to bowl first at Mirpur Cricket Stadium. Nabi Gul hit 47 from 48 including five boundaries and a maximum, and was the top-scorer for the side. He was supported by Sajid Khan (38, 34b, 5x4s, 1×6) and Kamran Ghulam (36, 69b, 2x4s, 1×6). Spinner Mubasir Khan and pacer Jahandad Khan returned with three scalps each. Zeeshan Malik (83, 110b, 7x4s, 1×6) and Haider Ali (63, 65b, 11x4s) allowed Rawalpindi to get into a comfortable position while chasing 213. However, a counterattack by the Peshawar bowlers swung the game back in their favour. Kamran Ghulam took a four-fer, while pacer Abbas Afridi had three wickets to his name. Mohammad Imran took the last wicket to fall as Rawalpindi fell two runs short of the target as the side was dismissed for 211 in 41.3 overs.

In a media release, the Minister said that SLC and the national selectors should take responsibility for a disastrous World Cup campaign that was exacerbated by Thursday’s defeat. “Sri Lanka officials have no moral, ethical right to remain in office. They should..resign from their posts,” the Minister has said. He also said that the non-inclusion of senior cricketers like Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal had an effect on Sri Lanka’s World Cup campaign. “The victimization of Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal by not including them in the World Cup squad also had an effect on Sri Lanka’s debacle at the World Cup,” he claimed. “It is a joke that SLC is defending the selectors and its executive committee.” In a separate letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Sports Minister highlighted SLC’s association with brands that have links to Betting and Gambling companies. “The Sri Lanka Cricket Board's present leadership has made choices that have resulted in considerable damage to the organization. Various Sri Lankan players have faced allegations of involvement in match-fixing schemes, and there has been a public backlash against Sri Lanka Cricket's perceived promotion of a culture of betting and gambling,” he wrote. “The organization's decision to allow such entities to participate in the Lanka Premier League has been met with criticism as Betting and Gambling is a strictly restrained business while promoting related activities is illegal by several acts of Parliament,” the Minister’s letter to the President read. The letter came after SLC themselves wrote to the President complaining that several of its activities have been hindered by inaction from the Sports Minister. In their letter, SLC said that the Minister had not yet given necessary approvals required to conduct the Under 19 World Cup and a franchise-based T10 league, in Sri Lanka.","pubDate":"2023-11-03 18:20:51","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_d0dabb6a74.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"231999edd885fb14f0fbc6343498f79f","title":"Second Unofficial Test ends in a draw at Dambulla","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Second-Unofficial-Test-ends-in-a-draw-at-Dambulla/315-270562","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The second Unofficial Test between the Sri Lanka Emerging Team and the visiting Bangladesh Emerging Team ended in a draw at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium today.","content":"The second Unofficial Test between the Sri Lanka Emerging Team and the visiting Bangladesh Emerging Team ended in a draw at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium today.

The Netherlands won the toss and opted to bat but were undone by seeing four of their batsmen run-out. The Dutch recovered from seeing 39-year-old opener Wesley Barresi dismissed by spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman in the first over. Max O'Dowd and Colin Ackermann put on 70 for the second wicket when a series of run-outs put them on the back foot. O'Dowd was on 42 when he was beaten by a direct hit by Azmatullah Omarzai from fine leg. With the score on 92-2, Ackermann (29) failed to make his ground when Ikram Alikhil whipped off the bails from a smart throw by Rashid Khan. On the next delivery, skipper Scott Edwards swept, lost sight of the ball and as he wandered aimlessly out of his crease Alikhil ran him out without scoring. Mohammad Nabi and teenage wrist spinner Noor Ahmad then sent back Bas de Leede, Saqib Zulfiqar and Logan van Beek thanks to three pieces of smart work by wicketkeeper Alikhil. Sybrand Engelbrecht had made 58 with six fours when he became the fourth run-out of the innings, failing to beat Nabi's throw from midwicket. That left the Dutch on 152-8 before they went on to be bowled out after 46.3 overs. Nabi was the pick of the bowlers with the veteran off-spinner taking 3-28. Afghanistan have three wins so far, over defending champions England, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Victory against the Dutch would take them to eight points, the same as Australia and New Zealand, who currently occupy two of the semi-final qualifying places. India have already made sure of a last-four spot with South Africa almost certain to join them.

Even on wickets that are presumed dead or batting friendly, he has been extracting movement like a tornado. It is only poetic that Mohammed Shami, basking in glory of his recent success, gets ready to play his first World Cup match in the city that nurtured him. He was only 16 when he shifted from Uttar Pradesh, where his career was going nowhere, to Kolkata maidans, sometimes earning as little as Rs 500 per match. Now, seen as a colossal figure in the Indian bowling armoury, suddenly India's fortunes seem to depend on his bowling ever more. Shami is spewing fire, literally, almost like what legendary New Zealand all-rounder Richard Hadlee once said about his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan while comparing their bowling philosophies, 'in see(ing) every ball as like a bullet. There are six balls in an over, and six bullets in a chamber. Each one is a chance to hit.' Overlooked for the first four matches as Rohit Sharma and Co. sought 'balance' with the bat and ball, the 33-year-old Shami returned for the crucial New Zealand match in Dharamsala and walked away with five wickets becoming the first Indian bowler to claim two five-fors in the World Cup. The figures of 10/0/54/5, which restricted the Kiwis to 273, also fetched the speedster the Player of the Match award. Brought on as the first change bowler by captain in the ninth over, Shami struck the first ball as Kiwi opener Will Young played it on to the stumps. It was a trademark Shami delivery with a very upright seam, close to off stump and extracting movement off the surface to nip back in. He then went on to claim four more wickets including two in a row to bundle out previous edition finalists, who once were threatening to breach the 300-run mark, with ease. The pacer from Uttar Pradesh, who played domestic cricket for Bengal, was in line for a hat-trick when he cleaned up English batters - Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow - in successive deliveries in the next match in Lucknow. Shami repeated the feat against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium as he claimed wickets of Charith Asalanka and Dushan Hemantha in two straight deliveries of his first over. He went on to claim another five-for, second of this edition, to once again bag the Player of the Match trophy. Former India player Gautam Gambhir heaped praise on the bowler after that successful outing against the defending champions. \"Ever since his (Shami) comeback in this lineup, it's a completely different bowling lineup now and this was probably the best spell that I have seen from a fast bowler, bowling while chasing. It was incredible. Fast bowling of the highest quality. The pace, the lengths, the seam position, everything,\" Gambhir said while speaking to official broadcaster Star Sports. Since his debut in the format more than 10 years ago, Shami is apparently enjoying his best phase in ODIs in 2023. In 15 matches he has played this year till India's World Cup contest against Sri Lanka, he has claimed 33 wickets including three five-fors with a strike rate of 19.2, his best since debut. Overall, he is second among the pacers with best strike rate and minimum 100 wickets in ODIs after Shaheen Shah Afridi from Pakistan while Aussie Mitchell Starc is third. Afridi is at the top with a strike rate of 25.2 followed by Shami (26) and Starc (26.4). But he is way ahead of the duo if their shows in the ODI World Cup are compared. Shami tops the list of fast bowlers with best strike rate and minimum 20 wickets in the showpiece event with the SR of 15.7. Shaheen is at a distant second with the SR of 20.2 followed by Starc's 21.8. Having 45 wickets in 14 matches in World Cup, Shami is already the country's leading wicket-taker in the quadrennial event. He now will hope to cement his legacy further when he plays his first World Cup match in Kolkata, the city where he started his career as a professional cricketer 17 years ago. Only 16 when he left Uttar Pradesh, Shami went through the grind on the Kolkata maidans receiving a meagre Rs 500 per match at times and sharing a small dingy room with four or five people. The hard work paid off as taking a note of his performances in the club cricket, he was eventually drafted into the Ranji squad of 15 in 2010 by then Bengal chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee. \"That day I was watching a first division league match between Town Club and Suburban Club. Shami was playing for Town Club and his team was fielding. He was bowling with the wind and extremely well,\" Banerjee told this daily recalling the time when he first saw the potential in the pacer. \"His seam position was perfect, the ball was moving either side and he got four wickets before lunch. At the break, I called Town Club captain Shafi Ahmed and told him let Shami bowl against the wind on resumption. Against the wind, he bowled with the same pace, more or less same movement and wonderful bounce. He got two more wickets. That evening, we had a selection meeting to pick a team for the Ranji Trophy. Straightaway I called Shami in the 15-member squad. Lot of people were surprised as they did not know who Shami was. I took the responsibility and told other selectors that he is one of the finest bowlers, let him play Ranji this season and rest, as they say, is history,\" Banerjee, who had also served as the national selector, added. So what makes his special and quick was the response from the Ranji-winning wicketkeeper-batter of Bengal, \"His smooth run up and seam position, which is the best in the World at the moment. After Glenn McGrath, I have never seen a seam position like this. And of course his right length. These are his plus points.\" Fittingly, Shami made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in 2013, which coincidentally was also the maiden match in the longest format for Rohit Sharma, India's incumbent captain. He had played five matches at the Eden Gardens including four Tests and an ODI, which was played against Sri Lanka earlier this year in January albeit he had a forgettable day on the field as he leaked 43 runs from his seven overs without any success. Banerjee and a lot more like him, who had seen Shami's rise out of nowhere, will be in the stands to cheer him up when the bowler takes the field on Sunday. Hopefully, they will get to watch the same pacer, who once impressed them with his smooth run-up, upright seam position and lot of wickets.

The second round of Pakistan Cup 2023-24 was played at four venues across three cities – Rawalpindi, AJK and Abbottabad – in the country. Karachi Whites banked on their decision to field first and dismissed FATA for 155 in 36.2 overs at Shoaib Akhtar Cricket Stadium. Mohammad Sarwar Afridi was the lone fighter for his side, producing a gritty half-century (53, 68b, 2x4s, 3x6s). Mohammad Farooq, who scored 23 from 43 including two fours and a six, was the second-highest run-getter in the innings. Veterans Anwar Ali and Sohail Khan grabbed three wickets each. Danish Aziz also got two wickets to his name and bowled three maidens in his eight-over spell. In return, Karachi Blues completed the target in 31.1 overs, while losing four wickets. Omair Bin Yousuf top-scored (41, 57b, 6x4s) for his team. His efforts were complemented by Asad Shafiq (37 not out, 67b, 4x4s). Irfanullah Shah took two wickets while Sameen Gul and captain Khushdil Shah had a wicket each to their name. In another second-round Pakistan Cup fixture, half-centuries by Zain Abbas, Sharoon Siraj and Haseebullah helped Multan to a six-wicket win against Lahore Whites. Multan won the toss and opted to field first against Lahore Whites at Abbottabad Cricket Stadium. Lahore Whites were bowled out for 266 in 44.1 overs. Tayyab Tahir (74, 86b, 6x4s, 4x6s) and Aamer Jamal (74, 53b, 7x4s, 4x6s) scored the bulk of the runs for their side. Captain Saad Naseem chipped in with 22 off 19 deliveries, including two boundaries and a maximum. Pacer Mohammad Imran registered a four-wicket haul while left-arm wrist-spinner Faisal Akram grabbed two wickets. It took Multan 39.2 overs to chase the target, getting to 270 at the expense of four wickets. Haseebullah (70, 96, 5x4s, 1×6), Zain Abbas (69, 67b, 6x4s, 1×6) and Sharoon Siraj (55 not out, 44b, 7x4s, 1×6) were crucial to Multan’s smooth sailing to the target. Kamran Afzal got two wickets while Mohammad Faiq and Ahmed Bashir grabbed a wicket each. Hunain Shah’s heroics with the ball allowed Lahore Blues to obtain a 94-run victory over Faisalabad in the second round of the Pakistan Cup. After being put in to bat first, Lahore Blues got to 241-6 in the stipulated 45 overs. Junaid Ali (47 not out, 48b, 4x4s, 1×6) and Umar Siddiq (46, 41b, 8x4s, 1×6) were the high scorers for the side. Umaid Asif (41 not out, 28b, 4x4s, 1×6) and Hussain Talat (39, 63b, 2x4s) also chipped in. Faisalabad captain Faheem Ashraf returned with three wickets while Mohammad Ali and Arham Nawab picked up a wicket apiece. In turn, Faisalabad were dismissed for 149 in 36.2 overs courtesy of a six-wicket haul by Hunain Shah. Faisalabad batters had no answers for the questions asked by the right-arm pacer falling 94 short of Lahore Blues’ total. Faheem was the only batter offering resistance, producing 40 from 57 including five boundaries. Mohammad Faizan (30, 38b, 4x4s) was the other contributor with the bat. The second round of the Pakistan Cup 2023 was graced with a thriller as Peshawar snatched a one-run victory from Rawalpindi. Peshawar scored 212-9 in the allotted 45 overs after Rawalpindi decided to bowl first at Mirpur Cricket Stadium. Nabi Gul hit 47 from 48 including five boundaries and a maximum, and was the top-scorer for the side. He was supported by Sajid Khan (38, 34b, 5x4s, 1×6) and Kamran Ghulam (36, 69b, 2x4s, 1×6). Spinner Mubasir Khan and pacer Jahandad Khan returned with three scalps each. Zeeshan Malik (83, 110b, 7x4s, 1×6) and Haider Ali (63, 65b, 11x4s) allowed Rawalpindi to get into a comfortable position while chasing 213. However, a counterattack by the Peshawar bowlers swung the game back in their favour. Kamran Ghulam took a four-fer, while pacer Abbas Afridi had three wickets to his name. Mohammad Imran took the last wicket to fall as Rawalpindi fell two runs short of the target as the side was dismissed for 211 in 41.3 overs.

In a media release, the Minister said that SLC and the national selectors should take responsibility for a disastrous World Cup campaign that was exacerbated by Thursday’s defeat. “Sri Lanka officials have no moral, ethical right to remain in office. They should..resign from their posts,” the Minister has said. He also said that the non-inclusion of senior cricketers like Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal had an effect on Sri Lanka’s World Cup campaign. “The victimization of Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal by not including them in the World Cup squad also had an effect on Sri Lanka’s debacle at the World Cup,” he claimed. “It is a joke that SLC is defending the selectors and its executive committee.” In a separate letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Sports Minister highlighted SLC’s association with brands that have links to Betting and Gambling companies. “The Sri Lanka Cricket Board's present leadership has made choices that have resulted in considerable damage to the organization. Various Sri Lankan players have faced allegations of involvement in match-fixing schemes, and there has been a public backlash against Sri Lanka Cricket's perceived promotion of a culture of betting and gambling,” he wrote. “The organization's decision to allow such entities to participate in the Lanka Premier League has been met with criticism as Betting and Gambling is a strictly restrained business while promoting related activities is illegal by several acts of Parliament,” the Minister’s letter to the President read. The letter came after SLC themselves wrote to the President complaining that several of its activities have been hindered by inaction from the Sports Minister. In their letter, SLC said that the Minister had not yet given necessary approvals required to conduct the Under 19 World Cup and a franchise-based T10 league, in Sri Lanka.","pubDate":"2023-11-03 18:20:51","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_d0dabb6a74.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"231999edd885fb14f0fbc6343498f79f","title":"Second Unofficial Test ends in a draw at Dambulla","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Second-Unofficial-Test-ends-in-a-draw-at-Dambulla/315-270562","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The second Unofficial Test between the Sri Lanka Emerging Team and the visiting Bangladesh Emerging Team ended in a draw at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium today.","content":"The second Unofficial Test between the Sri Lanka Emerging Team and the visiting Bangladesh Emerging Team ended in a draw at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium today.

(Photo | ICC Facebook page) On their arrival at the Dum Dum Airport in the city, which was then called Calcutta, the team led by 42-year-old Clive Rice was welcomed by a huge gathering that queued up to wave flags and shower flower petals throughout the 15-mile journey to the hotel. The tourists lost the series 1-2 but Rice, who passed away in 2015, perfectly summed up the tour, \"I know how Neil Armstrong felt when he stood on the moon.\" Since the historic tour, South Africa had played six matches — three Tests and as many ODIs including a 2011 World Cup match against Ireland — at the venue. Like the pre-ban era, they became a force to reckon with in the last 32 years. Amid many highs, they have also witnessed quite a few heartbreaks, especially in the ICC events including the World Cups. Given their show in the ongoing World Cup so far, South Africa comprising 15 members — eight of whom were not even born when Rice and his men boarded a worn-out 707 Boeing to India — once again are title contenders. They also enjoy a slight edge over India as far as the premier tournament is concerned winning three including the 2011 contest held in Nagpur and losing two. Temba Bavuma and Co would not only like to swell that margin further but also mark an end to their barren run in the tournament when they play the hosts here at the venue, where their predecessors started their nation's cricketing journey in the post-apartheid era. \"Yes, I think South Africa are playing well enough to reach the semifinals and to challenge to win the World Cup. They certainly can beat anyone on their day but I think India are still favourites,\" Jimmy Cook, who was part of the 1991 touring squad and entered the record books when he became the first South African batter to face a white ball in international cricket, told this daily. South African cricketer Jimmy Cook. (Special arrangement) Presently a coach with the Gary Kirsten Cricket Academy in Oman, the 70-year-old former right-hand batter, who scored 17 runs before being trapped by Javagal Srinath in the match, still remembers the first ball he faced. \"The noise grew louder as Kapil Dev ran in to bowl the first ball but my routine of staying calm and focussing on the ball did not change so I just followed my tried and trusted routine.\" The enormity of the occasion meant Cook must be eager to take the strike but he wanted approval from fellow opener Andrew Hudson, which he got as the latter was nervous. \"(Andrew) Hudson was very nervous going out to bat so I asked if he wanted to face the first ball but he was shaking so much that he declined!\" The pressure seemed to have got the better of Hudson as he was dismissed off the third ball he faced for a duck with Kapil claiming the wicket. As many as 10 South African players including skipper Rice made their ODI debut in the match except for wicketkeeper-batter Kepler Wessels, who had played for Australia in the past. Cook is still amazed by the hospitality the team received during that short tour. \"It was a very memorable tour with many highlights. The reception we received everywhere was incredible and the fans always gave us a great welcome. The firecrackers going off after wickets and boundaries at the matches was a new experience for all of us. Although we lost the series 2-1 it was a great return to International cricket and gave us the opportunity to play against some truly great Indian cricketers.\" Incidentally, Cook's son Ryan is the coach of the Netherlands competing at the World Cup. The Dutch had shocked South Africa earlier in the tournament. But the coaching responsibilities mean the senior Cook wouldn't be able to visit India again to watch either Proteas or the Dutch in action from the stands. \"I have not been back to India since that tour but will be watching both South Africa and the Netherlands play their matches in between my coaching duties,\" he signed off.

The Netherlands won the toss and opted to bat but were undone by seeing four of their batsmen run-out. The Dutch recovered from seeing 39-year-old opener Wesley Barresi dismissed by spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman in the first over. Max O'Dowd and Colin Ackermann put on 70 for the second wicket when a series of run-outs put them on the back foot. O'Dowd was on 42 when he was beaten by a direct hit by Azmatullah Omarzai from fine leg. With the score on 92-2, Ackermann (29) failed to make his ground when Ikram Alikhil whipped off the bails from a smart throw by Rashid Khan. On the next delivery, skipper Scott Edwards swept, lost sight of the ball and as he wandered aimlessly out of his crease Alikhil ran him out without scoring. Mohammad Nabi and teenage wrist spinner Noor Ahmad then sent back Bas de Leede, Saqib Zulfiqar and Logan van Beek thanks to three pieces of smart work by wicketkeeper Alikhil. Sybrand Engelbrecht had made 58 with six fours when he became the fourth run-out of the innings, failing to beat Nabi's throw from midwicket. That left the Dutch on 152-8 before they went on to be bowled out after 46.3 overs. Nabi was the pick of the bowlers with the veteran off-spinner taking 3-28. Afghanistan have three wins so far, over defending champions England, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Victory against the Dutch would take them to eight points, the same as Australia and New Zealand, who currently occupy two of the semi-final qualifying places. India have already made sure of a last-four spot with South Africa almost certain to join them. The Dutch need to win on Friday to have any chance of keeping their campaign alive after two victories in six games.

Even on wickets that are presumed dead or batting friendly, he has been extracting movement like a tornado. It is only poetic that Mohammed Shami, basking in glory of his recent success, gets ready to play his first World Cup match in the city that nurtured him. He was only 16 when he shifted from Uttar Pradesh, where his career was going nowhere, to Kolkata maidans, sometimes earning as little as Rs 500 per match. Now, seen as a colossal figure in the Indian bowling armoury, suddenly India's fortunes seem to depend on his bowling ever more. Shami is spewing fire, literally, almost like what legendary New Zealand all-rounder Richard Hadlee once said about his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan while comparing their bowling philosophies, 'in see(ing) every ball as like a bullet. There are six balls in an over, and six bullets in a chamber. Each one is a chance to hit.' Overlooked for the first four matches as Rohit Sharma and Co. sought 'balance' with the bat and ball, the 33-year-old Shami returned for the crucial New Zealand match in Dharamsala and walked away with five wickets becoming the first Indian bowler to claim two five-fors in the World Cup. The figures of 10/0/54/5, which restricted the Kiwis to 273, also fetched the speedster the Player of the Match award. Brought on as the first change bowler by captain in the ninth over, Shami struck the first ball as Kiwi opener Will Young played it on to the stumps. It was a trademark Shami delivery with a very upright seam, close to off stump and extracting movement off the surface to nip back in. He then went on to claim four more wickets including two in a row to bundle out previous edition finalists, who once were threatening to breach the 300-run mark, with ease. The pacer from Uttar Pradesh, who played domestic cricket for Bengal, was in line for a hat-trick when he cleaned up English batters - Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow - in successive deliveries in the next match in Lucknow. Shami repeated the feat against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium as he claimed wickets of Charith Asalanka and Dushan Hemantha in two straight deliveries of his first over. He went on to claim another five-for, second of this edition, to once again bag the Player of the Match trophy. Former India player Gautam Gambhir heaped praise on the bowler after that successful outing against the defending champions. \"Ever since his (Shami) comeback in this lineup, it's a completely different bowling lineup now and this was probably the best spell that I have seen from a fast bowler, bowling while chasing. It was incredible. Fast bowling of the highest quality. The pace, the lengths, the seam position, everything,\" Gambhir said while speaking to official broadcaster Star Sports. Since his debut in the format more than 10 years ago, Shami is apparently enjoying his best phase in ODIs in 2023. In 15 matches he has played this year till India's World Cup contest against Sri Lanka, he has claimed 33 wickets including three five-fors with a strike rate of 19.2, his best since debut. Overall, he is second among the pacers with best strike rate and minimum 100 wickets in ODIs after Shaheen Shah Afridi from Pakistan while Aussie Mitchell Starc is third. Afridi is at the top with a strike rate of 25.2 followed by Shami (26) and Starc (26.4). But he is way ahead of the duo if their shows in the ODI World Cup are compared. Shami tops the list of fast bowlers with best strike rate and minimum 20 wickets in the showpiece event with the SR of 15.7. Shaheen is at a distant second with the SR of 20.2 followed by Starc's 21.8. Having 45 wickets in 14 matches in World Cup, Shami is already the country's leading wicket-taker in the quadrennial event. He now will hope to cement his legacy further when he plays his first World Cup match in Kolkata, the city where he started his career as a professional cricketer 17 years ago. Only 16 when he left Uttar Pradesh, Shami went through the grind on the Kolkata maidans receiving a meagre Rs 500 per match at times and sharing a small dingy room with four or five people. The hard work paid off as taking a note of his performances in the club cricket, he was eventually drafted into the Ranji squad of 15 in 2010 by then Bengal chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee. \"That day I was watching a first division league match between Town Club and Suburban Club. Shami was playing for Town Club and his team was fielding. He was bowling with the wind and extremely well,\" Banerjee told this daily recalling the time when he first saw the potential in the pacer. \"His seam position was perfect, the ball was moving either side and he got four wickets before lunch. At the break, I called Town Club captain Shafi Ahmed and told him let Shami bowl against the wind on resumption. Against the wind, he bowled with the same pace, more or less same movement and wonderful bounce. He got two more wickets. That evening, we had a selection meeting to pick a team for the Ranji Trophy. Straightaway I called Shami in the 15-member squad. Lot of people were surprised as they did not know who Shami was. I took the responsibility and told other selectors that he is one of the finest bowlers, let him play Ranji this season and rest, as they say, is history,\" Banerjee, who had also served as the national selector, added. So what makes his special and quick was the response from the Ranji-winning wicketkeeper-batter of Bengal, \"His smooth run up and seam position, which is the best in the World at the moment. After Glenn McGrath, I have never seen a seam position like this. And of course his right length. These are his plus points.\" Fittingly, Shami made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in 2013, which coincidentally was also the maiden match in the longest format for Rohit Sharma, India's incumbent captain. He had played five matches at the Eden Gardens including four Tests and an ODI, which was played against Sri Lanka earlier this year in January albeit he had a forgettable day on the field as he leaked 43 runs from his seven overs without any success. Banerjee and a lot more like him, who had seen Shami's rise out of nowhere, will be in the stands to cheer him up when the bowler takes the field on Sunday. Hopefully, they will get to watch the same pacer, who once impressed them with his smooth run-up, upright seam position and lot of wickets.

Former India player Gautam Gambhir heaped praise on the bowler after that successful outing against the defending champions. \"Ever since his (Shami) comeback in this lineup, it's a completely different bowling lineup now and this was probably the best spell that I have seen from a fast bowler, bowling while chasing. It was incredible. Fast bowling of the highest quality. The pace, the lengths, the seam position, everything,\" Gambhir said while speaking to official broadcaster Star Sports. Since his debut in the format more than 10 years ago, Shami is apparently enjoying his best phase in ODIs in 2023. In 15 matches he has played this year till India's World Cup contest against Sri Lanka, he has claimed 33 wickets including three five-fors with a strike rate of 19.2, his best since debut. Overall, he is second among the pacers with best strike rate and minimum 100 wickets in ODIs after Shaheen Shah Afridi from Pakistan while Aussie Mitchell Starc is third. Afridi is at the top with a strike rate of 25.2 followed by Shami (26) and Starc (26.4). But he is way ahead of the duo if their shows in the ODI World Cup are compared. Shami tops the list of fast bowlers with best strike rate and minimum 20 wickets in the showpiece event with the SR of 15.7. Shaheen is at a distant second with the SR of 20.2 followed by Starc's 21.8. Having 45 wickets in 14 matches in World Cup, Shami is already the country's leading wicket-taker in the quadrennial event. He now will hope to cement his legacy further when he plays his first World Cup match in Kolkata, the city where he started his career as a professional cricketer 17 years ago. Only 16 when he left Uttar Pradesh, Shami went through the grind on the Kolkata maidans receiving a meagre Rs 500 per match at times and sharing a small dingy room with four or five people. The hard work paid off as taking a note of his performances in the club cricket, he was eventually drafted into the Ranji squad of 15 in 2010 by then Bengal chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee. \"That day I was watching a first division league match between Town Club and Suburban Club. Shami was playing for Town Club and his team was fielding. He was bowling with the wind and extremely well,\" Banerjee told this daily recalling the time when he first saw the potential in the pacer. \"His seam position was perfect, the ball was moving either side and he got four wickets before lunch. At the break, I called Town Club captain Shafi Ahmed and told him let Shami bowl against the wind on resumption. Against the wind, he bowled with the same pace, more or less same movement and wonderful bounce. He got two more wickets. That evening, we had a selection meeting to pick a team for the Ranji Trophy. Straightaway I called Shami in the 15-member squad. Lot of people were surprised as they did not know who Shami was. I took the responsibility and told other selectors that he is one of the finest bowlers, let him play Ranji this season and rest, as they say, is history,\" Banerjee, who had also served as the national selector, added. So what makes his special and quick was the response from the Ranji-winning wicketkeeper-batter of Bengal, \"His smooth run up and seam position, which is the best in the World at the moment. After Glenn McGrath, I have never seen a seam position like this. And of course his right length. These are his plus points.\" Fittingly, Shami made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in 2013, which coincidentally was also the maiden match in the longest format for Rohit Sharma, India's incumbent captain. He had played five matches at the Eden Gardens including four Tests and an ODI, which was played against Sri Lanka earlier this year in January albeit he had a forgettable day on the field as he leaked 43 runs from his seven overs without any success. Banerjee and a lot more like him, who had seen Shami's rise out of nowhere, will be in the stands to cheer him up when the bowler takes the field on Sunday. Hopefully, they will get to watch the same pacer, who once impressed them with his smooth run-up, upright seam position and lot of wickets.","pubDate":"2023-11-03 17:25:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"newindianexpress","source_priority":15406,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
