The sport, which evolved from the aristocratic game of billiards, is a popular pastime in Zimbabwe. In many places, pool has overtaken the once-famous “slug” or table football. However, its association with bars and other such places makes some people uncomfortable. Also, the assumption that it is played by lowlifes seems to be militating against the potential commercial impact of the sport. However, at its core, it remains a viable business proposition that should interest marketers. Hear me out. Pool players already have an association, which is ample evidence of organisation and coordination at national level. The players make contributions to get their games going. Although some may be sponsored by club owners, the majority are self-funding. Therefore, they already have a funding model that could be leveraged on. Organisations such as microfinance institutions could explore the possibility of partnering with pool clubs to deliver exciting packages. Some pool clubs own minibuses or small cars for their travel. A significant percentage of players, both male and female, are breadwinners in their families. While they are out playing pool for recreation, there is no reason for them not to look for opportunities that make sense to invest in for their families. Family-friendly products, therefore, can find favour with pool clubs. Imagine a club sponsored by an edible oils company. At some point, all these pool club members will be required to buy cooking oil, margarine, soap and other grocery items for their families, and therein lies the opportunity. Jim Side, a snooker writer, says: “Billiards and pool are two terms that are often used interchangeably. For the non-professional players, it’s easy to see why these two table sports seem the same thing. But while they do have similarities, there are also distinct qualities that set them apart. And then, we have a snooker, which adds to the confusion. “These three — billiards, pool and snooker — all use cue sticks, tables and balls. But what are the differences between these popular table sports?” Billiards can be traced back to a 15th century lawn game similar to croquet. The game was mostly known in Northern Europe. It was only played by royalty and nobles. However, it evolved over time. From an outdoor sport, it moved indoors, where it required a wooden table. There was a simple border and a green cloth put on the table. The colour was specially chosen to resemble grass. Years later, the table game was given a name derived from the French terms “bille”, which means ball, and “billiart”, meaning wooden sticks. The billiard table also underwent modification since players had to keep picking balls on the ground. Cue sticks, on the other hand, emerged in the late 1600s. It is believed the history of pool is the same as that of billiards since it stemmed from the same. The name “pool” reportedly came from the betting process, where pool refers to a collective bet (ante). Back in the day, however, pool tables were found in horse race betting parlours. They served as a way for bettors to pass time while waiting for their races. Around the 1800s, snooker was introduced. This makes snooker the youngest of the three. Neville Chamberlain, a lieutenant, wanted to modify certain things about the “black pool”. The game involves one black ball and 15 red ones. The lieutenant thought he should add other coloured balls. And because those balls were newly introduced into the game, he called his version of “black pool” snooker. The name came from the newbies of the Royal Military Academy, who were called “snookers”. Pool players sometimes play for money, so there is an opportunity for betting houses to structure a sports-betting platform for this sport. These highly mobile teams also provide opportunities for branding teams. They can act as mobile billboards. Mobile communication service, data and WiFi service providers, as well as those who offer electronic money transfer solutions can take advantage of this. Commercialising pool should not be a challenge. The game was born out of commercial activity. The game of snooker is instructive. The World Snooker Championship had a total prize money of £2,4 million (US$3,1 million) in 2022, which included £500 000 (US$644 817) for the winner. It is the longest-running and most prestigious tournament in professional snooker. So, while snooker commands this level of sponsorship, pool remains a pastime. Snooker, billiards and pool are a bit like Test cricket, One-Day Internationals and T20 cricket. They differ in pace but they are all versions of the same game. The challenge is on both the players and the business world to identify the opportunities and make the most of them. ■","pubDate":"2023-07-22 22:02:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"sundaymail","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zim Afro T10 the gift that keeps on giving","link":"https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/zim-afro-t10-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["malvernmugadzikwa"],"video_url":null,"description":"Tinashe Kusema Deputy Sports Editor AMID all the glitz and glamour that characterised its opening ceremony, including the allure of Bollywood actress and model Elnaaz Norouzi and some celebrated cricket players, there is more to the significance of the inaugural Zim Afro T10 cricket tournament.

The competition, which began with day-night games on Thursday, has also generated huge interest among cricket enthusiasts and neutrals, what with its high-profile outlook! It is not every day that local cricket fans get to be up-close with the likes of Eoin Morgan, Sikandar Raza and Mohammed Hafeez. The tournament itself is a brainchild of Indian billionaire Nawab Shaji Ul Mulk, who describes the sport as both a passion and a weakness. “I played cricket while I was in India, captained my university and also played a little for my state at the Under-19 level,” said Mulk. “When I went to the United Arab Emirates, I also played for the national side and had stints in administrative roles. “I am a member of one of the Emirates’ cricket boards. We run the UE cricket, and I have also invested in grounds and club teams. “Cricket has been a passion but more of a weakness, you could say.” Mulk is no stranger to following his passions on a whim; after all, this is the man who gave up admission at the prestigious Wharton Business School in the United States in 1982 to follow his dream to become an entrepreneur. Mulk now has a dream to see a T10 World Cup or, at least, a slot at the Olympics. “A T10 World Cup and Olympics, now, that is the endgame. “Twenty20 cricket is excellent but this format is everything one wants when it comes to time. “We have seen that there is a whole generation that wants to see cricket played in a shorter span and what we want is to see this sport on the same level as football and a few other ball games . . . 90 minutes. “So far, we have been very successful. Today, T10 cricket is played in over 20 countries around the world and we now want to make it into a global sport,” he said. Zimbabwe stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Mulk’s vision after the competition made its grand entry on Thursday. The country became only the second International Cricket Council (ICC) full member to embrace the format. Five privately owned franchise teams — Harare Hurricanes, Joburg Buffaloes, Durban Qalanders, Bulawayo Braves and Cape Town Samp Army — are taking part in the event, which runs until July 29 at Harare Sports Club. The stars have come in their numbers — including Mohammad Nabi, Taskin Ahmed, Yusuf Pathan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Andre Fletcher, Morgan and Hafeez. They are all eager to share the dressing room and lend their wealth of experience to some of the local players. Hafeez has already taken a liking to Zimbabwe’s Wesley Madhevere; while Morgan, who has been with the format from day one, says imparting his vast knowledge of the T10 format is something he always looks forward to. “It’s actually my first time in Zimbabwe and another edition of the T10 league, which I am very excited about,” said the former England captain. “I have been involved since the inaugural edition back in 2017 and I am looking forward to the next 10 days of festival-style cricket. “I am at a stage in my life where I have retired from international cricket — all forms — and do enjoy travelling the world playing T10 cricket and passing on some of my vast experience to the younger guys around the world. “Playing with and against young, new and vibrant Zimbabwean cricketers is sure to be a highlight for me,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Rahim and Fletcher. Mulk has also taken steps to invest in both emerging players and the school system. Through his partnership with the Pakistan franchise Lahore Qalanders, five young players have been identified through an Emerging Players Programme and have been slotted into the five franchises currently taking part. Ten more promising players will be selected from an annual programme aimed at identifying and nurturing talent. Of the 10, five will be handed scholarships, with Mulk and Qalanders aiding their progression in the game. “We want the T10 cricket brand to be part of the schools’ system so that the young kids can play and put them into the same pathway that can create international stars. “We will continue to groom them and get them into the talent hunt, and then make them internationals. “We want to do this the whole year round, invest in the schools’ cricket league and then do the big finale when the Zim Afro T10 comes. “We have established a scholarship for them that will go towards school fees, with the figure roughly US$1 000 each. “When they are ready, regardless of age, we will put them in the international squads,” Mulk said.","pubDate":"2023-07-22 22:02:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"sundaymail","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI, 2nd Test: Batters keep West Indies in contest against India on day 3","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/india-vs-west-indies-second-test-day-3-match-report-score-highlights-brathwaite-ashwin-jadeja/article67110859.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs WI, 2nd Test: West Indies ended Day Three at 229 for five, which left it trailing India by 209 runs. Caribbean skipper Kraigg Brathwaite starred for the home side with an attritional 75.","content":"West Indies dragged its way to 229 for five against India on a day of attritional cricket, constantly interrupted by rain, with the run rate barely floating over two in the second Test on Sunday at the Queen’s Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad. Starting from an overnight score of 86 for one, West Indies captain Kraig Brathwaite and Kirk McKenzie began with caution as they saw out the Indian bowlers in turn. McKenzie was the first to fall, after he edged a Mukesh Kumar length ball to wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan, to gift the debutant pacer his first international wicket. Soon after the left-hander’s dismissal, it began to rain, causing the first rain-enforced break of day. Brathwaite was patience personified as he played out 235 balls to get to his 75. Only an out-of-ordinary ball by Ravichandran Ashwin -- which drifted in like a frisbee and spun viciously to strike the stumps -- could put an end to the West Indian batter’s vigil. Unplayable! A classic off-spinner's dismissal from Ashwin 🔥 The Indian bowlers, who were shuffled around more in hope than vision by captain Rohit Sharma, found no assistance from a docile pitch. India did try to manufacture possibilities, by using left-armer Jaydev Unadkat over the wicket to create footmarks on the pitch for the spinner to extract bite. But the constant rain interruptions meant the spinners never got a long enough spell to take advantage of it. The highlight of the day was a stunning catch taken by Ajinkya Rahane to dismiss a well-set Jermaine Blackwood. Ravindra Jadeja, operating from over the wicket, pitched one on middle and leg and spun it away from the batter. The ball kissed the outside edge of Blackwod’s bat, ricocheted off Kishan’s gloves, before going low onto Rahane’s left. The Indian vice-captain quickly readjusted his body to bring his left hand under to pluck the ball out of thin air. Mohammed Siraj dismissed Joshua Da Silva with a late inswinger that went through his defence to give India the fifth and last wicket of the day before the game stopped for the second due to rain interruption. Alick Athanaze and Jason Holder played out the last hour with care as West Indies trails by 209 runs with two days of the game in hand.

The sport, which evolved from the aristocratic game of billiards, is a popular pastime in Zimbabwe. In many places, pool has overtaken the once-famous “slug” or table football. However, its association with bars and other such places makes some people uncomfortable. Also, the assumption that it is played by lowlifes seems to be militating against the potential commercial impact of the sport. However, at its core, it remains a viable business proposition that should interest marketers. Hear me out. Pool players already have an association, which is ample evidence of organisation and coordination at national level. The players make contributions to get their games going. Although some may be sponsored by club owners, the majority are self-funding. Therefore, they already have a funding model that could be leveraged on. Organisations such as microfinance institutions could explore the possibility of partnering with pool clubs to deliver exciting packages. Some pool clubs own minibuses or small cars for their travel. A significant percentage of players, both male and female, are breadwinners in their families. While they are out playing pool for recreation, there is no reason for them not to look for opportunities that make sense to invest in for their families. Family-friendly products, therefore, can find favour with pool clubs. Imagine a club sponsored by an edible oils company. At some point, all these pool club members will be required to buy cooking oil, margarine, soap and other grocery items for their families, and therein lies the opportunity. Jim Side, a snooker writer, says: “Billiards and pool are two terms that are often used interchangeably. For the non-professional players, it’s easy to see why these two table sports seem the same thing. But while they do have similarities, there are also distinct qualities that set them apart. And then, we have a snooker, which adds to the confusion. “These three — billiards, pool and snooker — all use cue sticks, tables and balls. But what are the differences between these popular table sports?” Billiards can be traced back to a 15th century lawn game similar to croquet. The game was mostly known in Northern Europe. It was only played by royalty and nobles. However, it evolved over time. From an outdoor sport, it moved indoors, where it required a wooden table. There was a simple border and a green cloth put on the table. The colour was specially chosen to resemble grass. Years later, the table game was given a name derived from the French terms “bille”, which means ball, and “billiart”, meaning wooden sticks. The billiard table also underwent modification since players had to keep picking balls on the ground. Cue sticks, on the other hand, emerged in the late 1600s. It is believed the history of pool is the same as that of billiards since it stemmed from the same. The name “pool” reportedly came from the betting process, where pool refers to a collective bet (ante). Back in the day, however, pool tables were found in horse race betting parlours. They served as a way for bettors to pass time while waiting for their races. Around the 1800s, snooker was introduced. This makes snooker the youngest of the three. Neville Chamberlain, a lieutenant, wanted to modify certain things about the “black pool”. The game involves one black ball and 15 red ones. The lieutenant thought he should add other coloured balls. And because those balls were newly introduced into the game, he called his version of “black pool” snooker. The name came from the newbies of the Royal Military Academy, who were called “snookers”. Pool players sometimes play for money, so there is an opportunity for betting houses to structure a sports-betting platform for this sport. These highly mobile teams also provide opportunities for branding teams. They can act as mobile billboards. Mobile communication service, data and WiFi service providers, as well as those who offer electronic money transfer solutions can take advantage of this. Commercialising pool should not be a challenge. The game was born out of commercial activity. The game of snooker is instructive. The World Snooker Championship had a total prize money of £2,4 million (US$3,1 million) in 2022, which included £500 000 (US$644 817) for the winner. It is the longest-running and most prestigious tournament in professional snooker. So, while snooker commands this level of sponsorship, pool remains a pastime. Snooker, billiards and pool are a bit like Test cricket, One-Day Internationals and T20 cricket. They differ in pace but they are all versions of the same game. The challenge is on both the players and the business world to identify the opportunities and make the most of them. ■","pubDate":"2023-07-22 22:02:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"sundaymail","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zim Afro T10 the gift that keeps on giving","link":"https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/zim-afro-t10-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["malvernmugadzikwa"],"video_url":null,"description":"Tinashe Kusema Deputy Sports Editor AMID all the glitz and glamour that characterised its opening ceremony, including the allure of Bollywood actress and model Elnaaz Norouzi and some celebrated cricket players, there is more to the significance of the inaugural Zim Afro T10 cricket tournament.

The competition, which began with day-night games on Thursday, has also generated huge interest among cricket enthusiasts and neutrals, what with its high-profile outlook! It is not every day that local cricket fans get to be up-close with the likes of Eoin Morgan, Sikandar Raza and Mohammed Hafeez. The tournament itself is a brainchild of Indian billionaire Nawab Shaji Ul Mulk, who describes the sport as both a passion and a weakness. “I played cricket while I was in India, captained my university and also played a little for my state at the Under-19 level,” said Mulk. “When I went to the United Arab Emirates, I also played for the national side and had stints in administrative roles. “I am a member of one of the Emirates’ cricket boards. We run the UE cricket, and I have also invested in grounds and club teams. “Cricket has been a passion but more of a weakness, you could say.” Mulk is no stranger to following his passions on a whim; after all, this is the man who gave up admission at the prestigious Wharton Business School in the United States in 1982 to follow his dream to become an entrepreneur. Mulk now has a dream to see a T10 World Cup or, at least, a slot at the Olympics. “A T10 World Cup and Olympics, now, that is the endgame. “Twenty20 cricket is excellent but this format is everything one wants when it comes to time. “We have seen that there is a whole generation that wants to see cricket played in a shorter span and what we want is to see this sport on the same level as football and a few other ball games . . . 90 minutes. “So far, we have been very successful. Today, T10 cricket is played in over 20 countries around the world and we now want to make it into a global sport,” he said. Zimbabwe stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Mulk’s vision after the competition made its grand entry on Thursday. The country became only the second International Cricket Council (ICC) full member to embrace the format. Five privately owned franchise teams — Harare Hurricanes, Joburg Buffaloes, Durban Qalanders, Bulawayo Braves and Cape Town Samp Army — are taking part in the event, which runs until July 29 at Harare Sports Club. The stars have come in their numbers — including Mohammad Nabi, Taskin Ahmed, Yusuf Pathan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Andre Fletcher, Morgan and Hafeez. They are all eager to share the dressing room and lend their wealth of experience to some of the local players. Hafeez has already taken a liking to Zimbabwe’s Wesley Madhevere; while Morgan, who has been with the format from day one, says imparting his vast knowledge of the T10 format is something he always looks forward to. “It’s actually my first time in Zimbabwe and another edition of the T10 league, which I am very excited about,” said the former England captain. “I have been involved since the inaugural edition back in 2017 and I am looking forward to the next 10 days of festival-style cricket. “I am at a stage in my life where I have retired from international cricket — all forms — and do enjoy travelling the world playing T10 cricket and passing on some of my vast experience to the younger guys around the world. “Playing with and against young, new and vibrant Zimbabwean cricketers is sure to be a highlight for me,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Rahim and Fletcher. Mulk has also taken steps to invest in both emerging players and the school system. Through his partnership with the Pakistan franchise Lahore Qalanders, five young players have been identified through an Emerging Players Programme and have been slotted into the five franchises currently taking part. Ten more promising players will be selected from an annual programme aimed at identifying and nurturing talent. Of the 10, five will be handed scholarships, with Mulk and Qalanders aiding their progression in the game. “We want the T10 cricket brand to be part of the schools’ system so that the young kids can play and put them into the same pathway that can create international stars. “We will continue to groom them and get them into the talent hunt, and then make them internationals. “We want to do this the whole year round, invest in the schools’ cricket league and then do the big finale when the Zim Afro T10 comes. “We have established a scholarship for them that will go towards school fees, with the figure roughly US$1 000 each. “When they are ready, regardless of age, we will put them in the international squads,” Mulk said.","pubDate":"2023-07-22 22:02:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"sundaymail","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI, 2nd Test: Batters keep West Indies in contest against India on day 3","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/india-vs-west-indies-second-test-day-3-match-report-score-highlights-brathwaite-ashwin-jadeja/article67110859.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs WI, 2nd Test: West Indies ended Day Three at 229 for five, which left it trailing India by 209 runs. Caribbean skipper Kraigg Brathwaite starred for the home side with an attritional 75.","content":"West Indies dragged its way to 229 for five against India on a day of attritional cricket, constantly interrupted by rain, with the run rate barely floating over two in the second Test on Sunday at the Queen’s Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad. Starting from an overnight score of 86 for one, West Indies captain Kraig Brathwaite and Kirk McKenzie began with caution as they saw out the Indian bowlers in turn. McKenzie was the first to fall, after he edged a Mukesh Kumar length ball to wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan, to gift the debutant pacer his first international wicket. Soon after the left-hander’s dismissal, it began to rain, causing the first rain-enforced break of day. Brathwaite was patience personified as he played out 235 balls to get to his 75. Only an out-of-ordinary ball by Ravichandran Ashwin -- which drifted in like a frisbee and spun viciously to strike the stumps -- could put an end to the West Indian batter’s vigil. Unplayable! A classic off-spinner's dismissal from Ashwin 🔥 The Indian bowlers, who were shuffled around more in hope than vision by captain Rohit Sharma, found no assistance from a docile pitch. India did try to manufacture possibilities, by using left-armer Jaydev Unadkat over the wicket to create footmarks on the pitch for the spinner to extract bite. But the constant rain interruptions meant the spinners never got a long enough spell to take advantage of it. The highlight of the day was a stunning catch taken by Ajinkya Rahane to dismiss a well-set Jermaine Blackwood. Ravindra Jadeja, operating from over the wicket, pitched one on middle and leg and spun it away from the batter. The ball kissed the outside edge of Blackwod’s bat, ricocheted off Kishan’s gloves, before going low onto Rahane’s left. The Indian vice-captain quickly readjusted his body to bring his left hand under to pluck the ball out of thin air. Mohammed Siraj dismissed Joshua Da Silva with a late inswinger that went through his defence to give India the fifth and last wicket of the day before the game stopped for the second due to rain interruption. Alick Athanaze and Jason Holder played out the last hour with care as West Indies trails by 209 runs with two days of the game in hand.

The sport, which evolved from the aristocratic game of billiards, is a popular pastime in Zimbabwe. In many places, pool has overtaken the once-famous “slug” or table football. However, its association with bars and other such places makes some people uncomfortable. Also, the assumption that it is played by lowlifes seems to be militating against the potential commercial impact of the sport. However, at its core, it remains a viable business proposition that should interest marketers. Hear me out. Pool players already have an association, which is ample evidence of organisation and coordination at national level. The players make contributions to get their games going. Although some may be sponsored by club owners, the majority are self-funding. Therefore, they already have a funding model that could be leveraged on. Organisations such as microfinance institutions could explore the possibility of partnering with pool clubs to deliver exciting packages. Some pool clubs own minibuses or small cars for their travel. A significant percentage of players, both male and female, are breadwinners in their families. While they are out playing pool for recreation, there is no reason for them not to look for opportunities that make sense to invest in for their families. Family-friendly products, therefore, can find favour with pool clubs. Imagine a club sponsored by an edible oils company. At some point, all these pool club members will be required to buy cooking oil, margarine, soap and other grocery items for their families, and therein lies the opportunity. Jim Side, a snooker writer, says: “Billiards and pool are two terms that are often used interchangeably. For the non-professional players, it’s easy to see why these two table sports seem the same thing. But while they do have similarities, there are also distinct qualities that set them apart. And then, we have a snooker, which adds to the confusion. “These three — billiards, pool and snooker — all use cue sticks, tables and balls. But what are the differences between these popular table sports?” Billiards can be traced back to a 15th century lawn game similar to croquet. The game was mostly known in Northern Europe. It was only played by royalty and nobles. However, it evolved over time. From an outdoor sport, it moved indoors, where it required a wooden table. There was a simple border and a green cloth put on the table. The colour was specially chosen to resemble grass. Years later, the table game was given a name derived from the French terms “bille”, which means ball, and “billiart”, meaning wooden sticks. The billiard table also underwent modification since players had to keep picking balls on the ground. Cue sticks, on the other hand, emerged in the late 1600s. It is believed the history of pool is the same as that of billiards since it stemmed from the same. The name “pool” reportedly came from the betting process, where pool refers to a collective bet (ante). Back in the day, however, pool tables were found in horse race betting parlours. They served as a way for bettors to pass time while waiting for their races. Around the 1800s, snooker was introduced. This makes snooker the youngest of the three. Neville Chamberlain, a lieutenant, wanted to modify certain things about the “black pool”. The game involves one black ball and 15 red ones. The lieutenant thought he should add other coloured balls. And because those balls were newly introduced into the game, he called his version of “black pool” snooker. The name came from the newbies of the Royal Military Academy, who were called “snookers”. Pool players sometimes play for money, so there is an opportunity for betting houses to structure a sports-betting platform for this sport. These highly mobile teams also provide opportunities for branding teams. They can act as mobile billboards. Mobile communication service, data and WiFi service providers, as well as those who offer electronic money transfer solutions can take advantage of this. Commercialising pool should not be a challenge. The game was born out of commercial activity. The game of snooker is instructive. The World Snooker Championship had a total prize money of £2,4 million (US$3,1 million) in 2022, which included £500 000 (US$644 817) for the winner. It is the longest-running and most prestigious tournament in professional snooker. So, while snooker commands this level of sponsorship, pool remains a pastime. Snooker, billiards and pool are a bit like Test cricket, One-Day Internationals and T20 cricket. They differ in pace but they are all versions of the same game. The challenge is on both the players and the business world to identify the opportunities and make the most of them. ■","pubDate":"2023-07-22 22:02:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"sundaymail","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zim Afro T10 the gift that keeps on giving","link":"https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/zim-afro-t10-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["malvernmugadzikwa"],"video_url":null,"description":"Tinashe Kusema Deputy Sports Editor AMID all the glitz and glamour that characterised its opening ceremony, including the allure of Bollywood actress and model Elnaaz Norouzi and some celebrated cricket players, there is more to the significance of the inaugural Zim Afro T10 cricket tournament.

The competition, which began with day-night games on Thursday, has also generated huge interest among cricket enthusiasts and neutrals, what with its high-profile outlook! It is not every day that local cricket fans get to be up-close with the likes of Eoin Morgan, Sikandar Raza and Mohammed Hafeez. The tournament itself is a brainchild of Indian billionaire Nawab Shaji Ul Mulk, who describes the sport as both a passion and a weakness. “I played cricket while I was in India, captained my university and also played a little for my state at the Under-19 level,” said Mulk. “When I went to the United Arab Emirates, I also played for the national side and had stints in administrative roles. “I am a member of one of the Emirates’ cricket boards. We run the UE cricket, and I have also invested in grounds and club teams. “Cricket has been a passion but more of a weakness, you could say.” Mulk is no stranger to following his passions on a whim; after all, this is the man who gave up admission at the prestigious Wharton Business School in the United States in 1982 to follow his dream to become an entrepreneur. Mulk now has a dream to see a T10 World Cup or, at least, a slot at the Olympics. “A T10 World Cup and Olympics, now, that is the endgame. “Twenty20 cricket is excellent but this format is everything one wants when it comes to time. “We have seen that there is a whole generation that wants to see cricket played in a shorter span and what we want is to see this sport on the same level as football and a few other ball games . . . 90 minutes. “So far, we have been very successful. Today, T10 cricket is played in over 20 countries around the world and we now want to make it into a global sport,” he said. Zimbabwe stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Mulk’s vision after the competition made its grand entry on Thursday. The country became only the second International Cricket Council (ICC) full member to embrace the format. Five privately owned franchise teams — Harare Hurricanes, Joburg Buffaloes, Durban Qalanders, Bulawayo Braves and Cape Town Samp Army — are taking part in the event, which runs until July 29 at Harare Sports Club. The stars have come in their numbers — including Mohammad Nabi, Taskin Ahmed, Yusuf Pathan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Andre Fletcher, Morgan and Hafeez. They are all eager to share the dressing room and lend their wealth of experience to some of the local players. Hafeez has already taken a liking to Zimbabwe’s Wesley Madhevere; while Morgan, who has been with the format from day one, says imparting his vast knowledge of the T10 format is something he always looks forward to. “It’s actually my first time in Zimbabwe and another edition of the T10 league, which I am very excited about,” said the former England captain. “I have been involved since the inaugural edition back in 2017 and I am looking forward to the next 10 days of festival-style cricket. “I am at a stage in my life where I have retired from international cricket — all forms — and do enjoy travelling the world playing T10 cricket and passing on some of my vast experience to the younger guys around the world. “Playing with and against young, new and vibrant Zimbabwean cricketers is sure to be a highlight for me,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Rahim and Fletcher. Mulk has also taken steps to invest in both emerging players and the school system. Through his partnership with the Pakistan franchise Lahore Qalanders, five young players have been identified through an Emerging Players Programme and have been slotted into the five franchises currently taking part. Ten more promising players will be selected from an annual programme aimed at identifying and nurturing talent. Of the 10, five will be handed scholarships, with Mulk and Qalanders aiding their progression in the game. “We want the T10 cricket brand to be part of the schools’ system so that the young kids can play and put them into the same pathway that can create international stars. “We will continue to groom them and get them into the talent hunt, and then make them internationals. “We want to do this the whole year round, invest in the schools’ cricket league and then do the big finale when the Zim Afro T10 comes. “We have established a scholarship for them that will go towards school fees, with the figure roughly US$1 000 each. “When they are ready, regardless of age, we will put them in the international squads,” Mulk said.","pubDate":"2023-07-22 22:02:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"sundaymail","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI, 2nd Test: Batters keep West Indies in contest against India on day 3","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/india-vs-west-indies-second-test-day-3-match-report-score-highlights-brathwaite-ashwin-jadeja/article67110859.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs WI, 2nd Test: West Indies ended Day Three at 229 for five, which left it trailing India by 209 runs. Caribbean skipper Kraigg Brathwaite starred for the home side with an attritional 75.","content":"West Indies dragged its way to 229 for five against India on a day of attritional cricket, constantly interrupted by rain, with the run rate barely floating over two in the second Test on Sunday at the Queen’s Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad. Starting from an overnight score of 86 for one, West Indies captain Kraig Brathwaite and Kirk McKenzie began with caution as they saw out the Indian bowlers in turn. McKenzie was the first to fall, after he edged a Mukesh Kumar length ball to wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan, to gift the debutant pacer his first international wicket. Soon after the left-hander’s dismissal, it began to rain, causing the first rain-enforced break of day. Brathwaite was patience personified as he played out 235 balls to get to his 75. Only an out-of-ordinary ball by Ravichandran Ashwin -- which drifted in like a frisbee and spun viciously to strike the stumps -- could put an end to the West Indian batter’s vigil. Unplayable! A classic off-spinner's dismissal from Ashwin 🔥 The Indian bowlers, who were shuffled around more in hope than vision by captain Rohit Sharma, found no assistance from a docile pitch. India did try to manufacture possibilities, by using left-armer Jaydev Unadkat over the wicket to create footmarks on the pitch for the spinner to extract bite. But the constant rain interruptions meant the spinners never got a long enough spell to take advantage of it. The highlight of the day was a stunning catch taken by Ajinkya Rahane to dismiss a well-set Jermaine Blackwood. Ravindra Jadeja, operating from over the wicket, pitched one on middle and leg and spun it away from the batter. The ball kissed the outside edge of Blackwod’s bat, ricocheted off Kishan’s gloves, before going low onto Rahane’s left. The Indian vice-captain quickly readjusted his body to bring his left hand under to pluck the ball out of thin air. Mohammed Siraj dismissed Joshua Da Silva with a late inswinger that went through his defence to give India the fifth and last wicket of the day before the game stopped for the second due to rain interruption. Alick Athanaze and Jason Holder played out the last hour with care as West Indies trails by 209 runs with two days of the game in hand.
