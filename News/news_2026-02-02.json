Capitals beat UP Warriorz by 5 wickets to each WPL Eliminator; Mumbai Indians knocked out","description":"Delhi Capitals huffed and puffed but eventually got over the line in a modest run-chase by five wickets to beat UP Warriorz and make their way into the Eliminator clash of the Womens Premier League here on Sunday Delhis win with five wickets and eight balls to spare also knocked out the defending champions Mumbai Indians from the race to the WPL playoffs Delhi Capitals who have featured in each of the three WPL finals so far but never got over the line will face an upbeat Gujarat Giants in the Eliminator here at the Baroda Cricket Association Stadium on Tuesday The winner will face Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Thursday Chasing 123 DC scored 1265 after slipping from 84 for one to 101 for five Skipper Jemimah Rodrigues 34 not out off 18 balls 5 fours and Niki Prasad 4 not out were on the crease when the winning runs of the low-scoring contest were hit Shafali Verma scored a patient 29 while Laura Wolvaardt hit a 36-ball 47 with seven fours to anchor Delhis run chase after they restricted UPW to 122 for eight Shafali and Wolvaardt put on 73 off 64 balls for a robust recovery after an early blow in form of Lizelle Lee 10 UPW despite having two of the worlds best spinners in Sophie Ecclestone 4-0-20-1 and Deepti Sharma 34-0-27-2 just did not have enough runs on the board to challenge the Capitals who had stuttered near the finish line Shafali and Wolvaardt had put DC on course of a comfortable win but they lost wickets in a flurry to raise UPWs hopes of a comeback But skipper Jemimah struck two consecutive fours in the penultimate over from Deepti to thwart any further hiccups Earlier Marizanne Kapp 330 and Chinelle Henry 225 delivered the goods as Delhi Capitals restricted a hapless UP Warriorz to a paltry 122 for eight UP Warriorz lost their skipper Meg Lanning on the first ball of the innings and failed to gain any momentum losing wickets at regular intervals Kapp accounted for opener Deepti Sharma 24 Charli Knott 12 and Deandra Dottin 5 Henry also removed Simran Shaikh 22 when she threatened to pull things back for UPW Opening the innings star India all-rounder Deepti tried her best to provide early momentum with a 19-ball 24 for which she struck four fours and a six But UPW failed to get any partnership going which hurt their cause Simran Shaikh tried to change the course of the innings with a brisk 14-ball 22 with three fours but she too fell at a wrong juncture for UPW Shikha Pandey 23 not out played a handy knock late in the innings Brief Scores UP Warriorz 1228 in 20 overs Deepti Sharma 24 Shikha Pandey 23 not out Chinelle Henry 225 Marizanne Kapp 330 lost to Delhi Capitals 1265 in 184 overs Shafali Verma 29 Laura
