Costliest Uncapped Player In IPL Auction History","description":"Chennai Super Kings (CSK) sent shockwaves through the IPL 2026 mini-auction, purchasing uncapped Indian all-rounder Prashant Veer for an unprecedented ₹14.20 crore.This astonishing price tag shattered all previous benchmarks, instantly making the 20-year-old Uttar Pradesh cricketer the most expensive uncapped player in the history of the Indian Premier League.The bidding for Veer, who began at a modest base price of ₹30 lakh, quickly escalated into a tense, protracted duel between CSK and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH).Both franchises demonstrated a clear intent to secure the highly-rated youngster, pushing the price far past the previous uncapped record, held by Avesh Khan at ₹10 crore (2022). It was CSK who ultimately clinched the deal, signaling a massive investment in their future core.Who is Prashant Veer?Prashant Veer is an exciting left-handed batter and slow left-arm spinner, a versatile combination that makes him a rare commodity in Indian cricket.This dual-threat ability is the driving force behind his valuation. Franchises, particularly CSK, view him as a strategic, long-term acquisition. His profile closely mirrors that of a certain superstar all-rounder who recently departed the franchise.CSK’s substantial spend strongly suggests they are eyeing Veer as the eventual replacement for the legendary Ravindra Jadeja, who was recently traded out. Veer's capacity to bowl economical left-arm spin and contribute valuable runs with explosive lower-order hitting makes him an ideal candidate to fill the significant gap left in the squad's balance.Veer's exceptional performances in the domestic circuit, particularly in the recent Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the UP T20 League, where he showcased both wicket-taking ability and an aggressive batting strike rate, were instrumental in catching the eye of IPL scouts.His purchase is a defining moment for the auction, validating the league’s willingness to bet big on high-potential, homegrown Indian talent.Also on ABP Live |","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["cricket"],"creator":["ABP Live Sports"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-16 11:56:21","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/12/16/04603f05923a23e684621fd7e457b7b7176588612844524_original.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","source_name":"Abp News","source_priority":7754,"source_url":"http://abplive.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/abplive.jpg","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"488ea1ae21eed76d62e1dcfb73df5d47","link":"https://www.thedailyjagran.com/cricket/ipl-auction-2026-csk-unleashes-rs-1420-crore-windfall-for-uncapped-kartik-sharma-becomes-joint-most-expensive-uncapped-player-10286471","title":"IPL Auction 2026: CSK Unleash Rs 14.20 Crore Windfall For Kartik Sharma, Wicketkeeper Becomes Joint Most Expensive Uncapped Player","description":"Cricket,IPL Auction 2026,Kartik Sharma,Chennai Super Kings,IPL 2026 Abu Dhabi,Kartik Sharma auction price,CSK Kartik Sharma deal,Rajasthan six-hitting machine IPL,IPL 2026 player bidding","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["ipl auction 2026","csk kartik sharma deal","cricket","kartik sharma","kartik sharma auction price","chennai super kings","ipl 2026 abu dhabi","rajasthan six-hitting machine ipl","ipl 2026 player bidding"],"creator":["the daily jagran"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports","top"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-16 11:55:41","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2025/12/16/article/image/SPO---2025-12-16T172326.652-1765886011706_v.webp","video_url":null,"source_id":"english_jagran","source_name":"Jagran English","source_priority":10561,"source_url":"https://english.jagran.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/english_jagran.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"c3ff92301350b3a724598ed37fb2cb0a","link":"https://odishatv.in/sports/ipl-mini-auctions-2026-death-overs-specialist-matheesha-pathirana-goes-to-kkr-for-whopping-rs-18-crore-10915354","title":"IPL Mini Auctions 2026: Death overs specialist Matheesha Pathirana goes to KKR for whopping Rs 18 crore","description":"The IPL 2026 Mini Auction continues to deliver blockbuster moments, and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) once again stole the spotlight. After an aggressive bidding war, the two-time champions snapped up Sri Lanka’s lethal death-overs specialist Matheesha Pathirana for a whopping Rs 18 crore, underlining their intent to build a fearsome bowling attack for the upcoming season. Earlier, the 3 time champion team bought Cameron Green for 25.20 crore. Known for his unique slinging action and lightning-fast yorkers, Pathirana has earned a reputation as one of the most difficult bowlers to face at the back end of an innings.The Yorker MachineCapable of clocking speeds close to 150 kmph, Pathirana’s biggest strength lies in his pinpoint accuracy at the death. His deceptive release and sharp pace make him a nightmare for batters, especially in pressure situations qualities KKR have been keen to add to their arsenal.CSK Legacy and a Dip in FormPathirana rose to prominence during IPL 2023, playing a crucial role in the Chennai Super Kings’ title-winning campaign. He picked up 19 wickets in 12 matches at an economy rate of 8.01, quickly becoming MS Dhoni’s go-to bowler in crunch moments.However, his IPL 2025 season was relatively modest. He managed 13 wickets in 12 games while conceding runs at an economy of 10.13, which eventually led to his release. Overall, Pathirana has claimed 47 wickets in 32 IPL matches at an economy of 8.68.Strong T20 CredentialsAcross 101 T20 matches, the 22-year-old has taken 136 wickets at an average of 21.27, including five four-wicket hauls. On the international stage, he has 31 wickets in 21 T20Is for Sri Lanka.While Pathirana’s injury history remains a concern, KKR’s Rs 18 crore investment reflects faith in his match-winning potential. If he stays fit, the Knight Riders may well have secured one of the most dangerous finishers-with-the-ball in T20 cricket.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["sports","news"],"creator":["Bibhu Prasad Ray"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-16 11:54:57","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1280x960/odishatv/media/media_files/2025/11/15/matheesha-pathirana-2025-11-15-16-46-26.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"odishatv","source_name":"Odisha Tv","source_priority":62016,"source_url":"https://odishatv.in","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/odishatv.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"5f69a8467cedcb90d88a708d07a2b865","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/ipl-2026/who-is-prashant-veer-domestic-star-roped-in-by-csk-for-most-expensive-uncapped-bid-9825859","title":"Who Is Prashant?

Costliest Uncapped Player In IPL Auction History","description":"Chennai Super Kings (CSK) sent shockwaves through the IPL 2026 mini-auction, purchasing uncapped Indian all-rounder Prashant Veer for an unprecedented ₹14.20 crore.This astonishing price tag shattered all previous benchmarks, instantly making the 20-year-old Uttar Pradesh cricketer the most expensive uncapped player in the history of the Indian Premier League.The bidding for Veer, who began at a modest base price of ₹30 lakh, quickly escalated into a tense, protracted duel between CSK and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH).Both franchises demonstrated a clear intent to secure the highly-rated youngster, pushing the price far past the previous uncapped record, held by Avesh Khan at ₹10 crore (2022). It was CSK who ultimately clinched the deal, signaling a massive investment in their future core.Who is Prashant Veer?Prashant Veer is an exciting left-handed batter and slow left-arm spinner, a versatile combination that makes him a rare commodity in Indian cricket.This dual-threat ability is the driving force behind his valuation. Franchises, particularly CSK, view him as a strategic, long-term acquisition. His profile closely mirrors that of a certain superstar all-rounder who recently departed the franchise.CSK’s substantial spend strongly suggests they are eyeing Veer as the eventual replacement for the legendary Ravindra Jadeja, who was recently traded out. Veer's capacity to bowl economical left-arm spin and contribute valuable runs with explosive lower-order hitting makes him an ideal candidate to fill the significant gap left in the squad's balance.Veer's exceptional performances in the domestic circuit, particularly in the recent Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the UP T20 League, where he showcased both wicket-taking ability and an aggressive batting strike rate, were instrumental in catching the eye of IPL scouts.His purchase is a defining moment for the auction, validating the league’s willingness to bet big on high-potential, homegrown Indian talent.Also on ABP Live |","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["cricket"],"creator":["ABP Live Sports"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-16 11:56:21","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/12/16/04603f05923a23e684621fd7e457b7b7176588612844524_original.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","source_name":"Abp News","source_priority":7754,"source_url":"http://abplive.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/abplive.jpg","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"488ea1ae21eed76d62e1dcfb73df5d47","link":"https://www.thedailyjagran.com/cricket/ipl-auction-2026-csk-unleashes-rs-1420-crore-windfall-for-uncapped-kartik-sharma-becomes-joint-most-expensive-uncapped-player-10286471","title":"IPL Auction 2026: CSK Unleash Rs 14.20 Crore Windfall For Kartik Sharma, Wicketkeeper Becomes Joint Most Expensive Uncapped Player","description":"Cricket,IPL Auction 2026,Kartik Sharma,Chennai Super Kings,IPL 2026 Abu Dhabi,Kartik Sharma auction price,CSK Kartik Sharma deal,Rajasthan six-hitting machine IPL,IPL 2026 player bidding","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["ipl auction 2026","csk kartik sharma deal","cricket","kartik sharma","kartik sharma auction price","chennai super kings","ipl 2026 abu dhabi","rajasthan six-hitting machine ipl","ipl 2026 player bidding"],"creator":["the daily jagran"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports","top"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-16 11:55:41","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2025/12/16/article/image/SPO---2025-12-16T172326.652-1765886011706_v.webp","video_url":null,"source_id":"english_jagran","source_name":"Jagran English","source_priority":10561,"source_url":"https://english.jagran.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/english_jagran.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"c3ff92301350b3a724598ed37fb2cb0a","link":"https://odishatv.in/sports/ipl-mini-auctions-2026-death-overs-specialist-matheesha-pathirana-goes-to-kkr-for-whopping-rs-18-crore-10915354","title":"IPL Mini Auctions 2026: Death overs specialist Matheesha Pathirana goes to KKR for whopping Rs 18 crore","description":"The IPL 2026 Mini Auction continues to deliver blockbuster moments, and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) once again stole the spotlight. After an aggressive bidding war, the two-time champions snapped up Sri Lanka’s lethal death-overs specialist Matheesha Pathirana for a whopping Rs 18 crore, underlining their intent to build a fearsome bowling attack for the upcoming season. Earlier, the 3 time champion team bought Cameron Green for 25.20 crore. Known for his unique slinging action and lightning-fast yorkers, Pathirana has earned a reputation as one of the most difficult bowlers to face at the back end of an innings.The Yorker MachineCapable of clocking speeds close to 150 kmph, Pathirana’s biggest strength lies in his pinpoint accuracy at the death. His deceptive release and sharp pace make him a nightmare for batters, especially in pressure situations qualities KKR have been keen to add to their arsenal.CSK Legacy and a Dip in FormPathirana rose to prominence during IPL 2023, playing a crucial role in the Chennai Super Kings’ title-winning campaign. He picked up 19 wickets in 12 matches at an economy rate of 8.01, quickly becoming MS Dhoni’s go-to bowler in crunch moments.However, his IPL 2025 season was relatively modest. He managed 13 wickets in 12 games while conceding runs at an economy of 10.13, which eventually led to his release. Overall, Pathirana has claimed 47 wickets in 32 IPL matches at an economy of 8.68.Strong T20 CredentialsAcross 101 T20 matches, the 22-year-old has taken 136 wickets at an average of 21.27, including five four-wicket hauls. On the international stage, he has 31 wickets in 21 T20Is for Sri Lanka.While Pathirana’s injury history remains a concern, KKR’s Rs 18 crore investment reflects faith in his match-winning potential. If he stays fit, the Knight Riders may well have secured one of the most dangerous finishers-with-the-ball in T20 cricket.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["sports","news"],"creator":["Bibhu Prasad Ray"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-16 11:54:57","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1280x960/odishatv/media/media_files/2025/11/15/matheesha-pathirana-2025-11-15-16-46-26.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"odishatv","source_name":"Odisha Tv","source_priority":62016,"source_url":"https://odishatv.in","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/odishatv.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"5f69a8467cedcb90d88a708d07a2b865","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/ipl-2026/who-is-prashant-veer-domestic-star-roped-in-by-csk-for-most-expensive-uncapped-bid-9825859","title":"Who Is Prashant?

Costliest Uncapped Player In IPL Auction History","description":"Chennai Super Kings (CSK) sent shockwaves through the IPL 2026 mini-auction, purchasing uncapped Indian all-rounder Prashant Veer for an unprecedented ₹14.20 crore.This astonishing price tag shattered all previous benchmarks, instantly making the 20-year-old Uttar Pradesh cricketer the most expensive uncapped player in the history of the Indian Premier League.The bidding for Veer, who began at a modest base price of ₹30 lakh, quickly escalated into a tense, protracted duel between CSK and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH).Both franchises demonstrated a clear intent to secure the highly-rated youngster, pushing the price far past the previous uncapped record, held by Avesh Khan at ₹10 crore (2022). It was CSK who ultimately clinched the deal, signaling a massive investment in their future core.Who is Prashant Veer?Prashant Veer is an exciting left-handed batter and slow left-arm spinner, a versatile combination that makes him a rare commodity in Indian cricket.This dual-threat ability is the driving force behind his valuation. Franchises, particularly CSK, view him as a strategic, long-term acquisition. His profile closely mirrors that of a certain superstar all-rounder who recently departed the franchise.CSK’s substantial spend strongly suggests they are eyeing Veer as the eventual replacement for the legendary Ravindra Jadeja, who was recently traded out. Veer's capacity to bowl economical left-arm spin and contribute valuable runs with explosive lower-order hitting makes him an ideal candidate to fill the significant gap left in the squad's balance.Veer's exceptional performances in the domestic circuit, particularly in the recent Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the UP T20 League, where he showcased both wicket-taking ability and an aggressive batting strike rate, were instrumental in catching the eye of IPL scouts.His purchase is a defining moment for the auction, validating the league’s willingness to bet big on high-potential, homegrown Indian talent.Also on ABP Live |","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["cricket"],"creator":["ABP Live Sports"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-16 11:56:21","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/12/16/04603f05923a23e684621fd7e457b7b7176588612844524_original.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","source_name":"Abp News","source_priority":7754,"source_url":"http://abplive.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/abplive.jpg","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"488ea1ae21eed76d62e1dcfb73df5d47","link":"https://www.thedailyjagran.com/cricket/ipl-auction-2026-csk-unleashes-rs-1420-crore-windfall-for-uncapped-kartik-sharma-becomes-joint-most-expensive-uncapped-player-10286471","title":"IPL Auction 2026: CSK Unleash Rs 14.20 Crore Windfall For Kartik Sharma, Wicketkeeper Becomes Joint Most Expensive Uncapped Player","description":"Cricket,IPL Auction 2026,Kartik Sharma,Chennai Super Kings,IPL 2026 Abu Dhabi,Kartik Sharma auction price,CSK Kartik Sharma deal,Rajasthan six-hitting machine IPL,IPL 2026 player bidding","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["ipl auction 2026","csk kartik sharma deal","cricket","kartik sharma","kartik sharma auction price","chennai super kings","ipl 2026 abu dhabi","rajasthan six-hitting machine ipl","ipl 2026 player bidding"],"creator":["the daily jagran"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports","top"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-16 11:55:41","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2025/12/16/article/image/SPO---2025-12-16T172326.652-1765886011706_v.webp","video_url":null,"source_id":"english_jagran","source_name":"Jagran English","source_priority":10561,"source_url":"https://english.jagran.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/english_jagran.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"c3ff92301350b3a724598ed37fb2cb0a","link":"https://odishatv.in/sports/ipl-mini-auctions-2026-death-overs-specialist-matheesha-pathirana-goes-to-kkr-for-whopping-rs-18-crore-10915354","title":"IPL Mini Auctions 2026: Death overs specialist Matheesha Pathirana goes to KKR for whopping Rs 18 crore","description":"The IPL 2026 Mini Auction continues to deliver blockbuster moments, and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) once again stole the spotlight. After an aggressive bidding war, the two-time champions snapped up Sri Lanka’s lethal death-overs specialist Matheesha Pathirana for a whopping Rs 18 crore, underlining their intent to build a fearsome bowling attack for the upcoming season. Earlier, the 3 time champion team bought Cameron Green for 25.20 crore. Known for his unique slinging action and lightning-fast yorkers, Pathirana has earned a reputation as one of the most difficult bowlers to face at the back end of an innings.The Yorker MachineCapable of clocking speeds close to 150 kmph, Pathirana’s biggest strength lies in his pinpoint accuracy at the death. His deceptive release and sharp pace make him a nightmare for batters, especially in pressure situations qualities KKR have been keen to add to their arsenal.CSK Legacy and a Dip in FormPathirana rose to prominence during IPL 2023, playing a crucial role in the Chennai Super Kings’ title-winning campaign. He picked up 19 wickets in 12 matches at an economy rate of 8.01, quickly becoming MS Dhoni’s go-to bowler in crunch moments.However, his IPL 2025 season was relatively modest. He managed 13 wickets in 12 games while conceding runs at an economy of 10.13, which eventually led to his release. Overall, Pathirana has claimed 47 wickets in 32 IPL matches at an economy of 8.68.Strong T20 CredentialsAcross 101 T20 matches, the 22-year-old has taken 136 wickets at an average of 21.27, including five four-wicket hauls. On the international stage, he has 31 wickets in 21 T20Is for Sri Lanka.While Pathirana’s injury history remains a concern, KKR’s Rs 18 crore investment reflects faith in his match-winning potential. If he stays fit, the Knight Riders may well have secured one of the most dangerous finishers-with-the-ball in T20 cricket.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["sports","news"],"creator":["Bibhu Prasad Ray"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-16 11:54:57","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1280x960/odishatv/media/media_files/2025/11/15/matheesha-pathirana-2025-11-15-16-46-26.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"odishatv","source_name":"Odisha Tv","source_priority":62016,"source_url":"https://odishatv.in","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/odishatv.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false}]}
