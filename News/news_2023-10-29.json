By that stage, sons Beauden, Scott and Jordie had already been born, and how they’ve lived up to their father’s assertion. On Saturday night, they will become the first trio of brothers to appear in a Rugby World Cup final, all close to certain starters for the All Blacks ahead of a meeting with South Africa . There are many tales of successful sporting siblings, from the Williams sisters to the Kelce brothers; the Waughs or the Charltons . But for three brothers to be so integral to a potential World Cup win is special. Smart international rugby coaches build their side around a spine of players from a single club; Ian Foster has been able to build his All Blacks around a single family. Their rise to the top is a story of both nature and nurture. Smiley was a legend of Taranaki rugby, capped almost 200 times by the Bulls in the back five in the pack, while mother Robyn was a talented basketball and netball player. Growing up, the brothers would hone their skills on a patch of land in their sprawling backyard that they called the BCG – the Barrett Cricket Ground – with Smiley intent on making sure all of his sons had the skillset to play an all-court game. “As youngsters playing in back yard, we only dreamed of being here,” Beauden Barrett explained earlier in the tournament. “’Mum was a pretty talented athlete herself. They all say our speed came from Mum and I guess the size and work rate from Dad. “There was always work to be done. So we always saw Mum and Dad doing that, coming home cooking us dinner, getting us ready for school. So if you relate that to your rugby it’s about striving to be better, to be the best you can be.\" By their teenage years, the trio could pass off both hands and kick with both feet, making them most of the space on the family dairy farm in Rahotu, an hour’s drive south of New Plymouth. Eldest brother Kane was pretty talented, too, just breaking through with the Blues when concussions brought a premature close to his career in 2014. Beauden was first to break through, barely out of his teens when making a first Super Rugby appearance and only 21 when helping the All Blacks to a record win over Ireland on international debut. His role as the bench impact back was crucial to the 2015 World Cup win, while two World Rugby Men’s Player of the Year awards followed in 2016 and 2017 after stepping up to be Dan Carter’s fly half successor. Of late, he has embraced his reinvention as an almost full-time full-back at international level – he has been outstanding throughout this World Cup, described as the “glue” in New Zealand’s side by head coach Ian Foster. He may lack the acceleration of his youth but there are few smarter backfield brains at this tournament. An impending deal with Toyota Verblitz will see Beauden move to Japan for at least a season, with the 32-year-old weighing up whether to extend his stay or return to New Zealand to try to make a fourth World Cup. This could yet be his last All Blacks hurrah. To do it alongside his brothers will fill Beauden with immense pride. That either could have a claim to be the best player in the family will, too. Lock Scott has come on leaps and bounds since the last tournament, forcing apart long-time second row partners Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock after producing a series of unignorable performances. If his sending off in the final warm-up against the Springboks shows he still has the occasional rough edge, Scott has become one of New Zealand’s most consistent performers . Jordie Barrett is probably the most talented of the Barrett bunch, possessing a blend of Scott’s size and Beauden’s brilliance. After starting his professional career primarily at full-back, his development as a top-class international inside centre - or second five-eight, as the Kiwis call it – has solved a problem spot for the All Blacks. His ability to offer real carrying threat and add playmaking options as a second distributor makes him a vital figure on attack, while he has come on defensively, too. Jordie is leading New Zealand’s set-piece defence at this tournament, and made 17 tackles in a player of the match performance in the semi-final against Argentina. “He was massive in defence, he attempted the most tackles,” defence coach Scott McLeod said of Jordie’s performance. “But the most pleasing thing for me was he actually applied pressure. “He saw the pictures a lot earlier, he backed himself to go and do it and those around him supported that and he made quite a difference for us.\" If New Zealand are to beat South Africa on Saturday, you somehow feel at least one of the three will be key. Beauden, of course, already has one World Cup winners’ medal, his late breakaway try putting the seal on back-to-back All Blacks’ triumphs in 2015. Come Saturday night, the Barrett mantlepiece could be gilded again, three more medals a fitting decoration for a remarkable sporting family.","pubDate":"2023-10-28 20:33:59","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/10/24/11/newFile-5.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","source_priority":290,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"27b686f0a5eaf5f17faf0291a5a25973","title":"India vs England, Cricket World Cup 2023: Key Player Battles","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/india-vs-england-cricket-world-cup-2023-key-player-battles-4523187","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs England, Cricket World Cup 2023: The key battles from the Cricket World Cup 2023 match between India and England.","content":"Two-time ODI World Cup winners India take on England, the reigning champions, in the 29th match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 on October 29 at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow. Led by Rohit Sharma, India have won all their five matches in the tournament so far. The Indian team beat New Zealand by four wickets in their latest encounter in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. Virat Kohli's 95 and Mohammed Shami's 5/54 headlined the team's commanding performance against 2019 World Cup runners-up New Zealand. India, earlier in the tournament, defeated Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Australia - all in run chases. England, on the other hand, have had a poor start to their title defence with four defeats in five matches. Their only win was a 137-run success against Bangladesh while they have lost to New Zealand, Afghanistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka. The English side, however, has the upper hand against India in ICC Cricket World Cup history. England have won four and tied one of the eight matches in this fixture. India, though, lead 57-44 in overall ODI wins in this fixture. Here are the key player battles to watch out for in the India vs England ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 match: Rohit Sharma vs Mark Wood Rohit Sharma is India's second-highest run-getter in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 with 311 runs in five matches. He boasts a strike-rate of 133.47 in the tournament, smashing 33 fours and 17 sixes so far, while averaging 62.20. Rohit will be key in neutralizing the new ball threat of England's firey pacer Mark Wood. Rohit has scored 73 runs in 86 balls against Mark Wood in ODI cricket, hitting 12 fours and a six. Wood, meanwhile, has dismissed the Indian captain only once. Virat Kohli vs Adil Rashid India's leading run-scorer in this tournament is Virat Kohli with 354 runs in five matches. He slammed a century against Bangladesh while scoring fifties against Australia, Afghanistan and New Zealand. Adil Rashid, on the other hand, is England's second-highest wicket-taker this edition with six wickets. In spin-friendly conditions at Lucknow, Rashid will be a handful for the Indian batters in the middle overs. Advertisement Virat Kohli and Adil Rashid have squared off in eight ODI innings. Kohli has scored 108 runs at a strike-rate of 93.10, including seven fours and a six. Rashid, meanwhile, has dismissed Kohli thrice with an average of 36.00. KL Rahul vs Moeen Ali Another key matchup in the middle overs of the Indian innings would be KL Rahul against Moeen Ali. KL Rahul has been impressive throughout the World Cup 2023, scoring 177 runs in four innings, remaining unbeaten thrice, headlined by the match-winning 97 against Australia. He has notched 708 runs in 18 ODIs in 2023, smashing five half-centuries and one ton. The BRSABV Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow is also where KL Rahul plays franchise T20 cricket, wherein he averages 46.25 with the bat. Moeen Ali hasn't enjoyed a successful campaign this edition. However, he has picked up nine wickets and bowled at an economy rate of 5.13 against India in this format. Meanwhile, KL Rahul has scored 32 runs in 46 balls against Moeen Ali in ODI cricket. Although the Indian batter hasn't been free-scoring against the English off-spinner, Moeen is yet to dismiss Rahul in this format. Jonny Bairstow vs Jasprit Bumrah England opener Jonny Bairstow will be responsible for providing his team a flying start against unbeaten India in the ICC World Cup 2023 encounter. Bairstow has amassed 127 runs in five matches at a strike-rate of 90.07 so far in this tournament. Bairstow will go up against India's Jasprit Bumrah early on in the innings. Bumrah, meanwhile, is India's leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 11 dismissals. He has also maintained a commendable economy rate of 3.80, despite bowling in the first powerplay and death overs. Jasprit Bumrah has dismissed Jonny Bairstow once in 44 balls in ODI cricket. Bairstow, on the other hand, has accumulated only 22 runs at a strike-rate of 50.00 in this head-to-head, 12 of which are in boundaries. Bumrah has bowled 33 dot balls against Bairstow in this format, gaining the upper hand ahead of the clash in Lucknow. Joe Root vs Ravichandran Ashwin England's batters, barring the win against Bangladesh, have failed to notch big scores. On spin-friendly conditions in Lucknow, it will be another uphill battle for the Three Lions. Joe Root, one of England's best batters against spin, will be key in this clash. He has averaged 35.00 in this World Cup, slamming two half-centuries - versus New Zealand and Bangladesh. Root has scored 739 runs in 21 ODIs against India, including three centuries. India are expected to play Ravichandran Ashwin against England on Sunday. The off-spinner has scalped 35 wickets in 23 ODIs against the Three Lions at an average of 28.00, making him a fruitful option for Rohit Sharma and Co. at Lucknow. Joe Root, however, has a slight upper hand against Ravichandran Ashwin in ODI cricket. Root has scored 97 runs in 134 balls, striking at 72.38, smashing six fours and a six. Ashwin, meanwhile, has dismissed him twice and bowled 69 dot balls. An average of 48.50, although, gives the Englishman an advantage.","pubDate":"2023-10-28 18:26:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c5e6bb438ca50d5fef236db86424f96d","title":"ODI World Cup: David Warner Overtakes Virat Kohli For Massive Feat","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/odi-world-cup-david-warner-overtakes-virat-kohli-for-massive-feat-4523033","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australian opener David Warner on Saturday overtook India's Virat Kohli to become the fourth-highest run-scorer in ICC World Cup history.","content":"Australian opener David Warner on Saturday overtook India's Virat Kohli to become the fourth-highest run-scorer in ICC World Cup history.

His teammates on-rushed, among them the beaming Paul van Meekeren, the four-wicket hero, and it was soon a pile of orange shirts celebrating madly in the vast stadium, near deserted, as the distraught Bangladesh fans had long filed out of the stadium. They had turned up in numbers, waving their puffed tiger dolls and wearing their passion on their sleeve. With an overwhelming majority of the crowd behind them, it was as though Bangladesh were playing in Mirpur of Chattogram.

You can also find the latest stats , like the top scorer and the highest wicket-taker of the current edition, upcoming World Cup fixtures and the points table on the site. A typically energetic crowd of 15,000 roared every wicket they took and every boundary they scored, in their pursuit of 230 runs. But they watched in utter horror the Dutch scythe through their batting. They did to Bangladesh what Bangladesh used to in the past, when they scalped big teams. No longer though. In the first place, Bangladesh let the Dutch soar to 229 after they were teetering on 107 for 5. But Scott Edwards put in another remarkable batting effort to power them to a competitive total on a surface that aided spinners as the day wore on. Still, Bangladesh fans nursed no fears of an upset and were cheerful in the stands. But drowning out the noise, Netherlands struck early to have them reeling at 15 for three. The thrifty Aryan Dutt consumed the under-firing Litton Das before Logan van Beek nailed Tanzid Hasan. The familiar van Meekeren struck the two vital blows, those of Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan. The former was lured into a wild waft outside the off-stump while the effort bowl that generated extra bounce accounted to Hasan. His attempt to play that was lazy too.

It only got worse from here, as Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mushfiqur too perished in no time. Suddenly, Bangladesh were reeling at 70/6. The Dutch were now beginning to sense hope and increased their intensity on the field, piling dot balls and ratcheting up the pressure. Mahedi Hasan and Mahmudullah, though, somehow took them past 100 before a direct throw from de Leede ended Hasan’s outings. And when de Leede nailed Mahmudullah, with the score 113 for 8, Bangladesh could feel the ground beneath them crack. Though they lower-order hung around, it was a matter of time before the defeat was confirmed. Advertisement Homegrown hero Van Meekeren is one of the few home-grown players in the Dutch team. But sustaining his passion in the game was not easy. The pandemic time was tough. He should have been playing the T20 World Cup for Netherlands in November, 2020. Instead, he was delivering UberEats to pay his bills. He was released by Somerset too. Initially he was not part of Netherlands’ squad for the ODI World Cup Qualifiers due to his county commitments but was later released by his current club Gloucester. Tonight, that decision paid rich dividends.

The partner Max O Dowd (0) would also follow him shortly after nicking off Shoriful Islam in the next over. The Dutch’s nightmare start in the powerplay continued. Skipper Scott Edwards had said before the match that they would look to rectify the mistakes when it came to their top order. Unfortunately, as of Saturday, the issue still persisted. Wesley Barresi, the 37-year-old South Africa-born batsman—better remembered for a comment on Virat Kohli that “we’ll never see or hear from you again”, when the Indian was dismissed in the 2011 World Cup—steered the Dutch ship clear of relative danger before being dismissed for 41.

87 धावांनी धुव्वा उडवून, विश्वचषकाच्या साखळीत दुसरा ऐतिहासिक विजय साजरा केला. या विश्वचषकात नेदरलँड्सनं बलाढ्य दक्षिण आफ्रिकेचा 38 धावांनी पराभव केला होता. त्याच नेदरलँड्सनं शकिब अल हसनच्या आता

16 चेंडूत 15 धावांचे योगदान दिले. मेहदी हसन मिराज यालाही मोठी खेळी करता आली नाही. चांगल्या सुरुवातीनंतर तो 35 धावांवर बाद जाला. नेदरलँड्सच्या संघाने बांगलादेशच्या संघाला कधीच वरचढ होऊ दिले नाही. ठरावीक अंतराने बांगलादेशच्या फलंदाजांना तंबूत धाडले. कर्णधार शाकीब अल हसन याला फक्त पाच धावाच करता आल्या. मुशफिकुर रहीम फक्त एक धाव काढून बाद झाला. मेहदी हसन यालाही फक्त 17 धावांचे योगदान देता आले.

Try to save face in a World Cup that has already passed them by, or use the game as the starting point for the 2027 tournament in southern Africa? With qualification for the semi-finals now dependent on a fantastical sequence of results, the braver call would be to look beyond the debacle of the last few weeks, and blood the 20-somethings who are likely to be around in four years’ time. The two scenarios need not even be mutally exclusive. Against Sri Lanka in Bangalore, where England suffered arguably the worst of their four defeats in this tournament, their entire XI was the wrong side of 30 - a first for an ODI team. Now, they must refresh the side with the members of their 15 who have the hunger to perform - and a loss of hunger among the squad’s double world champions remains as plausible an explanation as any for England’s disappearance over the cliff. That ought to mean a recall for Harry Brook, who was unfortunate to be dropped against Sri Lanka after showing pluck against Afghanistan’s spinners. Equally, Surrey quick Gus Atkinson deserves another go, having escaped relatively unscathed from the mauling by South Africa . Harry Brook was unfortunate to be dropped against Sri Lanka and should come back into side Gus Atkinson (centre) is another newcomer who escaped relatively unscathed during contest Brydon Carse was called up to replace Reece Topley and should get the chance against India Then there’s Brydon Carse, the Durham fast bowler who has replaced the injured Reece Topley, and has designs on becoming the middle-overs seamer England have so badly lacked since ditching Liam Plunkett after the 2019 World Cup. All three are in their twenties, and all will benefit from playing in front of a crowd that could reach 50,000 - no matter the result. One thing is for sure: we are yet to hear a coherent diagnosis of England’s plight from inside the camp, with assistant coach Marcus Trescothick the latest to express bewilderment. Asked if the players were confused by their struggles, he replied: ‘I think they’re trying to understand it, yeah. Whether confusion is the right word, I’m not sure. But it’s not gone - it’s just hiding in a funny place at the moment. Marcus Trescothick is among the England coaches to be as confused as the side's followers ‘We’re all feeling the heat, but what can you do? We’ve prepared the same. Every practice we go through, we’re coming out the other side thinking we’re in a good place. It’s just not quite worked when we go into the games.’ India, the tournament’s only unbeaten side, are unlikely to give them much breathing space, although the home fans are keen to see their heroes bat first after five successful chases. Even during the dark days of the 2015 World Cup, a tournament which persuaded Eoin Morgan to reset England’s entire white-ball strategy, they never lost four in a row. That is the fate that threatens them on Sunday. In a city famous for its kebabs, England could be in for a skewering. But if they pick a forward-looking team, it need not be in vain. The team England should pick 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Dawid Malan, 3 Joe Root, 4 Ben Stokes, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Jos Buttler (capt, wkt), 7 Liam Livingstone, 8 Brydon Carse, 9 Gus Atkinson, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Mark Wood India Cricket England Cricket South Africa Rugby Share or comment on this article: LAWRENCE BOOTH: With semi-final qualification near-impossible, England should be brave and blood future talents against champions-elect India e-mail Add comment Comments 2 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

By that stage, sons Beauden, Scott and Jordie had already been born, and how they’ve lived up to their father’s assertion. On Saturday night, they will become the first trio of brothers to appear in a Rugby World Cup final, all close to certain starters for the All Blacks ahead of a meeting with South Africa . There are many tales of successful sporting siblings, from the Williams sisters to the Kelce brothers; the Waughs or the Charltons . But for three brothers to be so integral to a potential World Cup win is special. Smart international rugby coaches build their side around a spine of players from a single club; Ian Foster has been able to build his All Blacks around a single family. Their rise to the top is a story of both nature and nurture. Smiley was a legend of Taranaki rugby, capped almost 200 times by the Bulls in the back five in the pack, while mother Robyn was a talented basketball and netball player. Growing up, the brothers would hone their skills on a patch of land in their sprawling backyard that they called the BCG – the Barrett Cricket Ground – with Smiley intent on making sure all of his sons had the skillset to play an all-court game. “As youngsters playing in back yard, we only dreamed of being here,” Beauden Barrett explained earlier in the tournament. “’Mum was a pretty talented athlete herself. They all say our speed came from Mum and I guess the size and work rate from Dad. “There was always work to be done. So we always saw Mum and Dad doing that, coming home cooking us dinner, getting us ready for school. So if you relate that to your rugby it’s about striving to be better, to be the best you can be.\" By their teenage years, the trio could pass off both hands and kick with both feet, making them most of the space on the family dairy farm in Rahotu, an hour’s drive south of New Plymouth. Eldest brother Kane was pretty talented, too, just breaking through with the Blues when concussions brought a premature close to his career in 2014. Beauden was first to break through, barely out of his teens when making a first Super Rugby appearance and only 21 when helping the All Blacks to a record win over Ireland on international debut. His role as the bench impact back was crucial to the 2015 World Cup win, while two World Rugby Men’s Player of the Year awards followed in 2016 and 2017 after stepping up to be Dan Carter’s fly half successor. Of late, he has embraced his reinvention as an almost full-time full-back at international level – he has been outstanding throughout this World Cup, described as the “glue” in New Zealand’s side by head coach Ian Foster. He may lack the acceleration of his youth but there are few smarter backfield brains at this tournament. An impending deal with Toyota Verblitz will see Beauden move to Japan for at least a season, with the 32-year-old weighing up whether to extend his stay or return to New Zealand to try to make a fourth World Cup. This could yet be his last All Blacks hurrah. To do it alongside his brothers will fill Beauden with immense pride. That either could have a claim to be the best player in the family will, too. Lock Scott has come on leaps and bounds since the last tournament, forcing apart long-time second row partners Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock after producing a series of unignorable performances. If his sending off in the final warm-up against the Springboks shows he still has the occasional rough edge, Scott has become one of New Zealand’s most consistent performers . Jordie Barrett is probably the most talented of the Barrett bunch, possessing a blend of Scott’s size and Beauden’s brilliance. After starting his professional career primarily at full-back, his development as a top-class international inside centre - or second five-eight, as the Kiwis call it – has solved a problem spot for the All Blacks. His ability to offer real carrying threat and add playmaking options as a second distributor makes him a vital figure on attack, while he has come on defensively, too. Jordie is leading New Zealand’s set-piece defence at this tournament, and made 17 tackles in a player of the match performance in the semi-final against Argentina. “He was massive in defence, he attempted the most tackles,” defence coach Scott McLeod said of Jordie’s performance. “But the most pleasing thing for me was he actually applied pressure. “He saw the pictures a lot earlier, he backed himself to go and do it and those around him supported that and he made quite a difference for us.\" If New Zealand are to beat South Africa on Saturday, you somehow feel at least one of the three will be key. Beauden, of course, already has one World Cup winners’ medal, his late breakaway try putting the seal on back-to-back All Blacks’ triumphs in 2015. Come Saturday night, the Barrett mantlepiece could be gilded again, three more medals a fitting decoration for a remarkable sporting family.","pubDate":"2023-10-28 20:33:59","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/10/24/11/newFile-5.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","source_priority":290,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"27b686f0a5eaf5f17faf0291a5a25973","title":"India vs England, Cricket World Cup 2023: Key Player Battles","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/india-vs-england-cricket-world-cup-2023-key-player-battles-4523187","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs England, Cricket World Cup 2023: The key battles from the Cricket World Cup 2023 match between India and England.","content":"Two-time ODI World Cup winners India take on England, the reigning champions, in the 29th match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 on October 29 at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow. Led by Rohit Sharma, India have won all their five matches in the tournament so far. The Indian team beat New Zealand by four wickets in their latest encounter in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. Virat Kohli's 95 and Mohammed Shami's 5/54 headlined the team's commanding performance against 2019 World Cup runners-up New Zealand. India, earlier in the tournament, defeated Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Australia - all in run chases. England, on the other hand, have had a poor start to their title defence with four defeats in five matches. Their only win was a 137-run success against Bangladesh while they have lost to New Zealand, Afghanistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka. The English side, however, has the upper hand against India in ICC Cricket World Cup history. England have won four and tied one of the eight matches in this fixture. India, though, lead 57-44 in overall ODI wins in this fixture. Here are the key player battles to watch out for in the India vs England ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 match: Rohit Sharma vs Mark Wood Rohit Sharma is India's second-highest run-getter in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 with 311 runs in five matches. He boasts a strike-rate of 133.47 in the tournament, smashing 33 fours and 17 sixes so far, while averaging 62.20. Rohit will be key in neutralizing the new ball threat of England's firey pacer Mark Wood. Rohit has scored 73 runs in 86 balls against Mark Wood in ODI cricket, hitting 12 fours and a six. Wood, meanwhile, has dismissed the Indian captain only once. Virat Kohli vs Adil Rashid India's leading run-scorer in this tournament is Virat Kohli with 354 runs in five matches. He slammed a century against Bangladesh while scoring fifties against Australia, Afghanistan and New Zealand. Adil Rashid, on the other hand, is England's second-highest wicket-taker this edition with six wickets. In spin-friendly conditions at Lucknow, Rashid will be a handful for the Indian batters in the middle overs. Advertisement Virat Kohli and Adil Rashid have squared off in eight ODI innings. Kohli has scored 108 runs at a strike-rate of 93.10, including seven fours and a six. Rashid, meanwhile, has dismissed Kohli thrice with an average of 36.00. KL Rahul vs Moeen Ali Another key matchup in the middle overs of the Indian innings would be KL Rahul against Moeen Ali. KL Rahul has been impressive throughout the World Cup 2023, scoring 177 runs in four innings, remaining unbeaten thrice, headlined by the match-winning 97 against Australia. He has notched 708 runs in 18 ODIs in 2023, smashing five half-centuries and one ton. The BRSABV Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow is also where KL Rahul plays franchise T20 cricket, wherein he averages 46.25 with the bat. Moeen Ali hasn't enjoyed a successful campaign this edition. However, he has picked up nine wickets and bowled at an economy rate of 5.13 against India in this format. Meanwhile, KL Rahul has scored 32 runs in 46 balls against Moeen Ali in ODI cricket. Although the Indian batter hasn't been free-scoring against the English off-spinner, Moeen is yet to dismiss Rahul in this format. Jonny Bairstow vs Jasprit Bumrah England opener Jonny Bairstow will be responsible for providing his team a flying start against unbeaten India in the ICC World Cup 2023 encounter. Bairstow has amassed 127 runs in five matches at a strike-rate of 90.07 so far in this tournament. Bairstow will go up against India's Jasprit Bumrah early on in the innings. Bumrah, meanwhile, is India's leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 11 dismissals. He has also maintained a commendable economy rate of 3.80, despite bowling in the first powerplay and death overs. Jasprit Bumrah has dismissed Jonny Bairstow once in 44 balls in ODI cricket. Bairstow, on the other hand, has accumulated only 22 runs at a strike-rate of 50.00 in this head-to-head, 12 of which are in boundaries. Bumrah has bowled 33 dot balls against Bairstow in this format, gaining the upper hand ahead of the clash in Lucknow. Joe Root vs Ravichandran Ashwin England's batters, barring the win against Bangladesh, have failed to notch big scores. On spin-friendly conditions in Lucknow, it will be another uphill battle for the Three Lions. Joe Root, one of England's best batters against spin, will be key in this clash. He has averaged 35.00 in this World Cup, slamming two half-centuries - versus New Zealand and Bangladesh. Root has scored 739 runs in 21 ODIs against India, including three centuries. India are expected to play Ravichandran Ashwin against England on Sunday. The off-spinner has scalped 35 wickets in 23 ODIs against the Three Lions at an average of 28.00, making him a fruitful option for Rohit Sharma and Co. at Lucknow. Joe Root, however, has a slight upper hand against Ravichandran Ashwin in ODI cricket. Root has scored 97 runs in 134 balls, striking at 72.38, smashing six fours and a six. Ashwin, meanwhile, has dismissed him twice and bowled 69 dot balls. An average of 48.50, although, gives the Englishman an advantage.","pubDate":"2023-10-28 18:26:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c5e6bb438ca50d5fef236db86424f96d","title":"ODI World Cup: David Warner Overtakes Virat Kohli For Massive Feat","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/odi-world-cup-david-warner-overtakes-virat-kohli-for-massive-feat-4523033","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australian opener David Warner on Saturday overtook India's Virat Kohli to become the fourth-highest run-scorer in ICC World Cup history.","content":"Australian opener David Warner on Saturday overtook India's Virat Kohli to become the fourth-highest run-scorer in ICC World Cup history.

His teammates on-rushed, among them the beaming Paul van Meekeren, the four-wicket hero, and it was soon a pile of orange shirts celebrating madly in the vast stadium, near deserted, as the distraught Bangladesh fans had long filed out of the stadium. They had turned up in numbers, waving their puffed tiger dolls and wearing their passion on their sleeve. With an overwhelming majority of the crowd behind them, it was as though Bangladesh were playing in Mirpur of Chattogram. Follow all the action from the Cricket World Cup 2023 on our special World Cup section. You can also find the latest stats , like the top scorer and the highest wicket-taker of the current edition, upcoming World Cup fixtures and the points table on the site. A typically energetic crowd of 15,000 roared every wicket they took and every boundary they scored, in their pursuit of 230 runs. But they watched in utter horror the Dutch scythe through their batting. They did to Bangladesh what Bangladesh used to in the past, when they scalped big teams. No longer though. In the first place, Bangladesh let the Dutch soar to 229 after they were teetering on 107 for 5. But Scott Edwards put in another remarkable batting effort to power them to a competitive total on a surface that aided spinners as the day wore on. Still, Bangladesh fans nursed no fears of an upset and were cheerful in the stands. But drowning out the noise, Netherlands struck early to have them reeling at 15 for three. The thrifty Aryan Dutt consumed the under-firing Litton Das before Logan van Beek nailed Tanzid Hasan. The familiar van Meekeren struck the two vital blows, those of Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan. The former was lured into a wild waft outside the off-stump while the effort bowl that generated extra bounce accounted to Hasan. His attempt to play that was lazy too.

It only got worse from here, as Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mushfiqur too perished in no time. Suddenly, Bangladesh were reeling at 70/6. The Dutch were now beginning to sense hope and increased their intensity on the field, piling dot balls and ratcheting up the pressure. Mahedi Hasan and Mahmudullah, though, somehow took them past 100 before a direct throw from de Leede ended Hasan’s outings. And when de Leede nailed Mahmudullah, with the score 113 for 8, Bangladesh could feel the ground beneath them crack. Though they lower-order hung around, it was a matter of time before the defeat was confirmed. Advertisement Homegrown hero Van Meekeren is one of the few home-grown players in the Dutch team. But sustaining his passion in the game was not easy. The pandemic time was tough. He should have been playing the T20 World Cup for Netherlands in November, 2020. Instead, he was delivering UberEats to pay his bills. He was released by Somerset too. Initially he was not part of Netherlands’ squad for the ODI World Cup Qualifiers due to his county commitments but was later released by his current club Gloucester. Tonight, that decision paid rich dividends.

(Express photo by Partha Paul) Another familiar figure was their batting hero, Edwards. After electing to bat, Netherlands were reeling at 4-2, courtesy of Taskin Ahmed, who was returning from an injury layoff, when he drew first blood for Bangladesh in the second over when he snapped up Vikramjit Singh (3). The partner Max O Dowd (0) would also follow him shortly after nicking off Shoriful Islam in the next over. The Dutch’s nightmare start in the powerplay continued. Skipper Scott Edwards had said before the match that they would look to rectify the mistakes when it came to their top order. Unfortunately, as of Saturday, the issue still persisted. Wesley Barresi, the 37-year-old South Africa-born batsman—better remembered for a comment on Virat Kohli that “we’ll never see or hear from you again”, when the Indian was dismissed in the 2011 World Cup—steered the Dutch ship clear of relative danger before being dismissed for 41. In the space of adding 44 runs, they lost three more wickets. But enter the man for crisis. Edwards. Making full use to two reprieves, he led the rebuild, before Logan van Beek’s late charge took them to a competitive total, that would prove more than handy in the end Also Read How much 50 over cricket domestically has Virat Kohli played: Nasser Huss...

Try to save face in a World Cup that has already passed them by, or use the game as the starting point for the 2027 tournament in southern Africa? With qualification for the semi-finals now dependent on a fantastical sequence of results, the braver call would be to look beyond the debacle of the last few weeks, and blood the 20-somethings who are likely to be around in four years’ time. The two scenarios need not even be mutally exclusive. Against Sri Lanka in Bangalore, where England suffered arguably the worst of their four defeats in this tournament, their entire XI was the wrong side of 30 - a first for an ODI team. Now, they must refresh the side with the members of their 15 who have the hunger to perform - and a loss of hunger among the squad’s double world champions remains as plausible an explanation as any for England’s disappearance over the cliff. That ought to mean a recall for Harry Brook, who was unfortunate to be dropped against Sri Lanka after showing pluck against Afghanistan’s spinners. Equally, Surrey quick Gus Atkinson deserves another go, having escaped relatively unscathed from the mauling by South Africa . Harry Brook was unfortunate to be dropped against Sri Lanka and should come back into side Gus Atkinson (centre) is another newcomer who escaped relatively unscathed during contest Brydon Carse was called up to replace Reece Topley and should get the chance against India Then there’s Brydon Carse, the Durham fast bowler who has replaced the injured Reece Topley, and has designs on becoming the middle-overs seamer England have so badly lacked since ditching Liam Plunkett after the 2019 World Cup. All three are in their twenties, and all will benefit from playing in front of a crowd that could reach 50,000 - no matter the result. One thing is for sure: we are yet to hear a coherent diagnosis of England’s plight from inside the camp, with assistant coach Marcus Trescothick the latest to express bewilderment. Asked if the players were confused by their struggles, he replied: ‘I think they’re trying to understand it, yeah. Whether confusion is the right word, I’m not sure. But it’s not gone - it’s just hiding in a funny place at the moment. Marcus Trescothick is among the England coaches to be as confused as the side's followers ‘We’re all feeling the heat, but what can you do? We’ve prepared the same. Every practice we go through, we’re coming out the other side thinking we’re in a good place. It’s just not quite worked when we go into the games.’ India, the tournament’s only unbeaten side, are unlikely to give them much breathing space, although the home fans are keen to see their heroes bat first after five successful chases. Even during the dark days of the 2015 World Cup, a tournament which persuaded Eoin Morgan to reset England’s entire white-ball strategy, they never lost four in a row. That is the fate that threatens them on Sunday. In a city famous for its kebabs, England could be in for a skewering. But if they pick a forward-looking team, it need not be in vain. The team England should pick 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Dawid Malan, 3 Joe Root, 4 Ben Stokes, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Jos Buttler (capt, wkt), 7 Liam Livingstone, 8 Brydon Carse, 9 Gus Atkinson, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Mark Wood India Cricket England Cricket South Africa Rugby Share or comment on this article: LAWRENCE BOOTH: With semi-final qualification near-impossible, England should be brave and blood future talents against champions-elect India e-mail Add comment Comments 2 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

By that stage, sons Beauden, Scott and Jordie had already been born, and how they’ve lived up to their father’s assertion. On Saturday night, they will become the first trio of brothers to appear in a Rugby World Cup final, all close to certain starters for the All Blacks ahead of a meeting with South Africa . There are many tales of successful sporting siblings, from the Williams sisters to the Kelce brothers; the Waughs or the Charltons . But for three brothers to be so integral to a potential World Cup win is special. Smart international rugby coaches build their side around a spine of players from a single club; Ian Foster has been able to build his All Blacks around a single family. Their rise to the top is a story of both nature and nurture. Smiley was a legend of Taranaki rugby, capped almost 200 times by the Bulls in the back five in the pack, while mother Robyn was a talented basketball and netball player. Growing up, the brothers would hone their skills on a patch of land in their sprawling backyard that they called the BCG – the Barrett Cricket Ground – with Smiley intent on making sure all of his sons had the skillset to play an all-court game. “As youngsters playing in back yard, we only dreamed of being here,” Beauden Barrett explained earlier in the tournament. “’Mum was a pretty talented athlete herself. They all say our speed came from Mum and I guess the size and work rate from Dad. “There was always work to be done. So we always saw Mum and Dad doing that, coming home cooking us dinner, getting us ready for school. So if you relate that to your rugby it’s about striving to be better, to be the best you can be.\" By their teenage years, the trio could pass off both hands and kick with both feet, making them most of the space on the family dairy farm in Rahotu, an hour’s drive south of New Plymouth. Eldest brother Kane was pretty talented, too, just breaking through with the Blues when concussions brought a premature close to his career in 2014. Beauden was first to break through, barely out of his teens when making a first Super Rugby appearance and only 21 when helping the All Blacks to a record win over Ireland on international debut. His role as the bench impact back was crucial to the 2015 World Cup win, while two World Rugby Men’s Player of the Year awards followed in 2016 and 2017 after stepping up to be Dan Carter’s fly half successor. Of late, he has embraced his reinvention as an almost full-time full-back at international level – he has been outstanding throughout this World Cup, described as the “glue” in New Zealand’s side by head coach Ian Foster. He may lack the acceleration of his youth but there are few smarter backfield brains at this tournament. An impending deal with Toyota Verblitz will see Beauden move to Japan for at least a season, with the 32-year-old weighing up whether to extend his stay or return to New Zealand to try to make a fourth World Cup. This could yet be his last All Blacks hurrah. To do it alongside his brothers will fill Beauden with immense pride. That either could have a claim to be the best player in the family will, too. Lock Scott has come on leaps and bounds since the last tournament, forcing apart long-time second row partners Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock after producing a series of unignorable performances. If his sending off in the final warm-up against the Springboks shows he still has the occasional rough edge, Scott has become one of New Zealand’s most consistent performers . Jordie Barrett is probably the most talented of the Barrett bunch, possessing a blend of Scott’s size and Beauden’s brilliance. After starting his professional career primarily at full-back, his development as a top-class international inside centre - or second five-eight, as the Kiwis call it – has solved a problem spot for the All Blacks. His ability to offer real carrying threat and add playmaking options as a second distributor makes him a vital figure on attack, while he has come on defensively, too. Jordie is leading New Zealand’s set-piece defence at this tournament, and made 17 tackles in a player of the match performance in the semi-final against Argentina. “He was massive in defence, he attempted the most tackles,” defence coach Scott McLeod said of Jordie’s performance. “But the most pleasing thing for me was he actually applied pressure. “He saw the pictures a lot earlier, he backed himself to go and do it and those around him supported that and he made quite a difference for us.\" If New Zealand are to beat South Africa on Saturday, you somehow feel at least one of the three will be key. Beauden, of course, already has one World Cup winners’ medal, his late breakaway try putting the seal on back-to-back All Blacks’ triumphs in 2015. Come Saturday night, the Barrett mantlepiece could be gilded again, three more medals a fitting decoration for a remarkable sporting family.","pubDate":"2023-10-28 20:33:59","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/10/24/11/newFile-5.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","source_priority":290,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"27b686f0a5eaf5f17faf0291a5a25973","title":"India vs England, Cricket World Cup 2023: Key Player Battles","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/india-vs-england-cricket-world-cup-2023-key-player-battles-4523187","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs England, Cricket World Cup 2023: The key battles from the Cricket World Cup 2023 match between India and England.","content":"Two-time ODI World Cup winners India take on England, the reigning champions, in the 29th match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 on October 29 at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow. Led by Rohit Sharma, India have won all their five matches in the tournament so far. The Indian team beat New Zealand by four wickets in their latest encounter in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. Virat Kohli's 95 and Mohammed Shami's 5/54 headlined the team's commanding performance against 2019 World Cup runners-up New Zealand. India, earlier in the tournament, defeated Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Australia - all in run chases. England, on the other hand, have had a poor start to their title defence with four defeats in five matches. Their only win was a 137-run success against Bangladesh while they have lost to New Zealand, Afghanistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka. The English side, however, has the upper hand against India in ICC Cricket World Cup history. England have won four and tied one of the eight matches in this fixture. India, though, lead 57-44 in overall ODI wins in this fixture. Here are the key player battles to watch out for in the India vs England ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 match: Rohit Sharma vs Mark Wood Rohit Sharma is India's second-highest run-getter in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 with 311 runs in five matches. He boasts a strike-rate of 133.47 in the tournament, smashing 33 fours and 17 sixes so far, while averaging 62.20. Rohit will be key in neutralizing the new ball threat of England's firey pacer Mark Wood. Rohit has scored 73 runs in 86 balls against Mark Wood in ODI cricket, hitting 12 fours and a six. Wood, meanwhile, has dismissed the Indian captain only once. Virat Kohli vs Adil Rashid India's leading run-scorer in this tournament is Virat Kohli with 354 runs in five matches. He slammed a century against Bangladesh while scoring fifties against Australia, Afghanistan and New Zealand. Adil Rashid, on the other hand, is England's second-highest wicket-taker this edition with six wickets. In spin-friendly conditions at Lucknow, Rashid will be a handful for the Indian batters in the middle overs. Advertisement Virat Kohli and Adil Rashid have squared off in eight ODI innings. Kohli has scored 108 runs at a strike-rate of 93.10, including seven fours and a six. Rashid, meanwhile, has dismissed Kohli thrice with an average of 36.00. KL Rahul vs Moeen Ali Another key matchup in the middle overs of the Indian innings would be KL Rahul against Moeen Ali. KL Rahul has been impressive throughout the World Cup 2023, scoring 177 runs in four innings, remaining unbeaten thrice, headlined by the match-winning 97 against Australia. He has notched 708 runs in 18 ODIs in 2023, smashing five half-centuries and one ton. The BRSABV Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow is also where KL Rahul plays franchise T20 cricket, wherein he averages 46.25 with the bat. Moeen Ali hasn't enjoyed a successful campaign this edition. However, he has picked up nine wickets and bowled at an economy rate of 5.13 against India in this format. Meanwhile, KL Rahul has scored 32 runs in 46 balls against Moeen Ali in ODI cricket. Although the Indian batter hasn't been free-scoring against the English off-spinner, Moeen is yet to dismiss Rahul in this format. Jonny Bairstow vs Jasprit Bumrah England opener Jonny Bairstow will be responsible for providing his team a flying start against unbeaten India in the ICC World Cup 2023 encounter. Bairstow has amassed 127 runs in five matches at a strike-rate of 90.07 so far in this tournament. Bairstow will go up against India's Jasprit Bumrah early on in the innings. Bumrah, meanwhile, is India's leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 11 dismissals. He has also maintained a commendable economy rate of 3.80, despite bowling in the first powerplay and death overs. Jasprit Bumrah has dismissed Jonny Bairstow once in 44 balls in ODI cricket. Bairstow, on the other hand, has accumulated only 22 runs at a strike-rate of 50.00 in this head-to-head, 12 of which are in boundaries. Bumrah has bowled 33 dot balls against Bairstow in this format, gaining the upper hand ahead of the clash in Lucknow. Joe Root vs Ravichandran Ashwin England's batters, barring the win against Bangladesh, have failed to notch big scores. On spin-friendly conditions in Lucknow, it will be another uphill battle for the Three Lions. Joe Root, one of England's best batters against spin, will be key in this clash. He has averaged 35.00 in this World Cup, slamming two half-centuries - versus New Zealand and Bangladesh. Root has scored 739 runs in 21 ODIs against India, including three centuries. India are expected to play Ravichandran Ashwin against England on Sunday. The off-spinner has scalped 35 wickets in 23 ODIs against the Three Lions at an average of 28.00, making him a fruitful option for Rohit Sharma and Co. at Lucknow. Joe Root, however, has a slight upper hand against Ravichandran Ashwin in ODI cricket. Root has scored 97 runs in 134 balls, striking at 72.38, smashing six fours and a six. Ashwin, meanwhile, has dismissed him twice and bowled 69 dot balls. An average of 48.50, although, gives the Englishman an advantage.","pubDate":"2023-10-28 18:26:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c5e6bb438ca50d5fef236db86424f96d","title":"ODI World Cup: David Warner Overtakes Virat Kohli For Massive Feat","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/odi-world-cup-david-warner-overtakes-virat-kohli-for-massive-feat-4523033","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australian opener David Warner on Saturday overtook India's Virat Kohli to become the fourth-highest run-scorer in ICC World Cup history.","content":"Australian opener David Warner on Saturday overtook India's Virat Kohli to become the fourth-highest run-scorer in ICC World Cup history.

His teammates on-rushed, among them the beaming Paul van Meekeren, the four-wicket hero, and it was soon a pile of orange shirts celebrating madly in the vast stadium, near deserted, as the distraught Bangladesh fans had long filed out of the stadium. They had turned up in numbers, waving their puffed tiger dolls and wearing their passion on their sleeve. With an overwhelming majority of the crowd behind them, it was as though Bangladesh were playing in Mirpur of Chattogram. Follow all the action from the Cricket World Cup 2023 on our special World Cup section. You can also find the latest stats , like the top scorer and the highest wicket-taker of the current edition, upcoming World Cup fixtures and the points table on the site. A typically energetic crowd of 15,000 roared every wicket they took and every boundary they scored, in their pursuit of 230 runs. But they watched in utter horror the Dutch scythe through their batting. They did to Bangladesh what Bangladesh used to in the past, when they scalped big teams. No longer though. In the first place, Bangladesh let the Dutch soar to 229 after they were teetering on 107 for 5. But Scott Edwards put in another remarkable batting effort to power them to a competitive total on a surface that aided spinners as the day wore on. Still, Bangladesh fans nursed no fears of an upset and were cheerful in the stands. But drowning out the noise, Netherlands struck early to have them reeling at 15 for three. The thrifty Aryan Dutt consumed the under-firing Litton Das before Logan van Beek nailed Tanzid Hasan. The familiar van Meekeren struck the two vital blows, those of Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan. The former was lured into a wild waft outside the off-stump while the effort bowl that generated extra bounce accounted to Hasan. His attempt to play that was lazy too.

It only got worse from here, as Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mushfiqur too perished in no time. Suddenly, Bangladesh were reeling at 70/6. The Dutch were now beginning to sense hope and increased their intensity on the field, piling dot balls and ratcheting up the pressure. Mahedi Hasan and Mahmudullah, though, somehow took them past 100 before a direct throw from de Leede ended Hasan’s outings. And when de Leede nailed Mahmudullah, with the score 113 for 8, Bangladesh could feel the ground beneath them crack. Though they lower-order hung around, it was a matter of time before the defeat was confirmed. Advertisement Homegrown hero Van Meekeren is one of the few home-grown players in the Dutch team. But sustaining his passion in the game was not easy. The pandemic time was tough. He should have been playing the T20 World Cup for Netherlands in November, 2020. Instead, he was delivering UberEats to pay his bills. He was released by Somerset too. Initially he was not part of Netherlands’ squad for the ODI World Cup Qualifiers due to his county commitments but was later released by his current club Gloucester. Tonight, that decision paid rich dividends.

(Express photo by Partha Paul) Another familiar figure was their batting hero, Edwards. After electing to bat, Netherlands were reeling at 4-2, courtesy of Taskin Ahmed, who was returning from an injury layoff, when he drew first blood for Bangladesh in the second over when he snapped up Vikramjit Singh (3). The partner Max O Dowd (0) would also follow him shortly after nicking off Shoriful Islam in the next over. The Dutch’s nightmare start in the powerplay continued. Skipper Scott Edwards had said before the match that they would look to rectify the mistakes when it came to their top order. Unfortunately, as of Saturday, the issue still persisted. Wesley Barresi, the 37-year-old South Africa-born batsman—better remembered for a comment on Virat Kohli that “we’ll never see or hear from you again”, when the Indian was dismissed in the 2011 World Cup—steered the Dutch ship clear of relative danger before being dismissed for 41. In the space of adding 44 runs, they lost three more wickets. But enter the man for crisis. Edwards. Making full use to two reprieves, he led the rebuild, before Logan van Beek’s late charge took them to a competitive total, that would prove more than handy in the end Also Read How much 50 over cricket domestically has Virat Kohli played: Nasser Huss...

Try to save face in a World Cup that has already passed them by, or use the game as the starting point for the 2027 tournament in southern Africa? With qualification for the semi-finals now dependent on a fantastical sequence of results, the braver call would be to look beyond the debacle of the last few weeks, and blood the 20-somethings who are likely to be around in four years’ time. The two scenarios need not even be mutally exclusive. Against Sri Lanka in Bangalore, where England suffered arguably the worst of their four defeats in this tournament, their entire XI was the wrong side of 30 - a first for an ODI team. Now, they must refresh the side with the members of their 15 who have the hunger to perform - and a loss of hunger among the squad’s double world champions remains as plausible an explanation as any for England’s disappearance over the cliff. That ought to mean a recall for Harry Brook, who was unfortunate to be dropped against Sri Lanka after showing pluck against Afghanistan’s spinners. Equally, Surrey quick Gus Atkinson deserves another go, having escaped relatively unscathed from the mauling by South Africa . Harry Brook was unfortunate to be dropped against Sri Lanka and should come back into side Gus Atkinson (centre) is another newcomer who escaped relatively unscathed during contest Brydon Carse was called up to replace Reece Topley and should get the chance against India Then there’s Brydon Carse, the Durham fast bowler who has replaced the injured Reece Topley, and has designs on becoming the middle-overs seamer England have so badly lacked since ditching Liam Plunkett after the 2019 World Cup. All three are in their twenties, and all will benefit from playing in front of a crowd that could reach 50,000 - no matter the result. One thing is for sure: we are yet to hear a coherent diagnosis of England’s plight from inside the camp, with assistant coach Marcus Trescothick the latest to express bewilderment. Asked if the players were confused by their struggles, he replied: ‘I think they’re trying to understand it, yeah. Whether confusion is the right word, I’m not sure. But it’s not gone - it’s just hiding in a funny place at the moment. Marcus Trescothick is among the England coaches to be as confused as the side's followers ‘We’re all feeling the heat, but what can you do? We’ve prepared the same. Every practice we go through, we’re coming out the other side thinking we’re in a good place. It’s just not quite worked when we go into the games.’ India, the tournament’s only unbeaten side, are unlikely to give them much breathing space, although the home fans are keen to see their heroes bat first after five successful chases. Even during the dark days of the 2015 World Cup, a tournament which persuaded Eoin Morgan to reset England’s entire white-ball strategy, they never lost four in a row. That is the fate that threatens them on Sunday. In a city famous for its kebabs, England could be in for a skewering. But if they pick a forward-looking team, it need not be in vain. The team England should pick 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Dawid Malan, 3 Joe Root, 4 Ben Stokes, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Jos Buttler (capt, wkt), 7 Liam Livingstone, 8 Brydon Carse, 9 Gus Atkinson, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Mark Wood India Cricket England Cricket South Africa Rugby Share or comment on this article: LAWRENCE BOOTH: With semi-final qualification near-impossible, England should be brave and blood future talents against champions-elect India e-mail Add comment Comments 2 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.
