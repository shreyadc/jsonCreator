The tickets for the hastily-arranged engagement programme were sold in a jiffy, but the fans crowded all the gates 12, 13 (main gates) and 10 (club house entrance) with not enough security to control them. #WATCH | Bengaluru stampede | Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah says, \"I don't want to defend this incident. Our government will not do politics on this. I have ordered a magisterial inquiry and given 15 days' time. People even broke the gates of the stadium. There was a stampede. No one… pic.twitter.com/ZtPIqMthS3— ANI (@ANI) June 4, 2025The number swelled to unexpected levels around 3.30 pm and it forced the police and stadium security officials to close all the gates to prevent the ticket-less from squeezing in along with the ones who had valid tickets.

I bought tickets for the function but was not even able to enter the stadium. Police suddenly blocked all the roads and closed all the entrances to the venue, and suddenly they started lathi-charging near the main gate,\" said Prashant Shetty, a post-graduate student who came along with a few of his friends. \"I don't know what we did wrong. We were invited for the function, bought tickets but in the end got beaten up and abused. Terrible day for fans like us,\" he added. The situation turned worse at around 4.30 pm when many more came from the nearby Cubbon Park metro station, worsening the situation and the police had to resort to mild use of force to disperse the huge gathering. At Gate No. 10, the situation was grimmer as women and children were shoved around forcefully, and even this reporter was pushed to a corner by a police official with a lathi who also hurled some swear words in local dialect. Several ticket-holders had no choice but to make a retreat from the venue albeit thankful that they escaped unscathed from what became a stampede. Even from a distance, it was disturbing to see women fainting and some others getting crushed under the feet of jostling fans. The fan engagement function lasted close to an hour and the team went back to the hotel around 6.30 pm but the fans still remained near the stadium creating further traffic block and chaos, before slowly moving away after a tragic day.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-06-04 16:41:50","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/06/04/6812060c5a0405b9fd5fb1168f856e8b1749055240420958_original.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","source_name":"Abp News","source_priority":7754,"source_url":"http://abplive.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/abplive.jpg","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"a90d8ed932bbc5bf3dede420e9fdf621","title":"Deadly Crowd Crush Mars Celebration for Indian Cricket Championship - The New York Times","link":"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPM0JoN0lFaUY3UGlROEhLWHEyclRQR0F2Y29nejh2M1htUVN1YWI1SnBiX051NDY5aG1URmtWbUkyTkdpdk9ISnQwTTJNMVE1RlFkRmQ3bFB3NGlXSTdnb3pZQzV2cEp4VE9Ha0NGb3BrU1pQR0U4VkpndVl0enJpZ2xtVnY5YlRCMFNF?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"description":"Deadly Crowd Crush Mars Celebration for Indian Cricket Championship The New York TimesEleven die in Bengaluru crush as fans gather for IPL victory parade BBC11 dead in stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium amid RCB victory celebrations in Bengaluru Deccan HeraldVirat Kohli Breaks Silence On 11 Deaths Due To Stampede At RCB's IPL 2025 Title Celebration: \"At A L..

A stampede occurred here, claiming the lives of 11 people and injuring 33 people. pic.twitter.com/5DBhW9IFli— ANI (@ANI) June 4, 2025BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia, while noting that 33 people have been hospitalised, saying that fans were desperate to catch a glimpse of their favourite cricketers. \"When one organises a victory celebration of this magnitude...safety and security measures need to be taken,\" BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told PTI.How Crowd Swelled Outside Chinnaswamy Stadium?Though there were no arrangements made to handle the heavy crowd, desperate fans reached to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars, including Virat Kohli. The tickets for the hastily-arranged engagement programme were sold in a jiffy, but the fans crowded all the gates 12, 13 (main gates) and 10 (club house entrance) with not enough security to control them. #WATCH | Bengaluru stampede | Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah says, \"I don't want to defend this incident. Our government will not do politics on this. I have ordered a magisterial inquiry and given 15 days' time. People even broke the gates of the stadium. There was a stampede. No one… pic.twitter.com/ZtPIqMthS3— ANI (@ANI) June 4, 2025The number swelled to unexpected levels around 3.30 pm and it forced the police and stadium security officials to close all the gates to prevent the ticket-less from squeezing in along with the ones who had valid tickets.

I bought tickets for the function but was not even able to enter the stadium. Police suddenly blocked all the roads and closed all the entrances to the venue, and suddenly they started lathi-charging near the main gate,\" said Prashant Shetty, a post-graduate student who came along with a few of his friends. \"I don't know what we did wrong. We were invited for the function, bought tickets but in the end got beaten up and abused. Terrible day for fans like us,\" he added. The situation turned worse at around 4.30 pm when many more came from the nearby Cubbon Park metro station, worsening the situation and the police had to resort to mild use of force to disperse the huge gathering. At Gate No. 10, the situation was grimmer as women and children were shoved around forcefully, and even this reporter was pushed to a corner by a police official with a lathi who also hurled some swear words in local dialect. Several ticket-holders had no choice but to make a retreat from the venue albeit thankful that they escaped unscathed from what became a stampede. Even from a distance, it was disturbing to see women fainting and some others getting crushed under the feet of jostling fans. The fan engagement function lasted close to an hour and the team went back to the hotel around 6.30 pm but the fans still remained near the stadium creating further traffic block and chaos, before slowly moving away after a tragic day.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-06-04 16:41:50","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/06/04/6812060c5a0405b9fd5fb1168f856e8b1749055240420958_original.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","source_name":"Abp News","source_priority":7754,"source_url":"http://abplive.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/abplive.jpg","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"a90d8ed932bbc5bf3dede420e9fdf621","title":"Deadly Crowd Crush Mars Celebration for Indian Cricket Championship - The New York Times","link":"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPM0JoN0lFaUY3UGlROEhLWHEyclRQR0F2Y29nejh2M1htUVN1YWI1SnBiX051NDY5aG1URmtWbUkyTkdpdk9ISnQwTTJNMVE1RlFkRmQ3bFB3NGlXSTdnb3pZQzV2cEp4VE9Ha0NGb3BrU1pQR0U4VkpndVl0enJpZ2xtVnY5YlRCMFNF?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"description":"Deadly Crowd Crush Mars Celebration for Indian Cricket Championship The New York TimesEleven die in Bengaluru crush as fans gather for IPL victory parade BBC11 dead in stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium amid RCB victory celebrations in Bengaluru Deccan HeraldVirat Kohli Breaks Silence On 11 Deaths Due To Stampede At RCB's IPL 2025 Title Celebration: \"At A L..

The tickets for the hastily-arranged engagement programme were sold in a jiffy, but the fans crowded all the gates 12, 13 (main gates) and 10 (club house entrance) with not enough security to control them. #WATCH | Bengaluru stampede | Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah says, \"I don't want to defend this incident. Our government will not do politics on this. I have ordered a magisterial inquiry and given 15 days' time. People even broke the gates of the stadium. There was a stampede.

I bought tickets for the function but was not even able to enter the stadium. Police suddenly blocked all the roads and closed all the entrances to the venue, and suddenly they started lathi-charging near the main gate,\" said Prashant Shetty, a post-graduate student who came along with a few of his friends. \"I don't know what we did wrong. We were invited for the function, bought tickets but in the end got beaten up and abused. Terrible day for fans like us,\" he added. The situation turned worse at around 4.30 pm when many more came from the nearby Cubbon Park metro station, worsening the situation and the police had to resort to mild use of force to disperse the huge gathering. At Gate No. 10, the situation was grimmer as women and children were shoved around forcefully, and even this reporter was pushed to a corner by a police official with a lathi who also hurled some swear words in local dialect. Several ticket-holders had no choice but to make a retreat from the venue albeit thankful that they escaped unscathed from what became a stampede. Even from a distance, it was disturbing to see women fainting and some others getting crushed under the feet of jostling fans. The fan engagement function lasted close to an hour and the team went back to the hotel around 6.30 pm but the fans still remained near the stadium creating further traffic block and chaos, before slowly moving away after a tragic day.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-06-04 16:41:50","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/06/04/6812060c5a0405b9fd5fb1168f856e8b1749055240420958_original.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","source_name":"Abp News","source_priority":7754,"source_url":"http://abplive.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/abplive.jpg","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"a90d8ed932bbc5bf3dede420e9fdf621","title":"Deadly Crowd Crush Mars Celebration for Indian Cricket Championship - The New York Times","link":"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPM0JoN0lFaUY3UGlROEhLWHEyclRQR0F2Y29nejh2M1htUVN1YWI1SnBiX051NDY5aG1URmtWbUkyTkdpdk9ISnQwTTJNMVE1RlFkRmQ3bFB3NGlXSTdnb3pZQzV2cEp4VE9Ha0NGb3BrU1pQR0U4VkpndVl0enJpZ2xtVnY5YlRCMFNF?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"description":"Deadly Crowd Crush Mars Celebration for Indian Cricket Championship The New York TimesEleven die in Bengaluru crush as fans gather for IPL victory parade BBC11 dead in stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium amid RCB victory celebrations in Bengaluru Deccan HeraldVirat Kohli Breaks Silence On 11 Deaths Due To Stampede At RCB's IPL 2025 Title Celebration: \"At A L..
