The BCCI is also in touch with them, taking updates on his condition. As of now, he will be kept here only,” Sharma told reporters after meeting the cricketer. India’s star cricketer had a miraculous escape when his luxury car crashed into a road divider and caught fire after he dozed off at the wheel on the Delhi-Dehradun highway in the early hours of Friday. The 25-year-old, who was on his way to his hometown Roorkee to surprise his mother, suffered injuries on his head, back and feet, but is in a stable condition, according to police. Replying to a question, Sharma said Pant told him that it was dark and the accident took place when he was trying to negotiate a pothole. Earlier in the day, Bollywood actors Anil Kapoor and Anupam Kher also met Pant at the hospital. “He (Pant) is doing fine. We met him as fans. Let us pray that he recovers soon and we see him playing again,” Kapoor told reporters after coming out of the hospital. —PTI DDCA director meets Pant; expresses satisfaction at medical treatment added by Press Trust of India on 12:43 am January 1, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-31 19:13:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Team India Schedule 2023: 2023 में टीम इंडिया के पास ICC के दो टूर्नामेंट जीतने का मौका, ऐसा है शेड्यूल","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/team-india-indian-cricket-team-2023-full-schedule-and-complete-fixtures-team-india-all-matches-in-2023-2296591","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"Indian Cricket Team 2023 Schedule: भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम के लिए अगला साल यानी 2023 काफी व्यस्त रहने वाला है. टीम इंडिया को अगले साल श्रीलंका, न्यूजीलैंड, ऑस्ट्रेलिया के साथ सीरीज खेलनी हैं. वहीं आईपीएल का 16वां सीजन भी खेलना है. इसके बाद वेस्टइंडीज दौरा, फिर वनडे वर्ल्ड कप और फिर एशिया कप भी खेलना है. अंत में टीम इंडिया दक्षिण अफ्रीका दौरे पर भी जाएगी.  2023 में आईसीसी के दो बड़े टूर्नामेंट होंगे. इसके अलावा एशिया का सबसे बड़ा टूर्नामेंट भी खेला जाएगा. आईसीसी इवेंट में एक वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप का फाइनल है तो दूसरा 2023 वनडे वर्ल्ड कप. वहीं 2023 एशिया कप भी 2023 में ही खेला जाना है.  2023 वनडे वर्ल्ड कप भारत में ही होना है. यह टूर्नामेंट में टीम इंडिया के लिए काफी अहम होगा. टीम इंडिया ने 2011 में पिछला वनडे वर्ल्ड कप जीता था. वहीं 2013 के बाद से टीम इंडिया ने कोई भी आईसीसी का इवेंट नहीं जीता है. ऐसे में टीम इंडिया अपने घर पर 2023 वनडे वर्ल्ड कप जीतना चाहेगी.   2023 के लिए टीम इंडिया का शेड्यूल जनवरी: श्रीलंका के साथ तीन मैचों की वनडे और इतने ही मैचों की टी20 सीरीज जनवरी-फरवरी: न्यूजीलैंड का भारत दौरा- तीन मैचों की वनडे और इतने ही मैचों की टी20 सीरीज फरवरी-मार्च: ऑस्ट्रेलिया के साथ चार टेस्ट और तीन वनडे अप्रैल-मई: आईपीएल का 16वां सीज़न जून:  WTC फाइनल 2023 (अगर टीम इंडिया वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप के फाइनल में पहुंची तो) जुलाई-अगस्त: वेस्टइंडीज दौरे पर जाएगी टीम इंडिया, 2 टेस्ट, 3 वनडे और 3 टी20 मैचों की खेली जाएगी सीरीज सितंबर- 2023 एशिया कप सितंबर- तीन वनडे मैचों के लिए भारत आएगी ऑस्ट्रेलियाई टीम 10 अक्टूबर- 26 नवंबर: 2023 वनडे वर्ल्ड कप नवंबर-दिसंबर: ऑस्ट्रेलिया का भारत दौरा (5 मैचों की टी20 सीरीज के लिए आएगी कंगारू टीम) दिसंबर: दिसंबर अंत में दक्षिण अफ्रीका दौरे पर जाएगी टीम इंडिया, 2 टेस्ट, 3 वनडे और 3 टी20 मैचों की खेली जाएगी सीरीज.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-31 17:36:38","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2022/09/24/e81500ca2dbb0e57811f8b2b75d101011663993398389266_original.jpg","source_id":"abplive","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Year Ender 2022: जानिए क्यों महिला क्रिकेट के लिए खास रहा यह साल, इन कारनामों से टीम इंडिया ने रचा इतिहास","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/year-ender-2022-know-why-this-year-has-been-special-for-women-s-cricket-2296577","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"Year Ender 2022: यह साल भारतीय महिला क्रिकेट (Indian Women’s Cricket team) के लिए काफी खास रहा है. 2022 में महिला टीम ने कई बड़े कारनामों को अंजाम दिया. वहीं टीम के हक में कुछ शानदार फैसले भी हुए. टीम ने कई शानदार मैचों में जीत दर्ज कर फैंस को खुश किया. आइए जानते हैं साल 2022 टीम इंडिया के लिए बाकी सालों के मुकाबले क्यों खास रहा है.  1 कॉमनवेल्थ में सिलवर मेडल 2022 में खेले गए कॉमनवेल्थ गेम्स ने महिला भारतीय टीम ने शानदार प्रदर्शन किया. टीम ने कुल तीन मैच जीतकर फाइनल में जगह बनाई. हालांकि टीम को फाइनल ऑस्ट्रेलिया के खिलाफ हार का सामना करना पड़ा था. फाइनल में पहुंचने के लिए टीम को सिलवर मेडल मिला था.  2 एशिया कप 2022 विजेता 2022 में खेले गए महिला एशिया कप में एक बार फिर भारतीय टीम ने जीत दर्ज की. इस साल टीम ने 7वीं बार एशिया कप का खिताब अपने नाम किया. महिला भारतीय टीम अब तक सर्वाधिक एशिया कप जीतने वाली टीम है. भारतीय टीम ने एशिया कप में श्रीलंका, मलेशिया, यूएई, बांग्लादेश, थाईलैंड और फाइनल में श्रीलंका को शिकस्त दी थी.  3 इंग्लैंड में वनडे सीरीज़ विजेता (3-0) इंग्लैंड की सरज़मीं पर खेलते हुए महिला भारतीय टीम ने इतिहास रचा. टीम ने पहली बार इंग्लैंड को उन्हीं के घर पर वनडे सीरीज़ में 3-0 से शिकस्त दी. इस सीरीज़ में भारतीय टीम ने पहले मैच में 7 विकटों से, दूसरे मैच में 88 रन से और तीसरे मैच में 16 रनों से जीत दर्ज की थी. टीम ने लॉर्ड्स के ऐतिहासिक मैदान पर इंग्लैंड के तीसरा मैच हराया था.  4 झूलन गोस्वामी का संन्यास 2022 में भारती टीम की दिग्गज तेज़ गेंदबाज़ झूलन गोस्वामी ने क्रिकेट को अलविदा कहा. 2002 में डेब्यू करने वाली झूलन गोस्वामी ने 20 साल क्रिकेट को अलविदा कहा. उन्होंने अपने इंटरनेशनल करियर में कुल 12 टेस्ट, 204 वनडे और 68 टी20 इंटरनेशनल मैच खेले. उन्होंने अपने पूरे करियर में कुल 355 विकेट अपने नाम किए.  5 पुरुष क्रिकेटर्स के बराबर हुई मैच फीस इस साल बीसीसीआई की तरफ से ऐलान बताया गया कि अब से महिला क्रिकेटर्स को भी पुरुष क्रिकेटर्स के बराबर मैच फीस दी जाएगी. बीसीसीआई की ओर से 27 अक्टूबर को यह घोषणा की गई थी. ये भी पढ़ें...

It could have been great but was only good given the high standards of the team. The team had a shot at moving on to the next round of the qualifications for the 2023 50-Over World Cup but four losses from the 10 games ended that dream with Jersey coming from behind to take the one slot from the group. It will be a while before 50-Over cricket is a priority for the Cricket Cranes and but that journey won some hearts and new fans while it lasted. The East African Derby against Kenya in Lugogo had a crowd that cricket had never seen before and the Cricket Cranes gave their fans something to smile about with an emphatic 5-wicket win. There were lessons for the Cricket Cranes at the T20 World Cup Global Qualifiers in Zimbabwe. The Cricket Cranes chopped down to size in the games against Netherlands and PNG even though they were able to compete against Jersey and Hong Kong. The team finished 5th out of 8 nations, failing to qualify for the 2022 T20 World Cup but must have left Bulawayo with a lot of lessons given that as the winner from the Africa region it was a clear sign that there is a lot of work to do for the team for them to catch up with some of the top associates. The Cricket Cranes got their hands on silverware later in the year winning the Africa T20 Cup in a scintillating final against Tanzania. The games were all live on SuperSport which also gave a new following and audience for the Cricket Cranes. The team was in Kigali in December and won the T20 Tri-Nation tournament winning 9 games out of 12 with a largely new team. The gains for the team were very many but they didn’t scale the heights they desired, players such as Emmanuel Hasahya, Cyrus Kakuru, Pascal Murungi, Juma Miyagi, Joseph Baguma and Ronald Lutaaya all came of age and got their chances with the senior team. With senior players such as Deus Muhumuza, Fred Achellam, and Riazat Ali Shah long-term injury concerns, the work for Laurence Mahatlane is cut out for him. Next year, the team will make a maiden appearance at the All Africa Games in August and the Africa T20 Cup finals.","pubDate":"2022-12-31 15:04:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"kawowo","country":["uganda"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"\"Can't Keep On Taking Breaks\": Ex India World Cup Winner's Advice To Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L2NhbnQta2VlcC1vbi10YWtpbmctYnJlYWtzLWV4LWluZGlhLXdvcmxkLWN1cC13aW5uZXJzLWFkdmljZS10by12aXJhdC1rb2hsaS1yb2hpdC1zaGFybWEtMzY1MzUwMNIBhgFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L2NhbnQta2VlcC1vbi10YWtpbmctYnJlYWtzLWV4LWluZGlhLXdvcmxkLWN1cC13aW5uZXJzLWFkdmljZS10by12aXJhdC1rb2hsaS1yb2hpdC1zaGFybWEtMzY1MzUwMC9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"\"Can't Keep On Taking Breaks\": Ex India World Cup Winner's Advice To Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma  NDTV Sports‘Can’t look beyond him, debate over': Gambhir picks India's ODI top six  Hindustan TimesRohit Sharma`s opening partner in ODI should be Ishan Kishan: Gautam Gambhir  Zee News\"Debate Is Over\": Gautam Gambhir Wants This Youngster To Open With Rohit Sharma In ODIs.

क्रिकेट की बड़ी कॉन्ट्रोवर्सी बनीं और उन घटनाओं ने खूब सुर्खियां भी बटोरी. ऐसे में आज हम आपको साल 2022 की टॉप 5 कंट्रोवर्सी के बारे में बताएंगे. गुणाथिलाका पर लगा रेप का आरोपआईसीसी टी20 वर्ल्ड कप का आयोजन इस साल ऑस्ट्रेलिया में हुआ थ. वहीं इस साल नवंबर महीने में विश्व कप के दौरान इस श्रीलंकाई खिलाड़ी पर एक महिला ने रेप का आरोप लगाया था. इस आरोप के बाद उन्हें पुलिस ने गिरफ्तार भी किया था. महिला ने गुणाथिलाका पर आरोप लगाया था कि उसने घर में 4 बार उसका यौन उत्पीड़न किया है. इस घटना के बाद उन्हें सिडनी की जेल में कई दिनों तक बंद रहना पड़ा था. भारत-पाक वर्ल्ड कप मुकाबले का नो बॉलआईसीसी टी20 वर्ल्ड कप में भारत और पाकिस्तान के बीच पहला मुकाबला खेला गया था. मैच काफी रोमांचक था और टीम इंडिया को 3 गेंद में 13 रनों की जरूरत थी. पाकिस्तान के लिए मोहम्मद नवाज ओवर कर रहे थे. उन्होंने विराट के कमर के ऊपर गेंद डाली. इस बॉल पर विराट ने छक्का लगाया. अंपायर ने पहले इस बॉल को नो बॉल नहीं दिया जिसके बाद विराट ने इसकी आलोचना की और बाद में अंपायर ने इसे नो बॉल करार दे दिया. भारत ने यह मुकाबला 4 विकेट से अपने नाम कर लिया. एशिया कप को लेकर भारत-पाक विवादआईसीसी के आगामी एशिया कप 2023 की मेजबानी पाकिस्तान के हाथों में है. इसे लेकर पीसीबी और बीसीसीआई के बीच लगातार बयानबाजी हुई. भारत के ओर से बीसीसीआई सचिव जय शाह ने साफ कह दिया कि भारत एशिया कप के लिए पाकिस्तान नहीं जाएगा. इसके बाद पाक क्रिकेटरों और अधिकारियों के बीच लगातार खींचतान शुरू हो गई. पीसीबी की ओर से यहां तक कह दिया गया कि अगर टीम इंडिया एशिया कप के लिए पाकिस्तान नहीं आएगी तो हम वर्ल्ड कप के लिए भारत नहीं जाएंगे. दीप्ति शर्मा मांकडिंग विवादभारतीय महिला क्रिकेटर दीप्ति शर्मा ने इस साल इंग्लैंड दौरे पर वनडे सीरीज के दौरान इंग्लिश बैट्समैन चार्ली डीन को मांकडिंग के जरिए आउट किया था. इसे लेकर लगातार चर्चा जारी रही. कई क्रिकेटरों ने दीप्ति को सही बताया तो कई खिलाड़ी दीप्ति को पहले वॉर्निंग देने की सलाह देते नजर आए. विराट कोहली का कप्तानी से हटनाभारतीय टीम के दिग्ग्ज बल्लेबाज विराट कोहली का इस साल टेस्ट कप्तानी से इस्तीफा दिया था. इसके बाद उनसे वनडे की कप्तानी भी वापस ले ली गई. वहीं टी20 वर्ल्ड कप 2021 के बाद उन्होंने इस फॉर्मेट से भी कप्तानी छोड़ दी. विराट के इस फैसले ने इस साल खूब सुर्खियां बटोरी और फैंस उनके इस फैसले से काफी निराश नजर आएं थे.   यह भी पढ़ें: IPL 2023: डेविड वॉर्नर करेंगे दिल्ली कैपिटल्स की कप्तानी, चोटिल ऋषभ पंत

After this, Australia's next Test assignment will be a tour of India for four Tests as part of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with Warner being the most experienced campaigner, having toured the country thrice for Test tours and playing for more than a decade in the Indian Premier League (IPL). \"It's going to be interesting. We know what we're going to prepare for, they're going to be turning wickets. There are going to be times when it's going to be challenging over there, but it's about how our batters can build and bat big as we did in Pakistan. \"I think with the ball, we're going to do a fantastic job - we've got a world-class spinner in Nathan Lyon and we're going to have to potentially think about playing two spinners. For us as a batting group ? we're going to have to find a way and a method like we did in Pakistan to get through that.\" \"Obviously in Sri Lanka, we had good methods and we saw in that first Test in Galle, everyone was playing reverse sweeps and sweeps, everyone had a method and they stuck to it. Moving to India, it's going to be a batters' battle I reckon,\" Warner was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au on Friday.

He is in the ICU presently,” Sharma told IANS from Dehradun, where he had gone to meet Pant. On Friday morning, Pant, 25, suffered multiple injuries when his car collided with a road divider and caught fire on the Delhi-Dehradun highway. A serious car accident happened between Manglaur and Narsan in the Haridwar district in the state of Uttarakhand. He has been admitted to Max Hospital in Dehradun after being initially taken to Saksham Hospital Multispecialty and Trauma Centre. Pant was on his way to his hometown Roorkee from New Delhi. Earlier, DDCA President Rohan Jaitley had said if needed and medically advisable, his organisation will airlift Pant from Dehradun to New Delhi for his plastic surgery. But Sharma said the future plan for Pant’s treatment will be decided by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). “The future plan of the treatment will be decided by the BCCI.

Both Akram and Younis, however, continued with their Pakistan career until their retirements in 2003 and 2004 respectively.

If I was the decision maker at the time, I would’ve banned them forever,” Raja told Samaa TV.“You brought them back to system. I wasn’t in power at the time. We were told to play with them and work with them, and that was it. No one knew how to tackle that. So many people were involved in that. I don’t know what the compulsion was.”When asked if he would have meted out a similar treatment to Salman Butt, Mohammad Amir, and Mohammad Asif – who were also banned after spot-fixing charges in 2010 – Raja said, “Whoever is tainted, I’ve zero tolerance on it.”Amir played for Pakistan after serving a suspension and played for Pakistan in multiple World Cups but was shunned out of the team once Raja took charge of PCB.“I’m absolutely clear.

In modern-day cricket when even bowlers are encouraged, nay, required, to work on their batting skills, it’s a near miracle that a wicketkeeper manages to maintain a spot in any playing eleven unless there’s a regular contribution with the bat as well.So shouldn’t a wicketkeeper be judged purely on their primary skills first? Well, the direction in which cricket is progressing, that may well have become a thing of the past. And it’s a fact that India woman wicketkeeper Sushma Verma accepted a while ago as after falling out of favour with the national selectors, she returned to the grind of domestic cricket and worked hard on improving her batting skills.In Sushma’s own words, her wicketkeeping has ‘never been an issue’ and with strike-rate being the buzzword across formats these days, the 30-year-old worked on that particular aspect with a focus on playing the role of a finisher.Analysis | India squad for T20 World Cup: Shikha adds necessary experience, Rana’s omission sticks outWednesday was the culmination of her ‘hustle’ as she was recalled in India’s T20I squad having last played in the format for the country back in 2016.In a chat, facilitated by iOS Sports, Sushma, who captains Himachal Pradesh in domestic cricket, opened up on a range of topics.EXCERPTSYou had a productive domestic season, especially in T20s. Tell us about your preparations and what were your goals?Well, if we are focusing on challenges then I would like to begin by talking about Inter-state T20 from where this tournament began two months back. For me, it was very different getting into a new role. I generally bat in the middle order but this season, I’ve been asked to open for Himachal Pradesh. So, as an opener, it was a very different experience. It was nice to experience how to score runs when batting at the top. You have plenty of time as compared to when playing in the middle. Situation is quite different. Initially, it was different but I was well-prepared and confident about the role. I was unbeaten a number of times and it helped my confidence.In T20s you don’t have much time – things change at the fall of a wicket. The bigger picture is that I have to come back (in the national setup). After that, when the zonals began, my role was different. Again, I was back in the middle order. I scored some 180-odd runs and was unbeaten in one of them. So it felt good. I knew my role will be that of a finisher and I tried my best.Sushma Verma with the Dhoni-esque finish to the match. Sushma’s team IND-D-W won the SENIOR WOMENS T20 CHALLENGER TROPHY final against IND-A-W@ImSushVerma @BCCIWomen@BCCIdomestic#bcci #bcciwomen #womenscricket #cricket #IOSAthlete #IOStalent #IOSmanagement #AthleteManagement pic.twitter.com/8wndi40Iug— IOS Sports & Entertainment (@iosindiaoff) November 28, 2022Mentally, I am prepared that I will get to play only 4-5 deliveries and have to maximise those. When chasing, you then have the chance to finish the match (in that situation). So in the final (zonal), I had that opportunity. The manner in which Yastika (Bhatia) was playing at the other end, there was a scope to take some time. So, initially, I played cautiously. I was very happy to finish the game. If I make a comeback to the Indian team, it’s possible I may get the same role.So how confident are you about your India recall? (This was before the BCCI announcement)Depends on how constantly I’m performing and finishing the game. As of now, my thinking is that the Indian team needs someone who is playing with a good strike-rate, especially in T20 format.And when you talk about wicketkeeping, I never thought there was anything lacking. Batting needed an extra edge though – hitting with a better strike-rate. So I’ve worked on that in the past 3-4 years. This season it has come really nice. Getting selected isn’t in my control but very focused on the process. Everybody wants to play at the top level. The hustle is ongoing.Wicketkeepers are often judged on their batting. Isn’t that unfair?This question I used to keep asking myself when I was dropped. Of course, you get selected after performing well both with the bat and behind the stumps. Taniya (Bhatia) also got selected when she scored runs in domestic cricket. Indian set-up is different – you may not get your favoured batting position because the team’s requirements could be different. I used to ask the same question that you asked after being dropped.Wicketkeeping is a very thankless job and very few people recognise this skill.I have worked with a lot of coaches, and support staff across different tournaments but rarely have I found a connection where a wicketkeeper is valued purely on wicketkeeping abilities which is a primary skill. So it depends on how you are backed and this is true not just for Indian setup but in domestic too. I feel very bad for wicketkeepers because it’s thought that anyone can do this job when in reality, you require top-level skills to perform the role well. It’s mentally draining.BCCI recently announced pay parity in match fees. Your thoughts on the development?Very happy with it. A wide impact of this decision is that it will inspire a lot of girls to take up the sport as a career because of the financial security. But I feel there’s another change that should be made. If this equal pay structure is implemented in domestic cricket too then things will get even better. Women cricketers who only play domestic cricket, I feel they are still not financially secure. But very good to know that a lot of parents are now more confident that if their daughter does well in cricket, she will be financially secure.There will be a women’s version of IPL from next season as well…Very-very excited. I remember those days when the men’s IPL began. We weren’t sure about the kind of cricket that was being played. First 2-3 seasons, IPL was also different (from what it has grown to become today). So, a similar level of excitement. And not just because there’s a competition for women but also because of its potential impact, especially on our international team. We have already started playing better cricket in the past 4-5 years. It may help us tackle the final hurdle like we (India) continue to make the final (in ICC events) but somehow aren’t able to win tournaments.Two giants of Indian cricket Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami called time on their international careers in 2022. How was your experience playing alongside them?Paaji the Sher 🦁Thank you @JhulanG10 for inspiring each and every woman out there . Best wishes for future. Ab to aa jao dharmshala ghoomi ghoomi krne 🤣🌻 #happyretiredlife ❤️ https://t.co/KF26a2kxNA— Sushma Verma (@ImSushVerma) September 27, 2022I feel very blessed to have gotten the chance to share the dressing room with them and it’s something which the upcoming generation won’t get to experience. I think these two players have grown with the game for so long and continued setting new standards for women’s cricket. It’s not easy being in that sort of system though. For example, in men’s cricket, everything is settled but these two have witnessed changes almost yearly, maybe from the day they started playing. And then they gave such performances and maintained their position at the top.I was very close to Jhulan di. I have seen their work ethics. They were so disciplined and well-organised. It looked as if they have all the time in the world to do so much! It never appeared they can be put under pressure. Even if they were going through a tough time, it was never visible on their faces. Probably, that’s what experience is. These are the learnings I took from them: keep it simple, be disciplined and keep the determination towards yourself and your team.You have been leading Himachal Pradesh for quite some time now. You are a senior player now. Do you think captaincy adds more pressure?I have been asked this question a lot of times. I don’t see it as a pressure but consider it a privilege. You are getting the chance to lead your state and then you have to be at the top, set an example by performing well and take everybody along. From day one, if I can recall it correctly, probably there were just two seasons I wasn’t the captain. Maybe it was the phase when all senior players left the setup and our batch which is still playing became part of it. Leading same bunch of cricketers with whom I was already playing was a bit easy. I have stayed with them 24X7 so there was a strong bonding with them. It was like family. I have never felt like I’m a senior.There’s a raging debate on Rishabh Pant vs Sanju Samson, at least on social media. If one gets picked, other is dropped and vice versa. As a wicketkeeper how do you see it?To be honest, I’m not aware of this. I feel for wicketkeepers (to play) in general, it all depends on the kind of support staff they have in addition to what the team management and captain want. It also depends on the opponent, conditions and what skill you are backing. There could be days when you need Rishabh Pant or maybe in some other match, he’s not needed. So it depends on what the requirement actually is.As a player, I feel this hype is more from outside rather than among the players. They understand that not everything will work out in their favour.Even in my case, I used to feel wicketkeeping is something which is being ignored. But it all boils down to the reason. Maybe a certain wicketkeeper playing ahead of me because of being a better batter. So why don’t I level up as well?Of course, there has to be clarity. The conversation should be there, informing them of the reason(s) why they are playing or not.Is it true you wanted to be a journalist? Are there any plans of getting back to studies?It (plan) has changed. Now, I am financially secure, working as a cop with the Himachal police. That time, I didn’t know whether I will get to play for India one day. I myself feel to be an ‘accidental cricketer’. I didn’t plan to become a cricketer but once I got the chance, have given my 100 percent to this game. At that time studies were as important. So I did my mass communication and gave my first semester exams. After that, I began playing for India and then it was hard to find time to get back (to studying). But I never wanted to be a journalist, probably saw Anjum Chopra on TV as an expert so from it I was inspired that maybe I will do commentary one day. But yes, after cricket, these options are available.I came across a social media post of yours in which you asked for recommendations on the best place to open a cricket academy. Can you please elaborate on it?Till the time you are playing, all your time has to be devoted to cricket alone. It’s time-demanding. This isn’t the right time to get into all this but yes, in the future, I have a wish to work in this direction. In Himachal, Dharamsala is the centre – international stadium and all. It’s not easily accessible which is understandable. But there are a lot of talented individuals in the state – both men and women. I think there aren’t enough quality centres here (in Himachal). So I feel people like us should do something in this regard. My aim is that kids from Himachal don’t have to struggle to find quality coaches. But right now, I am fully focused on my game. I’m myself practising in Chandigarh. So that’s that.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
