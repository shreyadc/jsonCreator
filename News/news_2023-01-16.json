Kohli hit 166 not out off 110 balls, his second-highest ODI score, as India reached 390-5 in 50 overs. Shubman Gill also scored his second ODI hundred. In reply, Sri Lanka was scuttled out for 73 runs in 22 overs. The resultant 317-run margin of victory was the biggest ever recorded in ODIs, smashing the previous record held by the Black Caps in their 290-run winning margin against Ireland in 2008. India made a solid start after opting to bat. Gill put on 95 runs with skipper Rohit Sharma (42) for the first wicket. After Sharma departed in the 16th over, Gill and Kohli put on 131 runs for the second wicket. Gill scored 116 off 97 balls, notching up his century off 89 balls, hitting 14 fours and two sixes. The day belonged to Kohli though, who scored his second hundred of the series and third across his last four ODI innings. Virat Kohli celebrates his century with Shreyas Iyer. Photo / AP Kohli got to 50 off 48 balls with his century partnership with Gill coming off only 90 balls. Later, he reached his ton off 85 balls. It was his 21st ODI hundred on Indian soil, the most by any batsman as he overtook Sachin Tendulkar’s record of 20 centuries. It was also Kohli’s 10th ODI hundred against Sri Lanka, the most by any batsman against any team in this format. Kohli stepped it up thereafter, scoring 50 off 21 balls, including six sixes. Overall, he hit 13 fours and eight sixes. Kohli was named player of the match as well as player of the series. “Ever since I came back from the long break, I have been feeling good. I don’t have the desperation to get to a milestone. I am enjoying my batting and trying to help the team as much as possible. I want this (run of form) to continue,” Kohli said, after the victory. Shreyas Iyer scored 38 off 32 balls and added 108 off 71 balls with Kohli for the third wicket. Compounding Sri Lanka’s misery, two of its fielders were stretchered off after a collision at the deep midwicket boundary in the 43rd over. Jeffrey Vandersay and Ashen Bandara both dived for the ball before colliding. They were both taken to a local hospital for scans. Dunith Wellalage took Vandersay’s place as a concussion substitute while Bandara was replaced by Dhananjaya de Silva as a fielding substitute. Sri Lankan batting folded meekly in reply to India’s mammoth total as Mohammed Siraj and Mohammed Shami bowled belligerent opening spells, sharing six wickets. Siraj took 4-32 while Shami returned 2-20. The tourists reached just 39-5 after 10 overs with just two top-order batsmen – Nuwanidu Fernando (19) and Dasun Shanaka (11) – reaching double figures in the one-sided encounter.","content":"Virat Kohli scored his 46th ODI hundred to lead India past Sri Lanka and complete a 3-0 whitewash in the series.

But the match was overshadowed by a physical clash when halfway through the Hurricanes chase team captains Chris Green and Wade exchanged some words. Green was said to be poking fun at Wade for almost being run out, with Wade refusing to take the jibe laying down. As the players then returned to the middle, Warner got involved and was seen shoving Wade. The incident earned the scorn of Fox Sports commentator Kerry O’Keefe. He said: “That was inappropriate. I don’t know what went on between that pair. “Their history goes back a long way as buddies. It’s unsavoury. You can’t have contact like that. “Whether they were half-joking, I don’t know.

If it doesn’t, it doesn’t. “I walk away with no ill feeling.” Wade later joked: “I couldn’t hit him, that was more my main frustration.” The result saw the Hurricanes leapfrog Thunder into fifth in the table.","pubDate":"2023-01-15 16:54:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Desert Vipers vs Sharjah Warriors, 4th Match, International League T20, 2023 - Cricbuzz","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbS5jcmljYnV6ei5jb20vY3JpY2tldC1jb21tZW50YXJ5LzU5MDIyL3N3LXZzLWR2LTR0aC1tYXRjaC1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWxlYWd1ZS10MjAtMjAyM9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Desert Vipers vs Sharjah Warriors, 4th Match, International League T20, 2023  CricbuzzUAE’s Muhammad Waseem’s sterling knock takes MI Emirates past Sharjah Warriors  Hindustan TimesInternational League T20 2023, Match 4, Desert Vipers vs Sharjah Warriors: Probable XIs, Match Prediction, Pitch Report, and Live Streaming Details  SportskeedaVIP vs SJH Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Playing XI, Pitch Report & Injury Updates for Today Match 4  CricTrackerILT20 HIGHLIGHTS: Desert Vipers WIN by 7 wickets, Top Knocks from Alex Hales, Sam Billings Guide Vipers to BEAT Sharjah Warriors - Check Highlights  InsideSportView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-15 16:43:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Is One day Cricket dying? tweets Yuvraj Singh during India vs Sri Lanka 3rd ODI in Thiruvananthapuram","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/is-one-day-cricket-dying-tweets-yuvraj-singh-during-india-vs-sri-lanka-3rd-odi-in-thiruvananthapuram-ind-vs-sl-3rd-odi-rohit-sharma-virat-kohli-2023-01-15-839516","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Indian Cricket team on Sunday played against Sri Lanka in the third and final ODI of the three-match series.

In the absence of Jasprit Bumrah , who has been on the sidelines due to a lower back stress fracture, Siraj has emerged as India's most successful bowler in ODIs in the past year. \"(Mohammed) Shami has always been there for us but the way Siraj has come in and done with the new ball has been outstanding,\" Kohli said at the post-match presentation after India's 317-run win over Sri Lanka in the the third and final ODI here. \"He has taken the maximum number of wickets in the powerplay, which was an issue for us early. He is always making the batters think, which is a great sign for us going into the World Cup.\" Siraj, who rocked the Sri Lankan top-order, missed out on a fifer and returned with impressive figures of 4/32. \"Good to see how he (Siraj) was bowling and he deserved all those slips. He is a rare talent, the way he has come up over the last few years is good to see,\" skipper Rohit said. \"He has come from strength to strength and that's really good for Indian cricket. \"We tried all sort of things (to get his fifer) but it didn't happen unfortunately. But the four wickets are all his and fifers will come. He has a few tricks up his sleeves which he is working on and it's there to see.\" India completed a 3-0 clean sweep of Sri Lanka in the ODI series. \"It was a great series for us. Lots of positives. We bowled well, got wickets when we needed and the batters throughout the series piling on the runs was good to watch.\" India are scheduled to play three ODIs and as many T20Is with New Zealand, starting Wednesday. \"We'll get to the drawing board quickly (for the next series) and see how the pitch is, then decide how the combinations will be. \"They (NZ) are coming off a series win in Pakistan, so it won't be an easy task at all,\" Rohit added. Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka was disappointed by his side's performance. \"It's disappointing. Not a game we wanted. It happens. We need to learn how to manage the start. Bowlers should learn how to take wickets on these decks and the batters should learn to score. \"Playing positive cricket is the most important thing. If the boys show intent, the bowling would have been different.

For me, it's just a byproduct of the intent I have, mindset that I play with. Mindset is always to help the team win, bat for as long as possible and if you do that, you end up making a difference. I have always played for the right reasons, help the team as much as possible. It is just intent, playing for the right reasons. Ever since I came back from the long break, I have been feeling good. I don't have that desperation to get to a milestone. I am just enjoying my batting, being in a space where I can relax. Today as well, I was just happy to be out there batting. I am in a nice space right now and want this to continue. Shami has always been there for us but the way Siraj has come up has been outstanding.

Virat Kohli is currently running the show and is nearing a century mark. Meanwhile, Shreyas Iyer, who came into bat after Gill's dismissal, is also looking in good touch having hit a  four and a six so far. 16:09 (IST)India vs Sri Lanka Live:Superb innings by Shubman Gill comes to an end as the opener is castled by Rajitha.

India 202/1 after 31 overs15:40 (IST)India vs Sri Lanka Live:Gill doesn't need luck this time as he moves forward and uses his bottom hand to loft it over wide long-off.

Flighted delivery by Fernando and Gill steps out and drives but only managed to get thick outside-edge which runs away past the vacant slip and wide of short third man. 15:23 (IST)India vs Sri Lanka Live:India 158/1 after 25 overs: The hosts are in a good position courtesy of good start given by skipper Rohit and Shubman Gill, who has completed his fifty and looks on course for his second ODI century.

Pressure is on Sri Lanka, who have managed to pick just a wicket so far.15:11 (IST)India vs Sri Lanka Live:Elegant shot by Shubman Gill as he leans into a drive off the front foot to hit a boundary at mid-off. That also brings up the fifty partnership between Gill and Kohli.15:01 (IST)India vs Sri Lanka Live:Shubman Gill is looking confident here as moments after completing his fifty, the opener smashed his first six of the match and that came off Vandersay's delivery.

Ind 0/0 after 1 overIndia vs Sri Lanka 3rd ODI preview: Having already won the ODI series, India will look to clinch a series sweep with another victory in the third ODI against Sri Lanka which will be played at the Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram. India won the first ODI by 67 runs and then took an unassailable 2-0 lead with a 4-wicket win in the second match.It was a run-fest in Guwahati in the first ODI as India scored 373 and Virat Kohli struck his 45th ODI ton. In reply, Sri Lanka were restricted to 306. But in the second ODI, Sri Lanka batted first and were shot out for 215. India had to work hard for the win and a gritty 64 not out from No 5 KL Rahul helped India cross the line.With the series in the bag, Team India could make a few changes with the 2023 ODI World Cup in the mind. Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh has not got a game yet and could be brought in to see the variety that he offers. Also, Kuldeep Yadav replaced the injured Yuzvendra Chahal in the second ODI and took three wickets. It is possible that Kuldeep could be dropped if Chahal is fit and India want to get a clear answer on whether to bank on Chahal or not.However, it’s quite possible no changes are made to the playing XI as a chance of a series sweep is at stake. But experimentation is important ahead of the World Cup even if a 3-0 series win will allow India to carry the momentum to the New Zealand ODI series that begins on 18 January.The match will be shown live on Star Sports network channels and the Disney+ Hotstar app.SquadsIndia: Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya (vc), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Ishan Kishan (wk), Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Umran Malik and Arshdeep Singh.Sri Lanka: Dasun Shanaka (c), Kusal Mendis (vc), Pathum Nissanka, Avishka Fernando, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Wanindu Hasaranga, Ashen Bandara, Maheesh Theekshana, Chamika Karunaratne, Dilshan Madushanka, Kasun Rajitha, Nuwanidu Fernando, Dunith Wellalage, Pramod Madushan and Lahiru Kumara.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
