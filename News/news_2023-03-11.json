On Thursday, she stretched her lead at the top with three more wickets against Delhi Capitals, sending them on their way to 105 all out. Capitals headed into what was a clash between two unbeaten sides with back-to-back 200-plus totals. But they were undone by the brilliance of Ishaque, who’s taken a rough path to the glitz and glamour of the WPL. Ishaque comes from a humble background in Park Circus, a neighbourhood in south Kolkata. She was introduced to the sport by her father, who passed away 15 years ago. She did the hard yards at the Under-19 and Under-23 levels for Bengal before playing for the senior side. But a shoulder injury in 2018 pegged her back for a couple of years and the road forward was tough. Ishaque struggled to pick up wickets on her return and was then left out of the Bengal side. Low on confidence, she was introduced to former Bengal left-arm spin allrounder Shibsagar Singh in 2021, and he helped her make technical adjustments. Watching some footage of her, Shibsagar observed that Ishaque was bowling very full and not letting the ball turn enough. “I saw that she is talented and there is something different about her, and made her understand what her issue is,” Shibsagar told ESPNcricinfo. “I asked her to pull her length back a touch, that allowed the ball to deviate, rather than bowling it full and not letting it turn. I also told her to not try for wickets but concentrate on bowling in the right way. “I told her to focus on bowling one ball at a time and not think of the entire over or other stuff. Her mindset slowly began changing. Her earlier focus was on wanting to pick X wickets in Y overs.” Former India allrounder Rumeli Dhar, who also captained Ishaque at Bengal, loved the gusty, fighting character that Ishaque was in the side. Bowling to batters who attack was something she particularly revelled in. “When I was the captain, there were a couple of instances where I have asked her if she would be able to pick up a tough wicket and she upfront used to say yes and did it too,” Dhar said. “She is badmaash [naughty] but she is fun-loving. She knows to have fun and also knows how to make people laugh. “[Ever since her comeback] she knows where she should land the ball to get it to spin and trouble the batter. She has learnt how to respond to captains’ and coaches’ calls of bowling in specific areas and situations. She has a lot of control with her bowling.” Capitals would learn of it the hard way. Meg Lanning and Shafali Verma, easily one of the most dangerous opening pairs in the WPL, had a 162-run stand in Capitals’ opening game and then put up a half-century partnership against UP Warriorz heading into the game against Mumbai. Ishaque, though, struck the first blow off her sixth ball, having Shafali play around a flighted delivery that was slanted into the stumps to bowl her. Capitals were briefly buoyed by a fifty-run stand between Lanning and Jemimah Rodrigues – going from 31 for 3 to 81 for 3 – but then Ishaque was at it again. Brought back in the 13th over for her third, Ishaque again attacked the stumps and just fired it in a touch, only for Rodrigues to go back and miss her cut and be bowled. The left-arm spinner then struck a telling blow on the last ball by floating one up outside off and enticing Lanning to charge down and take the aerial route only for her to hit it to extra cover. This all came after a four-wicket haul against Gujarat Giants at DY Patil Stadium to set up her team in the WPL curtain-raiser. While it was captain Harmanpreet Kaur who stole the show with her scintillating fifty, Ishaque’s exploits made sure everyone took note of her too. And so far, of her nine wickets in the WPL, seven have been either bowled or lbw.Ahead of the WPL, Shibsagar took Ishaque to the East Bengal club to train with male cricketers. He specifically asked them to attack her in a bid to prepare her for the WPL, and he liked what he saw. “She is dimaagwali (intelligent). Never afraid to bowl the tough overs – she will bowl two overs in the powerplay and then also want to bowl at the death,” Shibsagar said. “Any bowler can get hit but she is always confident of picking up wickets.” The WPL, it is expected, will be a means to unearth uncapped talents and fast track them into the national set-up. Given Ishaque’s WPL performances have come at a time when India’s incumbent left-arm spinners Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Radha Yadav are struggling for consistency and penetration, Ishaque could well be on this path. Published on By Andy Murray won a deciding set for the seventh time this season to reach the second round at Indian Wells.The British former world number one defeated Tomas Etcheverry 6-7 (5-7) 6-1 6-4 in a match that lasted three hours and 12 minutes.Murray had no fewer than 20 break points, 16 of which were saved by the 23-year-old Argentine. “I really felt like I was in the driving seat for much of the match,” Murray told BBC Sport. “I was creating lots of opportunities but I just wasn’t able to capitalise. I made some poor decisions at times, but in the end did really well to get through that.” Etcheverry was the sharper man in a first set tie-break, which he won 7-5, and had a break point for a 2-1 lead in the second.But Murray saved that break point before running away with the second set. Both players had chances in the deciding set. Etcheverry had two break points at 4-3 but Murray saved them with some fine serving, then secured the decisive break in the next game as the Argentine double faulted. “I’m not going to keep winning every three-set match that I play, but it’s been an amazing start to the year,” Murray continued. “It was still a good effort to turn that around as the first set was extremely long and I was thinking ‘here we go again’. “This is a place where I haven’t always played my best tennis so I was really happy that I managed to turn that around.” Murray will play Spain’s world number 17 Pablo Carreno Busta in the second round on Saturday.Murray’s victory came after 21-year-old compatriot Jack Draper thrashed Switzerland’s Leandro Riedi 6-1 6-1, to set up a second-round meeting with fellow Briton Dan Evans. The left-hander had not played since mid-January when he lost to Spain’s Rafael Nadal at the Australian Open.Showing no signs of the leg injury he had been dealing with, Draper looked sharp as he dismantled 135th-ranked Riedi’s serve.Draper, ranked 56th, broke in six of his seven return games as well as dominating on his own serve.Despite a seven-week lay-off, Draper showed why is one of the ATP Tour’s rising young stars by striking the ball confidently and consistently in an impressive performance. The rapid win sets up an intriguing match against 24th seed Evans, who will surely provide a sterner test than Riedi did on his debut in an ATP Masters event.Evans, 32, received a first-round bye in the Californian desert and the Davis Cup team-mates will play each other competitively for the first time later this week.Speaking about Evans, Draper told BBC Sport: “He’s a really nice human being and whenever I’ve had moments where I’ve not felt great he’s always sent me a message, and I appreciate that from an older player. “He definitely cares and it’s the same with Murray and [Cameron] Norrie – they’ve paved the way for me a little bit and they’ve always been supportive in my practice sessions and given me the confidence I’ve needed to get to this level quicker, so I’m very grateful to the likes of Dan.” Published on By Sri Lanka’s seamers edged the visitors ahead on the second day of play at Hagley Oval as New Zealand’s batters were made to grind in their pursuit of Sri Lanka’s first innings total of 355. Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara picked up two wickets apiece, while Kasun Rajitha, arguably the pick of the bowlers, grabbed a deserved scalp in the final half hour of play. For the hosts, Tom Latham top scored with a dogged 67, while Daryl Mitchell remained unbeaten on 40 alongside Michael Bracewell on 9 at stumps. The day was one that belonged to the seamers, however, starting with the New Zealand pair of Tim Southee and Matt Henry, who picked up four more wickets between them to wrap up the Sri Lankan innings in the morning session. Dhananjaya de Silva, Sri Lanka’s last recognised batter, fell having added just 10 runs to his overnight total, wafting at one outside off, while the rest of the Lankan tail came together to add a further 40, as Sri Lanka finished on 355. The New Zealand openers for their part made it through the six overs prior to lunch with little trouble. Post lunch, while Latham was going, New Zealand’s progress was slow but steady. Alongside his opening partner Devon Conway, he weathered the early movement utilised by the likes of Asitha and Rajitha, while there was also a little bit more zip to the surface as opposed to the opening day, which aided the likes of Kumara. Nevertheless the pair stuck to their tasks, milking ones and twos on the onside and down the ground, while awaiting rare short and wide deliveries to secure boundaries. The pair would put on 67 for the opening stand, however just when Sri Lanka’s seamers might have been tiring Asitha provided the breakthrough, getting one to nip back and trap Conway leg before. Conway might count himself a touch unfortunate though to have been given out by the on-field umpire, with DRS showing umpire’s call on both impact and whether it was hitting the wickets. That wicket would give Sri Lanka a renewed burst of energy to seek a second before the break, and Kane Williamson would oblige on the stroke of tea, with an uppish drive straight to the man catching at cover. Henry Nicholls would then fall shortly after the restart, top edging a pull off Lahiru Kumara. At this point Sri Lanka were well and truly on top, a state of affairs punctuated by the excellent Rajitha, who would torment Mitchell – who had just arrived at the crease – probing and teasing his off stump. That Mitchell would survive this period was a minor miracle, particularly after one delivery that – to borrow a phrase from football parlance – might have given him twisted blood. Angling in from slightly wide of the crease, Rajitha would pitch this on the border of offstump, on the edge of a good length, and then get it to shape away right at the death, beating Mitchell and the stumps by the barest of margins. If not for a graze on the outside of the pad, his stumps would have certainly been under threat. Sri Lanka’s only misstep might have been offering Angelo Mathews, with his 115kph gentle seamers, the ball during this period, though the thought process behind it – providing the front line seamers a rest while still utilising the swing on offer – was understandable. This period offered the New Zealand batters a minor reprieve, with Mitchell memorably launching Mathews down the ground for a six. Mitchell and Latham would proceed to put on 58 together before another moment of brilliance swung the pendulum back towards the visitors. Following periods of spin from Prabath Jayasuriya and Dhananjaya de Silva, Asitha returned to dismiss Latham in explosive fashion – a leg stump yorker from around the wicket, and an animated send off to boot. Rajitha would then finally get the wicket his performance deserved, getting Blundell to nick one through after yet another exquisite out swinger on off stump. Mitchell and Bracewell would survive till stumps, but with a 193-run deficit ahead of them, Sri Lanka would undoubtedly be the happier of the two sides going into day three. 355 (Kusal Mendis 87,Dimuth Karunaratne 50; Tim Southee 5- 64, Matt Henry 4-80) lead New Zealand 165/5 (Tom Latham 67; Daryl Mitchell 40*; Lahiru Kumara 2-34, Asitha Fernando 2-42) by 190 runs Published on By Angelo Mathews has taken aim at the Test-match schedule Sri Lanka has been lumped with. His complaint: Sri Lanka will not play enough Tests, particularly this year. This, despite there being an outside chance that Sri Lanka could play in the World Test Championship final, so long as Australia win or draw their last Test against India, and Sri Lanka beat New Zealand 2-0, in New Zealand. These remain unlikely outcomes, even though both Australia and Sri Lanka have had good days with the bat on Thursday.But Mathews essentially asks what value the cricket world places in Tests any more, if the scheduling is so lopsided. “Unfortunate that we are not playing too many Test matches this year – it’s as few as five,” he said, on the day he became Sri Lanka’s third-highest Test scorer, in Christchurch. “We are coming off a long layoff – the last Test was six months back.” Mathews is correct that there are only five Tests on the schedule for Sri Lanka in 2023 (two against New Zealand, two against Pakistan, and one against Ireland, who are not WTC opposition just yet). He is not correct on how long it’s been since Sri Lanka’s last Test before this one. It has been seven months. “Everyone’s talking about Test cricket dying, but we’re not doing any good for Test cricket playing only five Tests a year. Hopefully we’ll get more matches this year. Five feels like not enough.” In fact, right through the WTC cycle to follow this one, Sri Lanka are not scheduled to play a single three-Test series. Meanwhile, India, Australia and England routinely play five-Test series against each other through the same period. At the worst, they play four-Test series. The WTC structure requires the teams that qualify to play an equal number of WTC series between each other through the course of the cycle. But aside from India, England and Australia (the Big Three), most other sides play two-Test series, except when they play one of the Big Three sides, when they may have a three-Test encounter on the books. Jason Holder and Anrich Nortje – currently playing a two-Test series in South Africa – had also voiced how every team apart from the Big Three were barely playing any Tests these days.","pubDate":"2023-03-11 00:01:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"News24.com | SA's Rilee Rossouw smashes fastest 100 in Pakistan Super League history","link":"https://www.news24.com/sport/Cricket/sas-rilee-rossouw-smashes-fastest-100-in-pakistan-super-league-history-20230310","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South African batsman Rilee Rossouw made headlines in the Pakistan Super League when he smashed a stunning century to help his side chase down a mammoth total.","content":"South African batsman Rilee Rossouw made headlines in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on Friday when he smashed a stunning century to help his side chase down a mammoth total.

The BBC confirmed it has been unable to find a presenter willing to fill in the vacant role. A spokesperson said: 'Some of our pundits have said that they don’t wish to appear on the programme while we seek to resolve the situation with Gary. 'We understand their position and we have decided that the programme will focus on match action without studio presentation or punditry.' A source close to the Match of the Day program also told MailOnline that even the production team 'is considering walking in support of Gary Lineker and have contacted their union' however they are cautious to go ahead, because as there has 'been no ballot action, they won't be protected by law.' Fellow football pundit Ian Wright today tweeted that he would also shun presenting Match of the Day while the ban is in place, expressing 'solidarity' with his co-host Alan Shearer is the latest withdrawal from Match of the Day, tweeting this evening: 'I have informed the BBC that I won't be appearing on MOTD tomorrow night' Match of the Day's decision to take Gary Lineker (left) off air over his comments about the Government has led to a walkout from fellow hosts Alan Shearer (centre) and Ian Wright (right) The decision to streamline the programme was taken after fellow football pundit Ian Wright sparked a mutiny by announcing that he would shun presenting Match of the Day while the ban is in place, expressing 'solidarity' with his co-host.

Broadcaster Piers Morgan, a friend of Lineker's, also tweeted his disgust, branding the BBC's decision 'pathetically spineless'. Morgan added: 'I now demand the BBC suspend every presenter who has made public comment about news or current affairs - starting with Sir David Attenborough and Lord Sugar.' Channel 5 News presenter Dan Walker earlier said on air that Lineker told him 'they've [the BBC] told me I have to step back'. Speaking on Channel 5 News, Walker said: 'It's one of those strange situations where I'm actually texting the man himself (Lineker) at the moment. 'And I have asked Gary Lineker the question about whether he is stepping back or whether the BBC have told him to step back and I've told him that if he responds to me that I will read out that text on air. 'There's one word in there I can't use, but he has said 'No, they've told me I have to step back'. Alex Scott has also ruled herself out of tomorrow's show, sharing a meme with the word 'nah' Lineker's son George tweeted mischievously: 'RIP MOTD tomorrow' Gary Lineker will step back from presenting Match of the Day pending further discussions with his bosses, the BBC announced today. He's seen outside his London home this morning Channel 5 News presenter Dan Walker said Gary Lineker has told him 'they've [the BBC] told me I have to step back' The Match of the Day host accused ministers of using 'language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 1930s' 'So Gary Lineker wants to continue to present Match Of The Day and is not apologising for what he's said but he's said it's a BBC decision to force him to not present the programme at the moment.' Lineker's son George tweeted mischievously: 'RIP MOTD tomorrow.' BBC bosses had told Lineker either to stop his politicised posts or give up working for the corporation. Last night a senior source said: ‘It’s now up to Lineker – he needs to choose.’ Another well-placed insider described the presenters’ mutiny as a ‘proper BBC crisis’. However the decision has been welcomed by some, with former Tory leader William Hague said it was 'appropriate' for Gary Lineker to step back from hosting Match Of The Day. 'He broke the guidelines I think of the BBC with comments that are highly politicised, which BBC presenters are not meant to do. So that's against the rules and we've got to do something about that, otherwise every presenter can do so on every programme,' he told Times Radio. 'I think it is appropriate for him to step back.' Lord Hague added 'I don't know if you can separate' Lineker's personal social media and role as a BBC presenter. The BBC said Lineker would 'step back' from presenting the programme until he and his bosses had reached an 'agreed and clear position' on his use of social media. The BBC's highest paid star sparked a huge political row this week after comparing the language used to launch a new government crackdown on migrants arriving across the Channel in small boats to 1930s Germany. Elsewhere, members of the public who support Lineker will likely view his ban as a sign that the BBC is acting 'at the Government's behest', the BBC's former controller of editorial policy said. Richard Ayre, who also served as a member of Ofcom's content board, told BBC Radio 4's Today PM programme this afternoon that the BBC had 'no choice' but to take action against Lineker after his tweets criticising the Government's asylum policy. He said: 'I think it was inevitable.' 'He [Lineker] has the letters BBC written across his forehead and yet he's plunged right into the most controversial story of the day.' 'The fact is this was an immediate issue which Tim Davie, the Director General, couldn't sit on over the weekend, he had to solve it this week. He's clearly tried to solve it and reach an agreement with Gary Lineker, they've failed, so this has been the BBC decision. Whether this story moves on depends on what Gary Lineker says himself in the next few hours.' 'It's inevitable now that having in effect not sacked him but removed him temporarily at least, the BBC will not come under a torrent of criticism saying it's acting under the Government's behest.' Former BBC Newsnight host Emily Maitlis, who was herself reprimanded by the BBC for sharing a tweet the corporation viewed as 'controversial', said her former employer could face a 'much, much bigger battle' after its Gary Lineker decision. 'I'm not sure when they suggested to Gary Lineker he step back from (Match Of The Day) the BBC realised it might be starting a much much bigger battle,' she tweeted. Former BBC executive Richard Sambrook said there is 'a lot of confusion' around whether freelance broadcasters such as Gary Lineker - who do not work in news - should be subject to the same rules as permanent staff. Mr Sambrook, who was director of news at the BBC and director of BBC Global News and the BBC World Service, was asked Lineker's comments. He replied: 'I think the language he used was unnecessarily provocative but the wider question here is whether a sports presenter in his private life has to be bound by BBC policies. 'Traditionally, the BBC would always want that to be the case but I think in the current day and age when we live in a world full of social media, when journalism broadcasters have the ability to go and work for other people or do their own podcasts and all the rest of it, that's a bit of an unrealistic expectation.' Lineker's comments were criticised by Downing Street and a raft of Tory heavyweights including Home Secretary Suella Braverman and James Cleverly, the Foreign Secretary. The former Leicester striker has a history of controversial political interventions on everything from Brexit and the Tories to protests by Just Stop Oil and the fate of Shamima Begum . Gary Lineker, 62, reportedly refused to apologise for his comments comparing the Government's migration policy to Nazi Germany and he has been roundly supported by colleagues Lineker's tweeting history has raised more than a few eyebrows over the years A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC has been in extensive discussions with Gary and his team in recent days.

Mr Cleverly urged the ex-sportsman to study history 'a little bit more carefully' in the wake of his Nazi Germany jibe. Speaking to LBC from Paris, where the PM and his top team met their French counterparts today, the Foreign Secretary said: 'There are some people desperate to gain attention by using deeply offensive and inappropriate language about this. 'I would gently suggest they read their history books a little bit more carefully. The simple truth of the matter is the UK is a welcoming and hospitable country.' Former culture secretary Nadine Dorries also weighed in. The TV host and MP said that failure to fire Lineker would mean the BBC was only paying 'lip service' to its remit of impartiality. Mr Sunak himself insisted his Government's actions on the Channel migrant crisis were the 'moral and compassionate thing to do'. 'I strongly believe that what we're doing is the right thing to do,' the PM said today, when asked about Mr Lineker's intervention. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, on a visit to Paris, this morning swiped that the ex-England footballer was 'desperate to gain attention' Gary Lineker's long list of Twitter controversies January 2023 Then-culture secretary Michelle Donelan said the BBC should be 'conscious' of recent comments made by Lineker. Ms Donelan was speaking to The News Agents podcast about remarks Lineker had made on the same show about the World Cup in Qatar and racism in America. October 2022 Lineker breached BBC impartiality rules with a social media post criticising the Tories, the broadcaster's complaints team ruled. The Match of the Day host, 62, used Twitter to quote an article about Liz Truss – then foreign secretary – urging Premier League teams to boycott the Champions League final in Russia. In his post, the former England striker, who has more than 8.7million followers on Twitter, added: 'And her party will hand back their donations from Russian donors?'. August 2022 Lineker sparked a row with a senior BBC journalist this year with a Tweet about sewerage. He wrote on Twitter: 'As a politician how could you ever, under any circumstances, bring yourself to vote for pumping sewage into our seas? Unfathomable!' The tweet prompted veteran BBC journalist Neil Henderson, a home and foreign news editor, to ask the £1.35million-a-year presenter if his contract allowed him to breach the corporation's impartiality rules. The journalist wrote to him: 'The BBC lives or dies by its impartiality. If you can't abide it, get off it.' Mr Henderson, following discussions with BBC bosses, later issued an apology. July 2022 Lineker found himself at odds with ex-racing driver turned Sky commentator Martin Brundle over his response to a Just Stop Oil protest. Protesters stormed the British Grand Prix, sparking fury from Brundle, who said they could have been killed. Lineker tweeted: 'History will look back very favourably on these people'. But Brundle replied: 'Gary please don't encourage this reckless behaviour. 'They'd have been sliced into 100 pieces and fans, marshals and drivers were wholly at risk of injury and death. I totally support freedom of speech and opinion, but do it responsibly.' October 2020 Lineker said he had spoken to the BBC's director-general Tim Davie 'quite a few times in recent weeks' and that Mr Davie was 'perfectly happy' with his conduct on social media. His comments came after new guidelines and training were announced by the BBC to 'ensure the highest possible standards of impartiality' among staff at the broadcaster. February 2018 Lineker was challenged over his comments on Brexit by BBC cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew. Agnew, responding to one of Lineker's posts, Tweeted: 'Gary. You are the face of BBC Sport. Please observe BBC editorial guidelines... I'd be sacked if I followed your example. Thanks.' <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_4 - -> Advertisement 'I think it's the fair thing to do and I actually believe that it's the moral and compassionate thing to do, and I've made that argument multiple times. 'I'll continue to make it and I think actually the more people think about this challenge and how best to address it they will see that it is the right approach. 'And actually I was pleased that there was actually quite a lot of strong support for the approach we've outlined now that we've outlined it, because this is about thinking what's the best way to help the world's most vulnerable people.' Yesterday Mrs Braverman accused Lineker of diminishing the tragedy of the Holocaust as ministers engaged in an open row with the BBC star. She said she found the comments 'offensive' because her husband is Jewish. 'My children are therefore directly descendant from people who were murdered in gas chambers during the Holocaust,' she told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast. 'To kind of throw out those kind of flippant analogies diminishes the unspeakable tragedy that millions of people went through and I don't think anything that is happening in the UK today can come close to what happened in the Holocaust. 'So I find it a lazy and unhelpful comparison to make.' House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt claimed Labour were 'borrowing from the Gary Lineker playbook' by being the 'party of goal hangers' taking easy shots against the Government. The ex-England striker hit back at Ms Mordaunt's 'clumsy analogy', saying he was 'just happy to have been better in the six-yard box than you are at the dispatch box'. Lineker has said he is looking forward to presenting Match of the Day this weekend despite the 'ridiculously out of proportion story' surrounding his comments. Criticising the Government's new asylum plans earlier this week, he tweeted: 'There is no huge influx. We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. 'This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the '30s.' Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said he would boycott Match Of The Day. Mr Farron tweeted: 'And I will be stepping back from watching the programme until the @BBC grows a backbone. Still, I'm sure we can count on the Free Speech Union to stand up against this hysterical act of cancellation...' Henry Winter, the chief football writer for The Times who has regularly appeared on the BBC's Radio 5 Live, said the broadcaster should be 'ashamed' by its decision. 'Disappointing that coverage of (Match Of The Day) dictated by politicians,' he tweeted. 'Not what BBC should be about. BBC should be ashamed. Should be independent of No 10. Ian Wright replaced by Ian Duncan-Smith? 'Many good people working for BBC football who deserve better from their craven bosses.' Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised Gary Lineker and Ian Wright on Twitter. Corbyn wrote: 'Well done @GaryLineker for standing up for refugees. Well done @IanWright0 for showing the meaning of solidarity. 'Now, let's mobilise against a politics of cruelty, and defeat this inhumane, illegal & immoral legislation.' Former culture secretary Nadine Dorries has said she welcomes the decision for Gary Lineker to step back from Match Of The Day, saying it shows the BBC is 'serious about impartiality'. 'News that @GaryLineker has been stood down for investigation is welcome and shows @BBC are serious about impartiality,' the TalkTV host tweeted. Does the BBC need Gary Lineker more than he needs them? How ex-footballer has amassed £26m fortune with podcasts, broadcasting and advertising deals (just don't mention the two divorces and HMRC tax row) Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said he would boycott Match Of The Day amid the Gary Lineker row. Sharing a headline saying the presenter will be 'stepping back' from the show, Mr Farron tweeted: 'And I will be stepping back from watching the programme until the @BBC grows a backbone. Still, I'm sure we can count on the Free Speech Union to stand up against this hysterical act of cancellation...' Henry Winter, the chief football writer for The Times who has regularly appeared on the BBC's Radio 5 Live, said the broadcaster should be 'ashamed' by its decision to ask Gary Lineker to step back from hosting Match Of The Day. 'Disappointing that coverage of (Match Of The Day) dictated by politicians,' he tweeted. 'Not what BBC should be about. BBC should be ashamed. Should be independent of No 10. Ian Wright replaced by Ian Duncan-Smith? 'Many good people working for BBC football who deserve better from their craven bosses.' By Martin Robinson, Chief Reporter for MailOnline Gary Lineker earns £1.36-million-a-year from the BBC for Match of the Day, Sports Personality of the Year and other shows in a near three-decade broadcasting career that has helped him build a £26million nest egg. The 62-year-old is the highest-paid 'talent' at the c orporation but as the Beeb considers standing by him yet again over his highly political tweets, experts are pondering if another reprieve is a clear sign they need him much more than he needs them. The footballer turned broadcaster has amassed much of his fortune since starting at the BBC in the mid-1990s – but insists he does not fear leaving over the row where he compared Tory policy on migrants in boats to Nazi Germany. And MailOnline can reveal that he has close to ten other income streams with four years until the twice-married father-of-four hits retirement age – although a legal battle with HMRC over a £4.9million tax bill looms large in 2023. Lineker has four sons with his first wife, Michelle: Angus, 24, Tobias, 26, Harry, 28, and the eldest George, who is 30. He divorced from his second wife, Danielle Bux, six years ago. He said recently 'I've been married twice. I've got four kids. That's an expensive business'. Lineker promotes his own range of sunglasses and glasses, which he handpicks, for High Street chain Vision Express Lineker is also an investor in an insurance company which aims to reduce premiums for car and van drivers, as long as their driving is tracked Apart from his high-profile presenting roles, he features in big-brand television advertising campaigns but also runs a TV production company – Goalhanger Films – which he uses to sell even more of his work to the BBC. And it is Goalhanger's burgeoning podcast business that is predicted to make him even richer. His first shows were recorded at the kitchen table of his £4.8million Victorian property in Barnes, south-west London. He is also believed to own a property in Surrey where he has hosted at least two refugees. The Goalhanger stable also includes The Rest Is Politics, hosted by Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart, and The Rest Is History, presented by Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook - the latter widely considered as one of the UK's best podcasts. Gary's son Harry works for his dad's business, which has a growing list of hits including, you guessed it, Gary's own Match of the Day: Top Ten show with Alan Shearer, Micah Richards, Ian Wright and others. Eldest son George is co-founder of Your Business Number, Angus is a business development manager and Tobias is a DJ. Last year Lineker hailed the 'incredible growth' of the podcast arm, which is now signed up with global entertainment agency WME, even admitting that he could leave the BBC to work on it full time. He has three years left on his lucrative BBC deal - but with calls for him to be sacked over his tweets, it may not hit him that hard financially he moved on. He told The New Statesman last year when asked if he might work on Goalhanger full time: 'Maybe. Who knows? Life's thrown many things at me. And I'm 61. We don't really know what the boundaries are in terms of growth. But it's a very, very good business'. Gary Lineker married his first wife Michelle in 1986 but they later divorced. He later married Danielle Bux but they divorced in 2016 Gary with his four lookalike sons in 2013: Harry, Angus, George and Tobias (left to right) Mr Lineker is currently appealing in the courts after HMRC pursued him for £4.9million under IR35 legislation - rules designed to stop contractors working as 'disguised employees'. The tax man believes that Lineker should be treated as an employee by the BBC because he does so much regular work for them, meaning the star should pay more to the treasury. Mr Lineker disagrees. Last month a preliminary hearing in London was told Lineker has now paid the income tax bill in full but he is appealing. HMRC pursued him for the sum that it claimed should have been paid on income received between 2013 and 2018. Lineker insists all taxes were paid on the income through a partnership set up in 2012 with his ex-wife Danielle Bux and is appealing against the demand. The presenter is expected to argue that his partnership Gary Lineker Media (GLM) is required to funnel his income through because of the wide variety of work he does. HMRC will claim his extensive work for BT Sport and the BBC means he should be classed as an employee for tax purposes, because he agrees to do a minimum number of games and shows for the broadcaster. One of his first TV jobs away from football was as the face of Walkers crisps, and the Leicester-born star last year signed a new three-year deal with the firm – the snacks are made in his home city. The deal sees him feature in television advert campaigns and on social media. He has been working with the brand for more than 27 years, first teaming up with Walkers in 1994, and has now appeared in 150 adverts. Lineker is also an investor in an insurance company which aims to reduce premiums for drivers between the ages of 17 and 25. Ticker sends a box to the driver which they then place on their windscreen. The gadget pairs to a phone via bluetooth, sending the driver's behaviour on the road to the Ticker app, with the idea that the information can be used to provide cheaper insurance for safer young motorists. Described as the future of car insurance, the company is also backed by former Formula 1 driver Mark Blundell. Gary Lineker has been working with the brand for 27 years, first teaming up with Walkers in 1994, and has now appeared in 150 adverts In 2019, along with his friend and fellow broadcaster Danny Baker, Lineker published a book full of football anecdotes called Behind Closed Doors He is also a director of 'GCGL Properties Ltd' - described on Companies House as a 'development of building projects' business. As part of Lineker's £1.36 million deal with the Beeb, he presents Match Of The Day and other big sporting events. He is also one of the hosts of the Sports Personality of the Year event. Few BBC viewers will know that some of the programmes Lineker hosts are not part of his deal with the broadcaster but shows he sells to them through his production company. In 2020 he hosted and made Football, Prince William And Our Mental Health through Goalhanger Films. He has made others for the Corporation with stars including Marcus Rashford and Wayne Rooney, and featuring his beloved Leicester City. He also produces podcasts for the BBC. He recently announced a show he is making about tennis superstar Serena Williams, which he has sold to Amazon. He made a reputed £3 million from investing in Ingenie, a car insurance firm which was sold in 2014 He also works works for LaLiga TV. Lineker quit one big-money deal at BT Sport for another – transferring to La Liga to present football matches from the top Spanish division, live from Barcelona. Lineker still speaks Spanish after his time playing for the Catalan giants and he signed a multi-year contract with LaLigaTV. Speaking of the job, he said he was 'thrilled', adding: 'I have fond memories of my time playing in Spain and very much look forward to sharing the excitement of La Liga with viewers in the UK and elsewhere.' There are also books. In 2019, along with his friend and fellow broadcaster Danny Baker, Lineker published a book full of football anecdotes called Behind Closed Doors. A bestseller, it was culled from a podcast the pair presented and reveals jaw-dropping stories from the dressing room and open-top bus ceremonies, apparently 'all served up with lashings of wit and ribald humour.' As one of television's most prominent spectacle-wearers, it was only a matter of time before Lineker cashed in on them. He promotes his own range of sunglasses and glasses, which he handpicks, for high street chain Vision Express. The firm says in the 'edit', Lineker 'pays homage to the various fashion eras and styles which have influenced him throughout his life, specifically Italian and Mediterranean styles.' And he's hoping to score with the public in terms of pricing – Lineker spectacle frames cost from £99 and sunglasses are from £39. Lineker is renowned for his snappy suits when presenting his TV shows, which was clearly noticed by upmarket shirt brand TM Lewin, who then signed him up to promote the label. He appeared on its website where he advertised the budget range, starting at £25. He also used to encourage his millions of social media followers to shop at TM Lewin stores before the business went online only. In 2021 it was announced that Lineker would be straddling the BBC and ITV after being lured by the latter to host a new gameshow, named Sitting On A Fortune. In the show contestants can win up to £100,000 and it seems the presenter has hit the jackpot too. It's not known how much he is being paid but TV insiders suggest 'he won't be doing it for peanuts'. Lineker said: 'I am delighted to be hosting what I think and hope will be a show that people love, full of tension with high stakes and bags of drama from start to finish – everything a great game show should be.' A second series is billed to return in 2023.

RECAP | SA v West Indies, Day 3 Yet it was heartening to hear how the phlegmatic Proteas Test skipper also enjoyed the more mundane, perhaps even fun elements to his unbeaten 171, which has put the hosts in a prime position to push for a series whitewash. After all, he later had so much fun that he even donned a baggy green cap. Bavuma, who's called the Bullring his cricketing home for the past 14 years, never scored a red-ball century at the ground until now. \"I've actually never scored a hundred here in first-class cricket,\" he said at the end of his monumental, 369-minute effort to date. \"It's definitely a monkey off my back. The guys are always teasing me that my name isn't on the honours board at my home ground, so I guess I can stick it to them. \"[Jokes aside]... it's also special that it's against the West Indies, because, as I said leading to the series, it means sentimentally quite a lot because I grew up admiring their cricket too. That adds to the achievement.\" READ | Heroic Bavuma’s first Test ton in 7 years puts Proteas on top at the Wanderers The classy stroke-maker could even bask in the manner in which he reached his century - a disdainful lofted cover drive that was never going to be at risk of finding a fielder. In fact, Bavuma had been going about reaching his milestone in a methodical, pragmatic manner, but once he caught sight of his mother Phumza and father Vuyo watching intently from the Unity Stand and an expectant crowd raising their noise level, he decided to get a move on. \"I don't think there was a point where I felt I'd get over the line. When I got to 96, the crowd started picking up in anticipation of the milestone. My emotion started picking up too. I got a ball outside off-stump and I definitely wasn't about to keep it on the ground. I just waited for it,\" he said. And he's not about to let the tired Windies attack off the hook as a double century looms in the distance on Saturday. \"I'm going to try and bat as long as I can. I need the rest to come back fresh [on Saturday]. I'm not about to give my wicket away at any point. The opportunity is there, I definitely want to take it. \"I'm mentally quite tired more than physically. The adrenaline is still keeping me going. I have an ice bath waiting and I'm having a beer with the guys to celebrate. But after that, you have to put it behind you and look what's in front of you.\" Most pertinently though, Bavuma has entrenched his reputation of being the man the Proteas can depend on when the pressure is well and truly on. His most significant knocks at Test level - 54 in Chattogram 2015, 74 in Hobart 2016, 89 in Wellington 2017, 65 in Melbourne 2022 - attest to that. Now he has a big century to add to that collection, one where he came in at 8/2. \"In my Test career, I've found myself in situations where it's 20/4 or 10/2,\" said Bavuma. \"You really have to soak in the pressure and release it. I believe I've done it well in my career even if the scores haven't been as big as today. Walking into today's situation is one that I'm mentally accustomed to. My game leans towards it too.\" His team was grateful.","pubDate":"2023-03-10 21:43:05","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ben Duckett 'solely focused on playing for England' after featuring in Test, T20 and 50-over sides","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-11845429/Ben-Duckett-solely-focused-playing-England-featuring-Test-T20-50-sides.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ben Duckett wants to take every opportunity offered when it comes to playing for England, which is perhaps why he is unique amongst his international team-mates.","content":"Ben Duckett is 'solely focused on playing for England' after featuring in Test, T20 and 50-over sides this year... with Nottinghamshire batsman ready to snub riches of franchise cricket Duckett has defied a bloated schedule to feature in all three formats in 2023 Some team-mates have asked to miss matches to rest or play franchise cricket Batsman has averaged 56.44 in a triumphant return to Test cricket this winter By Richard Gibson For Mailonline Published: 17:12, 10 March 2023 | Updated: 21:11, 10 March 2023 e-mail View comments Ben Duckett wants to take every opportunity offered when it comes to playing for England, which is perhaps why he is unique amongst his international team-mates. For Nottinghamshire batsman Duckett is the only one to have defied a bloated schedule to feature in all three formats in 2023 - and on three separate continents at that. While others have opted out of sectors for one reason or another, the 28-year-old has accepted every invitation, beginning the year with the 50-over team in South Africa , then playing two Tests in New Zealand before arriving here for a Twenty20 series against Bangladesh via a week’s holiday in Dubai . ‘You can play in all these leagues around the world in a few years' time but at the time right now, I'm solely focused on playing as much for England as I can,’ said Duckett. Switching formats without fully preparing does carry jeopardy, however. Duckett joked that he was on a sun lounger two days before his 13-ball 20 in Thursday’s six-wicket defeat in Chittagong, and had just one net session to adjust to the reduction in bounce from antipodean to subcontinental conditions. Ben Duckett has defied a bloated schedule to feature in all three formats for England in 2023 England batsman has averaged 56.44 in a triumphant return to Test cricket this winter It was not quite enough, and his instincts meant he pulled over the top of a shooter from Mustafizur Rahman. Not that he will over-think his dismissal. Duckett is much more relaxed about his cricket than his 21-year-old self making a start as an international here in 2016, and puts that down to the attitude of England’s Test coach Brendon McCullum, summed up by an episode in the epic one-run defeat in Wellington last month. ‘At tea, he said, \"let's go out there and bat for a draw last session”. Obviously, he was joking but that's just how relaxed it is. You are going into the final session of a Test match, needing however many runs and the coach is cracking gags. That just relaxes you,’ he said. ‘His main thing with us is that he genuinely says he's not fussed about the results, it's a chance for us to go out there and express and show the world what we can do - try to make people back home want to watch us. If we lose by the way that we play, so be it.’ This winter, Duckett has averaged 56.44 in a triumphant return to Test cricket, but having won all but one of his 24 caps to date overseas, he is looking forward to what a home Ashes series entails. ‘I've always wanted to play for England again, and it's great, but to play in England in the summer, with packed houses, is something that's pretty exciting,’ he said. ‘I've never had a summer where I've had to manage myself and get ready at the right times, to play for England, and it's something I never thought I'd do, so I'm looking forward to it.’ Share or comment on this article: Ben Duckett 'solely focused on playing for England' after featuring in Test, T20 and 50-over sides e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

The net result was ensuring the second Test between South Africa and the West Indies will go into a fourth day. When Bavuma (171*) strode out at 10:18 at the fall of Tony de Zorzi's wicket, the score was 8/2. But, at the end of an absorbing day, the Proteas finished on 287/7 and with a massive lead of 356. It was largely thanks to Bavuma's broad and often pressured shoulders. Bavuma's 369-minute knock moved South Africa from a position of match-losing weakness to a point where the West Indies now have to reel in the highest successful fourth-innings chase at the Bullring. That's how important Bavuma's dig was, and in an era where three-figure captain's knocks have been few and far between for South Africa. It's worth remembering that Bavuma was subjected to the ignominy of a pair in his first Test as captain - such is the vicious and mischievous, yet enjoyable, nature of cricket. He scored more than half of his team's runs on a day when the West Indies had them on the rack with spells of mesmerising, military medium pace bowling in what was a difficult morning session for the hosts. Kyle Mayers (2/25) and Raymon Reifer (1/30) were unlikely partners in crime, reducing South Africa to 65/4. The Windies must have fancied their chances of batting after tea after Jason Holder's heroic 81* ensured South Africa only had a lead of 69. South Africa only led by 134 and were in danger of being bundled out cheaply, but Bavuma, whose 19 other 50-plus scores have come after his seminal 102* against England at Newlands in January 2016, understood the gravity of the situation and batted with the necessary care, diligence and later on, measured belligerence that befitted the changing situations. The fact that South Africa lost their first wicket off just the third ball of the day was a harbinger of things to come. Elgar (5), who has looked comfortable all series without making the relevant runs, inexplicably guided Mayers to Roston Chase at gully. The tall Roston Chase was so disbelieving of the gift that came in his direction, he had to have two grabs to ensure the catch wasn't grassed. That wicket fell at 10:03. De Zorzi (1) was the next to fall to Mayers, inside-edging a ball that could've been left onto his off-stump. It was a shot that lacked conviction and at 10:17, the Proteas were 8/2. It was important that Markram (18) reigned in his attacking instincts and, in recognising the situation, he did so. However, at 11:00, he received what was the ball of the session when a Kemar Roach delivery that ducked in and moved away squared him up and took his outside edge. That was 32/3 and Joshua da Silva, who was incessantly sledged by the hosts during his crucial partnership with Holder, let off a joint roar with Roach that not only pierced the bright blue sky, but punctured the Proteas' batting soul. Bavuma and Ryan Rickelton (10) needed to keep SA afloat and for 57 minutes in their stand of 37, they both dead batted what came their way and made the most of minimal scoring opportunities. Rickelton, though, was clearly flustered by Reifer's nagging off-stump line that moved the ball away from him. When he was claimed by the left-arm medium pacer on what became the stroke of lunch at 11:57, the Proteas were 69/4. It was definitely advantage West Indies, who were clearly riding the crest of the momentum created by Holder's knock. Bavuma is a noted firefighter, but he needed to move between his salvage job and being run surgeon by stitching together partnerships. He first shared a 24-run stand with Markram, then partnered with Rickelton for 37. The Bavuma/Heinrich Klaasen alliance of 34 had the potential to take the game away from the visitors. The wicket-keeper though succumbed to incessant chatty pressure from his opposite, Da Silva, when Klaasen (14) skied a short-ball that Da Silva caught at square-leg. That meant South Africa was 103/5 after the loss of the wicket at 13:32, leaving Bavuma and the under-pressure Wiaan Mulder (42). They guided South Africa to tea without further loss at 145/5 and Bavuma was on 81. It was from here where Bavuma and Mulder took the game by the scruff of the neck. They took 20 off Roach's first two overs after tea, an assertive move that not only allowed him to spend just seven balls in the 90s, but also brought a significant pressure release. The West Indies had only conceded 65 and 76 runs respectively in the previous two sessions. But in the evening session, they went for 142, 90 coming off Bavuma's bat in the march to his 100 and beyond. The crowd wasn't big, but the outpouring of emotions was intense after Bavuma drilled Joseph for four through cover after a nervy previous delivery. The moment had been worth it, and it rescued his side from a precarious position. It was unfortunate that Mulder didn't reach a deserved maiden Test 50 when he picked out Tagenarine Chanderpaul at fine leg off Joseph, but the monkey was off Bavuma's back. Bavuma needed only 62 balls to motor from 100 to 150 as he nailed home the advantage he had worked so hard to earn. He put together a 71-run stand with Simon Harmer (19) that moved the West Indies' target past the 310/8 Australia had reeled in to beat South Africa in 2011. Harmer didn't see out the day, but Bavuma did and when he was clapped off by the crowd and his opponents, it was well-deserved. Scores in brief: South Africa: 320 and 287/7 (Temba Bavuma 171*, Wiaan Mulder 42, Simon Harmer 19, Kyle Mayers 2/25, Alzarri Joseph 2/49, Jason Holder 1/35, Raymon Reifer 1/36) West Indies: 251 (Holder 81*, Mayers 29, Roston Chase 28, Joshua da Silva 26, Gerald Coetzee 3/41, Kagiso Rabada 2/19, Harmer 2/63) South Africa leads by 356 runs","pubDate":"2023-03-10 20:23:38","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"4th Test, Day 2: Ashwin’s 6-for gives India reason to believe they are still in the game","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/india-vs-australia-4th-test-ashwin-a-class-act/articleshow/98550797.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia had 480 on the board, but if there was a reason to believe that India were still in the game, it was provided by R Ashwin.

In very good conditions for batting, the offie was a class act, bowling nearly 48 overs, 15 of which were maidens to pick up 6 for 91. This was his 26th five-wicket bag at home, one more than the great Anil Kumble, and it’s an effort he’ll cherish for a long time. IANS There are few better slow bowlers in the world for such a challenge than Ashwin. When the Khawaja-Green partnership stretched to 208, and the pair had batted through two complete sessions, Ashwin had to do something different. Shoulders sagged, fielders oohed and aahed, bowlers poured in sweat at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Australia had batted nearly two days in their first innings, in itself an incredible feat, considering that the first three Tests barely lasted three days each. Usman Khawaja was the model Test batsman, soaking up pressure, minimising risk and winning the mental game, batting 11 minutes more than six hours to score 180 off a whopping 422 balls. Cameron Green gave notice of just why Australians are so excited about the giant allrounder, putting his head down and focussing hard on every delivery that came his way to score 114, his first Test century. Australia had 480 on the board, but if there was reason to believe that India were still in the game, it was provided by Ravichandran Ashwin . In conditions that were very good for batting, the offie was a class act, bowling nearly 48 overs, 15 of which were maidens to pick up 6 for 91. This was his 26th five-wicket bag at home, one more than the great Anil Kumble, and it is an effort he will cherish for a long time. In these conditions, it was not simply a matter of turning up, rolling the arm over, landing the ball on a spot and hoping the pitch would do the job with its natural variation. These were conditions in which the bowler had to plan and execute every single dismissal, with the various facets of spin bowling coming together. There are few better slow bowlers in the world for such a challenge than Ashwin. When the Khawaja-Green partnership stretched to 208, and the pair had batted through two complete sessions uninterrupted, Ashwin had to do something different. He packed the leg side field to Green, and came around the stumps, cramping the batsman. The delivery that got the wicket was not the finest, slipping down leg and kissing the glove off the attempted sweep for KS Bharat to catch well, but the thought process showed that Ashwin was not giving up at any stage. Alex Carey’s airy waft, trying to launch Ashwin over the off side was perhaps the one instance of the batsman giving away his wicket, but even here Ashwin had slowed the ball down nicely, allowing it to grip and take the edge. Mitchell Starc was a set-up of a different kind. After firing a succession of quick, flat deliveries, into the left-hander, Ashwin floated in the drifter, drawing the bat forward and catching the inside edge with precision. Todd Murphy , who was proving a proper thorn in the flesh with 41, was done in by the ball that went on with the arm and Nathan Lyon got a loopy ball that clipped the outside edge and went to slip via the keeper’s pad. Ashwin, who is a cricket tragic and has a head for numbers, will be telling his teammates that Australia are far from safe yet. Since 2000 there have been nine instances of visiting teams scoring 400 or more against India. Oddly, only one of those has resulted in a win, with four games being lost and three drawn. India were already well on their way, Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill heading to stumps at 36 without loss. While there was a hint of turn for Ashwin towards the very end of the second day, most of his bowling had happened on a placid pitch. With that being the case, the manner in which he controlled the game — going for just 1.92 runs an over — could well be the difference between the two teams. \"I remember my first tour to Australia in 2011-12, I bowled like how a spinner should bowl, put a lot of revs on the ball and spun it harder if things didn’t work,” said Ashwin. “But what I learnt was that to get a bagful of wickets, you have to treat every over as the most important over. I bowled 25-26 good overs and capitalised on it. It was a period of pressure that I could keep on batter for two days.” Ashwin also conceded that it was good to get the big haul in the bag. “You can go to bed feeling a lot better instead of having just three wickets in your kitty. It does feel good as you end up with a good bag of wickets,” said Ashwin. “I will go to bed tonight a bit early and a bit happier. Sometimes numbers speak easily for the bowler and I felt completely happy in my own cocoon about how the ball has been coming out of my hand.” Thanks to Ashwin, the entire Indian team will sleep a little easier tonight.

Spanish prosecutors have filed a complaint after it was reported last month that between 2001 and 2018 Barcelona paid more than 7million euros (£6.2million) to companies owned by Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, who was vice-president of the Spanish FA’s refereeing committee from 1993 to 2018. In a statement reported by local media, the public prosecutor’s office said: “Through presidents (Sandro) Rosell and (Jose Maria) Bartomeu, Barcelona reached and maintained a strictly confidential verbal agreement with the defendant Negreira, so that, in his capacity as vice president of the refereeing committee and in exchange for money, he would carry out actions aimed at favouring Barcelona in the decision making of the referees in the matches played by the club, and thus in the results of the competitions.” READ MORE: The curious case of Alex Neil and Stoke City The focus of the case is on payments made between 2014 and 2018. Rosell served as president from 2010 to 2014, with Bartomeu replacing him and remaining in the post until 2020. Former club executives Oscar Grau and Albert Soler, were listed among the defendents in the case. A judge must yet decide whether to take up the case. Barcelona have not publicly commented on Friday’s development, but last month denied wrongdoing. A statement said they had paid an external consultant for “technical reports related to professional refereeing”, arguing it was common practice in the game. On Tuesday, current Barca president Joan Laporta said: “Barca have never bought referees nor influence. That was never the intention and that has to be clear.

The new song ‘Halla Bol’ is written by lyricist Sholke Lal, composed and sung by famous Bollywood score composer and singer Amit Trivedi, and ably complemented by renowned Rajasthani folk singer Mame Khan. The song aims to appeal to the diverse fanbase of the franchise by encapsulating the spirit of the Royals with the way cry of ‘Halla Bol’ which is beautifully fused through a mixture of modern and folk music, and has a chantable appeal to it, as per a press release from the team. The new song lyrically retains the essence of the culture and the state of Rajasthan but differs musically from the older versions of the team’s anthems ‘Halla Bol’ and ‘Phir Halla Bol’ which were based on more traditional notes. The idea behind the new song is to evoke a strong in-stadia experience that motivates the players and is exciting enough for the fans at the venues to groove to – creating a unique, tantalising atmosphere for the Royals family by also connecting to a newer and younger generation. The lyrics of the song symbolise the diverse facets of being a true Royal – creating a beautiful fusion of two generations – where the traditional fan meets the modern-day fanatic. The song emphasizes the undying spirit of the Royals that is laced with resilience and resoluteness, and the limitless hunger to win on the field. The core essence of our home state is retained by introducing catchphrases in both Hindi and English, giving it a much wider mass appeal and the potential to be chanted at the stadiums by the Royals supporters. The outro reiterates the modern Royals philosophy. “Music is an important, vibrant way for the Royals, both players and fans, to connect emotionally. It has been fantastic to see the love from our fans in the creation of this song. I can’t wait to hear them chanting it in the stadium, helping drive us to victory,” stated Jake Lush McCrum, Chief Executive Officer, Rajasthan Royals. Amit Trivedi, who revealed the Rajasthan Royals Official Song at a recent concert he performed in the franchise’s home city of Jaipur, said, “My first reaction to Rajasthan Royals was ‘Halla Bol’. I’ve been following the IPL for a long time now, so I was very excited. I am also very closely attached to Rajasthan, its folk music, and the artists there. And when the idea came through cricket and the Royals team, it excited me and I thought everything is fitting beautifully well.” “With emphasis on having a song that can be chanted inside the stadiums to blow the roof off, and also in other settings across spheres, it’s been a pleasure bringing the Royals’ vibe to life. The war cry of ‘Halla Bol’ has resonated with so many Royals players and fans, and I hope that this new musical showpiece with Mame Khan can inspire the fans to really ‘Halla Bol’,” said Trivedi. Rajasthan Royals will start their IPL 2023 campaign against Sunrisers Hyderabad from April 2.

On Thursday, she stretched her lead at the top with three more wickets against Delhi Capitals, sending them on their way to 105 all out. Capitals headed into what was a clash between two unbeaten sides with back-to-back 200-plus totals. But they were undone by the brilliance of Ishaque, who’s taken a rough path to the glitz and glamour of the WPL. Ishaque comes from a humble background in Park Circus, a neighbourhood in south Kolkata. She was introduced to the sport by her father, who passed away 15 years ago. She did the hard yards at the Under-19 and Under-23 levels for Bengal before playing for the senior side. But a shoulder injury in 2018 pegged her back for a couple of years and the road forward was tough. Ishaque struggled to pick up wickets on her return and was then left out of the Bengal side. Low on confidence, she was introduced to former Bengal left-arm spin allrounder Shibsagar Singh in 2021, and he helped her make technical adjustments. Watching some footage of her, Shibsagar observed that Ishaque was bowling very full and not letting the ball turn enough. “I saw that she is talented and there is something different about her, and made her understand what her issue is,” Shibsagar told ESPNcricinfo. “I asked her to pull her length back a touch, that allowed the ball to deviate, rather than bowling it full and not letting it turn. I also told her to not try for wickets but concentrate on bowling in the right way. “I told her to focus on bowling one ball at a time and not think of the entire over or other stuff. Her mindset slowly began changing. Her earlier focus was on wanting to pick X wickets in Y overs.” Former India allrounder Rumeli Dhar, who also captained Ishaque at Bengal, loved the gusty, fighting character that Ishaque was in the side. Bowling to batters who attack was something she particularly revelled in. “When I was the captain, there were a couple of instances where I have asked her if she would be able to pick up a tough wicket and she upfront used to say yes and did it too,” Dhar said. “She is badmaash [naughty] but she is fun-loving. She knows to have fun and also knows how to make people laugh. “[Ever since her comeback] she knows where she should land the ball to get it to spin and trouble the batter. She has learnt how to respond to captains’ and coaches’ calls of bowling in specific areas and situations. She has a lot of control with her bowling.” Capitals would learn of it the hard way. Meg Lanning and Shafali Verma, easily one of the most dangerous opening pairs in the WPL, had a 162-run stand in Capitals’ opening game and then put up a half-century partnership against UP Warriorz heading into the game against Mumbai. Ishaque, though, struck the first blow off her sixth ball, having Shafali play around a flighted delivery that was slanted into the stumps to bowl her. Capitals were briefly buoyed by a fifty-run stand between Lanning and Jemimah Rodrigues – going from 31 for 3 to 81 for 3 – but then Ishaque was at it again. Brought back in the 13th over for her third, Ishaque again attacked the stumps and just fired it in a touch, only for Rodrigues to go back and miss her cut and be bowled. The left-arm spinner then struck a telling blow on the last ball by floating one up outside off and enticing Lanning to charge down and take the aerial route only for her to hit it to extra cover. This all came after a four-wicket haul against Gujarat Giants at DY Patil Stadium to set up her team in the WPL curtain-raiser. While it was captain Harmanpreet Kaur who stole the show with her scintillating fifty, Ishaque’s exploits made sure everyone took note of her too. And so far, of her nine wickets in the WPL, seven have been either bowled or lbw.Ahead of the WPL, Shibsagar took Ishaque to the East Bengal club to train with male cricketers. He specifically asked them to attack her in a bid to prepare her for the WPL, and he liked what he saw. “She is dimaagwali (intelligent). Never afraid to bowl the tough overs – she will bowl two overs in the powerplay and then also want to bowl at the death,” Shibsagar said. “Any bowler can get hit but she is always confident of picking up wickets.” The WPL, it is expected, will be a means to unearth uncapped talents and fast track them into the national set-up. Given Ishaque’s WPL performances have come at a time when India’s incumbent left-arm spinners Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Radha Yadav are struggling for consistency and penetration, Ishaque could well be on this path. Published on By Andy Murray won a deciding set for the seventh time this season to reach the second round at Indian Wells.The British former world number one defeated Tomas Etcheverry 6-7 (5-7) 6-1 6-4 in a match that lasted three hours and 12 minutes.Murray had no fewer than 20 break points, 16 of which were saved by the 23-year-old Argentine. “I really felt like I was in the driving seat for much of the match,” Murray told BBC Sport. “I was creating lots of opportunities but I just wasn’t able to capitalise. I made some poor decisions at times, but in the end did really well to get through that.” Etcheverry was the sharper man in a first set tie-break, which he won 7-5, and had a break point for a 2-1 lead in the second.But Murray saved that break point before running away with the second set. Both players had chances in the deciding set. Etcheverry had two break points at 4-3 but Murray saved them with some fine serving, then secured the decisive break in the next game as the Argentine double faulted. “I’m not going to keep winning every three-set match that I play, but it’s been an amazing start to the year,” Murray continued. “It was still a good effort to turn that around as the first set was extremely long and I was thinking ‘here we go again’. “This is a place where I haven’t always played my best tennis so I was really happy that I managed to turn that around.” Murray will play Spain’s world number 17 Pablo Carreno Busta in the second round on Saturday.Murray’s victory came after 21-year-old compatriot Jack Draper thrashed Switzerland’s Leandro Riedi 6-1 6-1, to set up a second-round meeting with fellow Briton Dan Evans. The left-hander had not played since mid-January when he lost to Spain’s Rafael Nadal at the Australian Open.Showing no signs of the leg injury he had been dealing with, Draper looked sharp as he dismantled 135th-ranked Riedi’s serve.Draper, ranked 56th, broke in six of his seven return games as well as dominating on his own serve.Despite a seven-week lay-off, Draper showed why is one of the ATP Tour’s rising young stars by striking the ball confidently and consistently in an impressive performance. The rapid win sets up an intriguing match against 24th seed Evans, who will surely provide a sterner test than Riedi did on his debut in an ATP Masters event.Evans, 32, received a first-round bye in the Californian desert and the Davis Cup team-mates will play each other competitively for the first time later this week.Speaking about Evans, Draper told BBC Sport: “He’s a really nice human being and whenever I’ve had moments where I’ve not felt great he’s always sent me a message, and I appreciate that from an older player. “He definitely cares and it’s the same with Murray and [Cameron] Norrie – they’ve paved the way for me a little bit and they’ve always been supportive in my practice sessions and given me the confidence I’ve needed to get to this level quicker, so I’m very grateful to the likes of Dan.” Published on By Sri Lanka’s seamers edged the visitors ahead on the second day of play at Hagley Oval as New Zealand’s batters were made to grind in their pursuit of Sri Lanka’s first innings total of 355. Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara picked up two wickets apiece, while Kasun Rajitha, arguably the pick of the bowlers, grabbed a deserved scalp in the final half hour of play. For the hosts, Tom Latham top scored with a dogged 67, while Daryl Mitchell remained unbeaten on 40 alongside Michael Bracewell on 9 at stumps. The day was one that belonged to the seamers, however, starting with the New Zealand pair of Tim Southee and Matt Henry, who picked up four more wickets between them to wrap up the Sri Lankan innings in the morning session. Dhananjaya de Silva, Sri Lanka’s last recognised batter, fell having added just 10 runs to his overnight total, wafting at one outside off, while the rest of the Lankan tail came together to add a further 40, as Sri Lanka finished on 355. The New Zealand openers for their part made it through the six overs prior to lunch with little trouble. Post lunch, while Latham was going, New Zealand’s progress was slow but steady. Alongside his opening partner Devon Conway, he weathered the early movement utilised by the likes of Asitha and Rajitha, while there was also a little bit more zip to the surface as opposed to the opening day, which aided the likes of Kumara. Nevertheless the pair stuck to their tasks, milking ones and twos on the onside and down the ground, while awaiting rare short and wide deliveries to secure boundaries. The pair would put on 67 for the opening stand, however just when Sri Lanka’s seamers might have been tiring Asitha provided the breakthrough, getting one to nip back and trap Conway leg before. Conway might count himself a touch unfortunate though to have been given out by the on-field umpire, with DRS showing umpire’s call on both impact and whether it was hitting the wickets. That wicket would give Sri Lanka a renewed burst of energy to seek a second before the break, and Kane Williamson would oblige on the stroke of tea, with an uppish drive straight to the man catching at cover. Henry Nicholls would then fall shortly after the restart, top edging a pull off Lahiru Kumara. At this point Sri Lanka were well and truly on top, a state of affairs punctuated by the excellent Rajitha, who would torment Mitchell – who had just arrived at the crease – probing and teasing his off stump. That Mitchell would survive this period was a minor miracle, particularly after one delivery that – to borrow a phrase from football parlance – might have given him twisted blood. Angling in from slightly wide of the crease, Rajitha would pitch this on the border of offstump, on the edge of a good length, and then get it to shape away right at the death, beating Mitchell and the stumps by the barest of margins. If not for a graze on the outside of the pad, his stumps would have certainly been under threat. Sri Lanka’s only misstep might have been offering Angelo Mathews, with his 115kph gentle seamers, the ball during this period, though the thought process behind it – providing the front line seamers a rest while still utilising the swing on offer – was understandable. This period offered the New Zealand batters a minor reprieve, with Mitchell memorably launching Mathews down the ground for a six. Mitchell and Latham would proceed to put on 58 together before another moment of brilliance swung the pendulum back towards the visitors. Following periods of spin from Prabath Jayasuriya and Dhananjaya de Silva, Asitha returned to dismiss Latham in explosive fashion – a leg stump yorker from around the wicket, and an animated send off to boot. Rajitha would then finally get the wicket his performance deserved, getting Blundell to nick one through after yet another exquisite out swinger on off stump. Mitchell and Bracewell would survive till stumps, but with a 193-run deficit ahead of them, Sri Lanka would undoubtedly be the happier of the two sides going into day three. 355 (Kusal Mendis 87,Dimuth Karunaratne 50; Tim Southee 5- 64, Matt Henry 4-80) lead New Zealand 165/5 (Tom Latham 67; Daryl Mitchell 40*; Lahiru Kumara 2-34, Asitha Fernando 2-42) by 190 runs Published on By Angelo Mathews has taken aim at the Test-match schedule Sri Lanka has been lumped with. His complaint: Sri Lanka will not play enough Tests, particularly this year. This, despite there being an outside chance that Sri Lanka could play in the World Test Championship final, so long as Australia win or draw their last Test against India, and Sri Lanka beat New Zealand 2-0, in New Zealand. These remain unlikely outcomes, even though both Australia and Sri Lanka have had good days with the bat on Thursday.But Mathews essentially asks what value the cricket world places in Tests any more, if the scheduling is so lopsided. “Unfortunate that we are not playing too many Test matches this year – it’s as few as five,” he said, on the day he became Sri Lanka’s third-highest Test scorer, in Christchurch. “We are coming off a long layoff – the last Test was six months back.” Mathews is correct that there are only five Tests on the schedule for Sri Lanka in 2023 (two against New Zealand, two against Pakistan, and one against Ireland, who are not WTC opposition just yet). He is not correct on how long it’s been since Sri Lanka’s last Test before this one. It has been seven months. “Everyone’s talking about Test cricket dying, but we’re not doing any good for Test cricket playing only five Tests a year. Hopefully we’ll get more matches this year. Five feels like not enough.” In fact, right through the WTC cycle to follow this one, Sri Lanka are not scheduled to play a single three-Test series. Meanwhile, India, Australia and England routinely play five-Test series against each other through the same period. At the worst, they play four-Test series. The WTC structure requires the teams that qualify to play an equal number of WTC series between each other through the course of the cycle. But aside from India, England and Australia (the Big Three), most other sides play two-Test series, except when they play one of the Big Three sides, when they may have a three-Test encounter on the books. Jason Holder and Anrich Nortje – currently playing a two-Test series in South Africa – had also voiced how every team apart from the Big Three were barely playing any Tests these days.","pubDate":"2023-03-11 00:01:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"News24.com | SA's Rilee Rossouw smashes fastest 100 in Pakistan Super League history","link":"https://www.news24.com/sport/Cricket/sas-rilee-rossouw-smashes-fastest-100-in-pakistan-super-league-history-20230310","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South African batsman Rilee Rossouw made headlines in the Pakistan Super League when he smashed a stunning century to help his side chase down a mammoth total.","content":"South African batsman Rilee Rossouw made headlines in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on Friday when he smashed a stunning century to help his side chase down a mammoth total.

The BBC confirmed it has been unable to find a presenter willing to fill in the vacant role. A spokesperson said: 'Some of our pundits have said that they don’t wish to appear on the programme while we seek to resolve the situation with Gary. 'We understand their position and we have decided that the programme will focus on match action without studio presentation or punditry.' A source close to the Match of the Day program also told MailOnline that even the production team 'is considering walking in support of Gary Lineker and have contacted their union' however they are cautious to go ahead, because as there has 'been no ballot action, they won't be protected by law.' Fellow football pundit Ian Wright today tweeted that he would also shun presenting Match of the Day while the ban is in place, expressing 'solidarity' with his co-host Alan Shearer is the latest withdrawal from Match of the Day, tweeting this evening: 'I have informed the BBC that I won't be appearing on MOTD tomorrow night' Match of the Day's decision to take Gary Lineker (left) off air over his comments about the Government has led to a walkout from fellow hosts Alan Shearer (centre) and Ian Wright (right) The decision to streamline the programme was taken after fellow football pundit Ian Wright sparked a mutiny by announcing that he would shun presenting Match of the Day while the ban is in place, expressing 'solidarity' with his co-host. Alan Shearer then said he would follow suit, tweeting this evening: 'I have informed the BBC that I won't be appearing on MOTD tomorrow night.' Alex Scott has also ruled herself out of tomorrow's show, sharing a meme with the word 'nah', while Bookies' former favourite Jermaine Jenas has also confirmed he won't host leaving the BBC with a host of frontline talent effectively on strike.

Broadcaster Piers Morgan, a friend of Lineker's, also tweeted his disgust, branding the BBC's decision 'pathetically spineless'. Morgan added: 'I now demand the BBC suspend every presenter who has made public comment about news or current affairs - starting with Sir David Attenborough and Lord Sugar.' Channel 5 News presenter Dan Walker earlier said on air that Lineker told him 'they've [the BBC] told me I have to step back'. Speaking on Channel 5 News, Walker said: 'It's one of those strange situations where I'm actually texting the man himself (Lineker) at the moment. 'And I have asked Gary Lineker the question about whether he is stepping back or whether the BBC have told him to step back and I've told him that if he responds to me that I will read out that text on air. 'There's one word in there I can't use, but he has said 'No, they've told me I have to step back'. Alex Scott has also ruled herself out of tomorrow's show, sharing a meme with the word 'nah' Lineker's son George tweeted mischievously: 'RIP MOTD tomorrow' Gary Lineker will step back from presenting Match of the Day pending further discussions with his bosses, the BBC announced today. He's seen outside his London home this morning Channel 5 News presenter Dan Walker said Gary Lineker has told him 'they've [the BBC] told me I have to step back' The Match of the Day host accused ministers of using 'language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 1930s' 'So Gary Lineker wants to continue to present Match Of The Day and is not apologising for what he's said but he's said it's a BBC decision to force him to not present the programme at the moment.' Lineker's son George tweeted mischievously: 'RIP MOTD tomorrow.' BBC bosses had told Lineker either to stop his politicised posts or give up working for the corporation. Last night a senior source said: ‘It’s now up to Lineker – he needs to choose.’ Another well-placed insider described the presenters’ mutiny as a ‘proper BBC crisis’. However the decision has been welcomed by some, with former Tory leader William Hague said it was 'appropriate' for Gary Lineker to step back from hosting Match Of The Day. 'He broke the guidelines I think of the BBC with comments that are highly politicised, which BBC presenters are not meant to do. So that's against the rules and we've got to do something about that, otherwise every presenter can do so on every programme,' he told Times Radio. 'I think it is appropriate for him to step back.' Lord Hague added 'I don't know if you can separate' Lineker's personal social media and role as a BBC presenter. The BBC said Lineker would 'step back' from presenting the programme until he and his bosses had reached an 'agreed and clear position' on his use of social media. The BBC's highest paid star sparked a huge political row this week after comparing the language used to launch a new government crackdown on migrants arriving across the Channel in small boats to 1930s Germany. Elsewhere, members of the public who support Lineker will likely view his ban as a sign that the BBC is acting 'at the Government's behest', the BBC's former controller of editorial policy said. Richard Ayre, who also served as a member of Ofcom's content board, told BBC Radio 4's Today PM programme this afternoon that the BBC had 'no choice' but to take action against Lineker after his tweets criticising the Government's asylum policy. He said: 'I think it was inevitable.' 'He [Lineker] has the letters BBC written across his forehead and yet he's plunged right into the most controversial story of the day.' 'The fact is this was an immediate issue which Tim Davie, the Director General, couldn't sit on over the weekend, he had to solve it this week. He's clearly tried to solve it and reach an agreement with Gary Lineker, they've failed, so this has been the BBC decision. Whether this story moves on depends on what Gary Lineker says himself in the next few hours.' 'It's inevitable now that having in effect not sacked him but removed him temporarily at least, the BBC will not come under a torrent of criticism saying it's acting under the Government's behest.' Former BBC Newsnight host Emily Maitlis, who was herself reprimanded by the BBC for sharing a tweet the corporation viewed as 'controversial', said her former employer could face a 'much, much bigger battle' after its Gary Lineker decision. 'I'm not sure when they suggested to Gary Lineker he step back from (Match Of The Day) the BBC realised it might be starting a much much bigger battle,' she tweeted. Former BBC executive Richard Sambrook said there is 'a lot of confusion' around whether freelance broadcasters such as Gary Lineker - who do not work in news - should be subject to the same rules as permanent staff. Mr Sambrook, who was director of news at the BBC and director of BBC Global News and the BBC World Service, was asked Lineker's comments. He replied: 'I think the language he used was unnecessarily provocative but the wider question here is whether a sports presenter in his private life has to be bound by BBC policies. 'Traditionally, the BBC would always want that to be the case but I think in the current day and age when we live in a world full of social media, when journalism broadcasters have the ability to go and work for other people or do their own podcasts and all the rest of it, that's a bit of an unrealistic expectation.' Lineker's comments were criticised by Downing Street and a raft of Tory heavyweights including Home Secretary Suella Braverman and James Cleverly, the Foreign Secretary. The former Leicester striker has a history of controversial political interventions on everything from Brexit and the Tories to protests by Just Stop Oil and the fate of Shamima Begum . Gary Lineker, 62, reportedly refused to apologise for his comments comparing the Government's migration policy to Nazi Germany and he has been roundly supported by colleagues Lineker's tweeting history has raised more than a few eyebrows over the years A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC has been in extensive discussions with Gary and his team in recent days.

The BBC has faced repeated calls to sack Lineker over his anti-Tory tweets, while Mr Cleverly this morning swiped that the ex-England footballer was 'desperate to gain attention'. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, speaking on a visit to Glasgow, defended Lineker's right to make his political views known. A Labour spokesman said: 'The BBC's cowardly decision to take Gary Lineker off air is an assault on free speech in the face of political pressure. Tory politicians lobbying to get people sacked for disagreeing with Government policies should be laughed at, not pandered to. The BBC should rethink.'

'I wouldn't personally say what Gary Lineker has said, but I would defend his right to say it,' the Labour leader said. 'What I see here is a Government that hasn't got a proper answer in relation to control of our borders and is looking around, as it always does, to other people to blame, Gary Lineker, the BBC, civil servants, anybody. 'I think anybody watching this will be crying out for a government that actually says 'There's a problem here, it's a problem of our making, we're going to stand up and we're going to fix it'. 'The sooner we can get back to that grown-up approach and not just casting blame around the better.' Rishi Sunak insisted his Government's actions over the Channel migrant crisis were the 'compassionate thing to do' Lineker has refused to step down and the BBC has yet to take action against him over his outburst. Mr Cleverly urged the ex-sportsman to study history 'a little bit more carefully' in the wake of his Nazi Germany jibe. Speaking to LBC from Paris, where the PM and his top team met their French counterparts today, the Foreign Secretary said: 'There are some people desperate to gain attention by using deeply offensive and inappropriate language about this. 'I would gently suggest they read their history books a little bit more carefully. The simple truth of the matter is the UK is a welcoming and hospitable country.' Former culture secretary Nadine Dorries also weighed in. The TV host and MP said that failure to fire Lineker would mean the BBC was only paying 'lip service' to its remit of impartiality. Mr Sunak himself insisted his Government's actions on the Channel migrant crisis were the 'moral and compassionate thing to do'. 'I strongly believe that what we're doing is the right thing to do,' the PM said today, when asked about Mr Lineker's intervention. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, on a visit to Paris, this morning swiped that the ex-England footballer was 'desperate to gain attention' Gary Lineker's long list of Twitter controversies January 2023 Then-culture secretary Michelle Donelan said the BBC should be 'conscious' of recent comments made by Lineker. Ms Donelan was speaking to The News Agents podcast about remarks Lineker had made on the same show about the World Cup in Qatar and racism in America. October 2022 Lineker breached BBC impartiality rules with a social media post criticising the Tories, the broadcaster's complaints team ruled. The Match of the Day host, 62, used Twitter to quote an article about Liz Truss – then foreign secretary – urging Premier League teams to boycott the Champions League final in Russia. In his post, the former England striker, who has more than 8.7million followers on Twitter, added: 'And her party will hand back their donations from Russian donors?'. August 2022 Lineker sparked a row with a senior BBC journalist this year with a Tweet about sewerage. He wrote on Twitter: 'As a politician how could you ever, under any circumstances, bring yourself to vote for pumping sewage into our seas? Unfathomable!' The tweet prompted veteran BBC journalist Neil Henderson, a home and foreign news editor, to ask the £1.35million-a-year presenter if his contract allowed him to breach the corporation's impartiality rules. The journalist wrote to him: 'The BBC lives or dies by its impartiality. If you can't abide it, get off it.' Mr Henderson, following discussions with BBC bosses, later issued an apology. July 2022 Lineker found himself at odds with ex-racing driver turned Sky commentator Martin Brundle over his response to a Just Stop Oil protest. Protesters stormed the British Grand Prix, sparking fury from Brundle, who said they could have been killed. Lineker tweeted: 'History will look back very favourably on these people'. But Brundle replied: 'Gary please don't encourage this reckless behaviour. 'They'd have been sliced into 100 pieces and fans, marshals and drivers were wholly at risk of injury and death. I totally support freedom of speech and opinion, but do it responsibly.' October 2020 Lineker said he had spoken to the BBC's director-general Tim Davie 'quite a few times in recent weeks' and that Mr Davie was 'perfectly happy' with his conduct on social media. His comments came after new guidelines and training were announced by the BBC to 'ensure the highest possible standards of impartiality' among staff at the broadcaster. February 2018 Lineker was challenged over his comments on Brexit by BBC cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew. Agnew, responding to one of Lineker's posts, Tweeted: 'Gary. You are the face of BBC Sport. Please observe BBC editorial guidelines... I'd be sacked if I followed your example. Thanks.' <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_4 - -> Advertisement 'I think it's the fair thing to do and I actually believe that it's the moral and compassionate thing to do, and I've made that argument multiple times. 'I'll continue to make it and I think actually the more people think about this challenge and how best to address it they will see that it is the right approach. 'And actually I was pleased that there was actually quite a lot of strong support for the approach we've outlined now that we've outlined it, because this is about thinking what's the best way to help the world's most vulnerable people.' Yesterday Mrs Braverman accused Lineker of diminishing the tragedy of the Holocaust as ministers engaged in an open row with the BBC star. She said she found the comments 'offensive' because her husband is Jewish. 'My children are therefore directly descendant from people who were murdered in gas chambers during the Holocaust,' she told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast. 'To kind of throw out those kind of flippant analogies diminishes the unspeakable tragedy that millions of people went through and I don't think anything that is happening in the UK today can come close to what happened in the Holocaust. 'So I find it a lazy and unhelpful comparison to make.' House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt claimed Labour were 'borrowing from the Gary Lineker playbook' by being the 'party of goal hangers' taking easy shots against the Government. The ex-England striker hit back at Ms Mordaunt's 'clumsy analogy', saying he was 'just happy to have been better in the six-yard box than you are at the dispatch box'. Lineker has said he is looking forward to presenting Match of the Day this weekend despite the 'ridiculously out of proportion story' surrounding his comments. Criticising the Government's new asylum plans earlier this week, he tweeted: 'There is no huge influx. We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. 'This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the '30s.' Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said he would boycott Match Of The Day. Mr Farron tweeted: 'And I will be stepping back from watching the programme until the @BBC grows a backbone. Still, I'm sure we can count on the Free Speech Union to stand up against this hysterical act of cancellation...' Henry Winter, the chief football writer for The Times who has regularly appeared on the BBC's Radio 5 Live, said the broadcaster should be 'ashamed' by its decision. 'Disappointing that coverage of (Match Of The Day) dictated by politicians,' he tweeted. 'Not what BBC should be about. BBC should be ashamed. Should be independent of No 10. Ian Wright replaced by Ian Duncan-Smith? 'Many good people working for BBC football who deserve better from their craven bosses.' Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised Gary Lineker and Ian Wright on Twitter. Corbyn wrote: 'Well done @GaryLineker for standing up for refugees. Well done @IanWright0 for showing the meaning of solidarity. 'Now, let's mobilise against a politics of cruelty, and defeat this inhumane, illegal & immoral legislation.' Former culture secretary Nadine Dorries has said she welcomes the decision for Gary Lineker to step back from Match Of The Day, saying it shows the BBC is 'serious about impartiality'. 'News that @GaryLineker has been stood down for investigation is welcome and shows @BBC are serious about impartiality,' the TalkTV host tweeted. Does the BBC need Gary Lineker more than he needs them? How ex-footballer has amassed £26m fortune with podcasts, broadcasting and advertising deals (just don't mention the two divorces and HMRC tax row) Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said he would boycott Match Of The Day amid the Gary Lineker row. Sharing a headline saying the presenter will be 'stepping back' from the show, Mr Farron tweeted: 'And I will be stepping back from watching the programme until the @BBC grows a backbone. Still, I'm sure we can count on the Free Speech Union to stand up against this hysterical act of cancellation...'

Ian Wright replaced by Ian Duncan-Smith? 'Many good people working for BBC football who deserve better from their craven bosses.' By Martin Robinson, Chief Reporter for MailOnline Gary Lineker earns £1.36-million-a-year from the BBC for Match of the Day, Sports Personality of the Year and other shows in a near three-decade broadcasting career that has helped him build a £26million nest egg. The 62-year-old is the highest-paid 'talent' at the c orporation but as the Beeb considers standing by him yet again over his highly political tweets, experts are pondering if another reprieve is a clear sign they need him much more than he needs them. The footballer turned broadcaster has amassed much of his fortune since starting at the BBC in the mid-1990s – but insists he does not fear leaving over the row where he compared Tory policy on migrants in boats to Nazi Germany. And MailOnline can reveal that he has close to ten other income streams with four years until the twice-married father-of-four hits retirement age – although a legal battle with HMRC over a £4.9million tax bill looms large in 2023. Lineker has four sons with his first wife, Michelle: Angus, 24, Tobias, 26, Harry, 28, and the eldest George, who is 30. He divorced from his second wife, Danielle Bux, six years ago. He said recently 'I've been married twice. I've got four kids. That's an expensive business'. Lineker promotes his own range of sunglasses and glasses, which he handpicks, for High Street chain Vision Express Lineker is also an investor in an insurance company which aims to reduce premiums for car and van drivers, as long as their driving is tracked Apart from his high-profile presenting roles, he features in big-brand television advertising campaigns but also runs a TV production company – Goalhanger Films – which he uses to sell even more of his work to the BBC. And it is Goalhanger's burgeoning podcast business that is predicted to make him even richer. His first shows were recorded at the kitchen table of his £4.8million Victorian property in Barnes, south-west London. He is also believed to own a property in Surrey where he has hosted at least two refugees. The Goalhanger stable also includes The Rest Is Politics, hosted by Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart, and The Rest Is History, presented by Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook - the latter widely considered as one of the UK's best podcasts. Gary's son Harry works for his dad's business, which has a growing list of hits including, you guessed it, Gary's own Match of the Day: Top Ten show with Alan Shearer, Micah Richards, Ian Wright and others. Eldest son George is co-founder of Your Business Number, Angus is a business development manager and Tobias is a DJ. Last year Lineker hailed the 'incredible growth' of the podcast arm, which is now signed up with global entertainment agency WME, even admitting that he could leave the BBC to work on it full time. He has three years left on his lucrative BBC deal - but with calls for him to be sacked over his tweets, it may not hit him that hard financially he moved on. He told The New Statesman last year when asked if he might work on Goalhanger full time: 'Maybe. Who knows? Life's thrown many things at me. And I'm 61. We don't really know what the boundaries are in terms of growth. But it's a very, very good business'. Gary Lineker married his first wife Michelle in 1986 but they later divorced. He later married Danielle Bux but they divorced in 2016 Gary with his four lookalike sons in 2013: Harry, Angus, George and Tobias (left to right) Mr Lineker is currently appealing in the courts after HMRC pursued him for £4.9million under IR35 legislation - rules designed to stop contractors working as 'disguised employees'. The tax man believes that Lineker should be treated as an employee by the BBC because he does so much regular work for them, meaning the star should pay more to the treasury. Mr Lineker disagrees. Last month a preliminary hearing in London was told Lineker has now paid the income tax bill in full but he is appealing. HMRC pursued him for the sum that it claimed should have been paid on income received between 2013 and 2018. Lineker insists all taxes were paid on the income through a partnership set up in 2012 with his ex-wife Danielle Bux and is appealing against the demand. The presenter is expected to argue that his partnership Gary Lineker Media (GLM) is required to funnel his income through because of the wide variety of work he does. HMRC will claim his extensive work for BT Sport and the BBC means he should be classed as an employee for tax purposes, because he agrees to do a minimum number of games and shows for the broadcaster. One of his first TV jobs away from football was as the face of Walkers crisps, and the Leicester-born star last year signed a new three-year deal with the firm – the snacks are made in his home city. The deal sees him feature in television advert campaigns and on social media. He has been working with the brand for more than 27 years, first teaming up with Walkers in 1994, and has now appeared in 150 adverts. Lineker is also an investor in an insurance company which aims to reduce premiums for drivers between the ages of 17 and 25. Ticker sends a box to the driver which they then place on their windscreen. The gadget pairs to a phone via bluetooth, sending the driver's behaviour on the road to the Ticker app, with the idea that the information can be used to provide cheaper insurance for safer young motorists. Described as the future of car insurance, the company is also backed by former Formula 1 driver Mark Blundell. Gary Lineker has been working with the brand for 27 years, first teaming up with Walkers in 1994, and has now appeared in 150 adverts In 2019, along with his friend and fellow broadcaster Danny Baker, Lineker published a book full of football anecdotes called Behind Closed Doors He is also a director of 'GCGL Properties Ltd' - described on Companies House as a 'development of building projects' business. As part of Lineker's £1.36 million deal with the Beeb, he presents Match Of The Day and other big sporting events. He is also one of the hosts of the Sports Personality of the Year event. Few BBC viewers will know that some of the programmes Lineker hosts are not part of his deal with the broadcaster but shows he sells to them through his production company. In 2020 he hosted and made Football, Prince William And Our Mental Health through Goalhanger Films. He has made others for the Corporation with stars including Marcus Rashford and Wayne Rooney, and featuring his beloved Leicester City. He also produces podcasts for the BBC. He recently announced a show he is making about tennis superstar Serena Williams, which he has sold to Amazon. He made a reputed £3 million from investing in Ingenie, a car insurance firm which was sold in 2014 He also works works for LaLiga TV. Lineker quit one big-money deal at BT Sport for another – transferring to La Liga to present football matches from the top Spanish division, live from Barcelona. Lineker still speaks Spanish after his time playing for the Catalan giants and he signed a multi-year contract with LaLigaTV. Speaking of the job, he said he was 'thrilled', adding: 'I have fond memories of my time playing in Spain and very much look forward to sharing the excitement of La Liga with viewers in the UK and elsewhere.' There are also books. In 2019, along with his friend and fellow broadcaster Danny Baker, Lineker published a book full of football anecdotes called Behind Closed Doors. A bestseller, it was culled from a podcast the pair presented and reveals jaw-dropping stories from the dressing room and open-top bus ceremonies, apparently 'all served up with lashings of wit and ribald humour.' As one of television's most prominent spectacle-wearers, it was only a matter of time before Lineker cashed in on them. He promotes his own range of sunglasses and glasses, which he handpicks, for high street chain Vision Express. The firm says in the 'edit', Lineker 'pays homage to the various fashion eras and styles which have influenced him throughout his life, specifically Italian and Mediterranean styles.' And he's hoping to score with the public in terms of pricing – Lineker spectacle frames cost from £99 and sunglasses are from £39. Lineker is renowned for his snappy suits when presenting his TV shows, which was clearly noticed by upmarket shirt brand TM Lewin, who then signed him up to promote the label. He appeared on its website where he advertised the budget range, starting at £25. He also used to encourage his millions of social media followers to shop at TM Lewin stores before the business went online only. In 2021 it was announced that Lineker would be straddling the BBC and ITV after being lured by the latter to host a new gameshow, named Sitting On A Fortune. In the show contestants can win up to £100,000 and it seems the presenter has hit the jackpot too. It's not known how much he is being paid but TV insiders suggest 'he won't be doing it for peanuts'. Lineker said: 'I am delighted to be hosting what I think and hope will be a show that people love, full of tension with high stakes and bags of drama from start to finish – everything a great game show should be.' A second series is billed to return in 2023.

RECAP | SA v West Indies, Day 3 Yet it was heartening to hear how the phlegmatic Proteas Test skipper also enjoyed the more mundane, perhaps even fun elements to his unbeaten 171, which has put the hosts in a prime position to push for a series whitewash. After all, he later had so much fun that he even donned a baggy green cap. Bavuma, who's called the Bullring his cricketing home for the past 14 years, never scored a red-ball century at the ground until now. \"I've actually never scored a hundred here in first-class cricket,\" he said at the end of his monumental, 369-minute effort to date. \"It's definitely a monkey off my back. The guys are always teasing me that my name isn't on the honours board at my home ground, so I guess I can stick it to them. \"[Jokes aside]... it's also special that it's against the West Indies, because, as I said leading to the series, it means sentimentally quite a lot because I grew up admiring their cricket too. That adds to the achievement.\" READ | Heroic Bavuma’s first Test ton in 7 years puts Proteas on top at the Wanderers The classy stroke-maker could even bask in the manner in which he reached his century - a disdainful lofted cover drive that was never going to be at risk of finding a fielder. In fact, Bavuma had been going about reaching his milestone in a methodical, pragmatic manner, but once he caught sight of his mother Phumza and father Vuyo watching intently from the Unity Stand and an expectant crowd raising their noise level, he decided to get a move on. \"I don't think there was a point where I felt I'd get over the line. When I got to 96, the crowd started picking up in anticipation of the milestone. My emotion started picking up too. I got a ball outside off-stump and I definitely wasn't about to keep it on the ground. I just waited for it,\" he said. And he's not about to let the tired Windies attack off the hook as a double century looms in the distance on Saturday. \"I'm going to try and bat as long as I can. I need the rest to come back fresh [on Saturday]. I'm not about to give my wicket away at any point. The opportunity is there, I definitely want to take it. \"I'm mentally quite tired more than physically. The adrenaline is still keeping me going. I have an ice bath waiting and I'm having a beer with the guys to celebrate. But after that, you have to put it behind you and look what's in front of you.\" Most pertinently though, Bavuma has entrenched his reputation of being the man the Proteas can depend on when the pressure is well and truly on. His most significant knocks at Test level - 54 in Chattogram 2015, 74 in Hobart 2016, 89 in Wellington 2017, 65 in Melbourne 2022 - attest to that. Now he has a big century to add to that collection, one where he came in at 8/2. \"In my Test career, I've found myself in situations where it's 20/4 or 10/2,\" said Bavuma. \"You really have to soak in the pressure and release it. I believe I've done it well in my career even if the scores haven't been as big as today. Walking into today's situation is one that I'm mentally accustomed to. My game leans towards it too.\" His team was grateful.","pubDate":"2023-03-10 21:43:05","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ben Duckett 'solely focused on playing for England' after featuring in Test, T20 and 50-over sides","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-11845429/Ben-Duckett-solely-focused-playing-England-featuring-Test-T20-50-sides.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ben Duckett wants to take every opportunity offered when it comes to playing for England, which is perhaps why he is unique amongst his international team-mates.","content":"Ben Duckett is 'solely focused on playing for England' after featuring in Test, T20 and 50-over sides this year... with Nottinghamshire batsman ready to snub riches of franchise cricket Duckett has defied a bloated schedule to feature in all three formats in 2023 Some team-mates have asked to miss matches to rest or play franchise cricket Batsman has averaged 56.44 in a triumphant return to Test cricket this winter By Richard Gibson For Mailonline Published: 17:12, 10 March 2023 | Updated: 21:11, 10 March 2023 e-mail View comments Ben Duckett wants to take every opportunity offered when it comes to playing for England, which is perhaps why he is unique amongst his international team-mates. For Nottinghamshire batsman Duckett is the only one to have defied a bloated schedule to feature in all three formats in 2023 - and on three separate continents at that. While others have opted out of sectors for one reason or another, the 28-year-old has accepted every invitation, beginning the year with the 50-over team in South Africa , then playing two Tests in New Zealand before arriving here for a Twenty20 series against Bangladesh via a week’s holiday in Dubai . ‘You can play in all these leagues around the world in a few years' time but at the time right now, I'm solely focused on playing as much for England as I can,’ said Duckett. Switching formats without fully preparing does carry jeopardy, however. Duckett joked that he was on a sun lounger two days before his 13-ball 20 in Thursday’s six-wicket defeat in Chittagong, and had just one net session to adjust to the reduction in bounce from antipodean to subcontinental conditions. Ben Duckett has defied a bloated schedule to feature in all three formats for England in 2023 England batsman has averaged 56.44 in a triumphant return to Test cricket this winter It was not quite enough, and his instincts meant he pulled over the top of a shooter from Mustafizur Rahman. Not that he will over-think his dismissal. Duckett is much more relaxed about his cricket than his 21-year-old self making a start as an international here in 2016, and puts that down to the attitude of England’s Test coach Brendon McCullum, summed up by an episode in the epic one-run defeat in Wellington last month. ‘At tea, he said, \"let's go out there and bat for a draw last session”. Obviously, he was joking but that's just how relaxed it is. You are going into the final session of a Test match, needing however many runs and the coach is cracking gags. That just relaxes you,’ he said. ‘His main thing with us is that he genuinely says he's not fussed about the results, it's a chance for us to go out there and express and show the world what we can do - try to make people back home want to watch us. If we lose by the way that we play, so be it.’ This winter, Duckett has averaged 56.44 in a triumphant return to Test cricket, but having won all but one of his 24 caps to date overseas, he is looking forward to what a home Ashes series entails. ‘I've always wanted to play for England again, and it's great, but to play in England in the summer, with packed houses, is something that's pretty exciting,’ he said. ‘I've never had a summer where I've had to manage myself and get ready at the right times, to play for England, and it's something I never thought I'd do, so I'm looking forward to it.’ Share or comment on this article: Ben Duckett 'solely focused on playing for England' after featuring in Test, T20 and 50-over sides e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

The net result was ensuring the second Test between South Africa and the West Indies will go into a fourth day. When Bavuma (171*) strode out at 10:18 at the fall of Tony de Zorzi's wicket, the score was 8/2. But, at the end of an absorbing day, the Proteas finished on 287/7 and with a massive lead of 356. It was largely thanks to Bavuma's broad and often pressured shoulders. Bavuma's 369-minute knock moved South Africa from a position of match-losing weakness to a point where the West Indies now have to reel in the highest successful fourth-innings chase at the Bullring. That's how important Bavuma's dig was, and in an era where three-figure captain's knocks have been few and far between for South Africa. It's worth remembering that Bavuma was subjected to the ignominy of a pair in his first Test as captain - such is the vicious and mischievous, yet enjoyable, nature of cricket. He scored more than half of his team's runs on a day when the West Indies had them on the rack with spells of mesmerising, military medium pace bowling in what was a difficult morning session for the hosts. Kyle Mayers (2/25) and Raymon Reifer (1/30) were unlikely partners in crime, reducing South Africa to 65/4. The Windies must have fancied their chances of batting after tea after Jason Holder's heroic 81* ensured South Africa only had a lead of 69. South Africa only led by 134 and were in danger of being bundled out cheaply, but Bavuma, whose 19 other 50-plus scores have come after his seminal 102* against England at Newlands in January 2016, understood the gravity of the situation and batted with the necessary care, diligence and later on, measured belligerence that befitted the changing situations. The fact that South Africa lost their first wicket off just the third ball of the day was a harbinger of things to come. Elgar (5), who has looked comfortable all series without making the relevant runs, inexplicably guided Mayers to Roston Chase at gully. The tall Roston Chase was so disbelieving of the gift that came in his direction, he had to have two grabs to ensure the catch wasn't grassed. That wicket fell at 10:03. De Zorzi (1) was the next to fall to Mayers, inside-edging a ball that could've been left onto his off-stump. It was a shot that lacked conviction and at 10:17, the Proteas were 8/2. It was important that Markram (18) reigned in his attacking instincts and, in recognising the situation, he did so. However, at 11:00, he received what was the ball of the session when a Kemar Roach delivery that ducked in and moved away squared him up and took his outside edge. That was 32/3 and Joshua da Silva, who was incessantly sledged by the hosts during his crucial partnership with Holder, let off a joint roar with Roach that not only pierced the bright blue sky, but punctured the Proteas' batting soul. Bavuma and Ryan Rickelton (10) needed to keep SA afloat and for 57 minutes in their stand of 37, they both dead batted what came their way and made the most of minimal scoring opportunities. Rickelton, though, was clearly flustered by Reifer's nagging off-stump line that moved the ball away from him. When he was claimed by the left-arm medium pacer on what became the stroke of lunch at 11:57, the Proteas were 69/4. It was definitely advantage West Indies, who were clearly riding the crest of the momentum created by Holder's knock. Bavuma is a noted firefighter, but he needed to move between his salvage job and being run surgeon by stitching together partnerships. He first shared a 24-run stand with Markram, then partnered with Rickelton for 37. The Bavuma/Heinrich Klaasen alliance of 34 had the potential to take the game away from the visitors. The wicket-keeper though succumbed to incessant chatty pressure from his opposite, Da Silva, when Klaasen (14) skied a short-ball that Da Silva caught at square-leg. That meant South Africa was 103/5 after the loss of the wicket at 13:32, leaving Bavuma and the under-pressure Wiaan Mulder (42). They guided South Africa to tea without further loss at 145/5 and Bavuma was on 81. It was from here where Bavuma and Mulder took the game by the scruff of the neck. They took 20 off Roach's first two overs after tea, an assertive move that not only allowed him to spend just seven balls in the 90s, but also brought a significant pressure release. The West Indies had only conceded 65 and 76 runs respectively in the previous two sessions. But in the evening session, they went for 142, 90 coming off Bavuma's bat in the march to his 100 and beyond. The crowd wasn't big, but the outpouring of emotions was intense after Bavuma drilled Joseph for four through cover after a nervy previous delivery. The moment had been worth it, and it rescued his side from a precarious position. It was unfortunate that Mulder didn't reach a deserved maiden Test 50 when he picked out Tagenarine Chanderpaul at fine leg off Joseph, but the monkey was off Bavuma's back. Bavuma needed only 62 balls to motor from 100 to 150 as he nailed home the advantage he had worked so hard to earn. He put together a 71-run stand with Simon Harmer (19) that moved the West Indies' target past the 310/8 Australia had reeled in to beat South Africa in 2011. Harmer didn't see out the day, but Bavuma did and when he was clapped off by the crowd and his opponents, it was well-deserved. Scores in brief: South Africa: 320 and 287/7 (Temba Bavuma 171*, Wiaan Mulder 42, Simon Harmer 19, Kyle Mayers 2/25, Alzarri Joseph 2/49, Jason Holder 1/35, Raymon Reifer 1/36) West Indies: 251 (Holder 81*, Mayers 29, Roston Chase 28, Joshua da Silva 26, Gerald Coetzee 3/41, Kagiso Rabada 2/19, Harmer 2/63) South Africa leads by 356 runs","pubDate":"2023-03-10 20:23:38","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"4th Test, Day 2: Ashwin’s 6-for gives India reason to believe they are still in the game","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/india-vs-australia-4th-test-ashwin-a-class-act/articleshow/98550797.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia had 480 on the board, but if there was a reason to believe that India were still in the game, it was provided by R Ashwin.

In very good conditions for batting, the offie was a class act, bowling nearly 48 overs, 15 of which were maidens to pick up 6 for 91. This was his 26th five-wicket bag at home, one more than the great Anil Kumble, and it’s an effort he’ll cherish for a long time. IANS There are few better slow bowlers in the world for such a challenge than Ashwin. When the Khawaja-Green partnership stretched to 208, and the pair had batted through two complete sessions, Ashwin had to do something different. Shoulders sagged, fielders oohed and aahed, bowlers poured in sweat at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Australia had batted nearly two days in their first innings, in itself an incredible feat, considering that the first three Tests barely lasted three days each. Usman Khawaja was the model Test batsman, soaking up pressure, minimising risk and winning the mental game, batting 11 minutes more than six hours to score 180 off a whopping 422 balls. Cameron Green gave notice of just why Australians are so excited about the giant allrounder, putting his head down and focussing hard on every delivery that came his way to score 114, his first Test century. Australia had 480 on the board, but if there was reason to believe that India were still in the game, it was provided by Ravichandran Ashwin . In conditions that were very good for batting, the offie was a class act, bowling nearly 48 overs, 15 of which were maidens to pick up 6 for 91. This was his 26th five-wicket bag at home, one more than the great Anil Kumble, and it is an effort he will cherish for a long time. In these conditions, it was not simply a matter of turning up, rolling the arm over, landing the ball on a spot and hoping the pitch would do the job with its natural variation. These were conditions in which the bowler had to plan and execute every single dismissal, with the various facets of spin bowling coming together. There are few better slow bowlers in the world for such a challenge than Ashwin. When the Khawaja-Green partnership stretched to 208, and the pair had batted through two complete sessions uninterrupted, Ashwin had to do something different. He packed the leg side field to Green, and came around the stumps, cramping the batsman. The delivery that got the wicket was not the finest, slipping down leg and kissing the glove off the attempted sweep for KS Bharat to catch well, but the thought process showed that Ashwin was not giving up at any stage. Alex Carey’s airy waft, trying to launch Ashwin over the off side was perhaps the one instance of the batsman giving away his wicket, but even here Ashwin had slowed the ball down nicely, allowing it to grip and take the edge. Mitchell Starc was a set-up of a different kind. After firing a succession of quick, flat deliveries, into the left-hander, Ashwin floated in the drifter, drawing the bat forward and catching the inside edge with precision. Todd Murphy , who was proving a proper thorn in the flesh with 41, was done in by the ball that went on with the arm and Nathan Lyon got a loopy ball that clipped the outside edge and went to slip via the keeper’s pad. Ashwin, who is a cricket tragic and has a head for numbers, will be telling his teammates that Australia are far from safe yet. Since 2000 there have been nine instances of visiting teams scoring 400 or more against India. Oddly, only one of those has resulted in a win, with four games being lost and three drawn. India were already well on their way, Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill heading to stumps at 36 without loss. While there was a hint of turn for Ashwin towards the very end of the second day, most of his bowling had happened on a placid pitch. With that being the case, the manner in which he controlled the game — going for just 1.92 runs an over — could well be the difference between the two teams. \"I remember my first tour to Australia in 2011-12, I bowled like how a spinner should bowl, put a lot of revs on the ball and spun it harder if things didn’t work,” said Ashwin. “But what I learnt was that to get a bagful of wickets, you have to treat every over as the most important over. I bowled 25-26 good overs and capitalised on it. It was a period of pressure that I could keep on batter for two days.” Ashwin also conceded that it was good to get the big haul in the bag. “You can go to bed feeling a lot better instead of having just three wickets in your kitty. It does feel good as you end up with a good bag of wickets,” said Ashwin. “I will go to bed tonight a bit early and a bit happier. Sometimes numbers speak easily for the bowler and I felt completely happy in my own cocoon about how the ball has been coming out of my hand.” Thanks to Ashwin, the entire Indian team will sleep a little easier tonight.

Spanish prosecutors have filed a complaint after it was reported last month that between 2001 and 2018 Barcelona paid more than 7million euros (£6.2million) to companies owned by Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, who was vice-president of the Spanish FA’s refereeing committee from 1993 to 2018. In a statement reported by local media, the public prosecutor’s office said: “Through presidents (Sandro) Rosell and (Jose Maria) Bartomeu, Barcelona reached and maintained a strictly confidential verbal agreement with the defendant Negreira, so that, in his capacity as vice president of the refereeing committee and in exchange for money, he would carry out actions aimed at favouring Barcelona in the decision making of the referees in the matches played by the club, and thus in the results of the competitions.” READ MORE: The curious case of Alex Neil and Stoke City The focus of the case is on payments made between 2014 and 2018. Rosell served as president from 2010 to 2014, with Bartomeu replacing him and remaining in the post until 2020. Former club executives Oscar Grau and Albert Soler, were listed among the defendents in the case. A judge must yet decide whether to take up the case. Barcelona have not publicly commented on Friday’s development, but last month denied wrongdoing. A statement said they had paid an external consultant for “technical reports related to professional refereeing”, arguing it was common practice in the game. On Tuesday, current Barca president Joan Laporta said: “Barca have never bought referees nor influence. That was never the intention and that has to be clear.

The new song ‘Halla Bol’ is written by lyricist Sholke Lal, composed and sung by famous Bollywood score composer and singer Amit Trivedi, and ably complemented by renowned Rajasthani folk singer Mame Khan. The song aims to appeal to the diverse fanbase of the franchise by encapsulating the spirit of the Royals with the way cry of ‘Halla Bol’ which is beautifully fused through a mixture of modern and folk music, and has a chantable appeal to it, as per a press release from the team. The new song lyrically retains the essence of the culture and the state of Rajasthan but differs musically from the older versions of the team’s anthems ‘Halla Bol’ and ‘Phir Halla Bol’ which were based on more traditional notes. The idea behind the new song is to evoke a strong in-stadia experience that motivates the players and is exciting enough for the fans at the venues to groove to – creating a unique, tantalising atmosphere for the Royals family by also connecting to a newer and younger generation. The lyrics of the song symbolise the diverse facets of being a true Royal – creating a beautiful fusion of two generations – where the traditional fan meets the modern-day fanatic. The song emphasizes the undying spirit of the Royals that is laced with resilience and resoluteness, and the limitless hunger to win on the field. The core essence of our home state is retained by introducing catchphrases in both Hindi and English, giving it a much wider mass appeal and the potential to be chanted at the stadiums by the Royals supporters. The outro reiterates the modern Royals philosophy. “Music is an important, vibrant way for the Royals, both players and fans, to connect emotionally. It has been fantastic to see the love from our fans in the creation of this song. I can’t wait to hear them chanting it in the stadium, helping drive us to victory,” stated Jake Lush McCrum, Chief Executive Officer, Rajasthan Royals. Amit Trivedi, who revealed the Rajasthan Royals Official Song at a recent concert he performed in the franchise’s home city of Jaipur, said, “My first reaction to Rajasthan Royals was ‘Halla Bol’. I’ve been following the IPL for a long time now, so I was very excited. I am also very closely attached to Rajasthan, its folk music, and the artists there. And when the idea came through cricket and the Royals team, it excited me and I thought everything is fitting beautifully well.” “With emphasis on having a song that can be chanted inside the stadiums to blow the roof off, and also in other settings across spheres, it’s been a pleasure bringing the Royals’ vibe to life. The war cry of ‘Halla Bol’ has resonated with so many Royals players and fans, and I hope that this new musical showpiece with Mame Khan can inspire the fans to really ‘Halla Bol’,” said Trivedi. Rajasthan Royals will start their IPL 2023 campaign against Sunrisers Hyderabad from April 2.

On Thursday, she stretched her lead at the top with three more wickets against Delhi Capitals, sending them on their way to 105 all out. Capitals headed into what was a clash between two unbeaten sides with back-to-back 200-plus totals. But they were undone by the brilliance of Ishaque, who’s taken a rough path to the glitz and glamour of the WPL. Ishaque comes from a humble background in Park Circus, a neighbourhood in south Kolkata. She was introduced to the sport by her father, who passed away 15 years ago. She did the hard yards at the Under-19 and Under-23 levels for Bengal before playing for the senior side. But a shoulder injury in 2018 pegged her back for a couple of years and the road forward was tough. Ishaque struggled to pick up wickets on her return and was then left out of the Bengal side. Low on confidence, she was introduced to former Bengal left-arm spin allrounder Shibsagar Singh in 2021, and he helped her make technical adjustments. Watching some footage of her, Shibsagar observed that Ishaque was bowling very full and not letting the ball turn enough. “I saw that she is talented and there is something different about her, and made her understand what her issue is,” Shibsagar told ESPNcricinfo. “I asked her to pull her length back a touch, that allowed the ball to deviate, rather than bowling it full and not letting it turn. I also told her to not try for wickets but concentrate on bowling in the right way. “I told her to focus on bowling one ball at a time and not think of the entire over or other stuff. Her mindset slowly began changing. Her earlier focus was on wanting to pick X wickets in Y overs.” Former India allrounder Rumeli Dhar, who also captained Ishaque at Bengal, loved the gusty, fighting character that Ishaque was in the side. Bowling to batters who attack was something she particularly revelled in. “When I was the captain, there were a couple of instances where I have asked her if she would be able to pick up a tough wicket and she upfront used to say yes and did it too,” Dhar said. “She is badmaash [naughty] but she is fun-loving. She knows to have fun and also knows how to make people laugh. “[Ever since her comeback] she knows where she should land the ball to get it to spin and trouble the batter. She has learnt how to respond to captains’ and coaches’ calls of bowling in specific areas and situations. She has a lot of control with her bowling.” Capitals would learn of it the hard way. Meg Lanning and Shafali Verma, easily one of the most dangerous opening pairs in the WPL, had a 162-run stand in Capitals’ opening game and then put up a half-century partnership against UP Warriorz heading into the game against Mumbai. Ishaque, though, struck the first blow off her sixth ball, having Shafali play around a flighted delivery that was slanted into the stumps to bowl her. Capitals were briefly buoyed by a fifty-run stand between Lanning and Jemimah Rodrigues – going from 31 for 3 to 81 for 3 – but then Ishaque was at it again. Brought back in the 13th over for her third, Ishaque again attacked the stumps and just fired it in a touch, only for Rodrigues to go back and miss her cut and be bowled. The left-arm spinner then struck a telling blow on the last ball by floating one up outside off and enticing Lanning to charge down and take the aerial route only for her to hit it to extra cover. This all came after a four-wicket haul against Gujarat Giants at DY Patil Stadium to set up her team in the WPL curtain-raiser. While it was captain Harmanpreet Kaur who stole the show with her scintillating fifty, Ishaque’s exploits made sure everyone took note of her too. And so far, of her nine wickets in the WPL, seven have been either bowled or lbw.Ahead of the WPL, Shibsagar took Ishaque to the East Bengal club to train with male cricketers. He specifically asked them to attack her in a bid to prepare her for the WPL, and he liked what he saw. “She is dimaagwali (intelligent). Never afraid to bowl the tough overs – she will bowl two overs in the powerplay and then also want to bowl at the death,” Shibsagar said. “Any bowler can get hit but she is always confident of picking up wickets.” The WPL, it is expected, will be a means to unearth uncapped talents and fast track them into the national set-up. Given Ishaque’s WPL performances have come at a time when India’s incumbent left-arm spinners Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Radha Yadav are struggling for consistency and penetration, Ishaque could well be on this path. Published on By Andy Murray won a deciding set for the seventh time this season to reach the second round at Indian Wells.The British former world number one defeated Tomas Etcheverry 6-7 (5-7) 6-1 6-4 in a match that lasted three hours and 12 minutes.Murray had no fewer than 20 break points, 16 of which were saved by the 23-year-old Argentine. “I really felt like I was in the driving seat for much of the match,” Murray told BBC Sport. “I was creating lots of opportunities but I just wasn’t able to capitalise. I made some poor decisions at times, but in the end did really well to get through that.” Etcheverry was the sharper man in a first set tie-break, which he won 7-5, and had a break point for a 2-1 lead in the second.But Murray saved that break point before running away with the second set. Both players had chances in the deciding set. Etcheverry had two break points at 4-3 but Murray saved them with some fine serving, then secured the decisive break in the next game as the Argentine double faulted. “I’m not going to keep winning every three-set match that I play, but it’s been an amazing start to the year,” Murray continued. “It was still a good effort to turn that around as the first set was extremely long and I was thinking ‘here we go again’. “This is a place where I haven’t always played my best tennis so I was really happy that I managed to turn that around.” Murray will play Spain’s world number 17 Pablo Carreno Busta in the second round on Saturday.Murray’s victory came after 21-year-old compatriot Jack Draper thrashed Switzerland’s Leandro Riedi 6-1 6-1, to set up a second-round meeting with fellow Briton Dan Evans. The left-hander had not played since mid-January when he lost to Spain’s Rafael Nadal at the Australian Open.Showing no signs of the leg injury he had been dealing with, Draper looked sharp as he dismantled 135th-ranked Riedi’s serve.Draper, ranked 56th, broke in six of his seven return games as well as dominating on his own serve.Despite a seven-week lay-off, Draper showed why is one of the ATP Tour’s rising young stars by striking the ball confidently and consistently in an impressive performance. The rapid win sets up an intriguing match against 24th seed Evans, who will surely provide a sterner test than Riedi did on his debut in an ATP Masters event.Evans, 32, received a first-round bye in the Californian desert and the Davis Cup team-mates will play each other competitively for the first time later this week.Speaking about Evans, Draper told BBC Sport: “He’s a really nice human being and whenever I’ve had moments where I’ve not felt great he’s always sent me a message, and I appreciate that from an older player. “He definitely cares and it’s the same with Murray and [Cameron] Norrie – they’ve paved the way for me a little bit and they’ve always been supportive in my practice sessions and given me the confidence I’ve needed to get to this level quicker, so I’m very grateful to the likes of Dan.” Published on By Sri Lanka’s seamers edged the visitors ahead on the second day of play at Hagley Oval as New Zealand’s batters were made to grind in their pursuit of Sri Lanka’s first innings total of 355. Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara picked up two wickets apiece, while Kasun Rajitha, arguably the pick of the bowlers, grabbed a deserved scalp in the final half hour of play. For the hosts, Tom Latham top scored with a dogged 67, while Daryl Mitchell remained unbeaten on 40 alongside Michael Bracewell on 9 at stumps. The day was one that belonged to the seamers, however, starting with the New Zealand pair of Tim Southee and Matt Henry, who picked up four more wickets between them to wrap up the Sri Lankan innings in the morning session. Dhananjaya de Silva, Sri Lanka’s last recognised batter, fell having added just 10 runs to his overnight total, wafting at one outside off, while the rest of the Lankan tail came together to add a further 40, as Sri Lanka finished on 355. The New Zealand openers for their part made it through the six overs prior to lunch with little trouble. Post lunch, while Latham was going, New Zealand’s progress was slow but steady. Alongside his opening partner Devon Conway, he weathered the early movement utilised by the likes of Asitha and Rajitha, while there was also a little bit more zip to the surface as opposed to the opening day, which aided the likes of Kumara. Nevertheless the pair stuck to their tasks, milking ones and twos on the onside and down the ground, while awaiting rare short and wide deliveries to secure boundaries. The pair would put on 67 for the opening stand, however just when Sri Lanka’s seamers might have been tiring Asitha provided the breakthrough, getting one to nip back and trap Conway leg before. Conway might count himself a touch unfortunate though to have been given out by the on-field umpire, with DRS showing umpire’s call on both impact and whether it was hitting the wickets. That wicket would give Sri Lanka a renewed burst of energy to seek a second before the break, and Kane Williamson would oblige on the stroke of tea, with an uppish drive straight to the man catching at cover. Henry Nicholls would then fall shortly after the restart, top edging a pull off Lahiru Kumara. At this point Sri Lanka were well and truly on top, a state of affairs punctuated by the excellent Rajitha, who would torment Mitchell – who had just arrived at the crease – probing and teasing his off stump. That Mitchell would survive this period was a minor miracle, particularly after one delivery that – to borrow a phrase from football parlance – might have given him twisted blood. Angling in from slightly wide of the crease, Rajitha would pitch this on the border of offstump, on the edge of a good length, and then get it to shape away right at the death, beating Mitchell and the stumps by the barest of margins. If not for a graze on the outside of the pad, his stumps would have certainly been under threat. Sri Lanka’s only misstep might have been offering Angelo Mathews, with his 115kph gentle seamers, the ball during this period, though the thought process behind it – providing the front line seamers a rest while still utilising the swing on offer – was understandable. This period offered the New Zealand batters a minor reprieve, with Mitchell memorably launching Mathews down the ground for a six. Mitchell and Latham would proceed to put on 58 together before another moment of brilliance swung the pendulum back towards the visitors. Following periods of spin from Prabath Jayasuriya and Dhananjaya de Silva, Asitha returned to dismiss Latham in explosive fashion – a leg stump yorker from around the wicket, and an animated send off to boot. Rajitha would then finally get the wicket his performance deserved, getting Blundell to nick one through after yet another exquisite out swinger on off stump. Mitchell and Bracewell would survive till stumps, but with a 193-run deficit ahead of them, Sri Lanka would undoubtedly be the happier of the two sides going into day three. 355 (Kusal Mendis 87,Dimuth Karunaratne 50; Tim Southee 5- 64, Matt Henry 4-80) lead New Zealand 165/5 (Tom Latham 67; Daryl Mitchell 40*; Lahiru Kumara 2-34, Asitha Fernando 2-42) by 190 runs Published on By Angelo Mathews has taken aim at the Test-match schedule Sri Lanka has been lumped with. His complaint: Sri Lanka will not play enough Tests, particularly this year. This, despite there being an outside chance that Sri Lanka could play in the World Test Championship final, so long as Australia win or draw their last Test against India, and Sri Lanka beat New Zealand 2-0, in New Zealand. These remain unlikely outcomes, even though both Australia and Sri Lanka have had good days with the bat on Thursday.But Mathews essentially asks what value the cricket world places in Tests any more, if the scheduling is so lopsided. “Unfortunate that we are not playing too many Test matches this year – it’s as few as five,” he said, on the day he became Sri Lanka’s third-highest Test scorer, in Christchurch. “We are coming off a long layoff – the last Test was six months back.” Mathews is correct that there are only five Tests on the schedule for Sri Lanka in 2023 (two against New Zealand, two against Pakistan, and one against Ireland, who are not WTC opposition just yet). He is not correct on how long it’s been since Sri Lanka’s last Test before this one. It has been seven months. “Everyone’s talking about Test cricket dying, but we’re not doing any good for Test cricket playing only five Tests a year. Hopefully we’ll get more matches this year. Five feels like not enough.” In fact, right through the WTC cycle to follow this one, Sri Lanka are not scheduled to play a single three-Test series. Meanwhile, India, Australia and England routinely play five-Test series against each other through the same period. At the worst, they play four-Test series. The WTC structure requires the teams that qualify to play an equal number of WTC series between each other through the course of the cycle. But aside from India, England and Australia (the Big Three), most other sides play two-Test series, except when they play one of the Big Three sides, when they may have a three-Test encounter on the books. Jason Holder and Anrich Nortje – currently playing a two-Test series in South Africa – had also voiced how every team apart from the Big Three were barely playing any Tests these days.","pubDate":"2023-03-11 00:01:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"News24.com | SA's Rilee Rossouw smashes fastest 100 in Pakistan Super League history","link":"https://www.news24.com/sport/Cricket/sas-rilee-rossouw-smashes-fastest-100-in-pakistan-super-league-history-20230310","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South African batsman Rilee Rossouw made headlines in the Pakistan Super League when he smashed a stunning century to help his side chase down a mammoth total.","content":"South African batsman Rilee Rossouw made headlines in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on Friday when he smashed a stunning century to help his side chase down a mammoth total.

The BBC confirmed it has been unable to find a presenter willing to fill in the vacant role. A spokesperson said: 'Some of our pundits have said that they don’t wish to appear on the programme while we seek to resolve the situation with Gary. 'We understand their position and we have decided that the programme will focus on match action without studio presentation or punditry.' A source close to the Match of the Day program also told MailOnline that even the production team 'is considering walking in support of Gary Lineker and have contacted their union' however they are cautious to go ahead, because as there has 'been no ballot action, they won't be protected by law.' Fellow football pundit Ian Wright today tweeted that he would also shun presenting Match of the Day while the ban is in place, expressing 'solidarity' with his co-host Alan Shearer is the latest withdrawal from Match of the Day, tweeting this evening: 'I have informed the BBC that I won't be appearing on MOTD tomorrow night' Match of the Day's decision to take Gary Lineker (left) off air over his comments about the Government has led to a walkout from fellow hosts Alan Shearer (centre) and Ian Wright (right) The decision to streamline the programme was taken after fellow football pundit Ian Wright sparked a mutiny by announcing that he would shun presenting Match of the Day while the ban is in place, expressing 'solidarity' with his co-host.

Broadcaster Piers Morgan, a friend of Lineker's, also tweeted his disgust, branding the BBC's decision 'pathetically spineless'. Morgan added: 'I now demand the BBC suspend every presenter who has made public comment about news or current affairs - starting with Sir David Attenborough and Lord Sugar.' Channel 5 News presenter Dan Walker earlier said on air that Lineker told him 'they've [the BBC] told me I have to step back'. Speaking on Channel 5 News, Walker said: 'It's one of those strange situations where I'm actually texting the man himself (Lineker) at the moment. 'And I have asked Gary Lineker the question about whether he is stepping back or whether the BBC have told him to step back and I've told him that if he responds to me that I will read out that text on air. 'There's one word in there I can't use, but he has said 'No, they've told me I have to step back'. Alex Scott has also ruled herself out of tomorrow's show, sharing a meme with the word 'nah' Lineker's son George tweeted mischievously: 'RIP MOTD tomorrow' Gary Lineker will step back from presenting Match of the Day pending further discussions with his bosses, the BBC announced today. He's seen outside his London home this morning Channel 5 News presenter Dan Walker said Gary Lineker has told him 'they've [the BBC] told me I have to step back' The Match of the Day host accused ministers of using 'language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 1930s' 'So Gary Lineker wants to continue to present Match Of The Day and is not apologising for what he's said but he's said it's a BBC decision to force him to not present the programme at the moment.' Lineker's son George tweeted mischievously: 'RIP MOTD tomorrow.' BBC bosses had told Lineker either to stop his politicised posts or give up working for the corporation. Last night a senior source said: ‘It’s now up to Lineker – he needs to choose.’ Another well-placed insider described the presenters’ mutiny as a ‘proper BBC crisis’. However the decision has been welcomed by some, with former Tory leader William Hague said it was 'appropriate' for Gary Lineker to step back from hosting Match Of The Day. 'He broke the guidelines I think of the BBC with comments that are highly politicised, which BBC presenters are not meant to do. So that's against the rules and we've got to do something about that, otherwise every presenter can do so on every programme,' he told Times Radio. 'I think it is appropriate for him to step back.' Lord Hague added 'I don't know if you can separate' Lineker's personal social media and role as a BBC presenter. The BBC said Lineker would 'step back' from presenting the programme until he and his bosses had reached an 'agreed and clear position' on his use of social media. The BBC's highest paid star sparked a huge political row this week after comparing the language used to launch a new government crackdown on migrants arriving across the Channel in small boats to 1930s Germany. Elsewhere, members of the public who support Lineker will likely view his ban as a sign that the BBC is acting 'at the Government's behest', the BBC's former controller of editorial policy said. Richard Ayre, who also served as a member of Ofcom's content board, told BBC Radio 4's Today PM programme this afternoon that the BBC had 'no choice' but to take action against Lineker after his tweets criticising the Government's asylum policy. He said: 'I think it was inevitable.' 'He [Lineker] has the letters BBC written across his forehead and yet he's plunged right into the most controversial story of the day.' 'The fact is this was an immediate issue which Tim Davie, the Director General, couldn't sit on over the weekend, he had to solve it this week. He's clearly tried to solve it and reach an agreement with Gary Lineker, they've failed, so this has been the BBC decision. Whether this story moves on depends on what Gary Lineker says himself in the next few hours.' 'It's inevitable now that having in effect not sacked him but removed him temporarily at least, the BBC will not come under a torrent of criticism saying it's acting under the Government's behest.' Former BBC Newsnight host Emily Maitlis, who was herself reprimanded by the BBC for sharing a tweet the corporation viewed as 'controversial', said her former employer could face a 'much, much bigger battle' after its Gary Lineker decision. 'I'm not sure when they suggested to Gary Lineker he step back from (Match Of The Day) the BBC realised it might be starting a much much bigger battle,' she tweeted. Former BBC executive Richard Sambrook said there is 'a lot of confusion' around whether freelance broadcasters such as Gary Lineker - who do not work in news - should be subject to the same rules as permanent staff. Mr Sambrook, who was director of news at the BBC and director of BBC Global News and the BBC World Service, was asked Lineker's comments. He replied: 'I think the language he used was unnecessarily provocative but the wider question here is whether a sports presenter in his private life has to be bound by BBC policies. 'Traditionally, the BBC would always want that to be the case but I think in the current day and age when we live in a world full of social media, when journalism broadcasters have the ability to go and work for other people or do their own podcasts and all the rest of it, that's a bit of an unrealistic expectation.' Lineker's comments were criticised by Downing Street and a raft of Tory heavyweights including Home Secretary Suella Braverman and James Cleverly, the Foreign Secretary. The former Leicester striker has a history of controversial political interventions on everything from Brexit and the Tories to protests by Just Stop Oil and the fate of Shamima Begum . Gary Lineker, 62, reportedly refused to apologise for his comments comparing the Government's migration policy to Nazi Germany and he has been roundly supported by colleagues Lineker's tweeting history has raised more than a few eyebrows over the years A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC has been in extensive discussions with Gary and his team in recent days.

'When it comes to leading our football and sports coverage, Gary is second to none. 'We have never said that Gary should be an opinion-free zone, or that he can't have a view on issues that matter to him, but we have said that he should keep well away from taking sides on party political issues or political controversies.' The BBC has faced repeated calls to sack Lineker over his anti-Tory tweets, while Mr Cleverly this morning swiped that the ex-England footballer was 'desperate to gain attention'. 'I wouldn't personally say what Gary Lineker has said, but I would defend his right to say it,' the Labour leader said. 'What I see here is a Government that hasn't got a proper answer in relation to control of our borders and is looking around, as it always does, to other people to blame, Gary Lineker, the BBC, civil servants, anybody. 'I think anybody watching this will be crying out for a government that actually says 'There's a problem here, it's a problem of our making, we're going to stand up and we're going to fix it'. 'The sooner we can get back to that grown-up approach and not just casting blame around the better.' Rishi Sunak insisted his Government's actions over the Channel migrant crisis were the 'compassionate thing to do' Lineker has refused to step down and the BBC has yet to take action against him over his outburst. Mr Cleverly urged the ex-sportsman to study history 'a little bit more carefully' in the wake of his Nazi Germany jibe. Speaking to LBC from Paris, where the PM and his top team met their French counterparts today, the Foreign Secretary said: 'There are some people desperate to gain attention by using deeply offensive and inappropriate language about this. 'I would gently suggest they read their history books a little bit more carefully. The simple truth of the matter is the UK is a welcoming and hospitable country.' Former culture secretary Nadine Dorries also weighed in. The TV host and MP said that failure to fire Lineker would mean the BBC was only paying 'lip service' to its remit of impartiality. Mr Sunak himself insisted his Government's actions on the Channel migrant crisis were the 'moral and compassionate thing to do'. 'I strongly believe that what we're doing is the right thing to do,' the PM said today, when asked about Mr Lineker's intervention. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, on a visit to Paris, this morning swiped that the ex-England footballer was 'desperate to gain attention' Gary Lineker's long list of Twitter controversies January 2023 Then-culture secretary Michelle Donelan said the BBC should be 'conscious' of recent comments made by Lineker. Ms Donelan was speaking to The News Agents podcast about remarks Lineker had made on the same show about the World Cup in Qatar and racism in America. October 2022 Lineker breached BBC impartiality rules with a social media post criticising the Tories, the broadcaster's complaints team ruled. The Match of the Day host, 62, used Twitter to quote an article about Liz Truss – then foreign secretary – urging Premier League teams to boycott the Champions League final in Russia. In his post, the former England striker, who has more than 8.7million followers on Twitter, added: 'And her party will hand back their donations from Russian donors?'. August 2022 Lineker sparked a row with a senior BBC journalist this year with a Tweet about sewerage. He wrote on Twitter: 'As a politician how could you ever, under any circumstances, bring yourself to vote for pumping sewage into our seas? Unfathomable!' The tweet prompted veteran BBC journalist Neil Henderson, a home and foreign news editor, to ask the £1.35million-a-year presenter if his contract allowed him to breach the corporation's impartiality rules. The journalist wrote to him: 'The BBC lives or dies by its impartiality. If you can't abide it, get off it.' Mr Henderson, following discussions with BBC bosses, later issued an apology. July 2022 Lineker found himself at odds with ex-racing driver turned Sky commentator Martin Brundle over his response to a Just Stop Oil protest. Protesters stormed the British Grand Prix, sparking fury from Brundle, who said they could have been killed. Lineker tweeted: 'History will look back very favourably on these people'. But Brundle replied: 'Gary please don't encourage this reckless behaviour. 'They'd have been sliced into 100 pieces and fans, marshals and drivers were wholly at risk of injury and death. I totally support freedom of speech and opinion, but do it responsibly.' October 2020 Lineker said he had spoken to the BBC's director-general Tim Davie 'quite a few times in recent weeks' and that Mr Davie was 'perfectly happy' with his conduct on social media. His comments came after new guidelines and training were announced by the BBC to 'ensure the highest possible standards of impartiality' among staff at the broadcaster. February 2018 Lineker was challenged over his comments on Brexit by BBC cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew. Agnew, responding to one of Lineker's posts, Tweeted: 'Gary. You are the face of BBC Sport. Please observe BBC editorial guidelines... I'd be sacked if I followed your example. Thanks.' <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_4 - -> Advertisement 'I think it's the fair thing to do and I actually believe that it's the moral and compassionate thing to do, and I've made that argument multiple times. 'I'll continue to make it and I think actually the more people think about this challenge and how best to address it they will see that it is the right approach. 'And actually I was pleased that there was actually quite a lot of strong support for the approach we've outlined now that we've outlined it, because this is about thinking what's the best way to help the world's most vulnerable people.' Yesterday Mrs Braverman accused Lineker of diminishing the tragedy of the Holocaust as ministers engaged in an open row with the BBC star. She said she found the comments 'offensive' because her husband is Jewish. 'My children are therefore directly descendant from people who were murdered in gas chambers during the Holocaust,' she told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast. 'To kind of throw out those kind of flippant analogies diminishes the unspeakable tragedy that millions of people went through and I don't think anything that is happening in the UK today can come close to what happened in the Holocaust. 'So I find it a lazy and unhelpful comparison to make.' House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt claimed Labour were 'borrowing from the Gary Lineker playbook' by being the 'party of goal hangers' taking easy shots against the Government. The ex-England striker hit back at Ms Mordaunt's 'clumsy analogy', saying he was 'just happy to have been better in the six-yard box than you are at the dispatch box'. Lineker has said he is looking forward to presenting Match of the Day this weekend despite the 'ridiculously out of proportion story' surrounding his comments. Criticising the Government's new asylum plans earlier this week, he tweeted: 'There is no huge influx. We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. 'This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the '30s.' Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said he would boycott Match Of The Day. Mr Farron tweeted: 'And I will be stepping back from watching the programme until the @BBC grows a backbone. Still, I'm sure we can count on the Free Speech Union to stand up against this hysterical act of cancellation...' Henry Winter, the chief football writer for The Times who has regularly appeared on the BBC's Radio 5 Live, said the broadcaster should be 'ashamed' by its decision. 'Disappointing that coverage of (Match Of The Day) dictated by politicians,' he tweeted. 'Not what BBC should be about. BBC should be ashamed. Should be independent of No 10. Ian Wright replaced by Ian Duncan-Smith? 'Many good people working for BBC football who deserve better from their craven bosses.' Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised Gary Lineker and Ian Wright on Twitter. Corbyn wrote: 'Well done @GaryLineker for standing up for refugees. Well done @IanWright0 for showing the meaning of solidarity. 'Now, let's mobilise against a politics of cruelty, and defeat this inhumane, illegal & immoral legislation.' Former culture secretary Nadine Dorries has said she welcomes the decision for Gary Lineker to step back from Match Of The Day, saying it shows the BBC is 'serious about impartiality'. 'News that @GaryLineker has been stood down for investigation is welcome and shows @BBC are serious about impartiality,' the TalkTV host tweeted. Does the BBC need Gary Lineker more than he needs them? How ex-footballer has amassed £26m fortune with podcasts, broadcasting and advertising deals (just don't mention the two divorces and HMRC tax row) Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said he would boycott Match Of The Day amid the Gary Lineker row. Sharing a headline saying the presenter will be 'stepping back' from the show, Mr Farron tweeted: 'And I will be stepping back from watching the programme until the @BBC grows a backbone. Still, I'm sure we can count on the Free Speech Union to stand up against this hysterical act of cancellation...' Henry Winter, the chief football writer for The Times who has regularly appeared on the BBC's Radio 5 Live, said the broadcaster should be 'ashamed' by its decision to ask Gary Lineker to step back from hosting Match Of The Day. 'Disappointing that coverage of (Match Of The Day) dictated by politicians,' he tweeted. 'Not what BBC should be about. BBC should be ashamed. Should be independent of No 10. Ian Wright replaced by Ian Duncan-Smith? 'Many good people working for BBC football who deserve better from their craven bosses.' By Martin Robinson, Chief Reporter for MailOnline Gary Lineker earns £1.36-million-a-year from the BBC for Match of the Day, Sports Personality of the Year and other shows in a near three-decade broadcasting career that has helped him build a £26million nest egg. The 62-year-old is the highest-paid 'talent' at the c orporation but as the Beeb considers standing by him yet again over his highly political tweets, experts are pondering if another reprieve is a clear sign they need him much more than he needs them. The footballer turned broadcaster has amassed much of his fortune since starting at the BBC in the mid-1990s – but insists he does not fear leaving over the row where he compared Tory policy on migrants in boats to Nazi Germany. And MailOnline can reveal that he has close to ten other income streams with four years until the twice-married father-of-four hits retirement age – although a legal battle with HMRC over a £4.9million tax bill looms large in 2023. Lineker has four sons with his first wife, Michelle: Angus, 24, Tobias, 26, Harry, 28, and the eldest George, who is 30. He divorced from his second wife, Danielle Bux, six years ago. He said recently 'I've been married twice. I've got four kids. That's an expensive business'. Lineker promotes his own range of sunglasses and glasses, which he handpicks, for High Street chain Vision Express Lineker is also an investor in an insurance company which aims to reduce premiums for car and van drivers, as long as their driving is tracked Apart from his high-profile presenting roles, he features in big-brand television advertising campaigns but also runs a TV production company – Goalhanger Films – which he uses to sell even more of his work to the BBC. And it is Goalhanger's burgeoning podcast business that is predicted to make him even richer. His first shows were recorded at the kitchen table of his £4.8million Victorian property in Barnes, south-west London. He is also believed to own a property in Surrey where he has hosted at least two refugees. The Goalhanger stable also includes The Rest Is Politics, hosted by Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart, and The Rest Is History, presented by Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook - the latter widely considered as one of the UK's best podcasts. Gary's son Harry works for his dad's business, which has a growing list of hits including, you guessed it, Gary's own Match of the Day: Top Ten show with Alan Shearer, Micah Richards, Ian Wright and others. Eldest son George is co-founder of Your Business Number, Angus is a business development manager and Tobias is a DJ. Last year Lineker hailed the 'incredible growth' of the podcast arm, which is now signed up with global entertainment agency WME, even admitting that he could leave the BBC to work on it full time. He has three years left on his lucrative BBC deal - but with calls for him to be sacked over his tweets, it may not hit him that hard financially he moved on. He told The New Statesman last year when asked if he might work on Goalhanger full time: 'Maybe. Who knows? Life's thrown many things at me. And I'm 61. We don't really know what the boundaries are in terms of growth. But it's a very, very good business'. Gary Lineker married his first wife Michelle in 1986 but they later divorced. He later married Danielle Bux but they divorced in 2016 Gary with his four lookalike sons in 2013: Harry, Angus, George and Tobias (left to right) Mr Lineker is currently appealing in the courts after HMRC pursued him for £4.9million under IR35 legislation - rules designed to stop contractors working as 'disguised employees'. The tax man believes that Lineker should be treated as an employee by the BBC because he does so much regular work for them, meaning the star should pay more to the treasury. Mr Lineker disagrees. Last month a preliminary hearing in London was told Lineker has now paid the income tax bill in full but he is appealing. HMRC pursued him for the sum that it claimed should have been paid on income received between 2013 and 2018. Lineker insists all taxes were paid on the income through a partnership set up in 2012 with his ex-wife Danielle Bux and is appealing against the demand. The presenter is expected to argue that his partnership Gary Lineker Media (GLM) is required to funnel his income through because of the wide variety of work he does. HMRC will claim his extensive work for BT Sport and the BBC means he should be classed as an employee for tax purposes, because he agrees to do a minimum number of games and shows for the broadcaster. One of his first TV jobs away from football was as the face of Walkers crisps, and the Leicester-born star last year signed a new three-year deal with the firm – the snacks are made in his home city. The deal sees him feature in television advert campaigns and on social media. He has been working with the brand for more than 27 years, first teaming up with Walkers in 1994, and has now appeared in 150 adverts. Lineker is also an investor in an insurance company which aims to reduce premiums for drivers between the ages of 17 and 25. Ticker sends a box to the driver which they then place on their windscreen. The gadget pairs to a phone via bluetooth, sending the driver's behaviour on the road to the Ticker app, with the idea that the information can be used to provide cheaper insurance for safer young motorists. Described as the future of car insurance, the company is also backed by former Formula 1 driver Mark Blundell. Gary Lineker has been working with the brand for 27 years, first teaming up with Walkers in 1994, and has now appeared in 150 adverts In 2019, along with his friend and fellow broadcaster Danny Baker, Lineker published a book full of football anecdotes called Behind Closed Doors He is also a director of 'GCGL Properties Ltd' - described on Companies House as a 'development of building projects' business. As part of Lineker's £1.36 million deal with the Beeb, he presents Match Of The Day and other big sporting events. He is also one of the hosts of the Sports Personality of the Year event. Few BBC viewers will know that some of the programmes Lineker hosts are not part of his deal with the broadcaster but shows he sells to them through his production company. In 2020 he hosted and made Football, Prince William And Our Mental Health through Goalhanger Films. He has made others for the Corporation with stars including Marcus Rashford and Wayne Rooney, and featuring his beloved Leicester City. He also produces podcasts for the BBC. He recently announced a show he is making about tennis superstar Serena Williams, which he has sold to Amazon. He made a reputed £3 million from investing in Ingenie, a car insurance firm which was sold in 2014 He also works works for LaLiga TV. Lineker quit one big-money deal at BT Sport for another – transferring to La Liga to present football matches from the top Spanish division, live from Barcelona. Lineker still speaks Spanish after his time playing for the Catalan giants and he signed a multi-year contract with LaLigaTV. Speaking of the job, he said he was 'thrilled', adding: 'I have fond memories of my time playing in Spain and very much look forward to sharing the excitement of La Liga with viewers in the UK and elsewhere.' There are also books. In 2019, along with his friend and fellow broadcaster Danny Baker, Lineker published a book full of football anecdotes called Behind Closed Doors. A bestseller, it was culled from a podcast the pair presented and reveals jaw-dropping stories from the dressing room and open-top bus ceremonies, apparently 'all served up with lashings of wit and ribald humour.' As one of television's most prominent spectacle-wearers, it was only a matter of time before Lineker cashed in on them. He promotes his own range of sunglasses and glasses, which he handpicks, for high street chain Vision Express. The firm says in the 'edit', Lineker 'pays homage to the various fashion eras and styles which have influenced him throughout his life, specifically Italian and Mediterranean styles.' And he's hoping to score with the public in terms of pricing – Lineker spectacle frames cost from £99 and sunglasses are from £39. Lineker is renowned for his snappy suits when presenting his TV shows, which was clearly noticed by upmarket shirt brand TM Lewin, who then signed him up to promote the label. He appeared on its website where he advertised the budget range, starting at £25. He also used to encourage his millions of social media followers to shop at TM Lewin stores before the business went online only. In 2021 it was announced that Lineker would be straddling the BBC and ITV after being lured by the latter to host a new gameshow, named Sitting On A Fortune. In the show contestants can win up to £100,000 and it seems the presenter has hit the jackpot too. It's not known how much he is being paid but TV insiders suggest 'he won't be doing it for peanuts'. Lineker said: 'I am delighted to be hosting what I think and hope will be a show that people love, full of tension with high stakes and bags of drama from start to finish – everything a great game show should be.' A second series is billed to return in 2023.

RECAP | SA v West Indies, Day 3 Yet it was heartening to hear how the phlegmatic Proteas Test skipper also enjoyed the more mundane, perhaps even fun elements to his unbeaten 171, which has put the hosts in a prime position to push for a series whitewash. After all, he later had so much fun that he even donned a baggy green cap. Bavuma, who's called the Bullring his cricketing home for the past 14 years, never scored a red-ball century at the ground until now. \"I've actually never scored a hundred here in first-class cricket,\" he said at the end of his monumental, 369-minute effort to date. \"It's definitely a monkey off my back. The guys are always teasing me that my name isn't on the honours board at my home ground, so I guess I can stick it to them. \"[Jokes aside]... it's also special that it's against the West Indies, because, as I said leading to the series, it means sentimentally quite a lot because I grew up admiring their cricket too. That adds to the achievement.\" READ | Heroic Bavuma’s first Test ton in 7 years puts Proteas on top at the Wanderers The classy stroke-maker could even bask in the manner in which he reached his century - a disdainful lofted cover drive that was never going to be at risk of finding a fielder. In fact, Bavuma had been going about reaching his milestone in a methodical, pragmatic manner, but once he caught sight of his mother Phumza and father Vuyo watching intently from the Unity Stand and an expectant crowd raising their noise level, he decided to get a move on. \"I don't think there was a point where I felt I'd get over the line. When I got to 96, the crowd started picking up in anticipation of the milestone. My emotion started picking up too. I got a ball outside off-stump and I definitely wasn't about to keep it on the ground. I just waited for it,\" he said. And he's not about to let the tired Windies attack off the hook as a double century looms in the distance on Saturday. \"I'm going to try and bat as long as I can. I need the rest to come back fresh [on Saturday]. I'm not about to give my wicket away at any point. The opportunity is there, I definitely want to take it. \"I'm mentally quite tired more than physically. The adrenaline is still keeping me going. I have an ice bath waiting and I'm having a beer with the guys to celebrate. But after that, you have to put it behind you and look what's in front of you.\" Most pertinently though, Bavuma has entrenched his reputation of being the man the Proteas can depend on when the pressure is well and truly on. His most significant knocks at Test level - 54 in Chattogram 2015, 74 in Hobart 2016, 89 in Wellington 2017, 65 in Melbourne 2022 - attest to that. Now he has a big century to add to that collection, one where he came in at 8/2. \"In my Test career, I've found myself in situations where it's 20/4 or 10/2,\" said Bavuma. \"You really have to soak in the pressure and release it. I believe I've done it well in my career even if the scores haven't been as big as today. Walking into today's situation is one that I'm mentally accustomed to. My game leans towards it too.\" His team was grateful.","pubDate":"2023-03-10 21:43:05","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ben Duckett 'solely focused on playing for England' after featuring in Test, T20 and 50-over sides","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-11845429/Ben-Duckett-solely-focused-playing-England-featuring-Test-T20-50-sides.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ben Duckett wants to take every opportunity offered when it comes to playing for England, which is perhaps why he is unique amongst his international team-mates.","content":"Ben Duckett is 'solely focused on playing for England' after featuring in Test, T20 and 50-over sides this year... with Nottinghamshire batsman ready to snub riches of franchise cricket Duckett has defied a bloated schedule to feature in all three formats in 2023 Some team-mates have asked to miss matches to rest or play franchise cricket Batsman has averaged 56.44 in a triumphant return to Test cricket this winter By Richard Gibson For Mailonline Published: 17:12, 10 March 2023 | Updated: 21:11, 10 March 2023 e-mail View comments Ben Duckett wants to take every opportunity offered when it comes to playing for England, which is perhaps why he is unique amongst his international team-mates. For Nottinghamshire batsman Duckett is the only one to have defied a bloated schedule to feature in all three formats in 2023 - and on three separate continents at that. While others have opted out of sectors for one reason or another, the 28-year-old has accepted every invitation, beginning the year with the 50-over team in South Africa , then playing two Tests in New Zealand before arriving here for a Twenty20 series against Bangladesh via a week’s holiday in Dubai . ‘You can play in all these leagues around the world in a few years' time but at the time right now, I'm solely focused on playing as much for England as I can,’ said Duckett. Switching formats without fully preparing does carry jeopardy, however. Duckett joked that he was on a sun lounger two days before his 13-ball 20 in Thursday’s six-wicket defeat in Chittagong, and had just one net session to adjust to the reduction in bounce from antipodean to subcontinental conditions. Ben Duckett has defied a bloated schedule to feature in all three formats for England in 2023 England batsman has averaged 56.44 in a triumphant return to Test cricket this winter It was not quite enough, and his instincts meant he pulled over the top of a shooter from Mustafizur Rahman. Not that he will over-think his dismissal. Duckett is much more relaxed about his cricket than his 21-year-old self making a start as an international here in 2016, and puts that down to the attitude of England’s Test coach Brendon McCullum, summed up by an episode in the epic one-run defeat in Wellington last month. ‘At tea, he said, \"let's go out there and bat for a draw last session”. Obviously, he was joking but that's just how relaxed it is. You are going into the final session of a Test match, needing however many runs and the coach is cracking gags. That just relaxes you,’ he said. ‘His main thing with us is that he genuinely says he's not fussed about the results, it's a chance for us to go out there and express and show the world what we can do - try to make people back home want to watch us. If we lose by the way that we play, so be it.’ This winter, Duckett has averaged 56.44 in a triumphant return to Test cricket, but having won all but one of his 24 caps to date overseas, he is looking forward to what a home Ashes series entails. ‘I've always wanted to play for England again, and it's great, but to play in England in the summer, with packed houses, is something that's pretty exciting,’ he said. ‘I've never had a summer where I've had to manage myself and get ready at the right times, to play for England, and it's something I never thought I'd do, so I'm looking forward to it.’ Share or comment on this article: Ben Duckett 'solely focused on playing for England' after featuring in Test, T20 and 50-over sides e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

The net result was ensuring the second Test between South Africa and the West Indies will go into a fourth day. When Bavuma (171*) strode out at 10:18 at the fall of Tony de Zorzi's wicket, the score was 8/2. But, at the end of an absorbing day, the Proteas finished on 287/7 and with a massive lead of 356. It was largely thanks to Bavuma's broad and often pressured shoulders. Bavuma's 369-minute knock moved South Africa from a position of match-losing weakness to a point where the West Indies now have to reel in the highest successful fourth-innings chase at the Bullring. That's how important Bavuma's dig was, and in an era where three-figure captain's knocks have been few and far between for South Africa. It's worth remembering that Bavuma was subjected to the ignominy of a pair in his first Test as captain - such is the vicious and mischievous, yet enjoyable, nature of cricket. He scored more than half of his team's runs on a day when the West Indies had them on the rack with spells of mesmerising, military medium pace bowling in what was a difficult morning session for the hosts. Kyle Mayers (2/25) and Raymon Reifer (1/30) were unlikely partners in crime, reducing South Africa to 65/4. The Windies must have fancied their chances of batting after tea after Jason Holder's heroic 81* ensured South Africa only had a lead of 69. South Africa only led by 134 and were in danger of being bundled out cheaply, but Bavuma, whose 19 other 50-plus scores have come after his seminal 102* against England at Newlands in January 2016, understood the gravity of the situation and batted with the necessary care, diligence and later on, measured belligerence that befitted the changing situations. The fact that South Africa lost their first wicket off just the third ball of the day was a harbinger of things to come. Elgar (5), who has looked comfortable all series without making the relevant runs, inexplicably guided Mayers to Roston Chase at gully. The tall Roston Chase was so disbelieving of the gift that came in his direction, he had to have two grabs to ensure the catch wasn't grassed. That wicket fell at 10:03. De Zorzi (1) was the next to fall to Mayers, inside-edging a ball that could've been left onto his off-stump. It was a shot that lacked conviction and at 10:17, the Proteas were 8/2. It was important that Markram (18) reigned in his attacking instincts and, in recognising the situation, he did so. However, at 11:00, he received what was the ball of the session when a Kemar Roach delivery that ducked in and moved away squared him up and took his outside edge. That was 32/3 and Joshua da Silva, who was incessantly sledged by the hosts during his crucial partnership with Holder, let off a joint roar with Roach that not only pierced the bright blue sky, but punctured the Proteas' batting soul. Bavuma and Ryan Rickelton (10) needed to keep SA afloat and for 57 minutes in their stand of 37, they both dead batted what came their way and made the most of minimal scoring opportunities. Rickelton, though, was clearly flustered by Reifer's nagging off-stump line that moved the ball away from him. When he was claimed by the left-arm medium pacer on what became the stroke of lunch at 11:57, the Proteas were 69/4. It was definitely advantage West Indies, who were clearly riding the crest of the momentum created by Holder's knock. Bavuma is a noted firefighter, but he needed to move between his salvage job and being run surgeon by stitching together partnerships. He first shared a 24-run stand with Markram, then partnered with Rickelton for 37. The Bavuma/Heinrich Klaasen alliance of 34 had the potential to take the game away from the visitors. The wicket-keeper though succumbed to incessant chatty pressure from his opposite, Da Silva, when Klaasen (14) skied a short-ball that Da Silva caught at square-leg. That meant South Africa was 103/5 after the loss of the wicket at 13:32, leaving Bavuma and the under-pressure Wiaan Mulder (42). They guided South Africa to tea without further loss at 145/5 and Bavuma was on 81. It was from here where Bavuma and Mulder took the game by the scruff of the neck. They took 20 off Roach's first two overs after tea, an assertive move that not only allowed him to spend just seven balls in the 90s, but also brought a significant pressure release. The West Indies had only conceded 65 and 76 runs respectively in the previous two sessions. But in the evening session, they went for 142, 90 coming off Bavuma's bat in the march to his 100 and beyond. The crowd wasn't big, but the outpouring of emotions was intense after Bavuma drilled Joseph for four through cover after a nervy previous delivery. The moment had been worth it, and it rescued his side from a precarious position. It was unfortunate that Mulder didn't reach a deserved maiden Test 50 when he picked out Tagenarine Chanderpaul at fine leg off Joseph, but the monkey was off Bavuma's back. Bavuma needed only 62 balls to motor from 100 to 150 as he nailed home the advantage he had worked so hard to earn. He put together a 71-run stand with Simon Harmer (19) that moved the West Indies' target past the 310/8 Australia had reeled in to beat South Africa in 2011. Harmer didn't see out the day, but Bavuma did and when he was clapped off by the crowd and his opponents, it was well-deserved. Scores in brief: South Africa: 320 and 287/7 (Temba Bavuma 171*, Wiaan Mulder 42, Simon Harmer 19, Kyle Mayers 2/25, Alzarri Joseph 2/49, Jason Holder 1/35, Raymon Reifer 1/36) West Indies: 251 (Holder 81*, Mayers 29, Roston Chase 28, Joshua da Silva 26, Gerald Coetzee 3/41, Kagiso Rabada 2/19, Harmer 2/63) South Africa leads by 356 runs","pubDate":"2023-03-10 20:23:38","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"4th Test, Day 2: Ashwin’s 6-for gives India reason to believe they are still in the game","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/india-vs-australia-4th-test-ashwin-a-class-act/articleshow/98550797.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia had 480 on the board, but if there was a reason to believe that India were still in the game, it was provided by R Ashwin.

In very good conditions for batting, the offie was a class act, bowling nearly 48 overs, 15 of which were maidens to pick up 6 for 91. This was his 26th five-wicket bag at home, one more than the great Anil Kumble, and it’s an effort he’ll cherish for a long time. IANS There are few better slow bowlers in the world for such a challenge than Ashwin. When the Khawaja-Green partnership stretched to 208, and the pair had batted through two complete sessions, Ashwin had to do something different. Shoulders sagged, fielders oohed and aahed, bowlers poured in sweat at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Australia had batted nearly two days in their first innings, in itself an incredible feat, considering that the first three Tests barely lasted three days each. Usman Khawaja was the model Test batsman, soaking up pressure, minimising risk and winning the mental game, batting 11 minutes more than six hours to score 180 off a whopping 422 balls. Cameron Green gave notice of just why Australians are so excited about the giant allrounder, putting his head down and focussing hard on every delivery that came his way to score 114, his first Test century. Australia had 480 on the board, but if there was reason to believe that India were still in the game, it was provided by Ravichandran Ashwin . In conditions that were very good for batting, the offie was a class act, bowling nearly 48 overs, 15 of which were maidens to pick up 6 for 91. This was his 26th five-wicket bag at home, one more than the great Anil Kumble, and it is an effort he will cherish for a long time. In these conditions, it was not simply a matter of turning up, rolling the arm over, landing the ball on a spot and hoping the pitch would do the job with its natural variation. These were conditions in which the bowler had to plan and execute every single dismissal, with the various facets of spin bowling coming together. There are few better slow bowlers in the world for such a challenge than Ashwin. When the Khawaja-Green partnership stretched to 208, and the pair had batted through two complete sessions uninterrupted, Ashwin had to do something different. He packed the leg side field to Green, and came around the stumps, cramping the batsman. The delivery that got the wicket was not the finest, slipping down leg and kissing the glove off the attempted sweep for KS Bharat to catch well, but the thought process showed that Ashwin was not giving up at any stage. Alex Carey’s airy waft, trying to launch Ashwin over the off side was perhaps the one instance of the batsman giving away his wicket, but even here Ashwin had slowed the ball down nicely, allowing it to grip and take the edge. Mitchell Starc was a set-up of a different kind. After firing a succession of quick, flat deliveries, into the left-hander, Ashwin floated in the drifter, drawing the bat forward and catching the inside edge with precision. Todd Murphy , who was proving a proper thorn in the flesh with 41, was done in by the ball that went on with the arm and Nathan Lyon got a loopy ball that clipped the outside edge and went to slip via the keeper’s pad. Ashwin, who is a cricket tragic and has a head for numbers, will be telling his teammates that Australia are far from safe yet. Since 2000 there have been nine instances of visiting teams scoring 400 or more against India. Oddly, only one of those has resulted in a win, with four games being lost and three drawn. India were already well on their way, Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill heading to stumps at 36 without loss. While there was a hint of turn for Ashwin towards the very end of the second day, most of his bowling had happened on a placid pitch. With that being the case, the manner in which he controlled the game — going for just 1.92 runs an over — could well be the difference between the two teams. \"I remember my first tour to Australia in 2011-12, I bowled like how a spinner should bowl, put a lot of revs on the ball and spun it harder if things didn’t work,” said Ashwin. “But what I learnt was that to get a bagful of wickets, you have to treat every over as the most important over. I bowled 25-26 good overs and capitalised on it. It was a period of pressure that I could keep on batter for two days.” Ashwin also conceded that it was good to get the big haul in the bag. “You can go to bed feeling a lot better instead of having just three wickets in your kitty. It does feel good as you end up with a good bag of wickets,” said Ashwin. “I will go to bed tonight a bit early and a bit happier. Sometimes numbers speak easily for the bowler and I felt completely happy in my own cocoon about how the ball has been coming out of my hand.” Thanks to Ashwin, the entire Indian team will sleep a little easier tonight.

Spanish prosecutors have filed a complaint after it was reported last month that between 2001 and 2018 Barcelona paid more than 7million euros (£6.2million) to companies owned by Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, who was vice-president of the Spanish FA’s refereeing committee from 1993 to 2018. In a statement reported by local media, the public prosecutor’s office said: “Through presidents (Sandro) Rosell and (Jose Maria) Bartomeu, Barcelona reached and maintained a strictly confidential verbal agreement with the defendant Negreira, so that, in his capacity as vice president of the refereeing committee and in exchange for money, he would carry out actions aimed at favouring Barcelona in the decision making of the referees in the matches played by the club, and thus in the results of the competitions.” READ MORE: The curious case of Alex Neil and Stoke City The focus of the case is on payments made between 2014 and 2018. Rosell served as president from 2010 to 2014, with Bartomeu replacing him and remaining in the post until 2020. Former club executives Oscar Grau and Albert Soler, were listed among the defendents in the case. A judge must yet decide whether to take up the case. Barcelona have not publicly commented on Friday’s development, but last month denied wrongdoing. A statement said they had paid an external consultant for “technical reports related to professional refereeing”, arguing it was common practice in the game. On Tuesday, current Barca president Joan Laporta said: “Barca have never bought referees nor influence. That was never the intention and that has to be clear.

The new song ‘Halla Bol’ is written by lyricist Sholke Lal, composed and sung by famous Bollywood score composer and singer Amit Trivedi, and ably complemented by renowned Rajasthani folk singer Mame Khan. The song aims to appeal to the diverse fanbase of the franchise by encapsulating the spirit of the Royals with the way cry of ‘Halla Bol’ which is beautifully fused through a mixture of modern and folk music, and has a chantable appeal to it, as per a press release from the team. The new song lyrically retains the essence of the culture and the state of Rajasthan but differs musically from the older versions of the team’s anthems ‘Halla Bol’ and ‘Phir Halla Bol’ which were based on more traditional notes. The idea behind the new song is to evoke a strong in-stadia experience that motivates the players and is exciting enough for the fans at the venues to groove to – creating a unique, tantalising atmosphere for the Royals family by also connecting to a newer and younger generation. The lyrics of the song symbolise the diverse facets of being a true Royal – creating a beautiful fusion of two generations – where the traditional fan meets the modern-day fanatic. The song emphasizes the undying spirit of the Royals that is laced with resilience and resoluteness, and the limitless hunger to win on the field. The core essence of our home state is retained by introducing catchphrases in both Hindi and English, giving it a much wider mass appeal and the potential to be chanted at the stadiums by the Royals supporters. The outro reiterates the modern Royals philosophy. “Music is an important, vibrant way for the Royals, both players and fans, to connect emotionally. It has been fantastic to see the love from our fans in the creation of this song. I can’t wait to hear them chanting it in the stadium, helping drive us to victory,” stated Jake Lush McCrum, Chief Executive Officer, Rajasthan Royals. Amit Trivedi, who revealed the Rajasthan Royals Official Song at a recent concert he performed in the franchise’s home city of Jaipur, said, “My first reaction to Rajasthan Royals was ‘Halla Bol’. I’ve been following the IPL for a long time now, so I was very excited. I am also very closely attached to Rajasthan, its folk music, and the artists there. And when the idea came through cricket and the Royals team, it excited me and I thought everything is fitting beautifully well.” “With emphasis on having a song that can be chanted inside the stadiums to blow the roof off, and also in other settings across spheres, it’s been a pleasure bringing the Royals’ vibe to life. The war cry of ‘Halla Bol’ has resonated with so many Royals players and fans, and I hope that this new musical showpiece with Mame Khan can inspire the fans to really ‘Halla Bol’,” said Trivedi. Rajasthan Royals will start their IPL 2023 campaign against Sunrisers Hyderabad from April 2.
