Cricket in the Asian country has gone through massive turmoil over the last few years, especially after their big names, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya and Lasith Malinga bid adieu to international cricket. Last year, the players got into a big dispute with the cricket board over payment issues. A number of their players were also handed bans for various reasons. Moreover, the team struggled to win series across formats. Ranatunga, who played a crucial role in the rise of Sri Lankan cricket during the 1990s, said that the SLC lacked professional operators and alleged them of corruption. MESSED UP EVERYTHING \"It is all about mismanagement, unprofessional, that is where the crisis has occurred in cricket. The worst subject is the cricket board, they are the most corrupt institution in the country,\" Ranatunga was quoted as saying. \"They have messed up everything; they do not have proper professionals who run cricket. It is worse than the government. Cricket wise we have produced players, but they are managed badly. It is a big issue... If you go to a cricket election, you are looking at 143 or 144 votes, it is all about bribing,” he stated. “The people who are running cricket since 2015 have messed up. I always felt that a proper sports minister would come in and they would handle this properly, but the only thing is thieves go and capture the post. It has happened in the past and will happen in the future,\" Ranatunga added. Earlier this year, Sri Lanka toured India for a T20I and Test series and ended up losing all five games on the tour. Prior to that, they lost a T20 series against Aaron Finch’s Australia. A number of Lankan cricketers, including Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dushmantha Chameera and Maheesh Theekshana are currently taking part in the 2022 Indian Premier League (IPL).

During the 49th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Chennai Super Kings in Pune, Royal Challengers Bangalore all-rounder Glenn Maxwell was dismissed cheaply in spite of receiving a promotion in the batting order. It all happened on the last delivery of the ninth over when former Bangalore captain Virat Kohli stepped out only a nudge a Ravindra Jadeja delivery towards to cover before rushing for a single. Maxwell, who responded positively to a risky single, paid the price of the same especially after Robin Uthappa put on display a pinpoint throw to captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Fielding at cover, a swift Uthappa not only challenged Maxwell with his brilliant throw regarding completing a single but also found him way short of his crease. A seasoned campaigner behind the wickets in Dhoni completing the formality had left no option for Maxwell than to return to the dugout. RCB failed to make the most of a 62-run opening partnership between Kohli (30) and captain Faf du Plessis (38) as both of them were dismissed on either side of Maxwell’s dismissal. Maxwell, who walked out to bat ahead of Rajat Patidar at No. 3 for the first time in this season, continued his mediocre form after scoring 3 (3) at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium tonight. All in all, Maxwell’s 160 IPL 2022 runs have come at an average of 22.85 and a strike rate of 175.82.

The two umpires make their way out to the middle followed by the players of Chennai. The Bangalore skipper Faf du Plessis joins Virat Kohli to open the innings. Mukesh Choudhary has the new ball in hand and is raring to go. Let's play... Glenn Maxwell is up for a chat. Shares that he has been hitting the ball well, he feels there's a big score around the corner. Adds that they played nicely in the last game but were unlucky, the wicket of Tewatia would have been a different game. Further says that there is good energy around. Tells that each match is exciting and hopes for a great contest here. Faf du Plessis, the captain of Bangalore says even he wasn't sure of the wicket and he was considering batting first. Adds that the previous match had a good batting performance and he wants his team to play the same way. Informs they are going with the same XI. MS Dhoni, the skipper of Chennai says that they will bowl first. Adds that the ball stops a bit initially here and the dew comes in pretty late, so it doesn't make much of a difference. Mentions that the wicket looks good and they want to play good cricket. Informs that Moeen Ali comes in for Mitchell Santner. Adds that they want to be more consistent with the batting and not give away a big over at crucial stages while bowling and hopes to improve upon the fielding as well. Bangalore (Unchanged playing XI) - Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (C), Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (WK), Shahbaz Ahmed, Mahipal Lomror, Wanindu Hasaranga, Harshal Patel, Josh Hazlewood, Mohammed Siraj. Chennai (Playing XI) - Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devon Conway, Robin Uthappa, Ambati Rayudu, Moeen Ali (In for Mitchell Santner), MS Dhoni (C/WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Simarjeet Singh, Dwaine Pretorius, Mukesh Choudhary, Maheesh Theekshana. Toss - Chennai have won the toss and they have elected to BOWL first! PITCH REPORT - Danny Morrison is pitchside. Danny says it's the third time they are playing on this pitch and it is dry, the grass has come off a bit more. Adds that the spinners will enjoy more and the pacers will have to vary their pace and bowl into the deck more. Suggests that the pacers should also look to bowl more yorkers. Bangalore, on the other hand, are on a three-match losing streak and even though Virat Kohli scored a half-century last time it wasn't quite vintage Virat. Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell and even Mahipal Lomror were good in the middle order but Kohli and du Plessis need to get their side off to a flying start so that those big-hitters can come into play more. They are in desperate need of a win tonight or else they will just keep falling behind in the playoffs race. So, both teams need a win big time and this will make for an even more entertaining watch. Which side will emerge victorious? We'll find out. Toss and team news in a bit. In their last game, MS Dhoni took on the reigns back from Ravindra Jadeja and the former Chennai skipper rallied his troops to a much-needed win thanks to some explosive batting from Ruturaj Gaikwad and Devon Conway at the top. Chennai are still pretty further down in the table but a win here will all of a sudden get them level on points with a couple of sides above them. Also, on a personal milestone, MS Dhoni will be playing his 200th Indian T20 League game for Chennai. Last night we saw Gujarat lose their second game of the season after five consecutive wins which also meant that Punjab got back in the mix for the playoffs race.

Delhi Capitals made a brilliant squad in the IPL 2022 auction, but they have struggled to perform well in the tournament so far. They have managed to win four of their nine games in the tournament, and they have to win at least four of their five games to reach the playoffs. The Delhi Capitals have struggled a lot in their batting lineup this year, and they rely a lot on their top-order to win the games. David Warner is the highest run-scorer of the tournament with 264 runs at 44.00, whereas Shaw is the 2nd highest run-scorer of the side with 259 runs. Kuldeep Yadav has been the highest wicket-taker of the team with 17 wickets so far. It is interesting that Kuldeep has won the player of the match award in all four wins of Delhi Capitals. David Warner calls for runs from Delhi Capitals’ top-order David Warner, who is the highest run-scorer of the side acknowledged that the Capitals will have to win almost all of their games to reach the playoffs. He has expressed his delight with his partnership with Shaw and said that when they both fell cheaply, the team struggled. “We’ve got off to a good start,” Warner said about his partnership with Shaw in Delhi Capitals’ official release. “In the last match, we’ve fallen cheaply, both of us, and that can happen in this game because we have to play that high-level brand of cricket in the power play.” David Warner also said that the top-3 of the side will have to score big runs in order to set up runs and chase big targets as well. He said that the focus on the top-order to score big runs for the side. | “Our focus is to take it game by game and trying to win those games.” | @davidwarner31 previewed our #DCvSRH game and talked about the season so far and what lies ahead #YehHaiNayiDilli | #IPL | #CapitalsUnplugged | #OctaRoarsForDC pic.twitter.com/a1vI32GhJl — Delhi Capitals (@DelhiCapitals) May 4, 2022 “I think the most important thing is myself or him [Shaw] or Mitch scoring an 80 or 90 or even a hundred if we can, to post good totals or chase down big totals, and that’s the key,” Warner said. “The teams who are doing well are scoring big runs at the top of the order. And, two players are actually scoring big in the games, they are the ones that you really need to shine to win these games.” Delhi Capitals will now face Sunrisers Hyderabad in their next league game at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai on 5 May 2022.

In a statement issued today, BCCI said that a committee has found that the actions of Majumder were in the nature of threat and intimidation, and therefore he has been banned from BCCI related matches and other events for two years. In the statement, BCCI said that it had taken cognizance of messages posted by Wriddhiman Saha saying that he felt bullied and threatened by the conduct of Boria Majumder.

BCCI issues order to ban journalist Boria Majumdar for two years for intimidating cricketer Wriddhiman Saha. \"…The BCCI Committee concluded that the actions by Majumdar were indeed in the nature of threat and intimidation..,\" read the order. pic.twitter.com/tcUlHuBTZk— ANI (@ANI) May 4, 2022 The committee considered submissions made by both Saha and Majumder, and concluded that actions by Majumder were indeed in the nature of threat and intimidation. As a result, the committee recommended the ban to the Apex Council of BCCI, and the Apex Council accepted the recommendations. According to the ban, for two years, Boria Majumder will not get any accreditation as a member of the press in any cricket matches held in India, both domestic and international. He will also not be able to interview any BCCI registered cricketer, and he will not get access to any cricket facilities owned by BCCI and its associates. It was reported last week itself that Boria Majumdar faces two years ban as BCCI had found him guilty of intimidating Wriddhiman Saha. This all happened after Wriddhiman Saha took to Twitter in February of this year to post a screenshot of threatening messages received by him from an unnamed journalist requesting an interview and then humiliating him for not responding. In the post, Saha wrote, “After all of my contributions to Indian cricket..this is what I face from a so called “Respected” journalist! This is where the journalism has gone.” In the screenshot posted by Saha, the journalist was seen asking Saha to do an interview with him. The journalist also says that he will not be pushing Saha for an interview, however, the wicket-keeper must choose the person who can help him the most. As Saha did not entertain the journalist’s request or call him back, the journalist became angry and said that he would never again take his interview. He had further stated in the message that he would not take this insult kindly. The journalist had even warned Saha that he should not have behaved in this manner. While Saha had not named the journalist in the tweet, many had speculated it to be Boria Majumder, and during the hearing, the cricketer had named him. He said that he was “bullied” by Boria for an interview.","pubDate":"2022-05-04 11:23:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"opindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RCB vs CSK Dream11 IPL 2022: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream 11, Probable Playing XI for Chennai vs Bangalore","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/rcb-vs-csk-dream11-fantasy-cricket-tips-dream-11-probable-playing-xi-for-chennai-vs-bangalore-ipl-2022-2022-05-04-774206","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"RCB vs CSK Dream11 IPL 2022: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream 11, Probable Playing XI for Royal Challengers Bangalore Vs Chennai Super Kings Match Details","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-04 10:45:47","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BREAKING: BCCI bans Boria Majumdar for threatening Wriddhiman Saha","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/breaking-bcci-bans-boria-majumdar-for-threatening-wriddhiman-saha-2460163.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has banned journalist Boria Majumdar for two years after its commitee found him guilty of intimidating Wriddhiman Saha.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-04 10:28:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Boria Majumdar banned from Indian cricket for two years for ‘threatening, intimidating’ Saha","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/bcci-bans-boria-mazumdar-for-two-years-in-wriddhiman-saha-case-7901083/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-04 10:14:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
