The key decisions were taken at the ICC Board Meeting held in Dubai. In line with a previous recommendation from the ICC Men's Cricket Committee, the CEC agreed that more neutral match officials should be utilised as travel restrictions are lifted while building on the success of the use of home umpires. From the 2022-23 season, one neutral and one home umpire in Tests will be allowed, while home umpires are permitted for ODIs and T20s. Following the recent decision to expand the ICC Women's Championship to ten teams, the ICC Board approved a recommendation that ODI status be extended to a number of Associate Member women's teams to enable them to progress to global qualifying events based on ODI rankings. Among other decisions, the ICC Board confirmed that South Africa will host the inaugural ICC U-19 Women's T20 World Cup, which will be held in January next year. The tournament will be a 16-team, 41-match event. The qualification pathway for the eight-team ICC Women's Cricket World Cup was also confirmed. The yet to be determined host of the event will automatically qualify along with the next five highest-placed teams at the end of the 22-25 ICC Women's Championship (IWC). The remaining two teams will be identified through a global qualifying event between the four bottom-placed teams in the IWC plus an additional two teams from the ODI rankings. The qualification pathway for the ICC men's T20 World Cup 2024 was also confirmed with 12 teams qualifying automatically for the event. The top eight teams from the 2022 event will be joined by the two host members, West Indies and the USA plus the next highest-ranked teams on the MRF ICC Men's T20 rankings table as of November 14, 2022.

Pretty sure everyone watching the game were biting their nails till the last ball. Rajasthan needed something special from their bowlers after managing to get just 165 on a Wankhede pitch and their bowlers didn't disappoint them. Kuldeep Sen did absoultely well to defend 15 runs off the last over after escoecially after Prasidh Krishna conceding 19 runs in the peunultimate over. Their bowlers rose to the occasion and stepped up handing them the win. Credit to Marcus Stoinis though who playing a fabulous knock at the end. If Krunal Pandya had taken that catch of Hetmyer when he was on 14, things might have ended differently for them but nevertheless, they ended up on the wrong side and would be looking to make amends in the next game. 19.6 overs (6 Runs) SIX! BANG! Full length, on middle and leg. Marcus Stoinis smokes it over the square leg fence for a biggie. Kuldeep Sen defends 14 runs to get his side over the line. RAJASTHAN WIN THE GAME BY 3 RUNS. 19.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Does not matter. Full length, outside off. Marcus Stoinis gets it to third man off the outside edge for a boundary. 19.4 overs (0 Run) Three dots! Kuldeep Sen, you beauty! The stocks of the young lad are surely rising here. It is full and outside off. Marcus Stoinis tries to heave it across the line but misses. Now, all Sen has to do is deliver legal deliveries and take the game home. 19.3 overs (0 Run) Two dots on the trot now! This is incredible bowling by Sen on his debut. It is full and outside off. Marcus Stoinis shuffles across, he tries to scoop it away but gets pinged on his pads. 19.2 overs (0 Run) A DOT NOW! Full length, wide outside off. Marcus Stoinis shuffles across and drives it hard to extra cover but straight to the fielder. 19.1 overs (1 Run) Avesh Khan does the right thing here. A full toss, on the stumps. Avesh Khan lofts it over covers for a single. Marcus Stoinis on strike now with 14 needed off 5. Kuldeep Sen to bowl the final over. 15 needed off 6. Can he defend it? 18.6 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Oh hello! Game is still on! This is full, straight and on off. Marcus Stoinis gets under it and smokes it over the bowler's head for a maximum. Marcus Stoinis couldn't have hit it any better. Prasidh Krishna goes for 19 runs in the penultimate over. 18.5 overs (0 Run) Two dots on the trot! These are gold dust at the moment! It is back of a length, on off. Marcus Stoinis tries to hook it away but misses. Prasidh Krishna appeals for caught behind but the umpire shows no interest. Sanju Samson opts for the review. The UltraEdge shows there is a flat line as the ball passes the bat. The on-field decision of not out stays. 18.4 overs (0 Run) An attempted yorker again, which turns into a full toss. Marcus Stoinis hits it to long on but does not take a run. 18.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! OH YES! OH YES! That's why Marcus Stoinis has come in down the order. It a low full toss, on off. Marcus Stoinis smokes it over the bowler's head for a maximum. Pressure on the bowler. 18.2 overs (2 Runs) Low full toss, on middle and leg. Marcus Stoinis flicks it to deep mid-wicket. The throw from the deep is not good enough. The batters run two and it looks like Avesh Khan makes it safely at the bowler's end. The umpires take it upstairs to confirm. The third umpire signals not out on the big screen. 18.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Marcus Stoinis exposes his stumps this time but it works in his favour. It is full, on middle and leg. Marcus Stoinis stands outside the off stump, tickles it down to fine leg for a boundary. Now, there is a mini press conference taking place with the bowler. 18.1 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Prasidh Krishna starts the penultimate over with a loosener. He goes for a wide yorker, which lands way outside the tramline. Marcus Stoinis does not bother. The umpire signals a wide. 17.6 overs (6 Runs) SIX! BANG! Avesh Khan has only one intent. It is full and on off. Avesh Khan gets low and slogs it over the wide long on fence for a maximum. Lucknow need 34 in 12 balls. 17.5 overs (0 Run) OUT! LBW! Yuzvendra Chahal picks up his fourth wicket now. This is also his 150th wicket in the Indian T20 League. It is full and on the stumps. Dushmantha Chameera tries to block it out but misses. He gets rapped on the pads. Yuzvendra Chahal appeals but the umpire is unmoved. Rajasthan opt for the review. The UltraEdge shows no bat is involved. The Ball Trackers shows three reds and Rajasthan now see the back of Dushmantha Chameera. Avesh Khan is the new batsman in. Rajasthan have opted a review for an LBW. It looked dead plumb to the naked eye but the on-field umpire has ruled it NOT OUT. UltraEdge shows no bat involved. Ball Tracking shows that the ball is pitching in line, the impact is in line and it is wickets hitting. Three reds and the on-field decision is reversed. 17.5 overs (1 Run) WIDE! This is tossed up, full and outside off. The ball grips and turns away sharply. Dushmantha Chameera gets low and tries to sweep it away but misses. The umpire thinks the ball goes out of the tramline and deems it as a wide. 17.4 overs (0 Run) Floated, full and on leg. Dushmantha Chameera works it back to the bowler. 17.4 overs (1 Run) WIDE!

Dushmantha Chameera gets low and drags his sweep to deep square leg for two runs. A good over for Lucknow as 11 runs come off it. 16.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! A much-needed boundary for Lucknow. It is a short ball, on off. Dushmantha Chameera pulls it into the gap at deep mid-wicket for a boundary. 16.4 overs (1 Run) Full length, on middle and leg.

Trent Boult (3-0-19-2) to bowl out. 15.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! EDGY! Yuzvendra Chahal is not happy about it all. It is full, wide outside off. Dushmantha Chameera flirts away from his body. The ball races down to third man off the outside edge for four. Nonetheless, an outstanding over by Chahal comes to an end. His currently tally also makes him the Purple cap holder with a better economy rate. Dushmantha Chameera walks out to bat. 15.5 overs (0 Run) OUT! TIMBER! Yuzvendra Chahal, you beauty! Second of the over and Rajasthan right on top at the moment. It is full and on the off stump. Krunal Pandya shuffles across the stumps, exposes the sticks. Pandya misses his sweep. The ball goes through to rattle the stumps. 64 runs needed in 25 balls now. 15.4 overs (1 Run) Marcus Stoinis gets off the mark. It is full and outside off. Stoinis pushes it to sweeper cover for one. Drinks! With Quinton de Kock back in the hut, things look like done and dusted for Lucknow unless a miracle happens here. Rajasthan have been brilliant with the ball so far and they will feel that they are on the brink of a victory. Marcus Stoinis is the new batsman in. 15.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Yuzvendra Chahal gets rid of the big fish here. He picks up his second wicket of the game and continues on his merry way in this season. It is tossed up, full and on off. Quinton de Kock clears his front leg and tonks it towards wide of long on. Riyan Parag there moves to his left to take a sharp catch. Sixth one goes down for Lucknow. 15.2 overs (3 Runs) Floated, full and on leg. Krunal Pandya comes down the track and flicks it to the leg side for a brace. The batters run one more due to overthrow. 15.1 overs (1 Run) Flatter and wide outside off.

The reports suggest that with Imran Khan ousted as Primer Minister of Pakistan, Ramiz may also go. Ramiz is presently in Dubai for the International Cricket Council (ICC) meetings which concluded on Sunday. Dare I say more! https://t.co/8igcX8hhHJ ‚Äî Ramiz Raja (@iramizraja) April 3, 2022 \"Ramiz had only agreed to become the chairman of the Board on the insistence of Imran for whom all the players who played under his captaincy including Ramiz have a lot of regard and respect,\" a source well aware of the developments said on Sunday. \"Ramiz was well set in a career as commentator, TV personality and expert and was busy with assignments. But on Imran's insistence he agreed to put aside all his media contacts and become chairman of the board,\" the source said. \"Ramiz had also made it clear to the PM that he would only remain in the Board until he (Imran Khan) was PM.\" The source said that with Imran now ousted as PM, who is also Patron-in-Chief of the Board and directly nominates the chairman for a formal election process, it is highly unlikely Ramiz would stay on unless the new Premier wants him to carry on with his job. Since Ramiz took over as PCB chairman last September he has made a lot of changes in the Board and also followed up on Imran's insistence on a domestic cricket structure based on just six first class provincial teams. Welcome Austrayliaa , the Pakistan way! pic.twitter.com/eFNrJxUzIZ ‚Äî Ramiz Raja (@iramizraja) March 18, 2022 Soon after taking charge, he made it clear to Misbah-ul-Haq and Waqar Younis that they were no longer required as head coach and bowling coach of the national team and should resign. He also asked the head of the high performance centre in Lahore, Grant Bradburn, and some other coaches to resign. His biggest move was to create circumstances where Wasim Khan stepped down as CEO of the Board. Since then, Ramiz has brought in a new CEO but with Imran's government now gone, it remains to be seen what will happen to the new appointments in the Board as it is no secret that political changes also have a big bearing on Pakistan cricket set-up. \"If Shahbaz Sharif becomes new Premier, then there is every likelihood he might convey to Ramiz his services are no longer required and bring back Najam Sethi to head the Board,\" the source said. But, with no international or domestic commitments for the national team until June, changes in the Board will not affect cricket affairs. Sethi resigned soon after Imran won the last general elections as he never got along with the former captain on political issues.

She is hopeful of returning for the start of next summer, and takes heart from the likes Pat Cummins who have got their bodies right later in their careers. \"I am 23, so hopefully a few more years ahead,\" Cheatle said. \"All I want to be doing is playing cricket and everything that can get me there I am trying to do. \"But there is no barrier other than a little rehab journey right now. \"You get to 25 or 26, and then your body matures with the workloads. It happens in the men's game as well.\"","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-6404779/9aed4c902ff62810450c93fb5e6efab4b0068747-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"GTC, Royals Cricket Club win in Golap-Arati Hazarika and Sarat Kalita Memorial Cricket","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/north-east-india-news/local-sports/gtc-royals-cricket-club-win-in-golap-arati-hazarika-and-sarat-kalita-memorial-cricket-586914","keywords":["Sports,Local Sports"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Gauhati Town Club (GTC) and Royals Cricket Club won in two matches of the Golap-Arati Hazarika and Sarat Kalita Memorial Cricket","content":"Our Sports ReporterGUWAHATI: Gauhati Town Club (GTC) and Royals Cricket Club won in two matches of the Golap-Arati Hazarika and Sarat Kalita Memorial Cricket at the Nehru stadium here today.

Jason Holder pushes it to cover. 0.2 over (0 Run) OUT! LBW! Trent Boult is spitting fire! Excellent seam bowling from him. Krishnappa Gowtham departs for a duck as well. This time Trent Boult goes over the wicket to the right-hander and delivers another good length delivery, nipping in. Krishnappa Gowtham looks to flick but misses and gets thudded on the pads. They appeal and the umpire agrees straightaway. Superb start from Rajasthan. Krishnappa Gowtham walks to his partner but Quinton de Kock suggests going against the review and rightly so, as the replays confirmed it was plumb. Jason Holder is the new batter in. 0.2 over (1 Run) WIDE! What a take from Sanju Samson! Length ball, down leg, going further away. Sanju Samson dives full length to his left and takes it one-handed. Krishnappa Gowtham comes in at number 3. 0.1 over (0 Run) OUT! BOWLED! A dream start from Trent Boult! What a ripper from Boult! Second time KL Rahul has gotten out for a golden duck this season. Very clever from Trent Boult to start from 'round the wicket. He hurls in and delivers a perfect inswinging delivery first up to KL Rahul, on middle. KL Rahul has no clue about that and just plays it all around. He gets beaten by the swing and hears the death rattle behind him. Lucknow lose an early wicket and this is just the start Rajasthan were looking for.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637852245259044147.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Maharaj, Harmer claim early wickets as Bangladesh chase 413","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/04/11/cricket-maharaj-harmer-claim-early-wickets-as-bangladesh-chase-413","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"GQEBERHA, South Africa (Reuters) - Spinners Keshav Maharaj and Simon Harmer took three quick wickets as South Africa reduced Bangladesh to 27 for three in pursuit of a victory target of 413 at the close on day three of the second and final test at St George‚Äôs Park on Sunday.

The duo made inroads into the visitors‚Äô top order on a wicket that is taking prodigious turn and with the weather set fair for the next two days, Bangladesh face a battle to claim a most unlikely victory. The highest successful run chase at St George‚Äôs Park is 271 by Australia against South Africa in 1997. The only other total over 200 was South Africa‚Äôs 215 against New Zealand in 1954. Visiting captain Mominul Haque will resume on five, and will be joined at the wicket by first-innings top scorer Mushfiqur Rahim. Bangladesh opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy scored the only century of the series in the first test in Durban but was out for his second duck in this test, lasting three balls in his two innings. He got a thick edge to Maharaj (2-17) that struck the gloves of wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne and looped to Wiaan Mulder at second slip. One became two quickly as Maharaj struck in his next over, trapping Najmul Hossain Shanto (7) lbw. The home side claimed the vital wicket of the dangerous Tamim Iqbal (13) with the last ball of the day as Harmer got bounce off the surface and the ball struck the shoulder of the bat, looping to Mulder. South Africa went in pursuit of quick runs in their second innings as opener Sarel Erwee top-scored with 41 and Verreynne ended unbeaten on 39 before they declared on 176 for six. Left arm spinner Taijul Islam finished with figures of 3-67 for a match haul of 9-202. South Africa bowled Bangladesh out for 217 in their first innings as Mushfiqur top-scored with 51.

At the moment there is no training. So I will go and get the scans and then we can find out what's going on, and then hopefully can make a plan from there,\" Stokes had said on the Round the Wicket podcast. England have a gruelling summer ahead as they host New Zealand and South Africa for three-Test series apiece, as well play the rescheduled fifth Test against India, and Stokes' fitness will be key to the team's success. Stokes ended up bowling 99 overs in the three-Test series in the West Indies, which reportedly aggravated the knee problem. But the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have revealed that the all-rounder's injury is not serious and, while they will continue to monitor his progress, he is set to feature for Durham in May, reported mirror.co.uk. A statement from the ECB read, \"Ben had a scan on his left knee which didn't reveal anything new. We had planned for him to return to LV= Insurance County Championship cricket in early May and, while he is feeling tender in the knee, that plan remains the same following the scan.

The Lucknow bowlers have done their job by restricting Rajasthan to a below-par score. The onus now is on the batters to chase down the target and extend their winning run in the maiden season. Rajasthan though won't make it an easy outing for the new side. An enticing chase coming up shortly. Shimron Hetmyer is in for a chat. He says that it was a little bit difficult to start and playing against spinners was tough. Tells that the ball is sticking onto the surface a bit. Mentions that he respects Holder a lot but he had to bat deep and take on every bowler. On asked about Ashwin's retired out strategy, he says that he has no idea what happened there and did not expect it but says that it was a good decision. Says that they have a good chance and they will need to bowl in the right areas. A great bowling performance by Lucknow overall! Lucknow could not do much to restrict the run flow in the Powerplay, but their spinners did well to trouble the batters and get Lucknow back into the game. It was Avesh Khan who drew first blood off his very first delivery, although it was Krishnappa Gowtham who stole the limelight, with two wickets in his first over. The decision of pushing Ashwin above Riyan Parag did work really well for Rajasthan. The fifth wicket helped Rajasthan to stable their ship. It all went wrong for Rajasthan after losing Jos Buttler. There was a mini collapse that took place as Rajasthan lost three wickets in quick succession. Although a stand of 68 runs between Ashwin and Hetmyer added some respect to the scoreboard for Rajasthan. Riyan Parag came in as Ravichandran Ashwin was deemed retired out, which allowed Parag to free his arms in the final over. So 165 is what Rajasthan could get on the board. It looks to be under par. It was never going to easy to set a target on this wicket. Rajasthan got off to a flyer, but the slowness of the deck got the better of them at one stage. Lucknow dominated the proceedings in the middle over but would be a tad disappointed with the runs leaked in the death overs. 19.6 overs (2 Runs) Two runs! Short ball again, on middle. Trent Boult pulls it to deep mid-wicket. He calls for the second run and gets it easily at the end. Excellent batting at the death from Rajasthan all thanks to Shimron Hetmyer and they have reached a good score here. Rajasthan finish with 165/6. Trent Boult is the new man in. 19.5 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Finally, Lucknow manage to get a wicket but the damage has already been done. Short ball from Holder, on middle. Riyan Parag looks to pull but miscues it as it was a slower ball. The ball goes to deep square leg where Krishnappa Gowtham charges forward and takes a good diving catch. 19.4 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Riyan Parag comes to the party now! This is quality batting from Rajasthan at the backend. Jason Holder keeps delivering full tosses and the batters just keep hitting it away. Another full toss, on the pads. Riyan Parag whips it over deep square leg for a biggie. 19.3 overs (1 Run) Short of a length, on middle. Pulled to long on for a single. 19.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! This is superb batting from Shimron Hetmyer! A full toss, outside off. Shimron Hetmyer gets underneath the ball and smacks it with immense power over long on for a huge maximum. He has played a huge role here and will look to end this innings on a high. 19.1 overs (1 Run) A low full toss, on the pads. Riyan Parag whips it to deep square leg for a single. 150 up for Rajasthan! 18.6 overs (1 Run) A good yorker on off, Riyan Parag squeezes it out to the off side for a single. 18.5 overs (1 Run) This is now pulled to deep mid-wicket for a single. 18.4 overs (6 Runs) SIX MORE! Shimron Hetmyer brings up his fifty! In the slot, on middle. Shimron Hetmyer says thank you and muscles it over deep mid-wicket for another biggie. 18.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! BOOM! Short ball, outside off. Shimron Hetmyer stands tall on his toes and slaps it over point for a maximum. A great strategy used by Rajasthan here. How will it pay off though? What happened here? It looks like Ravichandran Ashwin is retired out. 18.2 overs (1 Run) Full again, outside off. Driven to sweeper cover for a single. 18.1 overs (1 Run) Fuller in length, on middle. Shimron Hetmyer drills it to long on for just a single. 17.6 overs (1 Run) Keeps the strike! Length ball, outside off. Shimron Hetmyer steers it to cover for a quick single. 17.5 overs (6 Runs) SIX! BANG! Shimron Hetmyer is taking on the charge! Length ball, on middle. Shimron Hetmyer stands tall and pummes it over the bowler's head for another biggie. Rajasthan are finishing strongly here. 17.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Lovely! Touch fuller, on middle and leg. Shimron Hetmyer this time shuffles across and flicks it behind square on the leg side for a boundary. 17.3 overs (0 Run) Length ball, angling it away from outside off, Shimron Hetmyer moves that side and tries to reach out for it but fails to connect. 17.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Much-needed maximum! Full, on leg That was in the arc and Shimron Hetmyer doesn't miss out. Smacks it with disdain over deep mid-wicket for a cracking six. 17.1 overs (1 Run) Full and on the pads, clipped to deep square leg for a single. 16.6 overs (1 Run) Very full, outside off. Ravichandran Ashwin hangs back and chips it over the bowler's end. The ball lands safely though towards long off and the batters take a run. 16.5 overs (0 Run) Short of a length, outside off. Ravichandran Ashwin has a wild swing across the line but misses. 16.5 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Lands outside the tramline on a full length and Ashwin let's it go. 16.4 overs (2 Runs) Fuller, on off. Ravichandran Ashwin squirts it off the inside edge to deep square leg. The batters take a single but a needless overthrow at the striker's end allows the batters to come back for the second. 16.3 overs (1 Run) Short and outside off, Shimron Hetmyer rides the bounce and taps it to backward point for a single. 16.2 overs (1 Run) Length ball, outside off. Ravichandran Ashwin drags it off the inside half of his bat to long on for one. 16.1 overs (1 Run) Back of a length, outside off. Shimron Hetmyer taps it to backward point for a quick single. Ayush Badoni has a shy at the striker's end but misses. A direct hit and Ravichandran Ashwin was a goner! 15.6 overs (1 Run) Drifting it on leg, Shimron Hetmyer misses his flick. The ball goes off the pads to the leg side for a leg bye. 16 runs off Krishnappa Gowtham's final over. 15.5 overs (0 Run) Drifting it full, on off. Shimron Hetmyer pats it back to the bowler. 15.4 overs (2 Runs) Short and wide, outside off. Shimron Hetmyer cuts it behind point for a brace. 15.3 overs (1 Run) A full toss now, on middle. Ravichandran Ashwin misses out on this one as he manages to heave it away only to long off for a single. 15.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Yes, Ravichandran Ashwin can bat! Drops it short, on middle and leg. Ravichandran Ashwin transfers his weight back and pulls it with power over deep mid-wicket for another biggie. 15.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Wow! Krishnappa Gowtham angles it away, outside off. Ravichandran Ashwin stands tall and tonks it over the bowler's head for a maximum.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637852220087305688.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bangladesh's shot-selection in focus as batters make 'mental and technical mistakes' - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC1zLXNob3Qtc2VsZWN0aW9uLWluLWZvY3VzLWFzLWJhdHRlcnMtbWFrZS1tZW50YWwtYW5kLXRlY2huaWNhbC1taXN0YWtlcy0xMzEwMjgx0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Bangladesh's shot-selection in focus as batters make 'mental and technical mistakes'¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoMaharaj, Harmer claim early wickets as South Africa tightens noose on Bangladesh¬†¬†Sportstar2nd Test: Maharaj, Harmer claim early wickets as Bangladesh chase 413¬†¬†Times of IndiaSpinners extend South Africa's dominance on day three¬†¬†International Cricket CouncilThe Maharaj-Harmer partnership - how far can South Africa go with it?¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-10 15:32:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄúBest caught and bowled ever‚Äù: Brad Hogg exalts KKR vs DC Man of the Match Kuldeep Yadav for grabbing fantastic diving catch","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-best-caught-and-bowled-ever-brad-hogg-exalts-kkr-vs-dc-man-of-the-match-kuldeep-yadav-for-grabbing-fantastic-diving-catch/","keywords":["Cricket","Delhi Capitals","IPL 2022","KKR","DC","Indian Premier League","Kolkata Knight riders","kuldeep yadav"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kuldeep Yadav: The spinner from Delhi Capitals won a match award for all-round contributions in the second innings.

With Delhi fast bowler Khaleel Ahmed sending back Kolkata opening batters Venkatesh Iyer (18) and Ajinkya Rahane (8) to the dressing room, it was Yadav who ran through their lower-order to pick bowling figures of 4-0-35-4. In the 13th over, opposition captain Shreyas Iyer (54) had hit a towering six over long-on against Yadav. Wanting to step out and hit Yadav on the following delivery as well, Iyer had completely missed the ball as his counterpart Rishant Pant stumped him without any discomfort. In the 16th over, Yadav picked as many as three wickets in Pat Cummins (4), Sunil Narine (4) and Umesh Yadav (0) to not just become the pick of the bowlers in the match but also put his team in a winning position. It was on the last ball of his spell that Kuldeep Yadav picked his fourth wicket by putting on display a stunning caught and bowled. Wanting to grab a catch off Umesh Yadav‚Äôs slog, Kuldeep ran towards his right to complete a fantastic diving catch.

According to media reports, Ganguly and Jay Shah faceoff was to take take place with current ICC chairman Greg Barclay deciding not to extend his present term. Shah is one of the new inductees in the ICC cricket committee with former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene being reappointed as former player. New Zealand chief coach Gary Stead, ICC Elite Panel umpire Joel Wilson and MCC representative Jamie Cox are also part of the panel. However, The ICC board on Sunday convinced its chairman Gregor Barclay to complete his term till end of October before the global body starts its nomination process to find a new chairman where the Indian cricket board could play a massive role. The two-day board meeting which concluded in Dubai on Sunday was a win-win one for the Indian cricket board as Barclay's continuation till October gives it ample time to strategise whether it will field a candidate for the top post in the month of November. \"There has been no discussion on renomination of Barclay. But he will finish his current two year term as a chairman till end of October. So the process of nominating a new chairman only starts in November,\" an ICC Board member told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Originally, there was a possibility that the renomination or nomination would have happened in the month of June but that changed after deliberations between the member boards. The decision also helps the BCCI buy time as they are likely to have their AGM in September after which the composition of the national parent body will be clear. The BCCI has already appealed, seeking a a few changes in the Lodha Constitution which many feel till date is practically non-implementable. It will be interesting to see whether president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah go for a cooling-off in September. Shah's name is doing the rounds as the next chairman of ICC but there has been no confirmation from either the BCCI secretary himself or sources close to him about his apparent interest in throwing his hat in the ring.
