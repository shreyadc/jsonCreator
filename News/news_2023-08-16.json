Conflicting reports came out after the event with England captain Ben Stokes using his social media to say the players met up in a night club after the game. Aussie batsman Travis Head then revealed his side got \"a bit fed up\" of waiting around. ﻿ READ MORE: British tabloid's bizarre claim ahead of Matildas semi-final READ MORE: Boxing debut revealed for two-metre tall NRL beast READ MORE: England football fans locked out by sneaky Aussie ticket ploy \"It's been played up a little bit,\" Head told the Willow Talk podcast. \"Post-match, I think we hung around for a little bit. (England) had a couple of retirements, and, I think, a few staff that (were) going. \"We sort of knocked a couple of times and got told two minutes, which turned into an hour, and the boys got a bit fed up. \"But yeah, a few of the boys met up with them afterwards, and I've been in contact with a couple of the guys that I was close with about the differences in the timings. A bit disappointing, but I don't think it was by design.\" Speaking at the SCG for Cricket Australia's partnership announcement with HCLTech, Cummins confirmed the traditional post-series changeroom beer did not occur. \"It would have been nice to have a beer with them,\" Cummins said. \"After a great Ashes, it would have been good. Not to be. I think they had a fair few meetings on in their change room and we hung around for a bit. But we had a pretty good night.\"﻿ Despite Stokes' suggestion that both parties decided to meet up in the night club, Head said it wasn't planned. ﻿ \"We didn't go there together... It's just by design again that both teams found themselves at the same place,\" Head said. \"I think it was a Monday night, but there are not many places to go on a Monday night in London, so we found ourselves at the same place... shared one or two vodka Red Bulls together and then off to the flight.\" ﻿Throughout the press conference on Tuesday morning, Cummins also had an awkward exchange when a reporter asked if he'd like to stay Test captain for the summer. \"For this summer?,\" he replied﻿ before pausing with a smile and simply saying \"yeah\". The Aussie ODI skipper also confirmed his wrist injury is on the mend and said he'll play a part in the back end of the side's upcoming series in South Africa. ﻿","pubDate":"2023-08-15 21:32:11","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/08/529875/raw-capture-sequence.00_00_24_14.still447.png","source_id":"nine","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Let’s roar on Lionesses to waltz past the Matildas and get payback for Ashes in huge Women’s World Cup semi final","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/11098308/england-lionesses-matildas-australia-world-cup-semi-final/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Exclusives","The Sun Newspaper","Women's football","Women's World Cup 2019"],"creator":["Adam Sonin"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"ENGLAND’S Lionesses were last night roared on by Rishi Sunak — who urged them to “finish the job” against Australia.

Verstappen holds a 125-point lead in the overall standings in 2023, as he chases a third straight drivers' title. The Dutchman has won 10 of this season's 12 races, finishing second behind his Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez on the other two occasions. The Sprint format was introduced in 2021, and takes place at only a handful of stops. Verstappen has dominated there as well, winning five out of the nine Sprints so far, but has hit out at the repeated changes to the calendar. Verstappen has even suggested he could be encouraged to quit Formula 1 if more and more tweaks are made. However, Croft, who covered Formula 1 for the BBC before moving over to Sky, has proposed a solution. \"I think the Sprint concept is good, I like it, but I don't like it being part of the world championship,\" Croft told the Sky Sports F1 podcast . \"I'd like two separate world championships, like cricket has T20, ODIs and Test match, and we'll keep them separate. \"Have your Sprint day on a Friday maybe, rather than the Saturday. You could go into Sprint qualifying and then the Sprint, with maybe a 20-minute warm up in the morning - that's your Friday. \"And then the cars are not in parc ferme for the rest of the weekend, because you then have your practice session on the Saturday morning, Saturday qualifying and then the race on Sunday. So you're keeping the two very separate for different world championships.\" Do you support Croft's idea? Have your say in the comments section Speaking after the most recent Sprint session in Belgium in July, Verstappen said : \"I think luckily it wasn't too bad, but honestly with these kind of Sprint formats, when you have an FP1 like that… But even when it's fully dry it's still a bit hit-and-miss. \"That always makes it very chaotic, that's why I never really enjoy these kind of weekends because you don't have the time and once you do a mistake you're stuck with it for the rest of the weekend and I don't think it should be like that. \"For sure, you can do better things with the format, but I guess they implemented that for this particular reason, that there is a bit more chaos and people not getting it right. But I don't think, with how advanced everything is in this sport, that it should be like that, that on a Friday if you arrive with the wrong set-up or you make the wrong call after FP1 then you're stuck with it for the rest of the weekend.\" He had previously questioned the changes in April, hinting at an eventual exit from the sport despite his dominance. \"If we keep expanding the calendar and the whole weekend is that long, at one point you question yourself 'is it worth it?',\" he said. \"I do like racing, I do like winning. I know that of course the salary and everything, you have a good life, but is it actually a good life? I think sometimes you get to a point in your career where maybe you want to do other stuff. Croft, however, had a ready-made solution to the prospect of teams being unhappy with the format. Within his hypothetical scenario, he suggested teams would have the option of handing the reins to reserve drivers or even sitting out the 'second' championship altogether. \"If the teams and all the drivers don't want to run in the Sprint world championships, fine, there's enough reserve drivers that do,\" he said. \"Maybe that's a good way of getting the reserve drivers involved in that. So commercially, that's kind of what I'd look at.\"","pubDate":"2023-08-15 19:46:04","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30711999.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_F1-Belgian-Grand-Prix-2023-Spa-Belgium-30-Jul-2023.jpg","source_id":"irishmirror","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sanath Jayasuriya Disappointed By Poor Wickets: सनथ जयसूर्या ने प्रेमदासा स्टेडियम में खराब विकेट पर जताया निराशा, कहा- क्वालीफायर में बेहतर क्रिकेटिंग पिच होने की उम्मीद","link":"https://hindi.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/sanath-jayasuriya-expressed-disappointment-over-the-poor-wicket-at-premadasa-stadium-said-hope-for-a-better-cricketing-pitch-in-the-qualifiers-1897443.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"सनथ जयसूर्या ने एलपीएल के प्रेमदासा स्टेडियम में खराब विकेट से निराशा जताया है. उन्होंने ने सोशल मीडिया पर इसका जिक्र करते हुए बताया कि हम ऐसी पिचें चाहते हैं जो सकारात्मक, आक्रामक खेल को बढ़ावा दे और प्रशंसकों को रोमांचित कर दे","content":"Sanath Jayasuriya Disappointed By Poor Wickets: सनथ जयसूर्या ने एलपीएल के प्रेमदासा स्टेडियम में खराब विकेट से निराशा जताया है. उन्होंने ने सोशल मीडिया पर इसका जिक्र करते हुए बताया कि हम ऐसी पिचें चाहते हैं जो सकारात्मक, आक्रामक खेल को बढ़ावा दे और प्रशंसकों को रोमांचित कर दे. लेकिन वैसा नहीं हो पाया है. उन्होंने आगे कहा, आशा है कि आगामी क्वालीफायर में बेहतर क्रिकेटिंग विकेट होंगे. ताकि दर्शक मैच का पूरा लुफ्त उठा सके और बेहतर मैच खेला जा सके. ट्वीट देखें: Disappointed by poor wickets at Premadasa stadium for LPL.

Moseki said at the announcement of the International Cricket Council’s future tours programme last year that South Africa’s reduced Test schedule was necessary in order to accommodate the SA20 in a prime part of the season. But Moletsi said he was confident that South Africa would send a competitive team to New Zealand. “I have faith in our pipeline,” he said. Elgar bemoaned the situation in a newspaper interview last month. “It’s tough to take,” he said. “It shows what the narrative is when it comes to Test cricket and again it’s the players who suffer. A high percentage of the players still really want to play Test cricket.”","pubDate":"2023-08-15 18:16:44","image_url":"https://i.samaaenglish.tv/large/2023/08/15231613f1fb598.webp?r=231644","source_id":"samaaenglish","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"\"कोहली का ध्यान रिकॉर्ड तोड़ने पर...\" पूर्व भारतीय बल्लेबाज़ ने विराट को लेकर एशिया कप से पहले दिया बड़ा ब्यान","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/hindi/cricket/kohlis-focus-is-on-breaking-records-former-indian-batsman-gave-a-big-statement-about-virat-before-asia-cup-4301091#publisher=newsstand","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"आगामी एशिया कप और वनडे विश्व कप का समय नज़दीक आता जा रहा है और ये दो मेगा इवेंट इसलिए भी ख़ास हैं क्योंकि भारतीय फैंस स्टार बल्लेबाज़ विराट कोहली को धमाकेदार पारियां खेलते और महान सचिन तेंदुलकर के रिकॉर्ड के करीब पहुंचते देखने के लिए उत्सुक होंगे.","content":"पूर्व भारतीय बल्लेबाज़ ने विराट को लेकर एशिया कप से पहले दिया बड़ा ब्यान आगामी एशिया कप और वनडे विश्व कप का समय नज़दीक आता जा रहा है और फैंस का उत्साह भी दिन-ब-दिन बढ़ता ही जा रहा है. विश्व कप में अपने एक दशक पुराने ICC ट्रॉफी के सूखे को ख़त्म करने के इरादे से टीम इंडिया मैदान पर उतरेगी और फिलहाल अपनी तैयारियों में कोई कसर नहीं छोड़ रही है. ये दो मेगा इवेंट इसलिए भी ख़ास हैं क्योंकि भारतीय फैंस स्टार बल्लेबाज़ विराट कोहली को धमाकेदार पारियां खेलते और महान सचिन तेंदुलकर के रिकॉर्ड के करीब पहुंचते देखने के लिए उत्सुक होंगे. पूर्व भारतीय कप्तान ने अपनी कमज़ोर स्थिति से जूझते हुए एशिया कप 2022 में फॉर्म में वापसी की थी और तब से पीछे मुड़कर नहीं देखा. विराट ने 50 ओवर के प्रारूप में भी अपनी बल्लेबाज़ी का जलवा दिखाया और इस साल दो शतक लगाए और कुल 46 वनडे शतक दर्ज किए. कोहली को आक्रामक रूप में देखकर, कई फैंस और क्रिकेट विशेषज्ञों ने व्यक्त किया है कि विराट के सचिन के 49 एकदिवसीय शतकों के रिकॉर्ड को पार करने की बहुत अधिक संभावना है. हालाँकि, भारत के पूर्व बल्लेबाज़ रॉबिन उथप्पा ने कहा कि कोहली किसी भी रिकॉर्ड को तोड़ने के बजाय आगामी बड़े टूर्नामेंट्स में केवल मैच जीतने पर ध्यान केंद्रित करेंगे. उन्होंने कहा कि \"विराट को अब रिकॉर्ड तोड़ने की कोई परवाह नहीं है. हम लोग और उनके फैंस इसके प्रति जुनूनी हैं. वे उन शतकों के बावजूद भारत के लिए मैच जीतना ज्यादा पसंद करेंगे. विराट का ध्यान एशिया कप और विश्व कप में भारत के लिए मैच जीतने पर होगा., \"उन्हें वास्तव में रिकॉर्ड्स की परवाह नहीं है.उथप्पा ने टाइम्स ऑफ इंडिया के साथ बातचीत के दौरान ये बातें कही.\" \"चाहे वह (विराट) एशिया कप, विश्व कप या अपने करियर के किसी भी समय उस मील के पत्थर (सचिन के वनडे शतकों के रिकॉर्ड को तोड़ना) को हासिल कर ले, इससे कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता क्योंकि उसका एकमात्र ध्यान भारत के लिए मैच जीतने पर है।\" उथप्पा ने कहा, \"उनके शतक नहीं.\" हाल ही में, कोहली ने वेस्टइंडीज के खिलाफ टेस्ट श्रृंखला में भाग लिया जहां उन्होंने एक शतक लगाया और दो मैचों में कुल 197 रन बनाए. बाद में, उन्होंने विंडीज़ के खिलाफ तीन मैचों की एकदिवसीय श्रृंखला में एक मैच खेला और बाकी दो मैचों में उन्हें आराम दिया गया क्योंकि टीम इंडिया नए प्लेयर्स को आज़माना चाहती थी. आगामी टूर्नामेंट्स की बात करें तो एशिया कप 2023 30 अगस्त को शुरू होगा और इसकी सह-मेजबानी पाकिस्तान और श्रीलंका करेंगे. वहीं वनडे वर्ल्ड कप 2023 की शुरुआत 5 अक्टूबर को अहमदाबाद में होगी. पढ़ें ,राजनीति,खेल समाचार, और की ताजा समाचार अब हिंदी में ( ) लाइव खबर देखें: फॉलो करे:","pubDate":"2023-08-15 18:09:53","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-08/u8c6se38_virat-kohli_625x300_15_August_23.jpg","source_id":"ndtv_in","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Australia shakes up World Cup lineup by dropping stalwart Marnus Labuschagne","link":"https://torontosun.com/sports/other-sports/australia-shakes-up-world-cup-lineup-dropping-labuschagne","keywords":["Other Sports","Sports"],"creator":["Norm Da Costa"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Australia is making sweeping changes as it prepares to land its sixth World Cup in India in October. The Aussies have been odds-on favourite to take the trophy ever since the tournament started in 1975 and this year is no exception. It has won the trophy on more occasions than any other nation with the next best being the West Indies and India at two each, while Sri Lanka, Pakistan and England have won it once. In a major surprise, Australia’s top batsman, Marnus Labuschagne, will be on the other side of the ropes looking in and many are still shaking their heads in disbelief. Also, a new skipper may be asked to fill in as Pat Cummins has been nursing a broken wrist he sustained on the first day of the fourth Ashes Test — but that didn’t stop him from playing the entire match. Cummins will sit out the matches leading up to the World Cup and the selectors are confident Cummins will be back to lead the Baggy Greens in their bid to take the trophy home. Labuschagne, a run-scoring machine for the Aussies since he made his debut in 2020, has struggled in the 50-over format of late and team management felt it necessary to leave him out. The selectors issued a statement that Labuschagne was dispensable because of the similarity of roles between him and fellow batsman Steve Smith and it would be difficult to field both on the same ODI team. Surprise? How come they had no issues in fielding Labuschagne and Smith on the same team all these years? The other head-turner was the decision to install Mitchell Marsh as captain of the T20 squad to tour South Africa. It’s almost a given now that, if Cummins doesn’t recover in time, Marsh will take over the reins in for the World Cup. The 31-year-old right-handed batsman has impressed in all three formats and he has leadership experience as he led Perth Scorchers and Western Australia. He is an excellent all-rounder capable of handling pressure situations and has already made his mark with bat and ball in the Indian Premier League and the Big Bash League. The touring Aussies take on South Africa in three T20s followed by five ODIs before facing India in a further three ODIs just prior to the World Cup. Among the new faces catapulted into the squad for the safari to South Africa and the World Cup include all-rounder Aaron Hardie, leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha, top-order bat Matt Short and left-arm seamer Spencer Johnson. The squad also includes front-line seam-bowling all-rounders Cameron Green, Marcus Stoinis and Sean Abbott. Meanwhile, defending World Cup champion England are ever so close to convincing Test skipper Ben Stokes from making a U-turn and play in the World Cup. Stokes was man of the match when England won the final in 2019, but retired from ODIs last summer. The England selectors are meeting on Wednesday to select the World Cup squad. India ended its tour of the West Indies on a losing note and that has to raised some questions as it gets ready to host the World Cup. The home squad cruised to an eight-wicket victory to win the T20 series 3-2 in Lauderdale, Fla. Brandon King’s majestic unbeaten 85 and another gem from Nicholas Pooran (47) saw the home team chase 166 with ease with two overs to spare. The victory was a morale-booster for the West Indies as it is the first time it will not line up with the elite teams of the game. For India, Suryakumar Yadav struck 61 and medium-pacer Romario Shepherd took four for 31 in his four overs. West Indies had led the series 2-0 before India fought back to set up Sunday’s clincher. India’s coach Rahul Dravid was disappointed with the result and added the squad has to improve its batting depth, but he was hopeful the ODI team would fare better in the World Cup. “Our one-day team is really different to the squad that we had here,” Dravid said. “But yeah, it didn’t allow us the flexibility to change the combinations a little bit. “But going forward, we’ve got to look at certain areas in which we can get better. Finding depth in our batting has been an area we’re trying to address,” he added. India has hit a brick wall in its quest for glory despite producing some of the world’s greatest players, thanks to the lucrative Indian Premier League. India’s most recent victory of any significance was the World Cup on home soil in 2011. Since then, it has come up empty-handed each time in any of the major competitions run by the International Cricket Council. Dravid, one of the country’s greatest batsmen, and new skipper Rohit Sharma have failed to live up to their reputations and one can expect the axe to come down if they fail to land the World Cup on home soil.

Verstappen holds a 125-point lead in the overall standings in 2023, as he chases a third straight drivers' title. The Dutchman has won 10 of this season's 12 races, finishing second behind his Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez on the other two occasions. The Sprint format was introduced in 2021, and takes place at only a handful of stops. Verstappen has dominated there as well, winning five out of the nine Sprints so far, but has hit out at the repeated changes to the calendar. Verstappen has even suggested he could be encouraged to quit Formula 1 if more and more tweaks are made. However, Croft, who covered Formula 1 for the BBC before moving over to Sky, has proposed a solution. \"I think the Sprint concept is good, I like it, but I don't like it being part of the world championship,\" Croft told the Sky Sports F1 podcast . \"I'd like two separate world championships, like cricket has T20, ODIs and Test match, and we'll keep them separate. \"Have your Sprint day on a Friday maybe, rather than the Saturday. You could go into Sprint qualifying and then the Sprint, with maybe a 20-minute warm up in the morning - that's your Friday. \"And then the cars are not in parc ferme for the rest of the weekend, because you then have your practice session on the Saturday morning, Saturday qualifying and then the race on Sunday. So you're keeping the two very separate for different world championships.\" Do you support Croft's idea? Have your say in the comments section Speaking after the most recent Sprint session in Belgium in July, Verstappen said : \"I think luckily it wasn't too bad, but honestly with these kind of Sprint formats, when you have an FP1 like that… But even when it's fully dry it's still a bit hit-and-miss. \"That always makes it very chaotic, that's why I never really enjoy these kind of weekends because you don't have the time and once you do a mistake you're stuck with it for the rest of the weekend and I don't think it should be like that. \"For sure, you can do better things with the format, but I guess they implemented that for this particular reason, that there is a bit more chaos and people not getting it right. But I don't think, with how advanced everything is in this sport, that it should be like that, that on a Friday if you arrive with the wrong set-up or you make the wrong call after FP1 then you're stuck with it for the rest of the weekend.\" He had previously questioned the changes in April, hinting at an eventual exit from the sport despite his dominance. \"If we keep expanding the calendar and the whole weekend is that long, at one point you question yourself 'is it worth it?',\" he said. \"I do like racing, I do like winning. I know that of course the salary and everything, you have a good life, but is it actually a good life? I think sometimes you get to a point in your career where maybe you want to do other stuff. Croft, however, had a ready-made solution to the prospect of teams being unhappy with the format. Within his hypothetical scenario, he suggested teams would have the option of handing the reins to reserve drivers or even sitting out the 'second' championship altogether. \"If the teams and all the drivers don't want to run in the Sprint world championships, fine, there's enough reserve drivers that do,\" he said. \"Maybe that's a good way of getting the reserve drivers involved in that. So commercially, that's kind of what I'd look at.\"","pubDate":"2023-08-15 19:46:04","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30711999.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_F1-Belgian-Grand-Prix-2023-Spa-Belgium-30-Jul-2023.jpg","source_id":"irishmirror","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sanath Jayasuriya Disappointed By Poor Wickets: सनथ जयसूर्या ने प्रेमदासा स्टेडियम में खराब विकेट पर जताया निराशा, कहा- क्वालीफायर में बेहतर क्रिकेटिंग पिच होने की उम्मीद","link":"https://hindi.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/sanath-jayasuriya-expressed-disappointment-over-the-poor-wicket-at-premadasa-stadium-said-hope-for-a-better-cricketing-pitch-in-the-qualifiers-1897443.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"सनथ जयसूर्या ने एलपीएल के प्रेमदासा स्टेडियम में खराब विकेट से निराशा जताया है. उन्होंने ने सोशल मीडिया पर इसका जिक्र करते हुए बताया कि हम ऐसी पिचें चाहते हैं जो सकारात्मक, आक्रामक खेल को बढ़ावा दे और प्रशंसकों को रोमांचित कर दे","content":"Sanath Jayasuriya Disappointed By Poor Wickets: सनथ जयसूर्या ने एलपीएल के प्रेमदासा स्टेडियम में खराब विकेट से निराशा जताया है. उन्होंने ने सोशल मीडिया पर इसका जिक्र करते हुए बताया कि हम ऐसी पिचें चाहते हैं जो सकारात्मक, आक्रामक खेल को बढ़ावा दे और प्रशंसकों को रोमांचित कर दे. लेकिन वैसा नहीं हो पाया है. उन्होंने आगे कहा, आशा है कि आगामी क्वालीफायर में बेहतर क्रिकेटिंग विकेट होंगे. ताकि दर्शक मैच का पूरा लुफ्त उठा सके और बेहतर मैच खेला जा सके. ट्वीट देखें: Disappointed by poor wickets at Premadasa stadium for LPL.

The Aussies have been odds-on favourite to take the trophy ever since the tournament started in 1975 and this year is no exception. It has won the trophy on more occasions than any other nation with the next best being the West Indies and India at two each, while Sri Lanka, Pakistan and England have won it once. In a major surprise, Australia’s top batsman, Marnus Labuschagne, will be on the other side of the ropes looking in and many are still shaking their heads in disbelief. Also, a new skipper may be asked to fill in as Pat Cummins has been nursing a broken wrist he sustained on the first day of the fourth Ashes Test — but that didn’t stop him from playing the entire match. Cummins will sit out the matches leading up to the World Cup and the selectors are confident Cummins will be back to lead the Baggy Greens in their bid to take the trophy home. Labuschagne, a run-scoring machine for the Aussies since he made his debut in 2020, has struggled in the 50-over format of late and team management felt it necessary to leave him out. The selectors issued a statement that Labuschagne was dispensable because of the similarity of roles between him and fellow batsman Steve Smith and it would be difficult to field both on the same ODI team. Surprise? How come they had no issues in fielding Labuschagne and Smith on the same team all these years? The other head-turner was the decision to install Mitchell Marsh as captain of the T20 squad to tour South Africa. It’s almost a given now that, if Cummins doesn’t recover in time, Marsh will take over the reins in for the World Cup. The 31-year-old right-handed batsman has impressed in all three formats and he has leadership experience as he led Perth Scorchers and Western Australia. He is an excellent all-rounder capable of handling pressure situations and has already made his mark with bat and ball in the Indian Premier League and the Big Bash League. The touring Aussies take on South Africa in three T20s followed by five ODIs before facing India in a further three ODIs just prior to the World Cup. Among the new faces catapulted into the squad for the safari to South Africa and the World Cup include all-rounder Aaron Hardie, leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha, top-order bat Matt Short and left-arm seamer Spencer Johnson. The squad also includes front-line seam-bowling all-rounders Cameron Green, Marcus Stoinis and Sean Abbott. Meanwhile, defending World Cup champion England are ever so close to convincing Test skipper Ben Stokes from making a U-turn and play in the World Cup. Stokes was man of the match when England won the final in 2019, but retired from ODIs last summer. The England selectors are meeting on Wednesday to select the World Cup squad. India ended its tour of the West Indies on a losing note and that has to raised some questions as it gets ready to host the World Cup. The home squad cruised to an eight-wicket victory to win the T20 series 3-2 in Lauderdale, Fla. Brandon King’s majestic unbeaten 85 and another gem from Nicholas Pooran (47) saw the home team chase 166 with ease with two overs to spare. The victory was a morale-booster for the West Indies as it is the first time it will not line up with the elite teams of the game. For India, Suryakumar Yadav struck 61 and medium-pacer Romario Shepherd took four for 31 in his four overs. West Indies had led the series 2-0 before India fought back to set up Sunday’s clincher. India’s coach Rahul Dravid was disappointed with the result and added the squad has to improve its batting depth, but he was hopeful the ODI team would fare better in the World Cup. “Our one-day team is really different to the squad that we had here,” Dravid said. “But yeah, it didn’t allow us the flexibility to change the combinations a little bit. “But going forward, we’ve got to look at certain areas in which we can get better. Finding depth in our batting has been an area we’re trying to address,” he added. India has hit a brick wall in its quest for glory despite producing some of the world’s greatest players, thanks to the lucrative Indian Premier League. India’s most recent victory of any significance was the World Cup on home soil in 2011. Since then, it has come up empty-handed each time in any of the major competitions run by the International Cricket Council. Dravid, one of the country’s greatest batsmen, and new skipper Rohit Sharma have failed to live up to their reputations and one can expect the axe to come down if they fail to land the World Cup on home soil.

The PM made today’s Women’s World Cup semi-final a matter of ­national pride. Mr Sunak wants the football team — led by captain Millie Bright , to go one better than England’s male cricketers — who recently drew their Ashes series with Australia. He told The Sun: “It’s been an amazing summer of sport for our country and having fought back from the brink to draw the Ashes, it’s time to ­finish the job. The nation’s hopes of beating the Aussies now rest on our Lionesses. “They’re just one win away from creating history by reaching their first World Cup final. They’ll take the fight to them in their backyard and we’ll all be roaring them on back home.” Fierce sporting rivalry between the two countries boiled over in July during the bitter Second Ashes Test at Lord’s. Aussie Alex Carey controversially stumped Jonny Bairstow — effectively wrecking England hopes of winning the match. It led to chants of “Same old Aussies, alway cheating”. Today coach Sarina Weigman’s Lionesses face tournament hosts Australia — known as The Matildas — in Sydney at 11am UK time. Millions across the globe are expected to tune in to watch the crunch match on BBC1 at 11am. Last night Three Lions legend David Beckham sent a “good luck” message to the team and revealed the Lionesses are inspiring his 12-year-old daughter Harper. The ex-England skipper, 58, said in a video: “Hey girls, I just wanted to say, wow, what a tournament it’s been so far. “It’s been so much fun to watch and we’re all so proud, as a nation, of what you’ve achieved already. But seeing you girls play as a team, it’s been really incredible. So continue to do so. “Good luck in this next game and just know that our whole nation is behind you as always.” The video, posted on England’s official social media, then panned to Harper, who waved and said: “Good luck, Lionesses.” David added: “And there’s Harper. Keep inspiring these girls because it’s incredible to watch and I’m very, very happy you’re doing it for this one.” Meanwhile bosses were warned that England fans should be allowed to work from home today or they will call in sick.

Verstappen holds a 125-point lead in the overall standings in 2023, as he chases a third straight drivers' title. The Dutchman has won 10 of this season's 12 races, finishing second behind his Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez on the other two occasions. The Sprint format was introduced in 2021, and takes place at only a handful of stops. Verstappen has dominated there as well, winning five out of the nine Sprints so far, but has hit out at the repeated changes to the calendar. Verstappen has even suggested he could be encouraged to quit Formula 1 if more and more tweaks are made. However, Croft, who covered Formula 1 for the BBC before moving over to Sky, has proposed a solution. \"I think the Sprint concept is good, I like it, but I don't like it being part of the world championship,\" Croft told the Sky Sports F1 podcast . \"I'd like two separate world championships, like cricket has T20, ODIs and Test match, and we'll keep them separate. \"Have your Sprint day on a Friday maybe, rather than the Saturday. You could go into Sprint qualifying and then the Sprint, with maybe a 20-minute warm up in the morning - that's your Friday. \"And then the cars are not in parc ferme for the rest of the weekend, because you then have your practice session on the Saturday morning, Saturday qualifying and then the race on Sunday. So you're keeping the two very separate for different world championships.\" Do you support Croft's idea? Have your say in the comments section Speaking after the most recent Sprint session in Belgium in July, Verstappen said : \"I think luckily it wasn't too bad, but honestly with these kind of Sprint formats, when you have an FP1 like that… But even when it's fully dry it's still a bit hit-and-miss. \"That always makes it very chaotic, that's why I never really enjoy these kind of weekends because you don't have the time and once you do a mistake you're stuck with it for the rest of the weekend and I don't think it should be like that. \"For sure, you can do better things with the format, but I guess they implemented that for this particular reason, that there is a bit more chaos and people not getting it right. But I don't think, with how advanced everything is in this sport, that it should be like that, that on a Friday if you arrive with the wrong set-up or you make the wrong call after FP1 then you're stuck with it for the rest of the weekend.\" He had previously questioned the changes in April, hinting at an eventual exit from the sport despite his dominance. \"If we keep expanding the calendar and the whole weekend is that long, at one point you question yourself 'is it worth it?',\" he said. \"I do like racing, I do like winning. I know that of course the salary and everything, you have a good life, but is it actually a good life? I think sometimes you get to a point in your career where maybe you want to do other stuff. Croft, however, had a ready-made solution to the prospect of teams being unhappy with the format. Within his hypothetical scenario, he suggested teams would have the option of handing the reins to reserve drivers or even sitting out the 'second' championship altogether. \"If the teams and all the drivers don't want to run in the Sprint world championships, fine, there's enough reserve drivers that do,\" he said. \"Maybe that's a good way of getting the reserve drivers involved in that. So commercially, that's kind of what I'd look at.\"","pubDate":"2023-08-15 19:46:04","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30711999.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_F1-Belgian-Grand-Prix-2023-Spa-Belgium-30-Jul-2023.jpg","source_id":"irishmirror","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sanath Jayasuriya Disappointed By Poor Wickets: सनथ जयसूर्या ने प्रेमदासा स्टेडियम में खराब विकेट पर जताया निराशा, कहा- क्वालीफायर में बेहतर क्रिकेटिंग पिच होने की उम्मीद","link":"https://hindi.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/sanath-jayasuriya-expressed-disappointment-over-the-poor-wicket-at-premadasa-stadium-said-hope-for-a-better-cricketing-pitch-in-the-qualifiers-1897443.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"सनथ जयसूर्या ने एलपीएल के प्रेमदासा स्टेडियम में खराब विकेट से निराशा जताया है. उन्होंने ने सोशल मीडिया पर इसका जिक्र करते हुए बताया कि हम ऐसी पिचें चाहते हैं जो सकारात्मक, आक्रामक खेल को बढ़ावा दे और प्रशंसकों को रोमांचित कर दे","content":"Sanath Jayasuriya Disappointed By Poor Wickets: सनथ जयसूर्या ने एलपीएल के प्रेमदासा स्टेडियम में खराब विकेट से निराशा जताया है. उन्होंने ने सोशल मीडिया पर इसका जिक्र करते हुए बताया कि हम ऐसी पिचें चाहते हैं जो सकारात्मक, आक्रामक खेल को बढ़ावा दे और प्रशंसकों को रोमांचित कर दे. लेकिन वैसा नहीं हो पाया है. उन्होंने आगे कहा, आशा है कि आगामी क्वालीफायर में बेहतर क्रिकेटिंग विकेट होंगे. ताकि दर्शक मैच का पूरा लुफ्त उठा सके और बेहतर मैच खेला जा सके. ट्वीट देखें: Disappointed by poor wickets at Premadasa stadium for LPL.

The Aussies have been odds-on favourite to take the trophy ever since the tournament started in 1975 and this year is no exception. It has won the trophy on more occasions than any other nation with the next best being the West Indies and India at two each, while Sri Lanka, Pakistan and England have won it once. In a major surprise, Australia’s top batsman, Marnus Labuschagne, will be on the other side of the ropes looking in and many are still shaking their heads in disbelief. Also, a new skipper may be asked to fill in as Pat Cummins has been nursing a broken wrist he sustained on the first day of the fourth Ashes Test — but that didn’t stop him from playing the entire match. Cummins will sit out the matches leading up to the World Cup and the selectors are confident Cummins will be back to lead the Baggy Greens in their bid to take the trophy home. Labuschagne, a run-scoring machine for the Aussies since he made his debut in 2020, has struggled in the 50-over format of late and team management felt it necessary to leave him out. The selectors issued a statement that Labuschagne was dispensable because of the similarity of roles between him and fellow batsman Steve Smith and it would be difficult to field both on the same ODI team. Surprise? How come they had no issues in fielding Labuschagne and Smith on the same team all these years? The other head-turner was the decision to install Mitchell Marsh as captain of the T20 squad to tour South Africa. It’s almost a given now that, if Cummins doesn’t recover in time, Marsh will take over the reins in for the World Cup. The 31-year-old right-handed batsman has impressed in all three formats and he has leadership experience as he led Perth Scorchers and Western Australia. He is an excellent all-rounder capable of handling pressure situations and has already made his mark with bat and ball in the Indian Premier League and the Big Bash League. The touring Aussies take on South Africa in three T20s followed by five ODIs before facing India in a further three ODIs just prior to the World Cup. Among the new faces catapulted into the squad for the safari to South Africa and the World Cup include all-rounder Aaron Hardie, leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha, top-order bat Matt Short and left-arm seamer Spencer Johnson. The squad also includes front-line seam-bowling all-rounders Cameron Green, Marcus Stoinis and Sean Abbott. Meanwhile, defending World Cup champion England are ever so close to convincing Test skipper Ben Stokes from making a U-turn and play in the World Cup. Stokes was man of the match when England won the final in 2019, but retired from ODIs last summer. The England selectors are meeting on Wednesday to select the World Cup squad. India ended its tour of the West Indies on a losing note and that has to raised some questions as it gets ready to host the World Cup. The home squad cruised to an eight-wicket victory to win the T20 series 3-2 in Lauderdale, Fla. Brandon King’s majestic unbeaten 85 and another gem from Nicholas Pooran (47) saw the home team chase 166 with ease with two overs to spare. The victory was a morale-booster for the West Indies as it is the first time it will not line up with the elite teams of the game. For India, Suryakumar Yadav struck 61 and medium-pacer Romario Shepherd took four for 31 in his four overs. West Indies had led the series 2-0 before India fought back to set up Sunday’s clincher. India’s coach Rahul Dravid was disappointed with the result and added the squad has to improve its batting depth, but he was hopeful the ODI team would fare better in the World Cup. “Our one-day team is really different to the squad that we had here,” Dravid said. “But yeah, it didn’t allow us the flexibility to change the combinations a little bit. “But going forward, we’ve got to look at certain areas in which we can get better. Finding depth in our batting has been an area we’re trying to address,” he added. India has hit a brick wall in its quest for glory despite producing some of the world’s greatest players, thanks to the lucrative Indian Premier League. India’s most recent victory of any significance was the World Cup on home soil in 2011. Since then, it has come up empty-handed each time in any of the major competitions run by the International Cricket Council. Dravid, one of the country’s greatest batsmen, and new skipper Rohit Sharma have failed to live up to their reputations and one can expect the axe to come down if they fail to land the World Cup on home soil.
