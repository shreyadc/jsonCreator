Dovranno però superare lo scoglio del Congresso del Cio, che inizia domenica","content":"141esima sessione del Cio, il Comitato olimpico internazionale. Come a ogni nuova edizione dei Giochi olimpici, il comitato organizzatore della città ospitante ha la possibilità di suggerire delle aggiunte ai 28 sport presenti nel programma standard, con discipline più vicine agli interessi dei propri connazionali o che possono attrarre l'attenzione delle nuove generazioni: così hanno fatto i promotori dell'edizione di Los Angeles, e forse in pochi sanno che dei cinque sport che chiedono di entrare a far parte del cartellone il cricket è secondo soltanto al calcio quanto a popolarità globale ben 2,5 miliardi di appassionati, un miliardo dei quali nella sola India, ciò che gli conferisce un enorme forza pensando che la votazione si terrà proprio a Mumbai. Riuscisse a ottenere i voti necessari, il ritorno del cricket alle Olimpiadi colmerebbe una lacuna che dura da oltre un secolo, visto che la sua unica presenza ai Giochi risale addirittura all'edizione 1900 a Parigi. Tuttavia, la durata delle partite del cricket mal si adatta ai tempi della programmazione olimpica, e così sarebbe disputato nel formato accelerato, il cosiddetto Twenty20. Le altre new-entry proposte guardano invece decisamente al mondo sportivo nordamericano. Il baseball (il softball nella versione al femminile) è una religione negli Stati Uniti – oltre che in Giappone, dove peraltro è stato protagonista ai Tokyo 2021, ma non lo sarà più a Parigi –, lo squash è un simbolo della cosiddetta ‘american way of life’, mentre lacrosse e flag football sono ampiamente praticati soprattutto nelle scuole. Il lacrosse, tra l'altro, ha dei precedenti olimpici risalenti agli inizi del secolo scorso (1904 e nel 1908) ed è stato presente come sport dimostrativo nelle edizioni del 1928, 1932 e 1948. Un possibile fattore negativo potrebbe essere proprio la sua connotazione molto nordamericana e scolastica, e inoltre richiede un'attrezzatura piuttosto costosa che ne frena la diffusione nei Paesi meno ricchi. Anche la candidatura dello squash non è esente da pecche, la principale delle quali è la quasi assenza di test sulla capacità di attrarre pubblico televisivo e oltretutto nella fattispeciea si tratterebbe di un debutto olimpico assoluto, al pari del flag football, una versione ridotta e senza contatto fisico del football americano, che ha molto successo tra le donne ma rischia di avere a sua volta scarso appeal negli altri continenti.","pubDate":"2023-10-10 21:46:48","image_url":"https://media.laregione.ch/files/domains/laregione.ch/images/4c3q/1csm2.jpg?v=2","source_id":"laregione","source_priority":4191229,"country":["switzerland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"italian"},{"article_id":"1e011d97aa6469132886513ca5a44b99","title":"Dawid Malan thrilled to ‘keep silencing people’ with World Cup hundred","link":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/sport/national/23846966.dawid-malan-thrilled-keep-silencing-people-world-cup-hundred/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The England opener’s 140 set up a 137-run win over Bangladesh.","content":"Now 36, Malan has had to scrap hard for every opportunity he has had in international cricket and only inked his name into the World Cup side a matter of days before jetting out to India.

A false start in the tournament curtain-raiser against New Zealand put the pressure on England as defending champions, but for someone who has felt his credentials being placed under the microscope regularly Malan was well placed to stand up and be counted in Dharamshala. He put on 115 with Jonny Bairstow (52) and 151 with Joe Root (82) on his way to 140 from 107 deliveries, three more than the final winning margin as the Tigers failed to live with a target of 365.

If I can score as many runs as I can and help contribute to wins hopefully eventually people’s opinions might change. “To be able to score a hundred and say that I’ve been able to score a hundred in a World Cup game for England is fantastic.” Malan is, in many ways, an unlikely magnet for critics given his outstanding 50-over record. He boasts an average of 63.15 and a strike rate of 98.44, with exactly 1,200 runs on the board, but he is all too aware of those who remain sceptical about his ability to accelerate. “There’s been a lot of strange narratives around over the last couple of years,” he said. “But the majority of my cricket for England has been T20 cricket and I’ve always said, I can play it like a T20 game if you want me to.

The thrashing at the hands of New Zealand in the opener in Ahmedabad at the 132,000-seat Narendra Modi Stadium before a small crowd rattled the English. But on Tuesday, the scenery and playing in one of the world’s most scenic grounds in Dharamsala saw England on top of the world. Perched 1,500 metres above sea level with the Himalayan mountains providing a breathtaking backdrop, England rolled over Bangladesh by 137 runs thanks to a tremendous knock by Dawid Malan, who tore the Bangladesh attack to pieces with 140 (five sixes and 16 boundaries). He received solid support from his opening partner Jonny Bairstow (52) and Joe Root (82) as England finished on 364 for nine. It was then the turn of Reece Topley and the lightning pace of Mark Wood to subdue the opponents for 227. Topley finished with four for 43 and Bangladesh’s top scorer was wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim with a fluent 52. England now finds itself with a positive run rate despite that heavy loss to New Zealand and it could prove crucial later in the tournament. England will be hoping for a return to Dharamsala, the city that is home to the Dalai Lama, for more fixtures. The majority of people travelling to this city are non-cricket fans who are seeking to climb a mountain and England has just done that by conquering this peak in style. Pakistan pulled off its second straight victory, this time over a tough Sri Lanka squad that suffered its second straight defeat after that mauling by South Africa in the opener. Pakistan was set a whopping 345 for victory — the highest run chase ever in a World Cup — and did it with the loss of four wickets and 10 balls to spare. The highlight of Pakistan’s innings was Mohammad Rizwan’s unbeaten 131 (eight fours and three sixes) and opener Abdullah Shaffique’s 113. Sri Lanka also had two centurions, Kusal Mendis (122) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (108), in a losing cause. Playing in Hyderabad, Pakistan has received a warm welcome despite the tense political relations with India that has seen the two countries go to war on three occasions since independence in 1947. The two countries will meet in Ahmedabad on Saturday and this time a full house is expected, but you never know since the Indian authorities — with all the experience of staging the Indian Premier League — have made a gigantic mess of releasing tickets. The turn out for the England-New Zealand game was described by commentators as “embarrassing” and “pathetic.” Some are simply fed up and decided to watch it on TV. While there has been exciting cricket played, it is South Africa that has stirred the imagination of fans with their bats. By beating former World Cup champion Sri Lanka by a whopping 102 runs, the Proteas made a gigantic effort to get rid of that dreaded monkey off their backs and the ridicule it suffered along the way as “choke artists.” If the Proteas continue in the same vein, skipper Temba Bavuma could be parading that elusive trophy in Cape Town. South Africa racked up 428 for five, the highest score ever at a World Cup and, for the first time in a World Cup, there were three centurions. Aiden Markram smashed his way into the record book with a 49-ball century, the fastest in a World Cup, and there was more brutal batting from Quinton de Kock, who struck 100, and Rassie van der Dussen’s 108. Markram was named man of the match for his 106 off 54 balls and erasing the fastest-century record held by Ireland’s Kevin O’Brien, who a 50-ball century against England in 2011. Sri Lanka was all out for 326 in 44.5 overs with Kusal Mendis (76), Charith Asalanka (79) and Dasun Shanaka (68) leading the way. Meanwhile, New Zealand also upped its record to 2-0 after thumping the Netherlands by 99 runs. Mitchell Santner became the first Kiwi to take a five-wicket haul and also hammered a quickfire 36 off 17 balls. The Dutch managed 223 after New Zealand piled on 322 for seven with Tom Latham (53) and Rachin Ravindra, who made an unbeaten century against England, hitting 51. In a battle of heavyweights, India secured a six-wicket win over Australia in steamy Chennai despite losing three of its top-order batsmen for two runs before KL Rahul and Virat Kohli came to the rescue. Chasing a below-par 199, Kohli made 85 off 116 balls and Rahul slammed an unbeaten 99 as India reached 201 for four with 52 balls to spare in front of a passionate crowd. While the Aussie pacers had India on the ropes early, it was India’s spinners who did the damage with Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav sharing five wickets to wreck the Aussies.

Dovranno però superare lo scoglio del Congresso del Cio, che inizia domenica","content":"141esima sessione del Cio, il Comitato olimpico internazionale. Come a ogni nuova edizione dei Giochi olimpici, il comitato organizzatore della città ospitante ha la possibilità di suggerire delle aggiunte ai 28 sport presenti nel programma standard, con discipline più vicine agli interessi dei propri connazionali o che possono attrarre l'attenzione delle nuove generazioni: così hanno fatto i promotori dell'edizione di Los Angeles, e forse in pochi sanno che dei cinque sport che chiedono di entrare a far parte del cartellone il cricket è secondo soltanto al calcio quanto a popolarità globale ben 2,5 miliardi di appassionati, un miliardo dei quali nella sola India, ciò che gli conferisce un enorme forza pensando che la votazione si terrà proprio a Mumbai. Riuscisse a ottenere i voti necessari, il ritorno del cricket alle Olimpiadi colmerebbe una lacuna che dura da oltre un secolo, visto che la sua unica presenza ai Giochi risale addirittura all'edizione 1900 a Parigi. Tuttavia, la durata delle partite del cricket mal si adatta ai tempi della programmazione olimpica, e così sarebbe disputato nel formato accelerato, il cosiddetto Twenty20. Le altre new-entry proposte guardano invece decisamente al mondo sportivo nordamericano. Il baseball (il softball nella versione al femminile) è una religione negli Stati Uniti – oltre che in Giappone, dove peraltro è stato protagonista ai Tokyo 2021, ma non lo sarà più a Parigi –, lo squash è un simbolo della cosiddetta ‘american way of life’, mentre lacrosse e flag football sono ampiamente praticati soprattutto nelle scuole. Il lacrosse, tra l'altro, ha dei precedenti olimpici risalenti agli inizi del secolo scorso (1904 e nel 1908) ed è stato presente come sport dimostrativo nelle edizioni del 1928, 1932 e 1948. Un possibile fattore negativo potrebbe essere proprio la sua connotazione molto nordamericana e scolastica, e inoltre richiede un'attrezzatura piuttosto costosa che ne frena la diffusione nei Paesi meno ricchi. Anche la candidatura dello squash non è esente da pecche, la principale delle quali è la quasi assenza di test sulla capacità di attrarre pubblico televisivo e oltretutto nella fattispeciea si tratterebbe di un debutto olimpico assoluto, al pari del flag football, una versione ridotta e senza contatto fisico del football americano, che ha molto successo tra le donne ma rischia di avere a sua volta scarso appeal negli altri continenti.","pubDate":"2023-10-10 21:46:48","image_url":"https://media.laregione.ch/files/domains/laregione.ch/images/4c3q/1csm2.jpg?v=2","source_id":"laregione","source_priority":4191229,"country":["switzerland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"italian"},{"article_id":"1e011d97aa6469132886513ca5a44b99","title":"Dawid Malan thrilled to ‘keep silencing people’ with World Cup hundred","link":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/sport/national/23846966.dawid-malan-thrilled-keep-silencing-people-world-cup-hundred/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The England opener’s 140 set up a 137-run win over Bangladesh.","content":"Now 36, Malan has had to scrap hard for every opportunity he has had in international cricket and only inked his name into the World Cup side a matter of days before jetting out to India.

The thrashing at the hands of New Zealand in the opener in Ahmedabad at the 132,000-seat Narendra Modi Stadium before a small crowd rattled the English. But on Tuesday, the scenery and playing in one of the world’s most scenic grounds in Dharamsala saw England on top of the world. Perched 1,500 metres above sea level with the Himalayan mountains providing a breathtaking backdrop, England rolled over Bangladesh by 137 runs thanks to a tremendous knock by Dawid Malan, who tore the Bangladesh attack to pieces with 140 (five sixes and 16 boundaries). He received solid support from his opening partner Jonny Bairstow (52) and Joe Root (82) as England finished on 364 for nine. It was then the turn of Reece Topley and the lightning pace of Mark Wood to subdue the opponents for 227. Topley finished with four for 43 and Bangladesh’s top scorer was wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim with a fluent 52. England now finds itself with a positive run rate despite that heavy loss to New Zealand and it could prove crucial later in the tournament. England will be hoping for a return to Dharamsala, the city that is home to the Dalai Lama, for more fixtures. The majority of people travelling to this city are non-cricket fans who are seeking to climb a mountain and England has just done that by conquering this peak in style. Pakistan pulled off its second straight victory, this time over a tough Sri Lanka squad that suffered its second straight defeat after that mauling by South Africa in the opener. Pakistan was set a whopping 345 for victory — the highest run chase ever in a World Cup — and did it with the loss of four wickets and 10 balls to spare. The highlight of Pakistan’s innings was Mohammad Rizwan’s unbeaten 131 (eight fours and three sixes) and opener Abdullah Shaffique’s 113. Sri Lanka also had two centurions, Kusal Mendis (122) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (108), in a losing cause. Playing in Hyderabad, Pakistan has received a warm welcome despite the tense political relations with India that has seen the two countries go to war on three occasions since independence in 1947. The two countries will meet in Ahmedabad on Saturday and this time a full house is expected, but you never know since the Indian authorities — with all the experience of staging the Indian Premier League — have made a gigantic mess of releasing tickets. The turn out for the England-New Zealand game was described by commentators as “embarrassing” and “pathetic.” Some are simply fed up and decided to watch it on TV. While there has been exciting cricket played, it is South Africa that has stirred the imagination of fans with their bats. By beating former World Cup champion Sri Lanka by a whopping 102 runs, the Proteas made a gigantic effort to get rid of that dreaded monkey off their backs and the ridicule it suffered along the way as “choke artists.” If the Proteas continue in the same vein, skipper Temba Bavuma could be parading that elusive trophy in Cape Town. South Africa racked up 428 for five, the highest score ever at a World Cup and, for the first time in a World Cup, there were three centurions. Aiden Markram smashed his way into the record book with a 49-ball century, the fastest in a World Cup, and there was more brutal batting from Quinton de Kock, who struck 100, and Rassie van der Dussen’s 108. Markram was named man of the match for his 106 off 54 balls and erasing the fastest-century record held by Ireland’s Kevin O’Brien, who a 50-ball century against England in 2011. Sri Lanka was all out for 326 in 44.5 overs with Kusal Mendis (76), Charith Asalanka (79) and Dasun Shanaka (68) leading the way. Meanwhile, New Zealand also upped its record to 2-0 after thumping the Netherlands by 99 runs. Mitchell Santner became the first Kiwi to take a five-wicket haul and also hammered a quickfire 36 off 17 balls. The Dutch managed 223 after New Zealand piled on 322 for seven with Tom Latham (53) and Rachin Ravindra, who made an unbeaten century against England, hitting 51. In a battle of heavyweights, India secured a six-wicket win over Australia in steamy Chennai despite losing three of its top-order batsmen for two runs before KL Rahul and Virat Kohli came to the rescue. Chasing a below-par 199, Kohli made 85 off 116 balls and Rahul slammed an unbeaten 99 as India reached 201 for four with 52 balls to spare in front of a passionate crowd. While the Aussie pacers had India on the ropes early, it was India’s spinners who did the damage with Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav sharing five wickets to wreck the Aussies.

Dovranno però superare lo scoglio del Congresso del Cio, che inizia domenica","content":"141esima sessione del Cio, il Comitato olimpico internazionale. Come a ogni nuova edizione dei Giochi olimpici, il comitato organizzatore della città ospitante ha la possibilità di suggerire delle aggiunte ai 28 sport presenti nel programma standard, con discipline più vicine agli interessi dei propri connazionali o che possono attrarre l'attenzione delle nuove generazioni: così hanno fatto i promotori dell'edizione di Los Angeles, e forse in pochi sanno che dei cinque sport che chiedono di entrare a far parte del cartellone il cricket è secondo soltanto al calcio quanto a popolarità globale ben 2,5 miliardi di appassionati, un miliardo dei quali nella sola India, ciò che gli conferisce un enorme forza pensando che la votazione si terrà proprio a Mumbai. Riuscisse a ottenere i voti necessari, il ritorno del cricket alle Olimpiadi colmerebbe una lacuna che dura da oltre un secolo, visto che la sua unica presenza ai Giochi risale addirittura all'edizione 1900 a Parigi. Tuttavia, la durata delle partite del cricket mal si adatta ai tempi della programmazione olimpica, e così sarebbe disputato nel formato accelerato, il cosiddetto Twenty20. Le altre new-entry proposte guardano invece decisamente al mondo sportivo nordamericano. Il baseball (il softball nella versione al femminile) è una religione negli Stati Uniti – oltre che in Giappone, dove peraltro è stato protagonista ai Tokyo 2021, ma non lo sarà più a Parigi –, lo squash è un simbolo della cosiddetta ‘american way of life’, mentre lacrosse e flag football sono ampiamente praticati soprattutto nelle scuole. Il lacrosse, tra l'altro, ha dei precedenti olimpici risalenti agli inizi del secolo scorso (1904 e nel 1908) ed è stato presente come sport dimostrativo nelle edizioni del 1928, 1932 e 1948. Un possibile fattore negativo potrebbe essere proprio la sua connotazione molto nordamericana e scolastica, e inoltre richiede un'attrezzatura piuttosto costosa che ne frena la diffusione nei Paesi meno ricchi. Anche la candidatura dello squash non è esente da pecche, la principale delle quali è la quasi assenza di test sulla capacità di attrarre pubblico televisivo e oltretutto nella fattispeciea si tratterebbe di un debutto olimpico assoluto, al pari del flag football, una versione ridotta e senza contatto fisico del football americano, che ha molto successo tra le donne ma rischia di avere a sua volta scarso appeal negli altri continenti.","pubDate":"2023-10-10 21:46:48","image_url":"https://media.laregione.ch/files/domains/laregione.ch/images/4c3q/1csm2.jpg?v=2","source_id":"laregione","source_priority":4191229,"country":["switzerland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"italian"},{"article_id":"1e011d97aa6469132886513ca5a44b99","title":"Dawid Malan thrilled to ‘keep silencing people’ with World Cup hundred","link":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/sport/national/23846966.dawid-malan-thrilled-keep-silencing-people-world-cup-hundred/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The England opener’s 140 set up a 137-run win over Bangladesh.","content":"Now 36, Malan has had to scrap hard for every opportunity he has had in international cricket and only inked his name into the World Cup side a matter of days before jetting out to India.

The thrashing at the hands of New Zealand in the opener in Ahmedabad at the 132,000-seat Narendra Modi Stadium before a small crowd rattled the English. But on Tuesday, the scenery and playing in one of the world’s most scenic grounds in Dharamsala saw England on top of the world. Perched 1,500 metres above sea level with the Himalayan mountains providing a breathtaking backdrop, England rolled over Bangladesh by 137 runs thanks to a tremendous knock by Dawid Malan, who tore the Bangladesh attack to pieces with 140 (five sixes and 16 boundaries). He received solid support from his opening partner Jonny Bairstow (52) and Joe Root (82) as England finished on 364 for nine. It was then the turn of Reece Topley and the lightning pace of Mark Wood to subdue the opponents for 227. Topley finished with four for 43 and Bangladesh’s top scorer was wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim with a fluent 52. England now finds itself with a positive run rate despite that heavy loss to New Zealand and it could prove crucial later in the tournament. England will be hoping for a return to Dharamsala, the city that is home to the Dalai Lama, for more fixtures. The majority of people travelling to this city are non-cricket fans who are seeking to climb a mountain and England has just done that by conquering this peak in style. Pakistan pulled off its second straight victory, this time over a tough Sri Lanka squad that suffered its second straight defeat after that mauling by South Africa in the opener. Pakistan was set a whopping 345 for victory — the highest run chase ever in a World Cup — and did it with the loss of four wickets and 10 balls to spare. The highlight of Pakistan’s innings was Mohammad Rizwan’s unbeaten 131 (eight fours and three sixes) and opener Abdullah Shaffique’s 113. Sri Lanka also had two centurions, Kusal Mendis (122) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (108), in a losing cause. Playing in Hyderabad, Pakistan has received a warm welcome despite the tense political relations with India that has seen the two countries go to war on three occasions since independence in 1947. The two countries will meet in Ahmedabad on Saturday and this time a full house is expected, but you never know since the Indian authorities — with all the experience of staging the Indian Premier League — have made a gigantic mess of releasing tickets. The turn out for the England-New Zealand game was described by commentators as “embarrassing” and “pathetic.” Some are simply fed up and decided to watch it on TV. While there has been exciting cricket played, it is South Africa that has stirred the imagination of fans with their bats. By beating former World Cup champion Sri Lanka by a whopping 102 runs, the Proteas made a gigantic effort to get rid of that dreaded monkey off their backs and the ridicule it suffered along the way as “choke artists.” If the Proteas continue in the same vein, skipper Temba Bavuma could be parading that elusive trophy in Cape Town. South Africa racked up 428 for five, the highest score ever at a World Cup and, for the first time in a World Cup, there were three centurions. Aiden Markram smashed his way into the record book with a 49-ball century, the fastest in a World Cup, and there was more brutal batting from Quinton de Kock, who struck 100, and Rassie van der Dussen’s 108. Markram was named man of the match for his 106 off 54 balls and erasing the fastest-century record held by Ireland’s Kevin O’Brien, who a 50-ball century against England in 2011. Sri Lanka was all out for 326 in 44.5 overs with Kusal Mendis (76), Charith Asalanka (79) and Dasun Shanaka (68) leading the way. Meanwhile, New Zealand also upped its record to 2-0 after thumping the Netherlands by 99 runs. Mitchell Santner became the first Kiwi to take a five-wicket haul and also hammered a quickfire 36 off 17 balls. The Dutch managed 223 after New Zealand piled on 322 for seven with Tom Latham (53) and Rachin Ravindra, who made an unbeaten century against England, hitting 51. In a battle of heavyweights, India secured a six-wicket win over Australia in steamy Chennai despite losing three of its top-order batsmen for two runs before KL Rahul and Virat Kohli came to the rescue. Chasing a below-par 199, Kohli made 85 off 116 balls and Rahul slammed an unbeaten 99 as India reached 201 for four with 52 balls to spare in front of a passionate crowd. While the Aussie pacers had India on the ropes early, it was India’s spinners who did the damage with Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav sharing five wickets to wreck the Aussies.
