The BCCI's unwillingness, despite a three-team women's T20 Challenge, means Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have raced ahead to create hugely popular women's T20 cricket leagues. The Women's Big Bash League in Australia is an outright leader in this aspect while the now-defunct Kia Super League, did well for England in domestic cricket before the Hundred took it to even greater heights. For long, many have demanded a Women's IPL, which was either delayed due to citing of lack of player pool or doubts over financial viability. But ever since the launch of Women's IPL became formal in 2022 as the BCCI finally found the will and intent to do so, many are now seeing it as one of the big breakthrough events for women's cricket in what promises to be a big 2023 for the sport after 2022 saw Australia get back ODI World Cup trophy, clinch a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games. The year passing by also witnessed Women's Caribbean Premier League as well as Fairbreak Invitational tournament enter the calendar. And 2023 will begin with the inaugural edition of the ICC Women's U19 T20 World Cup, an event which was in making for long before Covid-19 pandemic further delayed it. 16 teams will be competing in 41 matches across four venues in Benoni and Potchefstroom in South Africa. The tournament will see youngsters thrive on a platform and showcase their talent in front of a world which is always on the lookout for future stars in the cricketing circuit. It will also mark the debut of Indonesia and Rwanda in an ICC World Cup for the first time ever in what promises to give plenty of exposure to young, talented female cricketers. Then in February, South Africa will be playing hosts' to the eighth edition of the Women's T20 World Cup. The benchmark for being fantastic hosts' was set by defending champions Australia when they got a record crowd of 86,174 for the final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) as the tournament became one of the most-watched sporting events in women's sports. March would potentially see the dream of seeing Women's IPL turn into reality, and see the crowds filling up stadiums, something which will be on cards ever since 47,000 plus people watched the second T20I between India and Australia at DY Patil Stadium, Navi Mumbai, who were treated to a Super Over finish won by the Harmanpreet Kaur-led team. At the same time, Pakistan will also be launching a Women's T20 League, featuring four teams and 12 matches, to be held in Rawalpindi. The Hundred in England will also see the first ever women's player draft in a major sport in the UK, with teams set to select a minimum of four players, and Welsh Fire to make their first pick. India's amazing run to being runners-up of the 2017 ODI World Cup brought women's cricket under immense spotlight. The proof of women's cricket popularity was again on the show during the recent India-Australia T20I series, where fans came in huge numbers if the tickets were priced or not. Over the last five years, the sport has taken huge strides towards providing playing opportunities, social media limelight, increased revenue and brand advertising interest for its women cricketers in India and abroad. The Indian team has got the ability to be world-beaters and with voices from Indian as well as foreign cricketers calling vociferously for a Women's IPL, it has set the ground for the next revolution in the cricketing world. 2023 may well turn out to be the year when women's cricket will take centrestage and see the emergence of the junior as well as senior talent in front of a passionate world craving for more cricketing action.

But Shakib Al Hasan and Mehidy Hasan Miraz took three wickets in the first hour to leave India in spot of bother at 74/7. The wicket-taking balls from Bangladesh were on straighter deliveries at a pitch which was offering huge assistance to spinners, making life difficult for India. But Ashwin and Iyer, India's last-recognised batting pair, defended solidly, mixed caution with aggression and then brought out a flurry of boundaries at the end to take the visitors' over the line. In a cracking finish at Dhaka, the Ashwin-Iyer partnership lasted 17.3 overs and scored at a run-rate of 4.05. In securing a 2-0 series sweep, Ashwin was unbeaten on 42, while Iyer was 29 not out for India to complete a chase of 145 in 46 overs. Off-spinner Mehidy Hazan Miraz (5/63) kept Bangladesh in the hunt with a five-wicket haul but it did not prove to be enough. Resuming the innings at 45/4, India lost Jaydev Unadkat (13) in the second over of the day. After slog sweeping Miraz for a six, Unadkat was caught plumb in front of the stumps with the arm ball from Shakib Al Hasan which struck plumb in front. Rishabh Pant tried to put the pressure back on the opposition with his counter attacking approach. The southpaw had changed the course of the first innings with his 93 but fell for nine on this occasion with Miraz trapping him leg before. It became 74/7 when a well set Axar Patel (34) became Miraz's fifth wicket. It was the straighter one again that thud into his pads before clipping the leg stump. India were staring at their maiden defeat against Bangladesh before Iyer and Ashwin provided a ray of hope with a gritty stand. Despite the series win, India still have many questions to answer, especially about the top order and the approach while playing against spinners in spin-friendly conditions. For now, they have Ashwin and Iyer to thank for securing a hard-fought win at Dhaka. Brief Scores: Bangladesh 227 in 73.5 overs and 231 in 70.2 overs lost to India 314 in 86.3 overs and 145/7 in 47 overs (Ravichandran Ashwin 42 not out, Axar Patel 34; Mehidy Hasan Miraz 5/63, Shakib Al Hasan 2/50) by three wickets.

The 23-year-old player induced a big bidding war as he became the second-most expensive buy in the history of IPL auction. The all-rounder was preparing for the Boxing Day Test between Australia and South Africa when he watched the IPL 2023 auction on TV. The likes of Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), Delhi Capitals (DC), and MI bid for him before he was bought by the five-time champions for INR 17.5 crore.At the IPL 2023 auction, which took place in Kochi last week, England all-rounder Sam Curran became the most-expensive buy in the history as Punjab Kings (PBKS) bought him for INR 18.5 crore.

After the visitors were dismissed for 189, an aggressive David Warner, in his 100th Test, was unbeaten on 32 and Marnus Labuschagne was not out on five to steer the hosts to 45-1 at stumps on day one. Usman Khawaja was out for one, caught behind by Kyle Verreynne off Kagiso Rabada. Australia won the first of three Tests by six wickets inside two days on a hostile and green Gabba pitch in Brisbane last week. The wicket at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was less bowler-friendly, but captain Pat Cummins surprisingly chose to field at a venue where toss-winning teams normally bat first. South African skipper Dean Elgar said he was bewildered by the decision, but it proved to be inspired in front of 64,876 fans with the Proteas losing early wickets as they again struggled against the hosts’ bowling firepower. After slumping to 67-5, Verreynne and Marco Jansen launched a stirring fightback in a gutsy 112-run stand. But then Green – the second-most expensive buy at the Indian Premier League auction last week – went on a blitz, snapping the partnership when Verreynne got an outside edge on 52 that Steve Smith collected. Two balls later, Jansen was gone, caught by wicketkeeper Alex Carey for 59 off Green before the giant Australian bowled Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi. Green took 4-8 in the spell with the Proteas losing their last five wickets for 10 runs. South Africa started the day nervously, losing Sarel Erwee and Theunis de Bruyn cheaply. They were stunned just before lunch when Elgar, who passed 5,000 Test runs, and the experienced Temba Bavuma departed in consecutive balls. It left them in trouble at 58-4 and the inexperienced middle order facing a daunting task. When Khaya Zondo was out in the fifth over after lunch for five, courtesy of a stunning Marnus Labuschagne diving catch, the end looked nigh before Verreynne and Jansen dug in. On a humid day, Cummins asked some searching early questions, dropping Elgar on seven off his own bowling and then having two big lbw shouts against Sarel Erwee denied. Erwee lived dangerously and was no match for local hero Scott Boland. The seamer, who took 6-7 in the corresponding Test against England a year ago, came on to thunderous applause and got the breakthrough in his second over, with Khawaja taking a low catch at third slip to remove Erwee for 18. South Africa’s batting has been under the pump recently and as the senior player, Elgar knew he had to stick around. But it was a grind, with the captain surviving when an inside edge off Boland sent the ball rolling onto his stumps only for the bails to stay on, then being dropped by Nathan Lyon. Green got Australia’s second wicket when Theunis De Bruyn attempted a pull shot and wicketkeeper Carey took an easy catch. Disaster then struck with a sluggish Elgar needlessly run out by Labuschagne going for a single on 26, and Bavuma fell for one next ball, edging Mitchell Starc to Carey after a poor shot. – AFP","pubDate":"2022-12-26 15:07:58","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","country":["kuwait"],"category":["sports"],"language":"arabic"},{"title":"Decision to send Pak team to India will be taken at govt level: Sethi","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/decision-to-send-team-to-india-will-be-taken-at-government-level-najam-sethi/articleshow/96523960.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The decision to send the Pakistan team for the ODI World Cup in India next year will be taken at the government level, the new Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Najam Sethi has said.

With the Scorchers struggling to chase 134 for victory at Perth Stadium, captain Ashton Turner opted to take a no-risk approach to Khan as wickets continued to drop. And Khan revealed the hilarious insult he sent Turner’s way after the Scorchers refused to take him on, scoring just two runs from his final over. Watch BBL12.

But he just controlled his nerves and didn’t do anything silly. “I was trying to make something happen and get his wicket as soon as possible.” 'Tidy up a few areas of attitude...' | 01:00 Khan conceded just 1-15 from his four in a brilliant performance that just wasn’t enough to get his side over the line. He was heard on the stump mic at one point telling teammates, “I want him on strike, I want to get him out now” and gesturing to Turner. And it was Turner (48 not out off 38) who proved the hero for Perth, as he got his side home with five balls to spare. But Khan got the full wrath of the Perth crowd for his battle with Turner, even getting booed late in the contest. “It’s not often Rashid Khan gets booed by a crowd but they are not happy,” Fox Cricket commentator Dan Ginanne said. Rashid Khan also spun his side to victory. Picture: Paul Kane Source: Getty Images “He’s so competitive and he’s right in this contest right now,” commentator Glenn Maxwell added. Speaking after the match, Turner said he had nothing but respect for Khan’s antics. “He’s a bloody good bowler, he’s got me out a few times before,” he said. “His job was to get wickets and get me out and my job was to not let him get me it – so it was as simple as that. “The important part of it for Jhye and I was to still be there when Rash had finished his four overs. “It’s awesome fun being able to play against someone like that.” Turner said he and Khan were “talking the whole time” from the moment he came to the crease with his side in trouble at 4-48.
