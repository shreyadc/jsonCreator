Since huge political rallies are expected to throng the city during these days, holding international matches adjacent to the capital city was a risky affair. Considering all these factors we have asked the PCB to shift the matches to Lahore.” The ruling political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf is facing a no-confidence motion and has already announced a big rally in Islamabad on March 27. The combined opposition has also announced holding a rally the next day (March 28) when voting is expected on the no-confidence motion. The Pindi Stadium falls within two-kilometer radius where these rallies are expected to gather momentum.The PCB has already expressed fears that all the four international white-ball matches would have to be shifted to Lahore as holding these matches amid political tension in and around Islamabad was not without risk. ‘The News’ has also learnt that hotel booking in Islamabad has already been released.“Yes, we have been asked to release the booking. According to the original schedule, Pakistan and Australia teams were booked at our hotel from March 26 to April 8. But now the booking has been canceled.” When ‘The News’ approached a PCB official, he said that the interior ministry had advised the Board to shift these matches to Lahore. “After getting the advice we have now approached Cricket Australia (CA) and sought their permission on the change in venue. We believe the CA would be having no objection to the change in the venue but we need to get formal approval before going ahead with the fresh plan. We hope to get the formal approval from CA anytime,” he said. The official added that the safety and security of teams and accompanied officials was top priority.“We cannot take even one percent risk when it comes to the safety and security of the teams. Now we have no other option but to hold these matches at the Gaddafi Stadium on the same dates. The teams will continue to stay at the same hotel in Lahore where the rooms were booked for the third Test of the series starting from March 21 at the Gaddafi Stadium.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Khawaja to become cricket’s new million dollar man","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/stay-up-to-date-with-the-latest-news-from-the-australian-cricket-team-ahead-of-the-third-test/news-story/e15af5c7c1330731465e6bf12d82c136","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Usman Khawaja’s stunning form surge could reap him a million dollar pay rise and will force Australia to review his potential in all forms of the game.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-19 01:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan will go all out to win final Test, says Saqlain","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/942682-pakistan-will-go-all-out-to-win-final-test-says-saqlain","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: Pakistan head coach Saqlain Mushtaq is expecting a result in the series decider here and reiterated that Pakistan will follow the course of playing tough cricket.Talking to media here on Friday, Saqlain said the Australians play tough cricket and obviously “we have to play tough...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-19 01:00:00","full_description":"LAHORE: Pakistan head coach Saqlain Mushtaq is expecting a result in the series decider here and reiterated that Pakistan will follow the course of playing tough cricket. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ Talking to media here on Friday, Saqlain said the Australians play tough cricket and obviously “we have to play tough cricket against them”. Besides the Paksitan’ coach stay firmed that they would give their best to ensure the final Test be result-oriented. “After our fight back [in Karachi match] we are very optimistic and we will play hard to get a result and obviously we also want a result and to win this series. Saqlain Mushtaq heaped praises on the Pakistan team for pulling off a rearguard draw against Australia in the second Test of the ongoing series. “History was made in the second Test against Australia and I am extremely proud of the way the whole team showed character,” he said. “The players turned the impossible into possible. I am proud the way the whole team has made history,” he added. However Saqlain claimed that the National Stadium Karachi (NSK)’s pitch had all the elements for Test cricket in it. He didn’t agree that the pitches for the first two Tests were not prepared to Pakistan’s strength. “Yes the surface for the second Test was on a slower side but it ticked all the boxes. It fulfilled all requirements to have a good Test as it had spin, reverse swing and uneven bounce. Both teams fought hard and made it a memorable Test match,” he said. Pakistan head coach also backed the middle-order batter, Fawad Alam, for his below-par performance in the second Test. “I think Fawad performed in his way. He could not get a chance to bat in the first Test, while a couple of good balls resulted in his dismissals in the second Test,” he said. Saqlain also commented on Yasir Shah’s inclusion and revealed lack of match fitness halted Yasir from making it to the Playing XI. Saqlain concluded that the home side is confident to win the series by winning the third Test. The final match of the series between Pakistan and Australia will begin from Monday.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia bowl against India in World Cup","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-bowl-against-india-in-world-cup-c-6123234","keywords":null,"creator":["Ben McKay"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia are chasing a fifth-straight Women's Cricket World Cup win when they take on India at Eden Park on Saturday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-19 00:59:58","full_description":"Meg Lanning has won the toss and will unleash pace talent Darcie Brown on India as Australia look to book a place in the World Cup semi-finals.

In the preceding series against New Zealand, Indian bowlers struggled to find rhythm but in the World Cup, the batting performance has been inconsistent with the team sitting at two wins and as many losses after four games. With three leagues games remaining, India must gain consistency in all departments and maintain their place in the top four to qualify for the semifinals.

Brathwaite would struggle to make an all-time Barbados XI, such is the rich history of cricket on this island and the talent it has produced over the years. The West Indies captain is a seasoned opener nonetheless, and over the course of eight and a half hours he repelled allcomers, reaching the close unbeaten on 109 from 337 balls for what was his 10th Test century and his third against England. By this stage he had lost Blackwood, his vice-captain, after an impressively restrained innings of 102 from 215 balls had been ended by the loopy off-spin of Dan Lawrence, lbw offering no shot. It was a bizarre miscalculation and a bonus for England’s weary players. But as their supporters headed off to the Friday night fish fry at Oistins, West Indies were 288 for four from 117 overs in reply to England’s 507 for nine declared, needing 20 more runs to avoid the follow-on. The draw appears favourite on another docile pitch, one that will earn much-needed revenues for the Barbados Cricket Association. But England had a couple of opportunities to break a fourth-wicket partnership of 183 from 68 overs that started out from 101 for three in the morning session and led to some words being exchanged between Blackwood and Ben Stokes after tea, such was the frustration it created. The first of these came when Blackwood was yet to score and was struck in front of the stumps by Stokes amid a thundering six-over spell during the second hour. With the naked eye it looked a strong shout – umpire’s call on impact with leg stump at worst – but Stokes dissuaded Root from sending the decision upstairs, only for the subsequent Hawk-Eye projection to return three reds. The second was a moment of agony for one of England’s two debutants, Saqib Mahmood, who in the 93rd over sent a searing yorker to the base of Blackwood’s stumps on 65, only for replays to show he had overstepped. He was instantly consoled by Stokes who, along with Mason Crane, Tom Curran and Mark Wood in recent times, had also seen his maiden Test wicket scrubbed off for a no-ball. Blackwood, it must be said, played superbly. The Jamaican right-hander has a reputation as a mercurial talent, something furthered by his dismissal on the final day in Antigua. But he got his head down here, offering stout defence and a keen eye for a single. He also laced 11 fours. At 4.57pm local time, as he guided Jack Leach for a single that sealed his third Test century, the celebration was joyous. It was a template that had been set by Brathwaite at the other end. After resuming on 28, with West Indies 71 for one and still 436 runs in arrears, the 29-year-old has batted through four sessions without offering a chance in a way that befits his cool character. Even upon reaching his century – a first on his home ground in Test cricket – he lifted his bat with the air of a man who had simply completed that day’s Wordle. The reprieves for Blackwood came with a sense of justice for West Indies too, having questioned the earlier removal of their rock from the first Test, Nkrumah Bonner. Given out lbw to Stokes for nine on the field, Bonner reviewed instantly amid a belief there was an inside edge. Both ultra-edge and replays hinted at vindication for the batter, only for the third umpire, Gregory Brathwaite, to decide he did not have conclusive evidence to overturn it. Less debatable was England’s first incision when Sharmarh Brooks, Brathwaite’s overnight partner, slapped a long-hop from Leach to backward point on 39 and trudged off bereft. With Leach having enjoyed some sharp turn early on, hopes rose that his deployment at one end, allied with the seamers rotating at the other, might see England chip away at more regular intervals. As it was, Leach was only steady and Root’s seamers toiled. Chris Woakes appeared drained of confidence – never more so than after tea when Brathwaite drilled him for two fours off the second new ball – while England’s two newcomers in Mahmood and Matthew Fisher bounded in with good energy but only fleeting threat when the ball offered a smidgeon of reverse for the former. Root has lost his chief point of difference on this tour, too, with Wood now ruled out of the third Test in Grenada – and the Indian Premier League that follows – with the elbow injury he picked up in Antigua now requiring specialist opinion back in the UK next week. The slog will have to continue without him.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53bcc9d3f3fadfa19a52f027ca0505a4023d947f/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c626e9d0a776f15dd97a2a38742efc94","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England toil as Brathwaite and Blackwood both hit centuries with decision to axe Anderson and Broad looking foolish","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/17998103/england-toil-west-indies-brathwaite-blackwood/","keywords":["Cricket","Sport","England Cricket"],"creator":["Martin Lipton"],"video_url":null,"description":"IT’S no good getting the runs if you can’t get the wickets.

As the sun beat down on England and the Barmy Army in Barbados, the decision to leave Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad at home looked even more foolish. GettyEngland toiled for much of day three as the West Indies piled on the runs[/caption] APBrathwaite and Blackwood both scored centuries as England suffered in the Barbados sunshine[/caption] A day that began with England licking their lips over the damage Jack Leach would do on a turning pitch turned into a nightmare. Leach bowled too quickly, not giving the ball time to grip, as West Indies closed in on the follow-on target of 308 with just four wickets down at the close. The seamers bowled straight, with reverse swing, but rarely with anything approaching the menace required. Those failings were compounded by failing to review when leg stump would have been knocked out of the ground, and taking wickets with no balls.

Ben Stokes, showing he is mortal, was responsible for the first error. In the over after – via a controversial third umpire decision – he had dismissed Nkrumah Bonner, the Durham all-rounder crashed one into Jermaine Blackwood’s back pad, with the new bat still not off the mark. Stokes, though, told Joe Root the ball was missing leg, advising against a review.

What would have been 101-4, after Leach had earlier snagged Shamarh Brooks when he spooned a wide one straight to Chris Woakes at point, was transformed over the next five painful hours into a partnership heading towards 200. Credit must go to Blackwood, disciplined and determined, as well as stoic Windies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite, who completed his tenth Test ton, and third against England, off 278 balls including 11 boundaries. England, though, were complicit, none more so than rookie seamer Saqib Mahmood. The Lancashire bowler, neat and tidy throughout, thought he had claimed his first Test scalp when he speared one through Blackwood’s defences with the No5 on 65 and the score on 230. But the third umpire saw that he had overstepped, by a long way. Dejection for Mahmood, another life for Blackwood, England’s chances of forcing the game ebbing further away.

Yet if ever there was a surface that Leach would have wanted to bowl on – at least, so it seemed as he turned two of his first four deliveries of the day past the outside edge – it should have been this one. Leach was monstered Down Under by Marnus Labuschagne and David Warner but in Bridgetown he continued to push it through, even when the home side were in survival mode. The fact that his only wicket came from a horrible miscue, as Brooks made a mess of a wide one begging to be hit, said far too much. As did the lack of chances created by the rest of the attack, which was game but lacked the guile that one of Anderson or Broad would surely have offered. Indeed, there was genuine fortune about another wicket taken, with the third umpire confirming Stokes’ leg before shout against Bonner – trimming the bails – despite a spike on ultra-edge as it passed the bat and into the pad. After that, misery until late in the day – including a missed stumping of Brathwaite from the usually-reliable Ben Foakes – before Dan Lawrence was the unlikely hero for the tourists. The part-time spinner had Blackwood pinned in front for 102 with just minutes to go in the day. But Brathwaite and nightwatchman Alzarri Joseph clung on until stumps as the West Indies closed on 288-4 – still 219 runs behind England. Meanwhile, fast bowler Mark Wood has been ruled out of the remainder of the tour and his IPL contract with his ongoing elbow injury.","pubDate":"2022-03-18 21:31:34","full_description":"WE saw it all through the Tour of Hell Down Under... if you can’t get the wickets, you can’t win a game. And while West Indies duo Kraigg Brathwaite and Jermaine Blackwood deserved the accolades for grinding out the centuries that should avoid the follow-on, this was a day England ’s bowlers will not want to remember. Joe Root and Co woke in Bridgetown licking their lips over the damage Jack Leach would do on a turning pitch. Ninety miserable overs later, with the home side having added 217 to finish on 288-4, they dragged themselves into the dressing room shaking their heads in frustrated disbelief. Leach, unfortunately, will bear the brunt of the inquest, unless England can find a way to turn the match back again over the final two days. There was sympathy for the way he was treated in Australia after being targeted by Marnus Labuschagne and David Warner at the Gabba. But the Kensington Oval pitch, against a home side in survival mode for the first two sessions, should have been made for him, especially when he beat the outside edge of both overnight men inside his first four balls. Instead, pushing it through far too quickly for it to really grip, Leach’s only success was when he tempted Shamarh Brooks into spooning a wide one straight to Chris Woakes at point. England spin coach Jeetan Patel admitted: “We knew it wasn’t going to be easy.” Yet if the spinner is not delivering - and 1-97 off 44 overs is not delivering - the seamers must. JOIN SUN VEGAS: GET A FREE £10 BONUS WITH 100s OF GAMES TO PLAY AND NO DEPOSIT REQUIRED (Ts&Cs apply) The effort of Matt Fisher, Saqib Mahmood, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes was not in question. Patel added: “The guys put in a great shift.” But they lacked the guile that you suspect the absent Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad would have brought, or even a fit Mark Wood - now going home and out of the IPL with his elbow injury. That was compounded by two errors that cost England Blackwood’s scalp, when he was on nought and then on 65. The first was from Stokes, showing he is mortal. He had removed Nkrumah Bonner, the leg before dismissal confirmed despite a spike on ultra-edge as it passed the bat and into the pad. With his tail up, the Durham all-rounder crashed one into Blackwood’s back knee but immediately advised Root the ball was missing leg. Ball tracking, though, suggested it was smashing into the pole three-quarters of the way up. What would have been 101-4 became a partnership of 183 but should have been sawn off 53 runs earlier. Mahmood thought he had claimed his first Test scalp when he speared one through Blackwood’s defences but he had overstepped, by a long way. Dejection. To be fair to Brathwaite and Blackwood, they took full advantage. Skipper Brathwaite who completed his tenth Test ton, and third against England, off 278 balls including 11 boundaries, finished on an unbeaten 109. And Blackwood, normally a dasher but far more conservative, got through to his third Test century - the second against England - before playing no shot to a Dan Lawrence spinner that would have hit the “middle of middle” for 102. Scant consolation. A truly awful England day. But Brathwaite and nightwatchman Alzarri Joseph clung on until stumps as the West Indies closed on 288-4 - still 219 runs behind England. Meanwhile, fast bowler Mark Wood has been ruled out of the remainder of the tour and his IPL contract with his ongoing elbow injury.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ireland national anthem lyrics: Why is Ireland’s Call played in rugby and is The Soldier’s Song played?","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/5503130/ireland-national-anthem-lyrics-irelands-call-words-six-nations-rugby/","keywords":["Rugby Union","Sport","Explainers","Ireland Rugby","Six Nations 2022","Sport Evergreen"],"creator":["Jim Sheridan"],"video_url":null,"description":"IRELAND are still in with a chance of securing their first Six Nations title since 2009 and they’ll need the passion of their national anthem to be transferred onto the field against Scotland.

Ireland’s Call is also used by the Ireland cricket team, with Northern Ireland and the Republic playing as one team in both sports. Do the Ireland rugby team ever sing The Soldier’s Song? At rugby matches played in the Republic, both national anthems are sung. Elsewhere, Ireland’s Call is the only one used, in recognition of the need for a unifying anthem. Therefore, at the Six Nations Ireland sing both national anthems in home matches but only Ireland’s Call in away games.

Former England skipper and batter Michael Vaughan is fondly remembered by the English Cricket fans for having led the England side to win the Ashes series in the year 2005.

James Anderson criticized Michael Vaughan Legendary England fast bowler James Anderson, however, seven years post the series victory, stated that the 2005 Ashes-winning skipper “was not as good a captain as others made out”. Speaking highly in praise of another former England skipper Nasser Hussain, Anderson exclaimed, “Our relationship was good on and off the field.

You played Muttiah Muralitharan exceptionally well in Sri Lanka. Now both of you are together for Sunrisers Hyderabad... Murali is a very friendly person and we met at several events. As a bowler, he had so many tricks. When I made all those runs in Sri Lanka, I played him according to the length, rotated the strike and came down the track only when I was sure. It will be great working together. Footwork is the essence of batting, in any format isn’t it? Footwork is the fundamental aspect of batting. I would say it is even more important than the hands and the bat. When you get to the ball’s pitch using your feet and get your body in a good position with a still head, you, vitally, achieve balance. Footwork does not mean jumping down the track alone. You cannot do that to pacemen. So you go back and across and play more off the back foot to the quicks. Batters with footwork will get runs in all formats. Shane Warne, sadly passed away recently. Your memories of him? It is an enormous blow. He is the greatest leg-spinner ever. Facing him was a challenge. We’ve been involved in some fascinating duels. But after the day’s play, he would leave everything behind and have a drink with you. As a commentator, he articulated the right issues. His influence was positive wherever he went. A tragic loss. What do you feel about young cricketers leaving Test cricket for the Twenty20 leagues? Playing for the country should come first. Because I played for the West Indies, other opportunities opened up for me. It’s disappointing to see young cricketers leaving Test cricket. The ICC should come up with a rule stating a cricketer must play a certain number of games for his country before he can play in the Twenty20 leagues.Something needs to be done. Master batsmen: Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara have a chat ahead of a Test at Kingston, Jamaica, in May, 2002. - V. V. KRISHNAN The ICC has said 'Mankading' will now be considered a regular run-out. I still feel it is not in the spirit of the game. Your thoughts on Virat Kohli’s loss of form? It’s temporary. He’s classy and will be back among the runs. How would you rate Rohit Sharma as Test captain? India has a very good team now, irrespective of who is leading the side. To beat Australia in Australia and win the decider with a second or third side speaks much about India’s bench strength and the kind of pacemen it now has. Rohit appears a good captain with a cool head with the respect of all players including Kohli. You are good friends with Sachin Tendulkar. Can you tell us about him? To carry the hopes of billions for so many years was sensational. We have always kept in touch, there is mutual respect. What I like the most about Sachin is his humility.","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ranji Trophy offers brief respite for run-hungry Ankit Kalsi","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/domestic/ranji-trophy-himachal-syed-mushtaq-ali-ankit-kalsi-rishi-dhawan-ipl-cricket-news/article38458211.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Abhishek Mukherjee"],"video_url":null,"description":"Playing domestic cricket after a frustrating two years, Kalsi led the run charts for Himachal Pradesh but oversaw a lukewarm team performance.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-18 16:00:26","full_description":"Ankit Kalsi, like numerous others, played domestic cricket for the first time in two years when he played the Ranji Trophy. Known more for his expertise as a patient accumulator of runs in first-class cricket, Kalsi’s wait to make a mark with the bat and make a case for higher honours ended when Himachal Pradesh took the field against Punjab at the Arun Jaitley stadium here on February 17. Within a month, it was over. Although his team’s overall performance was lukewarm, his personal returns with the bat were good: he topped the run charts, scoring 316 runs in five innings. These runs were scored after three months of strife. Just days away from participating in his first domestic T20 tournament – the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy – Kalsi suffered a grade-three muscle tear and was ruled out. His wait to play domestic cricket again after a lengthy break due to COVID-19 extended, a break which had ended his bat sponsorship. And now he couldn’t bat or bowl or field for the next three months. READ| Former cricketer Daniel Manohar to make IPL debut as match referee “I have been having a very good training regimen for the last 1.5-2 years. Everyone was very impressed with the fitness, so everyone was really surprised to see that I have got injured. Maybe it was because of the wet ground; we were going a sprint on the wet ground [at training],” the Himachal Pradesh captain told Sportstar , reflecting on his injury and rehab. The Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association asked him to undergo rehab at its rehab facility in Dharamsala, and Kalsi tried his best to recover before the all-important Ranji Trophy. He said the period of recovery made him a “better person.” READ| Mark Wood ruled out of IPL, Windies series with elbow injury “It was a very difficult period personally for me; even my family was worried. Before the season, you do all the hard work, and suddenly when the season comes, you get injured. It was very difficult to digest,” he said. Surprise He eventually made it to the inter-district tournament in the State, representing his home district of Una. Since the domestic team was busy playing the knockout rounds of the Vijay Hazare Trophy, most of the players likely to play the Ranji Trophy missed the red-ball practice. With an inspired performance with bat and ball, captain Rishi Dhawan led the team to its maiden title, beating heavyweight Tamil Nadu in the final in Jaipur. READ| Ankit Kalsi: Himachal benefitting from grooming home-grown players So when Kalsi was appointed captain again – he served as the captain in 2019 – two days before the Ranji Trophy was set to begin, he was surprised, as he thought Rishi would continue to lead the team in the longer format of the game as well. Himachal made a promising start, scoring 354 in the first innings against Punjab, Kalsi scoring 88. But thanks to Punjab’s mammoth first-innings score of 526, only one point could be gained. With an innings win against Tripura – Kalsi scored 147 – the team was well in the hunt for a quarterfinal spot, but a loss in the final round quashed the hopes. “They had prepared rank turners [in Palam]; it was difficult to make runs there,” Kalsi said, reflecting on the third-round match against Haryana. “The pitch had been under-prepared and deteriorated from day one, so whoever got the opportunity to bat first had a big advantage. We had to bowl, and our bowlers let us down; Haryana scored more than 300 runs and so were always behind in the match. “All in all, I would say our performance wasn’t very good but not very bad either. Rishi was injured for the last game, and Prashant [Chopra], too. It was very unfortunate; they both had to undergo surgery.” Not having qualified for the knockout rounds meant Kalsi and the rest of his team have hardly any cricket to look forward to this season. Kalsi will head to Liverpool, U.K., to play club cricket in the summer months, having signed up as a professional for Formby CC.","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"South Africa vs Bangladesh 1st ODI Live Score And Updates - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLXZzLWJhbmdsYWRlc2gtMXN0LW9kaS1saXZlLXNjb3JlLWFuZC11cGRhdGVzLTI4MzAyNTDSAWdodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L3NvdXRoLWFmcmljYS12cy1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLTFzdC1vZGktbGl2ZS1zY29yZS1hbmQtdXBkYXRlcy0yODMwMjUwL2FtcC8x?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa vs Bangladesh 1st ODI Live Score And Updates  NDTV SportsSA vs BAN Live Streaming Details, South Africa vs Bangladesh 2022- When and Where To Watch South Africa vs Bangladesh, South Africa vs Bangladesh 2022, 1st ODI  Cricket AddictorRecent Match Report - Bangladesh vs South Africa 1st ODI 2021/22  ESPNcricinfoTwitter Reactions: All-round Bangladesh defy Killer Miller to take early honours in the ODI series  CricTrackerSA vs BAN Prediction, Who Will Win the Match Between South Africa vs Bangladesh, South Africa vs Bangladesh, 1st ODI  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-18 15:33:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“I’ve so much mutual respect for MS Dhoni”: Gautam Gambhir eulogizes MS Dhoni for his contribution to Indian Cricket ahead of IPL 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ive-so-much-mutual-respect-for-ms-dhoni-gautam-gambhir-eulogizes-ms-dhoni-for-his-contribution-to-indian-cricket-ahead-of-ipl-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","Gautam Gambhir","MS Dhoni"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Gautam Gambhir eulogizes MS Dhoni; vows to be there for him whenever the latter is in need in his life ahead of IPL 2022.

When Pakistan captain Bismah Maroof celebrated her reaching half-century against Australia by mimicking rocking a baby in front of her infant daughter Fatima, on Friday, new mother and West Indies leg-spinner Afy Fletcher dedicated her first wicket in the tournament to her son a day after her 35th birthday. Fletcher's seven-month-old son Audee Henry is back home in the Caribbean as his mother made her return to the World Cup stage. After taking the wicket of Bangladesh's Fargana Hoque at the Bay Oval, Fletcher celebrated by pretending to video call her son, saying 'Hi baby'. Her teammates joined in with waves and smiles showing the family away from home Fletcher has around her in New Zealand. Hoque's dismissal marked the start of the collapse that saw Bangladesh slip to 60 for three in pursuit of 141. Fletcher's devastating bowling continued as she extracted the outer edge from experienced campaigner Rumana Ahmed's bat to be caught behind by Shemaine Campbelle for a five-ball duck. On the very next ball, Fletcher had Ritu Moni trapped lbw, justifying her inclusion for the match. A review couldn't spare Ritu, but Fletcher, with 3/29, was setting up West Indies' four-run win. With the bat, Fletcher was part of a vital eighth-wicket stand of 32 with Campbelle, the West Indies' highest partnership until the wicketkeeper-batter added 36 with Karishma Ramharack for the ninth wicket. Fletcher's 17 off 28 balls allowed Campbelle to score more freely after she had dug in to halt the slide, ending the innings on 53 not out from 107 balls with her runs proving crucial to a narrow win. \"It is brilliant. When you look at women's sport nowadays, you see so many changes happening and it's been fantastic that she's been able to go become a mother and come back. It speaks for her dedication, her age being probably 30-something at this point. So it's fantastic that it is becoming more of a regular happenstance that women can leave the game and give birth and be able to come back to it knowing that they have that support around them,\" said Hayley Matthews while doffing her hat to Fletcher for making a comeback after motherhood. \"It's brilliant to have her back. We saw today the type of class player that she is and we only expect good things from her going forward as always.\" If Matthews' words are to go by, then Fletcher will have more chances to take wickets and bring out video call gestures after taking a wicket in the World Cup. --IANS nr/akm (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","image_url":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1220318/thumb-122031800604.jpg","source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Women's World Cup India vs Australia: Toss timing and Playing 11 prediction","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/women-s-world-cup-india-vs-australia-toss-timing-and-playing-11-prediction-122031800590_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CWC 2022 India vs Australia Toss: Get the latest toss updates and the Playing 11 predictions from the India vs Australia match at the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2022","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-18 11:26:00","full_description":"Indian Women's cricket team captain Mithali Raj and her ladies would be up against a very tough challenge against the Australian Women's cricket team at Eden Park in Auckland. This would be the first game at this venue and there are chances of rain disturbing the play. However, the Indian team would be dead set on winning this match and getting on with the momentum after a devastating loss against England in its last game. Australia on the other hand would look to continue their winning run after having won four out of four matches in the tournament so far. CWC 2022 India vs Australia Toss Timing India vs Australia Women's Cricket World Cup match today will begin at 06:30 am IST and 1400 hrs Local New Zealand time. Thus the toss between the India Women captain Mithali Raj and Australia Women captain Meg Lanning would take place 30 minutes before the match start time. Hence, India vs Australia toss would take place at 06:00 am IST and 1330 hrs Local time. Here's how the Playing 11 of India and Australia Women's World Cup match would look like India must pick Shafali Verma in Playing 11 at all costs as she is someone who can win matches single-handedly and take the attack to the opposition right from the word go. No doubt that Yastika Bhatia has done well but she is never the type of batter that Verma is. Hence Verma must be included. Other than that, India could also play Poonam Yadav in place of either Sneh Rana or Deepti Sharma. Agreed that both Sneh and Deepti can wield the willow, but Yadav is a wicket-taker and India need to pick wickets. Deepti Sharma hasn't really been able to fire in this World Cup either with the bat or ball. Australia on the other hand has no problems to solve at all as it is going like a well-oiled machine and hence there would be no changes in their Playing 11.
