Australia are all set to tour India for a four-match Test series in February. Speaking ahead of their third Test against South Africa, Agar said he has always wanted to play Test cricket in India, adding that it’s the most exciting cricket to watch on TV. “It is in my mind. I love watching the Test matches over there, and I think playing Test match cricket in India is something I’ve always wanted to do. It’s the most exciting cricket to watch on TV because the wickets have been wild recently,” said Agar. He went on to say that he would love to be part of Australia’s squad for the Border-Gavaskar trophy tour to India, adding that he’ll have to wait and see what happens. “They’ve been spinning sideways, and I imagine they’ll spin a fair bit over there as well. It’s a tour I’d love to go on, but we’ll just wait and see what happens,” Agar added. Agar said he enjoys the responsibility of batting at number 7 for Australia, insisting that the added responsibility helps him play better. “I feel like if I do come in I’ll be batting around that No.7 mark, which is really cool, that responsibility is really nice, it’s something I’ve been doing for Western Australia and I think it’s something that makes you play better to be honest,” said Agar. The spin-bowling all-rounder said it would be nice for him to complete a century, insisting that there’s enough time to to that when he comes in to bat at number 7. “Any time you bat in four-day cricket you have time, particularly at No.7, there’s always enough time. All anyone wants is enough time to make 100, that’s every batter’s dream. I got close once, so it would be nice to do that,” Agar added.","pubDate":"2023-01-01 16:35:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BCCI Secretary Jay Shah Keeping Close Eye On Team India's Developments","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/bcci-secretary-jay-shah-keeping-close-eye-on-team-indias-developments-3655359","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Gathering key decision makers in a series of meetings even till the last week of 2022, Jay Shah has ensured Indian cricket remains on the growth trajectory with key decisions taken to mark the start of the New Year","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-01 13:55:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Rishabh Pant was trying to avoid pothole': Delhi cricket official on accident","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/rishabh-pant-was-trying-to-avoid-pothole-delhi-cricket-official-on-reason-of-the-accident/articleshow/96664973.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) director Shyam Sharma, who met Rishabh Pant at the hospital on Saturday, revealed that the cricketer was trying to avoid a pothole when the accident occurred on Friday morning.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-01 13:39:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"भारत को कॉपी कर पाकिस्‍तान टीम को मजबूत बनाना चाहते हैं शाहिद अफरीदी, बताया अपना प्‍लान","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/news/sports/cricket-shahid-afridi-wants-to-strengthen-the-bench-strength-of-pakistan-cricket-team-like-team-india-5146555.html","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"पाकिस्‍तान क्रिकेट टीम (Pakistan Cricket Team) के लिए यह साल अच्‍छा नहीं रहा. बीते साल टीम अपने घर में एक भी टेस्‍ट मैच नहीं जीत पाई. इंग्‍लैंड के खिलाफ तो उसे ऐतिहासिक हार का सामना करना पड़ा. एशिया कप (Asia Cup) और टी20 वर्ल्‍ड कप (T20 World Cup) के फाइनल में भी उसे शिकस्‍त मिली.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-01 12:14:51","image_url":"https://images.news18.com/ibnkhabar/uploads/2023/01/shahid-afridi-1-16725727303x2.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=675","source_id":"hindinews18","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"टीम इंडिया में खिलाड़ियों की एंट्री नहीं होगी आसान, BCCI ने बनाया फ्चूयर प्लान, जानें रिव्यू मीटिंग में 3 बड़े फैसले","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/news/sports/cricket-indian-cricket-team-review-meeting-held-bcci-3-decision-selection-fitness-cricket-world-cup-2023-rohit-sharma-rahul-dravid-plan-5146819.html","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian Cricket Team Review Meeting: पिछले साल टीम इंडिया का प्रदर्शन एशिया कप और टी20 विश्व कप में अच्छा नहीं रहा था. इसके बाद से ही भारतीय क्रिकेट में बदलाव की बातें हो रही थी. बीसीसीआई ने भी इसमें देरी नहीं की और नया साल लगते ही भारतीय क्रिकेट के भविष्य के लिहाज से कप्तान रोहित शर्मा, हेड कोच राहुल द्रविड़ और एनसीए चीफ वीवीएस लक्ष्मण के साथ ही रिव्यू मीटिंग के बाद कई अहम फैसले ले लिए.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-01 12:01:32","image_url":"https://images.news18.com/ibnkhabar/uploads/2022/12/Rohit-Sharma-Team-India-AFP-16720471183x2.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=675","source_id":"hindinews18","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Cricket-BCCI to increase focus on player fitness ahead of ODI World Cup","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2023/01/01/cricket-bcci-to-increase-focus-on-player-fitness-ahead-of-odi-world-cup","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - India's cricket board (BCCI) will increase its focus on player fitness and consider who have played a substantial domestic season when making selections for the national team, it said on Sunday following a review meeting ahead of the 2023 World Cup.

The board said that the National Cricket Academy will work with teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to monitor the targeted Indian players participating in the Twenty20 league this year. The review meeting was held in Mumbai to discuss the roadmap and was attended by BCCI president Roger Binny, India captain Rohit Sharma, head coach Rahul Dravid and others. Issues of player availability, workload management and fitness parameters were also discussed at the meeting in the build-up to the World Cup, which will be held in India in October and November. \"The emerging players will have to play a substantial domestic season to be eligible for selection to the national team,\" the BCCI statement said. \"The Yo-Yo test and Dexa will now be part of selection criteria and implemented in the customised roadmaps of the central pool of players,\" it added. The Yo-Yo test demands players run back and forth between cones spaced 20 metres apart with increasing speed and reduced time available to complete each shuttle, while a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) is an imaging test that measures bone density. Last month after India's ODI series defeat in Bangladesh, captain Rohit had raised concerns over players pulling up injured repeatedly despite being passed fit. \"We need to try and get to the bottom of it,\" Rohit said at that time. \"I don't know what exactly it is. Maybe they're playing too much cricket. \"We need to try and monitor those guys, because it's important to understand when they come for India, they need to be a 100%, in fact more than 100%.\" Deepak Chahar was injured for most parts of 2022, while Jasprit Bumrah (stress fracture on his back) and Ravindra Jadeja (ankle) are recovering from injuries.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-01 11:31:03","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2023/1/2023_1$largeimg_1524557397.JPG","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"पाकिस्तान का खतरनाक गेंदबाज लेगा यू-टर्न, 2 साल बाद संन्यास से वापसी के दिए संकेत","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/mohammad-amir-hints-of-his-return-to-pakistan-cricket-after-announcing-retirement-in-2020-2023-01-01-917457","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan Cricket: पाकिस्तान के बाएं हाथ के तेज गेंदबाज मोहम्मद आमिर ने दो साल बाद संन्यास से वापसी के संकेत दिए है।","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-01 11:10:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Yo-Yo Test Part Of Team Selection Criteria: BCCI Decides In Review Meet","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/yo-yo-test-part-of-team-selection-criteria-bcci-decides-in-review-meet-3654926","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) held a performance review meeting in Mumbai on Sunday","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-01 10:31:53","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"\"I Would've Banned Them\": Ramiz Raja's Big Statement On Akram, Waqar","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/i-wouldve-banned-them-ramiz-rajas-big-statement-on-wasim-akram-waqar-younis-3654875","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Ramiz Raja has now targetted legendary fast bowlers, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-01 09:58:02","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Wow’: Unknown star tears BBL apart","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/big-bash/unknown-grade-cricketer-josh-brown-explodes-in-23ball-62-for-brisbane-heat/news-story/46ccc5a54fd295296f9da51de218cbfc","keywords":["Big Bash News","Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The BBL has a brand new star after unheralded Queensland grade cricketer Josh Brown dismantled the Sydney Sixers at the Gabba with a spectacular 62 off 23 balls.","content":"Brown spanked his 50 off just 19 balls including six sixes.

Start your free trial now >While most people won’t know his name as he hasn’t played state cricket, he has dominated the grade competition this season.He has four centuries and five 50s, hitting 1013 runs at an average of 48.24 and a ridiculous strike rate of 162.08.His 90 sixes this season for the Northern Suburbs District Cricket Club are more than double that of BBL stalwart Ben Cutting, who has 44.He brought that form into the BBL — racing to a maiden fifty in just his second BBL match.Brown, who makes custom bats for Cooper Cricket for his day job, twice hit the third tier of the Gabba in a phenomenal innings that had the commentators and social media raving.The fastest 100 record holder in the BBL Craig Simmons was impressed by what he saw.“@BBL wow serious striking by josh brown and more importantly has some nice girth about him,” he tweeted. CODE Sports’ Lachlan McKirdy wrote: “Josh Brown hits his maiden BBL 50 off just 19 balls. Includes five sixes. Remarkable in just his second game. “Departs for 62 off 23 balls, what a way to announce yourself.”Sports producer Sarang Bhalerao added: “Josh Brown looks very impressive. Where has he been all this while, @HeatBBL?”Former journo Ray Gatt posted: “Well that was exciting while it lasted! Magic innings”.Newscorp’s Tim Michell tweeted: “Nothing better than a guy who’s dominated at the lower level for years who gets his chance and goes off! Love to see Josh Brown go large”.On Seven, Glenn Maxwell was stunned by the audacity of the hitting.Asked on Seven about how he pulled off the innings, he said it was pretty simple.“Just watch the ball, and hit it as far as I can really,” Brown said.“That was always my plan. Pretty simple.”On Fox, Brown said his secret was equally simple.“Just try to keep as still as I can when I’m hitting the ball and hit every ball on its merits,” Brown said.“I sorta didn’t know I was any good at cricket until I was about 24. And then it all sort of kicked off from there.“Went from playing third grade to second level cricket in the space of 18 months - it all happened very quickly.”Brown really became a first grade regular in the past few seasons since the 2018/19 season and played a handful of games for the Queensland second XI but struggled to score big. Brown wasn’t alone either as 23-year-old South Australian first-class player Nathan McSweeney smashed 84 off 51 balls as the Heat piled on 5/224 off its 20 overs.","pubDate":"2023-01-01

The BCCI is also in touch with them, taking updates on his condition. As of now, he will be kept here only,” Sharma told reporters after meeting the cricketer. India’s star cricketer had a miraculous escape when his luxury car crashed into a road divider and caught fire after he dozed off at the wheel on the Delhi-Dehradun highway in the early hours of Friday. The 25-year-old, who was on his way to his hometown Roorkee to surprise his mother, suffered injuries on his head, back and feet, but is in a stable condition, according to police. Replying to a question, Sharma said Pant told him that it was dark and the accident took place when he was trying to negotiate a pothole. Earlier in the day, Bollywood actors Anil Kapoor and Anupam Kher also met Pant at the hospital. “He (Pant) is doing fine. We met him as fans. Let us pray that he recovers soon and we see him playing again,” Kapoor told reporters after coming out of the hospital. —PTI DDCA director meets Pant; expresses satisfaction at medical treatment added by Press Trust of India on 12:43 am January 1, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-31 19:13:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Injured Rishabh Pant all set to miss Australia series; three-way race between Bharat, Upendra and Kishan for Test wicketkeeper’s slot","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/injured-rishabh-pant-all-set-to-miss-australia-series-three-way-race-between-bharat-upendra-and-kishan-for-test-wicketkeepers-slot-466212","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi, December 31The extent of Rishabh Pant's ligament tear, after his horrific car accident, is yet to be ascertained but if BCCI sources are to be believed, he is set to miss the upcoming four-Test series against Australia.Pant's absence from competitive cricket could be a prolonged one and it will be premature to even zero in on a date at this point in time, and hence, one of the biggest challenges for the new selection committee will be to select the two keeper-batters for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.The Indian Test wicketkeeper's slot is now suddenly up for grabs and it could be an interesting three-horse race between Pant's current understudy Kona Bharat, India A's second keeper Upendra Yadav and white-ball specialist, Ishan Kishan, when the Test series starts in Nagpur from February 9.The 25-year-old lost control of his Mercedes car while driving from Delhi to Rourkee on Friday morning and hit the divider near Mohammadpur Jat in Manglaur area.
