Unlike the rugby codes and AFL though, which rely heavily on the school system to help develop players, the schools our cricketers attend are less likely to point to their higher-level success.Eighty-six separate institutions have contributed to the tally this century, from all states and territories except the Northern Territory, with players schooled in city and country areas.Seventy-two of those have produced a single Test cricketer, while 10 have two students that have gone on to play a men’s cricket Test for Australia.But four schools stand above the rest for players this century.Western Australia’s Wesley College has produced four players – brothers Shaun and Mitchell Marsh, batsman Chris Rogers and middle-order batter Hilton Cartwright – while wrist spinner Brad Hogg, opener Cameron Bancroft and former Test stalwart and coach Justin Langer went to fellow WA Public Schools Association (PSA) member Aquinas College.Queensland’s traditional rugby nursery Nudgee College also schooled three players that turned out this century, off spinner Nathan Hauritz, opener Joe Burns and Australia’s latest Test debutant, leg spinner Mitchell Swepson.SCBBL PROMOVictoria’s St Bede’s College, which also has close connections with the Kingston Hawthorn Cricket Club, has produced three players – Brad Hodge, Jon Holland and last summer’s success story, quick Scott Boland.Wesley College head of sport Luke Dwyer said the college’s facilities and the depth of the PSA competition had helped produce the champions.“Those guys (the Marsh brothers, Rogers and Cartwright) are seriously good Test cricketers, so we do pride ourselves on the fact that we’ve had some very good athletes come through our college,” Dwyer said.The college’s director of cricket Michael Deighton played 71 first class matches for Tasmania, while Test representative Shaun Marsh has given back to the college, doing some batting and fielding specialist coaching.But Dwyer said on-field success – of the individual or the team, was not everything.“We value everything that comes with sport – building resilience and discipline that it takes to commit to training and competition,” he said of Wesley, a school which has also produced AFL stars Lance “Buddy” Franklin, Ben Cousins and England Test cricketer Ben Hollioake.“We’re not a win at all costs school and we value preparing students as best as can with good coaching and mentorship to be competitive.“It’s bigger than the result. We come back to what is our philosophy and what are we doing to prepare our students for a meaningful experience as young adults and adults.”Fellow PSA school Aquinas College, whose alumni include Olympic track champion Herb Elliott, has a rich tradition of school sport its head of cricket Brett Silver says drives all at the school.“It’s a Chariots of Fire moment, you’re excited by what’s gone on in the past and you want to honour that whether you’re a player or a coach or a teacher,” Silver said.Queensland rugby nursery St Joseph’s College, Nudgee, is another school building its cricket resume.Nudgee head of cricket Tim Lang said his main focus had been getting “wonderful” coaches into the program to help develop the boys’ skills.In conjunction with multimillion-dollar facilities that include new flats and 20 artificial and eight turf practice wickets, coaches including former Test player Nathan Hauritz and Australia’s latest Test debutant Mitch Swepson helped hone players’ skills and bring a new generation through the system.“If you put good mentors in front of the boys, it’s a long process but you’ll see the fruits of the labour by the time they get to year 10,11 and 12,” Lang said.As well as Hauritz, Swepson and Joe Burns, Nudgee old boys include West Indies representative Brendan Nash, who remains heavily involved in the college’s cricket program, Australian one-day players Jimmy Maher and Chris Lynn.AUSTRALIA’S TOP CRICKET SCHOOLS THIS CENTURY","pubDate":"2022-11-16 22:06:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Roadmap for 2024 T20 World Cup starts now, lot of people will get enough chances: Pandya","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/11/17/roadmap-for-2024-t20-world-cup-starts-now-lot-of-people-will-get-enough-chances-pandya/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Wellington: Stand-in T20I skipper Hardik Pandya on Wednesday said the road map for 2024 T20 World Cup starts now, adding that going forward a lot of players will be given chances to stake their claim in the side.

India’s 2022 T20 World Cup hopes ended with a 10-wicket defeat against eventual champions England in the semifinals. Pandya, who will be leading India in the three-match T20I series against New Zealand, starting Friday, said the team needs to overcome from their World Cup failure. “Yes, we all know there is disappointment of the World Cup but we are professionals and we need to cope with it. How we cope with our success we cope up with our failures and move forward and look forward to get better rectify our mistakes,” Pandya told reporters. The next T20 World Cup will be played in 2024 in the West Indies and United States and the Indian squad is expected to undergo a major transition in the next two years with the likes of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma among others being gradually eased out of the set up. “Yes, the next T20 WC is almost two years so we have time (to unearth new talent). A lot of cricket will be played and a lot of people will get enough chances. “The road map starts from now. But it’s too fresh right now. We have a lot of time so we will sit down and have conversations on those grounds,” Pandya said. “Right now it’s making sure that the boys enjoy playing here. We will talk about the future later,” he added. The white-ball tour of New Zealand that includes three T20Is and as many ODIs will not feature Kohli, Rohit, opener KL Rahul, keeper-batter Dinesh Karthik and veteran off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin as all have been rested as part of “workload management of players”. —PTI Roadmap for 2024 T20 World Cup starts now, lot of people will get enough chances: Pandya added by Press Trust of India on 1:04 am November 17, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-11-16 19:34:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket Discipline Commission reprimands England's Alex Hales over controversial social media post","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/cricket-discipline-commission-reprimands-englands-alex-hales-over-controversial-social-media-post-11641991.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket Discipline Commission reprimands England's Alex Hales over controversial social media post","content":"Cricket Cricket Discipline Commission reprimands England's Alex Hales over controversial social media post After a picture of Hales in blackface was published by The Sun last year, Hales had in November 2021 apologised via an Instagram video. FirstCricket Staff November 17th, 2022 0:38:47 IST Alex Hales in action during the 2022 T20 World Cup. AP England batter Alex Hales was on Wednesday reprimanded by the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) over an old photo of Hales himself, in a black face during a New Year’s party in 2009. After a picture of Hales in blackface was published by The Sun last year, Hales had in November 2021 apologised via an Instagram video. “The theme was musicians and Tupac is, was and always will be my favourite musician, so I went as him. I want to apologise for all the offence this has no doubt caused. It was incredibly reckless and foolish on my behalf, so I want to apologise for that, apologise to the club for the embarrassment it would have caused them. I guess my twenties was full of mistakes like that, reckless mistakes off the field that cost me, let down family, let down team-mates, let down friends, close relationships I had during my twenties,” the 33-year-old had said. In August, Hales was charged with a breach of ECB Directive 3.3. The directive states: “No such person may conduct himself in a manner or do any act or omission which may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket or which may bring the game of cricket or any cricketer or group of cricketers into disrepute.” Hales was part of the successful England team that were crowned T20 World Cup champions in Australia recently. England beat Pakistan by five wickets in the final in Melbourne. Hales finished the tournament with 212 runs from six matches, including a match-winning knock of 86 off just 47 deliveries against India in the semi-finals.

Some of the biggest players were carried away in the cyclone as Mumbai Indian released Kieron Pollard, Sunrisers released Kane Williamson, Gujarat Titans did away with the likes of Lockie Ferguson and Jason Roy, and the winds of change swept away Kolkata Knight Riders, Rajasthan Royals, and Punjab Kings in its entirety.The cyclone will once again take pace after more than a month’s time as the mini auctions will be held on 23 December in Kochi. However, for the time being, the winds of change have stopped flowing, and the cyclone has stopped blowing the IPL squads to pieces with the window closing on Tuesday.IPL 2023 Player Retention: Full list of retained, released, and traded playersSeveral teams have released a significant number of players and are looking at an overhaul of the entire squad. Whereas, several other teams have released a few players that would have hardly played any games if retained, but retained a majority of its players.We take a look at each of the teams and what would they need to do to have their squads cover all the bases at the auction.We start with the champions of the last season Gujarat TitansGujarat Titans (GT)The Titans have released six players from their inaugural squad that won the IPL. However, most of the players who were pivotal in their victorious campaign are still with them.They have three foreign slots to fill, and with ₹ 19.25 crores left in the purse, that should not be too problematic.The Titans largely have all basis covered and will only most likely look to strengthen their bench at the auctions.Lucknow Super Giants (LSG)One of the most surprising releases for LSG was West Indian all-rounder Jason Holder. Besides, LSG have also released several other significant names including Evin Lewis, Manish Pandey, Andrew Tye, and Dushmantha Chameera.But they still have the core players in place and boast of several high-profile players that make their squad look dangerous on paper.They have four overseas slots empty, and they might look to have a solid middle-order batter at the auctions. A purse of ₹ 23.35 crore should not make them feel poor and they shall be able to fulfill their wish list.Mumbai Indians (MI)Mumbai Indian were in the news on the last day of retention, as much as the entire retention was. And the reason was as tall and giant as Kieron Pollard.MI are clearly looking to overhaul their squad and they have made it crystal clear discontinuing the services of Pollard, albeit only as a player.#OneFamily @KieronPollard55 @DJBravo47 pic.twitter.com/6VvmEn9ET6— Mumbai Indians (@mipaltan) November 16, 2022 Apart from Pollard, the franchise has done away with 12 other players and they brought back the services of Jason Behrendorff via trade from Royal Challengers Bangalore.At the auctions, Mumbai will have a purse of ₹ 20.55 crore and will have quite a bit of shopping to do. However, their primary target will be to acquire one or two excellent spinners and an all-weather all-rounder.If the bidding wars escalate, they might find their purse to be smaller.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)RCB letting go of Behrendorff was quite surprising, but he hardly played for the franchise and was benched more often than not. Besides, Sherfane Rutherford was the only big name they let go.RCB have otherwise continued with the same squad and will require to do very less shopping. They shall probably look for a fast-bowling all-rounder.A purse of ₹ 8.75 crore sounds low, but it shall be sufficient considering the team combination and their requirements.Chennai Super Kings (CSK)The rumour mills and grapevines around Ravindra Jadeja have once and for all ended as CSK announced his retention.However, the release of Chris Jordan was quite a surprise. Probably considering that the IPL will be played in Indian conditions. Trying to out-smart their opponents, CSK have continued with their spin attack that might prove lethal on the Chepauk track.Everything is fine #RESTART pic.twitter.com/KRrAHQJbaz— Ravindrasinh jadeja (@imjadeja) November 15, 2022 They seem to have most bases covered, and MS Dhoni has the tendency to make an average player look like a superstar.CSK need two more overseas players and might try to replace Jordan and Dwayne Bravo with a few pacers or all-rounders. ₹ 20.45 crore should let them do that.Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH)Sunrisers have released a total of 12 players including the likes of Kane Williamson and Nicholas Pooran. And they are expected to be one of the busiest at the mini-auction.The franchise has retained the core bowling attack that is a mix of Indian and overseas bowlers. But they will look to rebuild their top and middle order alongside very few existing batters.₹ 42.25 in their purse shall be sufficient. But, with the kind of requirement they have generated, after pressing the reset button, a bidding war might take a toll on their team combination.Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)KKR were one of those franchises whose house was completely blown away by the cyclone. As many as 16 players were released including Pat Cummins and Alex Hales who opted out of the IPL.However, the core has been maintained in Sunil Naraine, Shreyas Iyer, and Andre Russell. A few bowlers were also acquired through trade-offs to add to the existing armoury of Tim Southee and Umesh Yadav.Nevertheless, they have quite a significant shopping to be done, and ₹ 7.05 will definitely make them feel below the poverty line at the auctions unless they have some tricks up their sleeves.The as of 15/11/22⏭️ All eyes now on #IPLAuction…#IPLRetention #AmiKKR #GalaxyOfKnights pic.twitter.com/MaE4bfXpFd— KolkataKnightRiders (@KKRiders) November 15, 2022 Delhi Capitals (DC)It will be unfortunate to not see an active Delhi Capitals table at the auction. If there is anything to remember from the 2022 auction, it was the DC owner raising his pedal at every second player.This time around, their squad looks settled and they have not made too many releases either to enter into the heavy bidding war.The Capitals also have a purse of ₹ 19.45 crore and with not much to do at the auction, the amount definitely seems big.Rajasthan Royals (RR)Rajasthan Royals have retained their core, but have made a big statement by releasing several big overseas names – five of their nine releases are foreign players.Their core players, nevertheless, have all the basis covered. A formidable top order and a dynamic middle order, including world-class spin and pace attack.Did someone say ? pic.twitter.com/Fr2GV3uuZd— Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) November 16, 2022 But if they wish to strengthen their bench, which they should, ₹ 13.2 crores might prove to be significantly less.Punjab Kings (PBKS)The Kings as well surprised with the exclusion of Mayank Agarwal and Odean Smith. But they still boast of a good-looking squad with a good mix of Indian and overseas players.They also have a big purse of ₹32.2 crore and with only three overseas players required to be added, they are expected to shop in a light-hearted manner.An area which they might want to strengthen is their spin bowling department, as only Rahul Chahar is a recognizable name alongside all-rounder Liam Livingstone.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Gambling used to be stigmatized, but it has recently gained popularity in Nigeria as a way to spend time and money. The skill has gotten so popular that daily wagers of about 3,000 Naira and a staggering 730 billion Naira are wagered annually. Businesses have taken notice of this growth habit, and as a result, there was a sports betting store on practically every street across Lagos in 2019. Not every user has the same taste, so Nigerian bookmakers offer various options that help the market grow exponentially. Since Nigeria’s gambling law welcomes gambling activities, especially sports betting, the locals can check out all Nigerian bookmakers listed on BetZillion and place their wagers accordingly. Sports Betting Market in Nigeria: Current Situation Although Nigeria has one of the most formidable online sports betting markets on the continent, ranking alongside South Africa and Kenya, it is still a market that is easy to access and navigate. Even for new users, it can be an excellent place to start. The Nigerian bookies also provide tempting promotions and free bets to draw in customers, much like the rest of the world. The proposals and bonuses never seem to end. Enrollment frequently comes with attractive discounts, especially for new clients. Thus the Nigerian betting network is flourishing fast, and with the right bookmaker, you can stand a real chance of winning big! As for bookies, it is extremely promising to set up their business as the sports betting industry in Nigeria is overgrowing, with more than 30% of the country’s population being invested in regular online betting.

Besides, the customer base in Nigeria is extremely promising and growing at an excellent rate. You can learn more about Nigerian sports betting here. Is Sports Betting Profitable in Nigeria?​ Football is big in Nigeria and popular among viewers and bettors. That isn’t surprising, knowing that Nigeria is the home of many football superstars, including Victor Osimhen, Mikel John Obi, Samuel Chukwueze, and many more. The Nigerian football team has achieved plenty of success on the international level with 3 Africa Cup of Nations titles and 2 World Cup playoff appearances. But the nations’ success goes beyond only football. While other types of gambling are steadily gaining popularity across the country, sports betting has been the overwhelmingly popular choice for the vast majority. The popularity of football is a major booster to the increasing prominence of online sports betting in the region. Nigeria also has a powerful national basketball team that holds titles from AfroBasket and All Africa Games and regularly appears at the World Cup and the Olympic Games. Nigerians are incredibly proud of their national teams, so it only makes sense to bet on their success. Football World Cup and basketball World Cup receive extensive coverage by the bookies, along with all other major sporting leagues, including La Liga, English Premier League, and Italian Serie A. This is both because significant international events are prevalent among bettors in Nigeria and also due to the fact that some Nigerian football players play in those clubs. Other than this, if there’s a major international sports competition, you can be sure that the Nigerian bookies will also have markets open for it. The locals’ wagering interest has also extended to other athletic endeavors like American football, rugby, and cricket. Traditional horse racing wagers are also immensely popular among the population. So if anything, the Nigerian sports betting market is the best place for online bettors to incur a profit. The Future of the Betting Market in Nigeria Greater Acceptance In Nigeria, sports betting is becoming increasingly popular, and this trend is not likely to stop soon. Through the Criminal Act Code, the Nigerian government approved several skill-based games in 1990. As a result, there were few regulations on how land-based casinos and sports betting sites might operate. The National Lottery Regulatory Commission closely regulates the sector. This government agency ensures that all offline and online gaming establishments pay taxes. Additionally, it guarantees that Nigerians only bet on legal games like poker and blackjack. Movements of international brands to Nigeria The availability of broadband internet services and the acceptance of sports betting have attracted international brands in the betting industry to Nigeria. This new generation of youthful Nigerians is tech-savvy and loves the convenience of performing several legitimate activities online. It has created a thriving market for international betting brands. Dedicated Nigerian betting websites spring up almost daily, and more Nigerians are taking advantage of their enticing offers. Live Streaming Bookmakers in Nigeria have started using live streams to engage their numerous customers actively. A few betting sites have also improved their offerings by including live sports betting that ardent followers can use. Using live bets guarantees that participants in competitions like the Premier League, Bundesliga, etc., have a more engaging experience. As more people become tech-aware, sports betting in Nigeria will have a bright future. It has also motivated a few platforms to develop and launch their betting apps in Nigeria so that more users can download and utilize them conveniently. Sports betting in Nigeria can only improve as technologies emerge every day. As long as businesses and gamblers adhere to the law, there is no indication that anything will slow down. Best Nigerian Bookmakers Online sports betting in Nigeria might not be as huge as in the United States, nor are there as many bettors as in some Asian countries. However, Nigeria is undoubtedly one of Africa’s most competitive gambling industries. It is partly because of the size of the population and the availability of the internet, which created the ideal environment for many Nigerian betting sites to begin operations. There are numerous betting sites to pick from, but you should know where to look to find the best ones. It is where our post will be helpful. So, the following considerations should be made when selecting the best betting sites in Nigeria. Find a safe and legal sportsbook with a good reputation. Check the quality of the odds and the market depth. Consider picking a bookie with solid bonuses and promotions. Check out the payment options and different payment gateways. If you like to wager on the go, choose the sportsbook with the fastest and most reliable mobile betting app. Look for sites with suitable data safety measures, with SSL encryption for any data the user enters. From here, you can learn how to find out if your bookmaker offers this feature. You might want to pick a bookie with a betting blog with tips and predictions on the upcoming games. No bookmaker will, of course, offer the best odds for every sport, but some of them do for select sports. So if you’re betting on horse racing, it’s advisable to choose a sportsbook known for offering great odds on horse racing, whereas if you plan to wager primarily on football, you should pick a more football-focused bookmaker. Wrapping Up It should be clear from the facts discussed previously in this article that online sports betting in Nigeria are not only possible but also advantageous. There are numerous international sportsbooks and bookmakers in Nigeria. All are designed with sports bettors in mind and offer you the most betting possibilities available. It wouldn’t be far from the truth to say that sports betting in Nigeria has never been more popular. Although the sector is still developing, Nigeria has taken the necessary steps to position itself for a successful future in the online betting industry. So if you want to place a bet in Nigeria, choose the bookmaker with all the features you require, go to the top betting sites, and place your bet!

It is wonderful seeing him in international cricket now. I have high hopes from him now that he has been selected for the India squad for this upcoming series,” Williamson said during a media interaction organised by Amazon Prime Video on Tuesday (November 15).

The tour will commence on November 18 with the T20I series being played first.Following the flak Rohit Sharma-led Team India faced for the humiliating 10-wicket loss against England in the T20 World Cup 2022 semi-final, there have been calls for changes, thus India will be keen on rebuilding the side from the upcoming three-match T20I series against New Zealand.Time for transitionIndia will be without main players like regular captain Rohit Sharma, opener KL Rahul, talismanic batter Virat Kohli, veteran wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik and ace off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin for the T20I series. Hardik Pandya will lead the side consisting of a lot of youngsters as Indian cricket gears up for much-needed transition, at least in the shortest format.Did anyone say Captains’ photoshoot? 📸That’s Some Entry! 😎 #TeamIndia | #NZvIND pic.twitter.com/TL8KMq5aGs— BCCI (@BCCI) November 16, 2022The series is a golden opportunity for Hardik to convince the management that he is ready to permanently take over as India T20I captain after many former India cricketers, including Krishnamachari Srikkanth, rallied behind the all-rounder’s elevation. Hardik has led Gujarat Titans to the elusive IPL title in their maiden season which is a big plus on his CV.In the absence of some senior players, the likes of Shubman Gill, Umran Malik, Ishan Kishan, and Sanju Samson have been given a chance and Pandya says it will be an important series for them in the grand scheme of things.“The main boys are not here but at the same time the talent which the guys who are already here, they have also been playing for one-and-a-half, two years now,” he said. “They have had ample chances and enough time in international cricket to express themselves and show what they have. Very excited for them, new bunch of guys, new energy, and excitement.”Going by Hardik’s statement, one thing is for sure – the Indian squad is expected to undergo a major transition in the next two years.The roadmap for the 2024 T20 World Cup starts nowThe T20I series against New Zealand will also mark the start of India’s road to the next edition of T20 World Cup in 2024, which will be jointly hosted by the West Indies and the USA.Ahead of the series opener, Pandya has himself asserted that the road map for the 2024 T20 World Cup starts now, adding that going forward a lot of players will be given chances to stake their claim in the side.Regroup ✅Restart ✅#TeamIndia | #INDvNZ pic.twitter.com/6QK7hLYxwd— BCCI (@BCCI) November 16, 2022”Yes, the next T20 WC is almost two years so we have time (to unearth new talent). A lot of cricket will be played and a lot of people will get enough chances. The road map starts from now. But it’s too fresh right now. We have a lot of time so we will sit down and have conversations on those grounds,” Pandya said.‘Intent’ is all that mattersIt’s high time that India not only learn from their past mistakes but also rectify them. The Men in Blue’s most recent mistake was the lack of intent which ultimately cost them a place in the final of the T20 World Cup.The ‘attack brand of cricket’ which was advertised by Team India ahead of the marquee ICC event in Australia seemed like a fake election promise and the assured ‘fearless approach’ remained a pipe dream for the most part of the tournament.India had the second-lowest powerplay run rate (6.03) in the entire competition with only UAE being worse in that aspect of the game. While Rohit struggled to get going in the entire tournament, Rahul was very inconsistent and cautious at top of the order.India scored at 6 runs per over in the powerplay in the T20 World Cup. This increased to 8.1 runs in the middle overs and 11.9 runs in the last five overs.In the bowling department, India paid the price for not playing Yuzvendra Chahal throughout the tournament even when leg-spinners from other teams dominated the proceedings. Also, the Men in Blue missed the trick by not picking someone like Umran Malik as the lack of pace was evident in the Indian attack and teams like England and South Africa took full advantage of this shortcoming.How’s that for a Trophy unveil! 🤩 🏆#TeamIndia | #NZvIND📸 Courtesy: @PhotosportNZ pic.twitter.com/qTazPXpr3R— BCCI (@BCCI) November 16, 2022The onus now is upon a new bunch of players to show that they can practice what they preach. As far as batting is concerned, the focus will be on Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan in New Zealand to get rid of the conservative approach at the top so that the middle order doesn’t have to do the repair job in every game. The openers must and will have to play an attacking brand of cricket if they aim to be part of the squad for the 2024 T20 World Cup.Also, going forward, India should trust and opt for the combination of Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal as both have brilliant record bowling in tandem and have performed well in the middle overs – an area where India struggled in the last two World Cups.In the pace department, the Men in Blue need to have one bowler in the squad who can bowl express pace just to keep the batters guessing and make them uncomfortable. Given his exploits in IPL, Umran Malik is definitely such a speedster and India need to prepare him well for the next T20 World Cup.Management should also come up with a plan and strategy to develop other pacers in the lot. The likes of Arshdeep Singh, Harshal Patel, and Mohammed Siraj need to be managed well so that India are not dependent on a single bowler in a multi-nation event.Mitch Santner and Kane Williamson preview the upcoming limited overs Series against India, starting with the first T20I this Friday at @skystadium 🏏#NZvIND pic.twitter.com/xIdNWXUZEC— BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS) November 14, 2022The selectors and team management must work on creating a pool of players who are multi-dimensional.

A former Indian cricketer, he is hailed as the god of cricket. He retired from international cricket on this same day in 2013. Let’s rewind a bit of his achievements at this point. Earlier, many cricket fans in India would switch off the TV if Sachin was out and move on to the next job. Because Sachin out means India lose the game. He is such a brilliant player. It has changed over time. He played international cricket for the Indian team from 1989 to 2013. About 24 years. He played his first innings in international cricket on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi. He played his last Test innings in his hometown Mumbai in November 2013. During this 24-year period from 1989 to 2013, he played with different cricketers from three generations. Starting with Kapil Dev, Krishnamachari Srikanth, Ravi Shastri and traveling with Ganguly and Dravid, Sachin retired after playing with players like Sehwag, Yuvraj, Dhoni and Kohli. In those 24 years, Sachin had 664 international cricket matches, 34,357 runs, 100 centuries and 201 wickets. Some of his achievements are… He has accumulated 15,921 runs in Test cricket. This makes him known as the highest run scorer in the international Test arena. He is also the world’s highest run scorer in ODI cricket. He has accumulated a total of 18,426 runs. A cricketer who has accumulated more than 30 thousand runs in all formats like Test, T20 and ODI. First Indian to score 50,000 runs in domestic and international cricket. Player with most centuries in Tests (51) and ODIs (49). A total of 100 international centuries. In ODI cricket, he has set the record of scoring 1000 runs in a single year 7 times. First cricketer to score a double century in ODI cricket. He has formed a partnership with Rahul Dravid for a total of 6920 runs in Test cricket. Although Sachin has retired from the cricket field, the slogan ‘Sachin, Sachin’ is still ringing in the hearts of Sachin’s fans. Sachin’s achievements may be surpassed someday. But his cricketing contribution to the Indian team will forever be an era.
