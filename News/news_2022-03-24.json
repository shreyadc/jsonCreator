Perry was off the field for most of the win over South Africa on Tuesday after suffering a back spasm. She was not required to bat in the five-wicket win. Team physiotherapist Kate Beerworth said Perry's back was settling down with treatment. \"She won't play tomorrow but we expect that she will be available for the semi-final,\" Beerworth said on Thursday. Undefeated Australia will be strong favourites to beat Bangladesh, who are in the event for the first time and lie seventh out of eight teams with one win from five matches. Australia will not know their semi-final opponent until South Africa meet India on Sunday in the final match before the knockouts.

Furosemide is a diuretic, prescribed to treat hypertension and reduce swelling caused by fluid build-up in the body. It is on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s banned list because of concerns that it may mask other drugs. “Zubayr is not disputing the positive test, is cooperating fully with the ICC and has agreed to a voluntary suspension commencing immediately whilst written submissions are presented to the ICC,” said CSA. “Furosemide is not a performance-enhancing substance and Zubayr has been able to identify how the substance entered his system.” Hamza was named in the South African squad for a current one-day series against Bangladesh but withdrew before the series started for what CSA described at the time as “personal reasons”.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Barty career: down-to-earth star of many sporting talents","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/944036-barty-career-down-to-earth-star-of-many-sporting-talents","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"SYDNEY: Multi-talented Ashleigh Barty excels at so many sports that she has played professional cricket and even won a golf tournament, but it was in tennis where she rose to become the best in the world.In January she took her place among the giants of Australian sport by winning her home Grand...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-24 01:00:00","full_description":"SYDNEY: Multi-talented Ashleigh Barty excels at so many sports that she has played professional cricket and even won a golf tournament, but it was in tennis where she rose to become the best in the world. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ In January she took her place among the giants of Australian sport by winning her home Grand Slam. It was fitting that Chris O’Neil, the last home-grown player to win the Australian Open, in 1978, was in the stadium to witness Barty ending a 44-year hoodoo and thrilling a nation glued to their televisions. Less than two months later, Barty on Wednesday announced her shock retirement from tennis aged just 25. She leaves the sport having been world number one for more than two years and with three Grand Slam singles titles, having also won the French Open in 2019 and Wimbledon last year. It is unclear what she will do next, but it would be no surprise if Barty ended up becoming a champion in another sport, because few athletes can boast such a varied sporting CV as the down-to-earth Barty. Widely respected as one of the nicest players in women’s tennis, Barty began playing the sport as a child in the Queensland state capital Brisbane. But it was a trip to the Australian Open for a training camp at the age of about 12 that proved to be the spark that drove her to the summit of the sport. “To see how professional it was and to see everyone going about their business was really eye-opening. My first taste of it was in the juniors and I loved it,” she said at the Australian Open in January. “That kind of lit the flame.” Barty went on to win the junior Wimbledon title as a 15-year-old in 2011. But the expectations that came with success took their toll and she made a surprise decision three years later to ditch tennis for cricket, signing for Brisbane Heat in the inaugural Women’s Big Bash League. “In short, I think I needed just to find myself,” said Barty who, while never shrinking in the limelight, hardly appeared to revel in it. She said that while cricket gave her “a different perspective about sport”, the lure of tennis was never far away. She returned after a season out. Barty broke through for her maiden Grand Slam triumph at the French Open in 2019, became Australia’s first women’s world number one since Evonne Goolagong Cawley and finally won a cherished Wimbledon crown last year. So dominant has she been that she ended 2021 as the top-ranked player for a third consecutive year, joining Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, Serena Williams and Chris Evert as the only women to achieve the feat. Barty should have returned to Paris to defend her Roland Garros title in 2020, but she pulled out over coronavirus fears and picked up her golf clubs instead. And on a course designed by Greg Norman near Brisbane, she won the Brookwater Golf Club women’s title with a commanding victory. “Is there anything you can’t do?” asked one social media user at the time. Barty and long-time partner Garry Kissick got engaged in November, sparking a frenzy of congratulations from fellow tennis stars. She hardly played any competitive tennis in the second half of last year because of the pandemic. Despite that long layoff Barty was imperious in winning the Australian Open. There was an air of inevitability about her title victory as she tore through the field before beating American Danielle Collins in the final in straight sets.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ash Barty’s former cricket teammates would welcome the retired champion back","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/ash-bartys-former-cricket-teammates-would-welcome-the-retired-champion-back-c-6185431","keywords":null,"creator":["Russell Gould"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former cricket teammates were shocked when Ash Barty announced her retirement but also sensed an opportunity.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-24 00:50:27","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-6185431/3dc1e39d4848bea3df39434c704831b1ec90960e-16x9-x0y661w1716h965.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ash Barty’s former cricket teammates would welcome the retired champion back","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/ash-bartys-former-cricket-teammates-would-welcome-the-retired-champion-back-c-6185425","keywords":null,"creator":["Russell Gould"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former cricket teammates were shocked when Ash Barty announced her retirement but also sensed an opportunity.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-24 00:50:18","full_description":"Newly retired tennis champion Ash Barty would be welcomed back to cricket “in any capacity” according to her former Brisbane Heat teammate Jess Jonassen. Barty famously turned to cricket when she retired from tennis for the first time in 2014 and not only took up the sport but earnt herself a WBBL contract with the Heat. She played nine games across the 2015/16 WBBL season, making a high score of 39, off just 27 balls, in her first game for the Heat at the Junction Oval in Melbourne. Jonassen, now the Heat captain who is in Wellington with the Australian team charging towards a one-day World Cup title, said she was “shocked and pretty sad” when she heard the Barty news. But she also said should Barty want to turn to cricket again at any time, she’d be welcomed back into the fold. “There’s going to be a lot of sporting codes in here ear, I can guarantee that. I think she deserves a well-earned break for now,” Jonassen said. “To be fair, we’ll have her back in and around the Heat in any capacity whether that’s on the playing field or as a mentor type role. “She’s an incredible athlete and an incredible person and she’s somebody that any sporting team or any team in general would be lucky to have her around in whatever capacity that may be.” Jonassen didn’t think Barty would be turning her attention to another sport, with golf also touted as a potential option, any time soon. “I thought it was a bit of a joke initially. But I think that was something Ash was always good at, she marches to the beat of her own drum,” Jonassen said. “She was never out there to get in the spotlight or the glory, she just set out and wanted to achieve certain goals, and feeling like she has done that, she now has other goals. “She’s engaged now and family is a big thing for her. It wouldn’t surprise me if that was now the main driver, to be able to spend a lot more time with family.” Barty gave no indication in her retirement announcement on Wednesday that she had another sport in mind, only that she wanted to step away from tennis to “chase other dreams”.","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-6185425/3dc1e39d4848bea3df39434c704831b1ec90960e-16x9-x0y661w1716h965.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket world erupts over David Warner moment with Pakistan rival","link":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/australia-pakistan-2022-cricket-world-erupts-david-warner-222112147.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-23 22:21:12","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/f4009b80-aaf6-11ec-9d8b-d434d5841edd","source_id":"yahoo","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Aussies get the edge after brutal spell against Pakistan","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/aussies-get-the-edge-after-brutal-spell-against-pakistan/video/517c7bb5af3d0d3d82bd400feb48966c","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: A brutal spell with the ball has given Australia the edge in Lahore, bowling Pakistan out for 268 on day three.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-23 20:45:17","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'What on earth': Cricket world in disbelief over 'insane' scenes","link":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/australia-pakistan-2022-cricket-stunned-insane-scenes-203622270.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-23 20:36:22","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/522c43d0-aae8-11ec-9b3a-1b80e5f347b1","source_id":"yahoo","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Top-ranked Ash Barty retires from tennis at age 25; won 3 Grand Slams","link":"https://www.cheknews.ca/top-ranked-ash-barty-retires-from-tennis-at-age-25-won-3-grand-slams-993599/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Nicholas Pescod"],"video_url":null,"description":"BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Ash Barty surprisingly retired from tennis at age 25 while ranked No. 1 and less than two months after winning the Australian Open for her third Grand Slam singles title. “I just know at the moment, in my heart, for me as a person, this is right,” Barty said, her voice […] The post Top-ranked Ash Barty retires from tennis at age 25; won 3 Grand Slams appeared first on CHEK.","content":"BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Ash Barty surprisingly retired from tennis at age 25 while ranked No. 1 and less than two months after winning the Australian Open for her third Grand Slam singles title. “I just know at the moment, in my heart, for me as a person, this is right,” Barty said, her voice shaky at times, during a six-minute video posted on her Instagram account Wednesday in Australia. Saying it was time to “chase other dreams,” Barty, who announced her engagement to trainee golf professional Garry Kissick in November, said she no longer feels compelled to do what she knows is required to be the best she can be at tennis. “It’s the first time I’ve actually said it out loud and, yeah, it’s hard to say,” Barty said during an informal interview with her former doubles partner, Casey Dellacqua. “I don’t have the physical drive, the emotional want and everything it takes to challenge yourself at the very top level any more. I am spent.” This is not the first time Barty walked away from tennis: She was the Wimbledon junior champion at age 15 in 2011, presaging a promising professional career, but left the tour entirely for nearly two years in 2014 because of burnout, overwhelmed by the pressure and travel required. She played professional cricket back home in Australia, then eventually picked up a racket once again and returned to her other sport. Barty went on to win singles major championships on three different surfaces — on clay at the 2019 French Open, on grass at Wimbledon last year and on the hard courts of Melbourne Park in January, becoming the first Australian player in 44 years to triumph at the nation’s Grand Slam tournament. But she hasn’t played a tournament since being presented with her Australian Open trophy by seven-time Grand Slam singles champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley, her mentor and Indigenous and Australian tennis icon, after a straight-sets final victory over Danielle Collins. “I am so supportive of Ash that she does what makes her happy,” Goolagong Cawley told The Associated Press on Wednesday. “I can’t wait to see what happens in the next chapter of Ash’s life, and what helps her achieve her dreams.” Barty won 15 tour-level titles in singles and another 12 in doubles since first turning pro in 2010. She spent 121 weeks at No. 1 in the rankings, including the last 114 in a row. Her announcement was all the more stunning from an on-court perspective given her recent run of success: Barty had won 25 of her last 26 matches and three of her past four events. Only one other woman has walked away from the sport while atop the WTA rankings: Justine Henin was No. 1 when she retired in May 2008. In a statement released by the WTA, CEO Steve Simon called Barty “the ultimate competitor” and said she “has always led by example through the unwavering professionalism and sportsmanship she brought to every match.” “We will miss her,” Simon said. During her 21-month sabbatical from tennis as a teen, Barty played cricket with the Brisbane Heat of the Women’s Big Bash League. She returned to tennis in May 2016, playing a $50,000 ITF event in Eastbourne. One year later, she was ranked No. 88; by the end of 2017, Barty was an established member of the top 20. “I know I’ve done this before,” Barty said with a laugh in the retirement video, “but in a very different feeling. I’m so grateful to everything that tennis has given me. It’s given me all of my dreams, plus more, but I know that the time is right now for me to step away and chase other dreams and to, yeah, put the rackets down.” A semifinal loss to Petra Kvitova in Doha in February was the last match she played in 2020; Barty stayed home in Australia for the balance of the season when the global pandemic emerged. After six months on the road in 2021 and after winning five titles, including at Wimbledon, Barty ended her season abruptly after a loss to Shelby Rogers at the U.S. Open. “Wimbledon last year changed a lot for me as a person and for me as an athlete,” Barty said. “When you work so hard your whole life for one goal — to be able to win Wimbledon, which was my dream, the one true dream that I wanted in tennis, that really changed my perspective.” She described what she termed a “gut feeling” after Wimbledon about maybe being ready to move on, but she also described herself then as not “quite fulfilled.” Her victory at the Australian Open satisfied another gap, and Barty said she was completely aware that “my happiness wasn’t dependent on the results.” Barty was one of the most popular players on tour, and many praised her in retirement on Wednesday. “Ash, what can I say, you know I have tears right?” tweeted Simona Halep. “My friend, I will miss you on tour. You were different, and special, and we shared some amazing moments . . . Be happy and enjoy your life to the max.” Madision Keys posted: “An incredible tennis player but more importantly one of the nicest people on tour.” Alicia Molik, coach of Australia’s Billie Jean King Cup team, said Barty’s decision was ”unusual, retiring at the top.” “It’s pretty gutsy, it’s pretty noble,” Molik said. “What an athlete, what a trailblazer and what a role model.” Andy Murray tweeted: “Happy for (at) ashbarty, gutted for tennis, what a player.” Barty’s closing words, at least for now — she plans a media conference on Thursday — came at the end of the video. “I’ll never, ever, ever stop loving tennis,” she said. “It will always be a massive part of my life but now I think it’s important I get to enjoy the next phase of my life as Ash Barty the person, not Ash Barty the athlete.” The post Top-ranked Ash Barty retires from tennis at age 25; won 3 Grand Slams appeared first on CHEK.","pubDate":"2022-03-23 18:17:21","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cheknews","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Are you kidding me?’: The day Ash Barty stunned Tiger Woods","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/tennis/are-you-kidding-me-the-day-ash-barty-stunned-tiger-woods-20220323-p5a79e.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Sam Phillips"],"video_url":null,"description":"What’s next for Ash Barty?

Louis Dobbelaar, a two-time Queensland amateur champion, won the men’s club championship on the same day.

Barty scored a half century in just her second club match, and was later described by Brisbane Heat coach Andy Richards as a “freak”. Cricket Australia and Queensland Cricket were so captivated by Barty’s talent that they asked her to address the Australian women’s cricket team. If it wasn’t for her desire to take care of unfinished business in tennis, former CA high performance boss Pat Howard told the Herald the sky was the limit. “Initially, it was year one of trying to get the Big Bash up. I was a bit like, ‘Yeah, great, whoever wants to come and play can come and play’,” Howard said. “But she was fantastic. I know the players were really happy to have her around. She was inspirational. “You see lots of multi-skilled, very high-ranking teenagers that are good at lots of things. The chance to play a team sport, she saw it as really cool. “We were trying to inspire the players and say, look, this is what you can be. You can be the greatest women’s team of all time. “That was the remit, and we were trying to find a few people to come in that were at the top or on their way to the top of their sports at the time. That was the goal, and she fit that remit really well.” But perhaps neither cricket nor golf are Barty’s true calling.

When asked which sport she would like to “conquer” next by Ladies Golf, Barty’s mind turned straight to her favourite football code. “I love to challenge myself across all different sports,” she said. “One of my favourites is AFL, and we love to kick the ball around while we’re on tour.” While a return to the tennis court shouldn’t be dismissed, don’t be surprised if Barty pops up sporting yellow and black one day, too.","image_url":null,"source_id":"smh","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bunbury and Districts Cricket Association Team of the Season: Crudeli, Clarke, Wilson among best of the best","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/south-western-times/bunbury-and-districts-cricket-association-team-of-the-season-crudeli-clarke-wilson-among-best-of-the-best--c-6174634","keywords":null,"creator":["Jackson Barrett"],"video_url":null,"description":"Journalist Jackson Barrett has taken a look at some of the top performers from the summer and put the best of the best together for this year’s team of the season.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-23 18:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-6174634/461c7c6f60827f655c3a4e362cde552fb4283d67-16x9-x0y1w1640h923.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zimbabwe players in IPL 2022: Is Blessing Muzarabani playing 2022 IPL?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-zimbabwe-players-in-ipl-2022-is-blessing-muzarabani-playing-2022-ipl/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Blessing Muzarabani","Indian Premier League"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Zimbabwe players in IPL 2022: Zimbabwean fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani will have to wait for his maiden appearance in the IPL.

Mit 25 Jahren und im besten Tennisalter stellt das Ausnahmetalent die Schläger in die Ecke, \"um sich anderen Träumen zu widmen\", wie sie in einem emotionalen Post auf Instagram mitteilte.Keine zwei Monate ist es her, dass die Tennisspielerin aus dem australischen Ipswich die Rod-Laver-Arena in Melbourne zum Kochen brachte. In einem dramatischen Finale nach einem 1:5-Rückstand im zweiten Satz gewann die 25-Jährige die Australian Open und beendete eine 44 Jahre währende Durststrecke. Christine O’Neill war 1978 die letzte Australierin, die den Titel gewann. Für Barty war es der dritte Triumph bei einem der Grand-Slam-Turniere, vielleicht ihr schönster, sicherlich aber ihr letzter. Es war auch die Geburtsstunde der Barty-Party in den Medien, die nach zwei Monaten beendet ist. Was genau Barty für die Zukunft plant, ließ sie zunächst offen. Für Donnerstag kündigte sie aber eine Pressekonferenz an, wo sie sich äußern will.Zverev PAIDAshleigh Bartys Dank an ihre MentorinDass Barty überhaupt drei Grand-Slam-Titel im Einzel gewann, hat sie auch der Frau zu verdanken, die das Abschiedsinterview auf Instagram mit ihr führte: Casey Dellacqua. Nach ihrem Aus bei den US Open 2014 nahm sich die damals 18-jährige Barty eine Auszeit, auch das Karriereende stand erstmals vor der Tür. \"Ich bin schon seit jungen Jahren immer auf Reisen gewesen und das war mir einfach zu viel und ging mir zu schnell\", erinnerte sich Barty später auf dem Portal \"Cricket.com\". Barty wechselte das Schlagwerkzeug und stieg vom Tennis auf Cricket um, eine Sportart, die sie schon länger faszinierte. Auch hier fand sich die talentierte Allrounderin schnell ein und spielte für ein Team in der Profiliga \"Women’s Big Bash League\". Über Dellacqua, die selbst mittlerweile ihre Tennis-Karriere beendet hat und als Moderatorin arbeitet, fand Barty ein Jahr später zurück auf die Tennisplätze Australiens. Bereits vor ihrer Auszeit hatten die beiden erfolgreich im Doppel gespielt, eine gemeinsame Trainingsstunde soll sie wieder zurück zur Jagd auf die gelbe Filzkugel gebracht haben. \"Sie hat als Persönlichkeit so viel für mich gemacht und war vom Beginn meiner Karriere an immer für mich da. Sie hat es ermöglich, dass ich mich entfalten kann und die Balance zwischen dem Privatleben und dem Leben eines Profis finden kann. Ich liebe sie einfach\", konstatierte Barty in einem Interview nach dem Triumph in Melbourne im Januar. Zuvor hatte sie nach der Gratulation von Gegnerin und Schiedsrichterin den direkten Weg zu Dellacqua gesucht und ihr einen Kuss auf die Stirn gedrückt.Mentorin und Freundin: Nach ihrem Triumph bei den Australian Open bedankte sich Ashleigh Barty bei Casey Dellacqua mit einem Küsschen.© Sydney Low/Dabei ging es der 25-Jährigen nie um das große Geld und Titel. Als sie Ende 2019 das WTA-Finale gewann, wurde dieser Titel mit sechs Millionen Euro vergoldet. Ausgeben aber wollte sie das Geld nicht für sich. \"Ich bin ziemlich froh mit meinem kleinen Haus in Australien und habe alles, was ich benötige. Wahrscheinlich bin ich eine langweilige Person, weil ich kaum Geld für mich ausgebe\", erklärte Barty. Nutznießer waren aber Lucy und Oscar, die Nichte und der Neffe der Tennisspielerin, denen sie eine neue Schaukel im Garten versprach. Die 25-Jährige erschien in Interviews immer freundlich, mit einem Lächeln, vor allem aber bodenständig. \"Ich habe so viele Träume, die ich jagen möchte und die nicht daraus bestehen, die Welt zu bereisen, weg zu sein von meiner Familie und von meiner Heimat, wo ich eigentlich immer sein wollte\", erklärte Barty in ihrem Abschiedsinterview.Der Erfolg und die Trophäen bedeuten ihr nichts, schrieb Bartys Schwester Sara im Mai 2019 in einem Artikel für \"Athletes Voice\". Gerade in der Juniorenzeit habe sie gespielt, weil sie den Sport liebe. \"Sie hat einen Teil ihrer Trophäen dem Tennis Club geschenkt, damit sie sie für Juniorenturniere wiederverwenden können\", erinnert sich Sara Barty in dem Artikel. Andere seien in einem Raum bei ihrem Vater eingeschlossen. Die, die sich als Vasen nutzen lassen, überließ Barty ihrer Mutter und den Schwestern. Und nicht nur ihr Nichte und ihr Neffe waren immer im Kopf Bartys, sondern auch der Rest der Familie. \"Wir bekamen andauernd Geschenke von ihr. Egal, wohin sie reiste, Ash brachte immer Geschenke mit.\" Eine ähnliche Einstellung legte auch Biathletin Magdalena Neuner an den Tag, die 2012 ebenfalls im Alter von 25 Jahren ihre Karriere beendete. Das Biathlon-Aushängeschild hätte alle Rekorde brechen können, doch der Erfolg habe sie nie interessiert, erklärte die Sportlerin damals in ihrer Rücktrittsankündigung. Beide verband die Liebe zu ihrem Sport, nicht die Jagd nach Erfolgen.Konkurrentinnen verneigen sichDass Barty sich großer Beliebtheit bei ihren Konkurrentinnen erfreute, zeigen auch deren Reaktionen. Ihre Tennis-Freundin Julia Görges gratulierte ihr zu einer \"unglaublichen\" Karriere. \"Ich bin unglaublich stolz auf dich\", schrieb die 33-Jährige, die ebenfalls bereits zurücktrat: \"Wie du zurückgekommen bist, nachdem du 2014 aufgehört hattest zu spielen, ist herausragend\", meinte sie. Barty sei ein \"wahrer Champion\". Die ebenfalls dreifach Grand-Slam-Siegerin Angelique Kerber sprach Bewunderung für die Entscheidung aus. \"Du verlässt das Tennis als ein wahrer Champion und zu deinen eigenen Bedingungen, einfach deinem Weg folgend, so wie du es immer getan hast\", schrieb Kerber auf Twitter. \"Verfolge weiter deine Träume, ich weiß, du wirst es\", schrieb Kerber, die im vergangenen Jahr noch im Halbfinale von Wimbledon gegen Barty in zwei Sätzen verloren hatte. US-Spielerin Maddison Keys nannte Barty \"eine großartige Spielerin und was noch wichtiger ist, einer der nettesten Menschen auf der Tour\". Simona Halep schrieb, dass sie ihre Freundin vermissen werde: \"Du warst anders und besonders.\"Keinen Hehl machte Barty aber auch daraus, dass der Tenniszirkus an den Kräften der Weltranglistenersten gezehrt hat. Bereits nach dem Wimbledon-Triumph im Vorjahr habe sie das Bauchgefühl gehabt, dass sie Schluss machen wolle mit dem Tennis. „Ein kleiner Part in mir war aber noch nicht ganz zufrieden, und dann kamen die Australian Open. Und das war der perfekte Weg für mich, meine unglaubliche Reise zu würdigen“, so Barty, die im Spätherbst ihrer jungen Karriere nach eigenen Angaben einen Perspektivwechsel habe. „Mein Glück war nicht mehr abhängig von den Ergebnissen.“ Für sie sei Erfolg, zu wissen, dass sie immer alles gegeben habe. Jetzt aber fehle ihr der Antrieb, physisch und emotional, weiter auf einem Top-Level zu spielen. „Aber das ist Erfolg für mich: Ich habe einfach alles für den Sport gegeben und bin wirklich erfüllt und glücklich damit.“ Mehr kann man an seinem Karriereende nicht wollen.Quellen: dpa, Athletes Voice, The West Australian, Tennis 365, Spiegel, Cricket.com","pubDate":"2022-03-23 16:33:00","full_description":"Man soll aufhören, wenn es am schönsten ist – ein deutsches Sprichwort trifft wohl am ehesten auf die Entscheidung von Ashleigh Barty zu, ihre Tenniskarriere zu beenden.

Bangladesh ODI captain Tamim Iqbal was hopeful of a first-ever series victory in South Africa before the start of the recently concluded three-match series. Iqbal, 33, had cited the example of how the team can gain motivation from winning their first-ever Test match in New Zealand earlier in the year. “A great example is our Test win in New Zealand. We turned things around there after many years. We couldn’t win in 30-32 matches in New Zealand but the Test team changed that. I am hopeful this team will force the same change [in South Africa].

Three ODIs later, Iqbal has become the first Bangladeshi captain to lead the team to its maiden ODI series victory in South Africa. Yet to win an ODI in South Africa before the start of the series, Bangladesh have defeated the hosts 2-1 after winning both the ODIs at the SuperSport Park. Avoiding any sort of hiccup in a 155-run chase, Iqbal (87*) and opening partner Litton Das (48) put together a match-winning 127-run opening partnership to provide an outstanding start today. Earlier, after South Africa captain Temba Bavuma won the toss and chose to bat, Bangladesh fast bowler Taskin Ahmed picked his second ODI five-wicket haul as his bowling figures of 9-0-35-5 played a titular role in bundling out the hosts for 154 in 37 overs.

Before this Test series in the Windies, he had previously filled in as replacement head coach for an ODI series against Ireland in 2020 and for England’s five match T20 series in the Caribbean earlier this year which they lost 3-2. “He won’t thank me for saying this but I’d give him the red-ball job after seeing what I’ve seen this month,” his old team-mate Harmison said on talkSPORT’s The Cricket Collective. “He was a shoe-in for the white-ball job, [but] I think you can give him both to be honest because he enjoys being away from home, he enjoys the fact that he’s in with the group, he can distract himself from it and I would definitely give him the red-ball job because the red-ball needs somebody like Paul, I really do.” There have been suggestions that Collingwood, who only retired from professional cricket in 2018, is too close to the players to be able to instil the discipline required of a head coach. He played alongside a number of current England players such as Ben Stokes, Mark Wood at Durham, as well as playing internationally alongside Caribbean absentees Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson.

An increase/decrease in both these elements coupled with the type of soil used, is what determines how the pitch is going to behave at different stages of the match. The Cricket pitches around the world are made using either the Black or the Red soil.

Moreover, the characteristics of both these soils may differ across geographical locations. For instance, the black soil pitches in Australia generally offers more pace and bounce, while the black soil pitches in India may keep the ball low and offer lesser pace. Difference between Black soil and Red soil To simply put, the Red soil generally has less clay content, which results in more wear and tear of the pitch as the match progresses. This largely happens because the soil offers less elasticity and water absorption capacity which makes it dry relatively sooner than a black soil, leading it to crumble soon. On the contrary, the Black soil has more elasticity and thus lasts for a longer time. The more clay content in it means more water absorption capacity; which means that the pitch doesn’t wear and tear soon. The three pitches in Mumbai are likely to offer more bounce initially and thus assist the pacers in the initial stages of the league phase. But, as time would progress and more matches would be played on the red soil surfaces, expect the spinners to dominate proceedings due to wear and tear of the pitches. On the other hand, the black soil surface in Pune’s MCA stadium is likely to assist the spinners right-away as compared to the other three surfaces in Mumbai.

She retired on her own terms, too. At the age of 25, just two months after winning the Australian Open title. The announcement stunned the tennis world on Wednesday. “I just know at the moment, in my heart, for me as a person, this is right,\" Barty said, her voice shaky at times, during a six-minute video posted on her Instagram account Wednesday in Australia. Saying it was time to “chase other dreams,” Barty, who announced her engagement to trainee golf professional Garry Kissick in November, said she no longer feels compelled to do what she knows is required to be the best she can be at tennis. “It’s the first time I’ve actually said it out loud and, yeah, it’s hard to say,” Barty said during an informal interview with her former doubles partner, Casey Dellacqua. “I don’t have the physical drive, the emotional want and everything it takes to challenge yourself at the very top level any more. I am spent.” This is not the first time Barty walked away from tennis: She was the Wimbledon junior champion at age 15 in 2011, presaging a promising professional career, but left the tour entirely for nearly two years in 2014 because of burnout, overwhelmed by the pressure and travel required. She played professional cricket back home in Australia, then eventually picked up a racket once again and returned to her other sport. Barty went on to win singles major championships on three different surfaces — on clay at the 2019 French Open, on grass at Wimbledon last year and on the hard courts of Melbourne Park in January, becoming the first Australian player in 44 years to triumph at the nation's Grand Slam tournament. But she hasn't played a tournament since being presented with her Australian Open trophy by seven-time Grand Slam singles champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley, her mentor and Indigenous and Australian tennis icon, after a straight-sets final victory over Danielle Collins. \"I am so supportive of Ash that she does what makes her happy,” Goolagong Cawley told The Associated Press. “I can’t wait to see what happens in the next chapter of Ash's life, and what helps her achieve her dreams.” Barty won 15 tour-level titles in singles and 12 in doubles since first turning pro in 2010. She spent 121 weeks at No. 1 in the rankings, including the last 114 in a row. Her announcement was all the more stunning from an on-court perspective given her recent run of success: Barty had won 25 of her last 26 matches and three of her past four events. Only one other woman has walked away from the sport while atop the WTA rankings: Justine Henin was No. 1 when she retired in May 2008. In a statement released by the WTA, CEO Steve Simon called Barty “the ultimate competitor.” During her 21-month sabbatical from tennis as a teen, Barty played cricket with the Brisbane Heat of the Women’s Big Bash League. She returned to tennis in May 2016, playing a $50,000 ITF event in Eastbourne. One year later, she was ranked No. 88; by the end of 2017, Barty was an established member of the top 20. “I know I’ve done this before,” Barty said with a laugh in the retirement video, “but in a very different feeling. I’m so grateful to everything that tennis has given me. It’s given me all of my dreams, plus more, but I know that the time is right now for me to step away and chase other dreams and to, yeah, put the rackets down.” A semifinal loss to Petra Kvitova in Doha in February was the last match she played in 2020; Barty stayed home in Australia for the balance of the season when the global pandemic emerged. After six months on the road in 2021 and after winning five titles, including at Wimbledon, Barty ended her season abruptly after a loss to Shelby Rogers at the U.S. Open. “Wimbledon last year changed a lot for me as a person and for me as an athlete,” Barty said. “When you work so hard your whole life for one goal — to be able to win Wimbledon, which was my dream, the one true dream that I wanted in tennis, that really changed my perspective.\" She described what she termed a “gut feeling” after Wimbledon about maybe being ready to move on, but she also described herself then as not “quite fulfilled.\" Her victory at the Australian Open satisfied another gap, and Barty said she was completely aware that \"my happiness wasn’t dependent on the results.” Barty was one of the most popular players on tour, and many praised her in retirement on Wednesday. “Ash, what can I say, you know I have tears right?\" tweeted Simona Halep. “My friend, I will miss you on tour. You were different, and special, and we shared some amazing moments . . . Be happy and enjoy your life to the max.\" Madision Keys posted: “An incredible tennis player but more importantly one of the nicest people on tour.\" Alicia Molik, coach of Australia's Billie Jean King Cup team, said Barty’s decision was ”unusual, retiring at the top.” “It’s pretty gutsy, it’s pretty noble,” Molik said. “What an athlete, what a trailblazer and what a role model.” Andy Murray tweeted: “Happy for (at) ashbarty, gutted for tennis, what a player.” Barty’s closing words, at least for now — she plans a media conference in Brisbane on Thursday — came at the end of the video. “I’ll never, ever, ever stop loving tennis,” she said. “It will always be a massive part of my life but now I think it’s important I get to enjoy the next phase of my life as Ash Barty the person, not Ash Barty the athlete.”","pubDate":"2022-03-23 15:39:53","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2022/03/AP22082083401663.jpg?w=900","source_id":"wfla","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"South Africa vs Bangladesh, 3rd ODI, Bangladesh tour of South Africa, 2022 - Cricbuzz","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbS5jcmljYnV6ei5jb20vY3JpY2tldC1jb21tZW50YXJ5LzM4NDQxL3Rhc2tpbi1iYWdzLWZpdmUtYXMtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLWZvbGQtZm9yLTE1NNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa vs Bangladesh, 3rd ODI, Bangladesh tour of South Africa, 2022  CricbuzzLive commentary 3rd ODI South Africa v Bangladesh  Eyewitness NewsMatch Preview - South Africa vs Bangladesh, Bangladesh in South Africa 2021/22, 3rd ODI  ESPNcricinfoBangladesh dream of historic triumph | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzSA vs BAN Prediction, Who Will Win the Match Between South Africa vs Bangladesh, South Africa vs Bangladesh, 3rd ODI  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-23 14:02:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SA vs BAN: South Africa cricket player Zubayr Hamza positive for banned drug","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/sa-vs-ban-south-africa-cricket-player-zubayr-hamza-positive-for-banned-drug-2022-03-23-765636","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa batsman Zubayr Hamza has tested positive for the banned diuretic Furosemide, the country's cricket federation said Wednesday.

Hamza tested positive following a doping test on Jan. 17, CSA said. He went on to play for South Africa in the first test in New Zealand last month.

This decision is no different.Even in a sport with an impossibly high threshold for dramatic flourish, tennis outdid itself Tuesday night with the announcement that the WTA Tour’s No. 1 player, Australia’s Ash Barty, was retiring at age 25. As far as athletes conforming to the cliché and “going out on top,” you’re unlikely to find a more stark example. Barty not only sits atop the WTA rankings; she is weeks removed from winning the most recent major, the 2022 Australian Open. And did so without dropping a set. And she has won 25 of her last 26 matches. And at age 25, she was—and still is—in the meaty prime of her career, this in a sport where Serena Williams and Venus Williams are still active in their 40s.But here’s the truth: while the Australian media has already described this as a “shock announcement,” it is anything but. Even as Barty was dominating the Australian Open in January, rumors whipped through the players’ lounge that she might gather the trophy and mic-drop retire. Here was a player who had already previously retired as a teenager, mostly for the simple reason that tennis no longer held joy for her. (After a year that, famously, included a stint playing cricket, Barty returned to tennis rejuvenated.) Here was a player who spoke openly about both the hardship that COVID-19 travel restrictions had placed on her mental health and her desire to start a family. If you were scripting endings, what would be more climactic than a prototype fair dinkum Aussie winning her country’s major—the first homegrown champ in more than 40 years to do so—and exiting gracefully? Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY Sports Barty’s career will be recalled for her three major titles—French Open 2019; Wimbledon 2021; Australian Open 2021. For the 114 consecutive weeks she spent at No. 1, the fourth-highest streak in WTA history. For the 15 overall titles in singles. The dozen titles in doubles. But those are just the Wikipedia-style entries.But within tennis and among her peers, Barty stood for more: something resembling a blazing authenticity. Last year, a GIF made the rounds of Barty cheering like mad at an Aussie rules football game. For all the jokes about her fist-bumping and drinking beer and being an archetypal Aussie, here’s what was lost: she was sitting in the crowd. Not in the suites.Even at the peak of her powers, Barty wanted nothing to do with the celebrity trappings of tennis. She would rather be home than filming a commercial or attending a premiere. So she went home. She would rather not put her life on display to the world on Instagram or lend her name to a product she would never use. So she didn’t. She wearied of the travel that, even outside of COVID Times, usually entailed crossing an ocean to play. So she scheduled accordingly.She is a few weeks from turning 26, and, inevitably, this announcement will trigger speculation about the odds of her reversing this decision and “unretiring,” much as she did as a teenager.

The world number one is the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champions, while she has also won the French Open over her career, but decided the time was right to step away from the sport. Barty has faced no trouble in getting to the Australian Open finalGetty No player on the women’s tour has really come close to Barty’s level over the last 12 months and her retirement came as a huge shock. “Wimbledon last year changed a lot for me as a person and for me as an athlete when you work so hard your whole life for one goal, and I’ve been able to share that with so many incredible people,” she said. “But to be able to win Wimbledon, which was my dream, my one true dream that I wanted in tennis, that really changed my perspective.” The life as a professional on the tennis tour can be a brutal one, and problems only got worse at the height of the pandemic. Barty particularly spent months on end away from home with Australia having some of the strictest travel conditions around the globe. Barty leaves the world of tennis at its summitAFP She bowed out at the top of the sport, winning her home Grand Slam of the Australian Open in January. Barty followed in the footsteps of greats like Evonne Goolagong and Margaret Court, who dominated in the 1960s and 1980s, and will rightly take her place alongside them. Goolagong has particularly provided inspiration to Barty over the years and it will be a proud moment for indigenous Australians all over the country. Barty has Ngarigo ancestry through her father’s side and she regularly speaks about her heritage and what it means to her. During the Australian Open, she said: “I’m a very, very proud indigenous woman. I love my heritage. It’s what connects me to all of you here today. It’s what connects me to the land.” On Goolagong, she added: “We’re connected through our heritage and she’s paved a path for so many Indigenous youth coming up, both in her career and also in her work off the court.” The 25-year-old had been able to dominate any player in the world on the court and her fun personality makes her a popular figure, not just in Australia but the wider world.

But just as her career was still in its fledgling stages, she decided to take a break from tennis in 2014 and took up professional cricket. “It was too much too quickly for me as I’ve been travelling from quite a young age,” Barty later admitted. “I wanted to experience life as a normal teenaged girl and have some normal experiences.” Although she had no competitive cricket experience, she showed what an incredibly talented sportswoman she is. Barty played professional cricket during her break from tennisGetty She played in the inaugural Women’s Big Bash League for Brisbane Heat, and impressed in several matches for the team. Just to give you some idea of her ridiculous sporting talent, she also has a golf handicap of 3.9. By 2016, the lure of tennis pulled her back in and she returned to the WTA Tour and quickly started climbing the rankings. She won the US Open in doubles in 2018, before going on to win her first Grand Slam the following year before COVID-19 hit and derailed things. The world number one decided to take the rest of 2020 off after tennis had been called to a halt, due to concerns about global travel amid the pandemic. The Barty story is inspirational to so manyGetty She made her return in 2021 to win Wimbledon as she made up for the time she missed.
