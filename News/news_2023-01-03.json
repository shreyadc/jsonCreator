Here are some of the moves that have turned Saudi Arabia into a major player in sports: Saudi Arabia, a mostly desert country where summer temperatures touch 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), raised eyebrows in October when it was chosen to host the 2029 Asian Winter Games. Saudi Arabia was chosen to host the 2029 Asian Winter Games at NEOM, an under-construction $500 billion futuristic desert megacity © The event, which has already earned the wrath of environmental campaigners, will be held at NEOM, an under-construction $500 billion megacity that is planning a year-round winter sports complex. Five years later, the capital Riyadh will put on the 2034 Asian Games, an Olympic-style multi-sports event. Hosting an Olympics is the kingdom’s “ultimate goal”, Sports Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal told AFP in August.

It is one of four grands prix to be held in the wealthy Gulf this year. Last year’s edition was overshadowed by an attack by Huthi rebels from Yemen, Saudi’s war-torn neighbour, that left oil facilities belching black smoke within sight of the circuit during practice sessions. Newcastle United fans celebrated the club’s takeover by a consortium led by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund © In October 2021, well before the swoop for Ronaldo, a Saudi-funded consortium completed its takeover of English Premier League club Newcastle United following a protracted wrangle with regulators. Fans of the “sleeping giant”, who had been at odds with the previous owner for years, celebrated by donning Arab headdresses at St. James’s Park stadium. Newcastle have enjoyed a rise in fortunes and currently lie third in the table. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia, which will host the 2027 Asian Cup and hopes to hold the women’s edition in 2026, has held talks with Egypt and Greece about a joint World Cup bid, according to officials.

Despite enraging golf’s establishment, LIV will expand its 54-hole, part-team format this year with a 14-tournament international schedule offering a record $405 million in prize money.

We’ve had our issues with Cricket Australia, and we’ve reset,” he said.“There were challenging times, there’s no doubt about it, but our love for the sport and love for cricket (helped us get past it). Our strategy was to build a suite of Australia‘s premier sports across 52 weeks of the year.“That’s in the past. Credit to Nick and our team because we actually realised that we’re the right fit and this is a great game.“I just had a wonderful call with Bruce McAvaney who believes we’re on the cusp of a golden era of cricket and that we’re heading towards ‘the Invincibles’.“They were challenging times, but we’ve become stronger because of it.”Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley confirmed they’d spent millions of dollars in legal costs last year but described the new deal as a “great reset to the relationship” after what was said last year.“I think I’ve said previously that some of those comments were disappointing. But we’ve moved on beyond that,” he said.“Today draws an end to all of that and we’re moving forward. We’ve reached a relationship and all of those legal proceedings have been put to bed.”","pubDate":"2023-01-03

The team was missing some core players for their 1st engagement to Namibia early in 2022 with players such as Phiona Khulume, Sarah Akiteng, Susan Kakai, Shakira Shadiq, and Leona Babirye a shot at international cricket. Victoria Pearls were humbled in the Tri-Nation Series that had Namibia and Zimbabwe losing all their five games in the tournament. However, positives were picked by the team with Phiona Khulume and Sarah Akiteng making an impression while Janet Mbabazi finally came of age and stood up for the team in some crunch moments. The team then toured Asia for the first time with a trip to Nepal for 5 T20i matches. Nepal is ranked higher than Uganda in the global rankings but once bat met ball, the Ugandans won 3 games on the bounce. The series win healed some wounds from Namibia with Uganda climbing back to 19th from 21st in the World rankings. Janet Mbabazi had some grand all-rounder performances which earned her the MVP title from the series. Uganda made a return to the Kwibuka after missing 2021 due to Covid and two losses to Tanzania and Kenya in the groups hurt their chances of making the finals and eventually having to settle for a 3rd place finish. The end of year four-nation tournament in Nairobi saw the girls win their second silverware in the year. The Victoria Pearls getting some revenge over neighbours Kenya and Tanzania enroute to the title. Janet Mbabazi had another fine all-round performance that saw her win the Player of the tournament award. The return of Immaculate Nakisuyi, Stephanie Nampiina, Irene Alumo, Proscovia Alako and Esther Iloku boasted the squad as they prepare for a defining 2023. In 2023, Victoria Pearls will make a maiden appearance at the All Africa Games in Ghana in August and the all-important 2024 T20 World Cup qualifiers that will be held in June. The experience gained by new players such as Khulume and Akiteng plus the form of Mbabazi makes the Victoria Pearls are more improved side with the experience of Nakisuyi and Alumo. Victoria Pearls’ captain Consy Aweko finished 2022 as the highest wicket-taker in Women’s Cricket with 40 scalps. Aweko is very quiet customer who does all the talking with the ball and has grown into the leadership role having taken over a broken team. The heroics of 2017 when they were crowned African queens and qualified for the global event are still very fresh in the memory of the team and 2023 might be the year for some deja vu.

From 226-1 at tea, the visitors slumped to 309-6 by stumps, losing a perfect platform on a wicket that failed to portend what was to follow. For the second straight test, Devon Conway and Tom Latham put on a century partnership for the opening wicket, following their 184 from the first test with a smooth 134 that rarely looked troubled. Kane Williamson joined Conway to see the opener through to his fourth test century as the pair added a further 100, before it all unravelled, with New Zealand losing five wickets for 45 runs and bringing Pakistan right back into the test. The early signs were ominous only for Pakistan. In contrast to New Zealand’s triple-spin attack – their only change seeing Matt Henry replace Neil Wagner - Pakistan strangely opted for an extra seamer, with quicks Hasan Ali and Naseem Shah coming in for spinner Nauman Ali and seamer Mohammad Wasim. Then, their star spinner Abrar Ahmed was tonked all over the park by Latham and Conway, conceding 67 from his first 11 overs as New Zealand cruised to lunch at 119-0, barely having offered a chance. Devon Conway celebrates his century. Photo / AP Pakistan stuck at it though, and got their breakthroughs from likely and unlikely sources. The return of Naseem was a key addition to their bowling stocks after poor showings from their seamers in the first test, and he looked dangerous after a so-so first session, trapping Latham lbw for 71 and having Williamson caught behind for 36 with a ball on a perfect line. In between, Agha Salman showed he is more than a part-time spin option, as despite coming into the test with a bowling average of 114, he got the key wicket of Conway. Conway strengthened the case that he should be the permanent opener with a classy 122, but after lunch he started to offer chances with two nicks just evading fielders, and eventually Salman lured him into fishing at a ball outside off that turned away. That was where the rot kicked in, with Salman also removing Daryl Mitchell (3), bowled between bat and pad, while Henry Nicholls tried to cut the tweaker and feathered an edge behind for 26. Abrar came back after his morning pasting and trapped Michael Bracewell lbw for a second ball duck, and only some late resistance from Tom Blundell (30no) and Ish Sodhi (11no) spared further blushes. More fight from the tail order will be needed on day two in order to reach a competitive total on a wicket that while greener than the first test, still offers more to batsmen than bowlers.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-02 21:39:00","image_url":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/yy4ls0u5/daryl-mitchell-black-caps-poor-final-session.jfif","source_id":"newstalkzb","country":["new zealand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England shatter 112-year Test cricket record in historic 2022","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/england-shatter-112year-test-cricket-record-in-historic-2022/news-story/dd85f67848f3e88beaa419dd4b998ae9","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England have smashed the Test cricket record books in 2022 with an out of this world display.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-02 21:23:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Reliance firm invests $11.2 million in South Africa and UAE T20 teams","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/reliance-firm-invests-11-2-million-in-south-africa-and-uae-t20-teams/articleshow/96691597.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa-incorporated India Mumbai Indians Pvt Ltd owns the Cape Town franchise in SA20, the franchise-based T20 league launched by Cricket South Africa.

This time it is being said that BCCI is responsible for this problem and this could be a new headache for the franchise teams. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is taking the 50-over World Cup series to be held in India in October and November very seriously. BCCI has prepared a proposed list of around 20 players to prepare for this series. It has been reported that players in this list will be given opportunities and evaluated in international cricket series on a rotational basis. This is apparently a decision taken at a review meeting attended by BCCI president Roger Binny and key executives. Apart from that, it seems that only the players who pass tests like yo-yo test and Texa scan to ensure the fitness of the players will get a chance in the team. Last year, the main players of the Indian team missed the main series due to injuries. This decision has been taken keeping that in mind. In this case, it seems that BCCI has taken into consideration the workload of the main Indian players participating in IPL cricket. So the National Cricket Academy along with the franchises are monitoring these players. Through this, the fitness, stress and workload of the players during the IPL season will be monitored and plans will be made accordingly. However, it seems that no proper information has been given to the franchises by the BCCI. There seems to be more focus on the bowlers than the batsmen in this regard. In the 2021-22 season alone, 70 players have approached the National Cricket Academy due to injury. It is noteworthy that 23 of them are players who have been placed in the senior men’s team. அன்பு வாசகர்களே.... இந்த ஊரடங்கு காலத்தில் வீட்டை விட்டு வெளியே வராமல் நமக்கு நாமே சமூக விலகல் ( Social Distancing) செய்து கொள்வோம். செய்தி ஊடகங்களின் வழியே உலகுடன் தொடர்பில் இருப்போம். பொதுவெளியில் இருந்து தனிமைப்படுத்திக் கொண்டு கரோனா பரவலைத் தடுப்பதில் நம் பங்கை முழுமையாக இந்த சமூகத்துக்கு அளிப்போம்.

Incidentally, India's last ODI World Cup title came in 2011 at home. As per a report in Cricbuzz, the BCCI has shortlisted 20 players who will be on the radar and will be rotated for proper preparation for the ODI World Cup 2023. \"It was a very constructive and fruitful meeting where we reviewed the past performance and planned for future events, including World Cup and World Test Championship (WTC).\" \"We will give preference for international cricket while making sure the IPL is not diluted,\" a BCCI source, who attended the meeting, was quoted as saying in the report. BCCI added in its official statement that keeping in mind the Men's FTP and preparations for ICC CWC 2023, the National Cricket Academy (NCA) will work in tandem with the IPL franchisees to monitor the targeted Indian players participating in the IPL 2023. Apart from this, the emerging players will have to play a substantial domestic season to be eligible for selection to the national team. The meeting was held ahead of the white-ball series against Sri Lanka, which begins on January 3 in Mumbai. It was in the process of being held after England thrashed India by ten wickets in the Men's T20 World Cup semifinals, which extended their winless run in ICC events since 2013 when they won the Champions Trophy under M.S. Dhoni's captaincy. The meeting was attended by BCCI President Roger Binny, Honorary Secretary Jay Shah, Captain Rohit Sharma, head coach Rahul Dravid, Head of Cricket (NCA) V.V.S. Laxman and Chairman of Senior Men Selection Committee Chetan Sharma, whose panel was sacked in November.

Brisbane had rode on knocks from Josh Brown (62) and McSweeney (84) to post a mammoth 224 on board, and in reply, the Sixers endured a tough time despite a promising start.Silk had reached 41 inside just 22 deliveries, and had hit three fours and two sixes. Silk was facing Mark Steketee in the second ball of the 19th over, and the batter had looked to go big again, only to find Neser at long off. However, one cannot say it was a straightforward catch and it has certainly divided opinions.What actually happened?Sydney Sixers’ Jordan Silk tried to clear the boundary ropes, but he found Neser with the catch at long-off. It was neither easy nor straightforward, as Neser caught the ball inside the boundary rope, but as he realised he would cross the playing area, and Neser tossed the ball up.Neser’s release of the ball, however, meant that the ball went a bit much over the fence, and after crossing the fence, Neser threw the ball in the air, with no part of his body making contact with the ground, and the 32-year-old sealed the catch inside the playing area in a calm manner.How has the cricketing fraternity reacted?The cricketing fraternity seems divided on this controversial incident. Former Australia wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist said Neser showed a ‘brilliant’ sense of awareness. “I’ll put my hand up and say brilliant umpiring and a brilliant sense of game awareness by Michael Neser for him to know that rule,” Gilchrist was quoted as saying on Fox Cricket.“In this modern day, we shouldn’t be surprised, but we are continually surprised by how brilliant they are. They practice so much, and the fielders are learning all those intricate little rules,” he added.“It’s out … as long as when he threw it up the second time his feet were in the air,” Glenn Maxwell, commentating on 7Cricket, said on air.“Effectively he could throw it up 300 times as long as his feet were in the air,” he added.Australian cricketer Marcus North, however, questioned the decision to give it out. “If this is within the rules of cricket then they need to change. No way that should be out. What’s the point of the boundary,” he tweeted.If this is within the rules of cricket then they need to change. No way that should be out.

Might as well keep hopping down the road to Caxton street throwing the ball up in the air. That’s just a bad rule #BBL12,” Australian cricketer Cameron Boyce tweeted.Probs need to change that eh @BBL Seriously. Might as well keep hopping down the road to Caxton street throwing the ball up in the air. That’s just a bad rule #BBL12— Cameron Boyce (@CaJBoyce) January 1, 2023England cricketer Kate Cross was also critical of the verdict, tweeting: “I don’t understand how this has been given out,”.I don’t understand how this has been given out 🤯 https://t.co/ylUKGitwOK— Kate Cross (@katecross16) January 1, 2023What is the official rule?In Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)’s rules, Law 19.5.2 states: “A fielder who is not in contact with the ground is considered to be grounded beyond the boundary if his/her final contact with the ground, before his/her first contact with the ball after it has been delivered by the bowler, was not entirely within the boundary.”As far as the fielder’s first touch of the ball is inside the boundary, they are encouraged to take the catch as they wish to do so, given that the fielders’ feet are not grounded with the ball beyond the boundary.Since Neser’s initial contact with the ball, timing of the jump and completion of the catch were all within the laws of the game, the batter was eventually declared out.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The star batter was driving from Delhi to Roorkee to mark the new year with his family. While driving near Mohammedpur Jat, his four-wheeler collided with a divider at around 5:30 am. The crash was so intense that the tumbled to the other side of the road, leaving Pant trapped inside it.Then, the cricketer had to break the windshield to get out as the vehicle caught fire. The news of Pant’s accident unquestionably shocked the Indian cricket fraternity. A number of former and present cricketers wished the 25-year-old a speedy recovery.On the day of the accident, Pant’s fellow gloveman Ishan Kishan was playing a Ranji Trophy match for Jharkhand against Railways. During the drinks break, Kishan was interacting with some fans gathered at the boundary line, when he got to hear the news. A clip of the incident has widely been shared across social media.When Ishan kishan came to meet fans during the drinks break,he was so generous&humble. See his reaction on knowing rishabh pants’s car accident. #keenanstadium #jhvsser @ishankishan51 @BCCI @RishabhPant17 @nistula @akhileshsharma1 pic.twitter.com/3uNLnEDRiX— Avishkar (@twstopsfreespch) December 30, 2022 In the footage, Kishan can be spotted coming hurriedly toward the fans who were waiting to snap photographs with him. The Jharkhand batter, who is quite recognised for his humble behaviour, went on to fulfil the crowd’s wish and continued taking selfies with everyone. In between the photo session, a person broke the news of Pant’s accident. Kishan, who had no clue about it, was evidently shocked. He took a small pause and asked, “What are you saying?” Then the fans informed him about Pant’s injuries. They also requested Kishan to focus on the game.According to his X-ray and CT scan reports, Pant did not suffer any fractures, brain or spinal injuries. However, a ligament tear in his knee will undoubtedly keep him out of the game for a long time. It could take anywhere from two to six months depending on the severity of the tear, as per reports. He will be brought back to Mumbai where BCCI physio Dinshaw Pardiwala will take care of the remaining treatment.Amid this scenario, Kishan could be the first-choice wicketkeeper for India in the limited-over format thanks to his swashbuckling form in recent times. The 24-year-old southpaw recently smashed a double century in the second ODI during the Bangladesh tour. However, there is still a concern regarding the wicketkeeper’s post in the upcoming major Test series against Australia. Besides Kishan, KS Bharat and India A’s second keeper Upendra Yadav are up in the race.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

At the Boxing Day Test in the MCG, South Africa were thrashed by an innings and 182 runs by a rampant Australian team, making it the first time since 2005/06 that the Proteas didn't win a Test series in the country.It is also South Africa's second successive Test series loss after 1-2 defeat to England in August-September. They will now play for pride in the third and final Test at Sydney starting from January 4. \"While South Africa's bowling attack possesses real ability, their wicket-taking capability could be drastically improved. And they are handicapped by their side's poor batting. A team that is repeatedly provided with low scores and has to regularly be back bowling after yet another failure by their batting side finds its strength sapping and morale dropping.\" \"There is also the matter of captaincy. Anrich Nortje aside, the rest of the attack could have performed better in Australia with improved leadership. Elgar, like many of his fellow international leaders, is not well versed in captaincy on Australian pitches.\" \"The bowlers must first understand that producing the odd really good ball interspersed with some deliveries that can be dispatched won't win much in Australia. Bowlers have to keep producing good deliveries to talented batters and their demeanour has to alert opponents to their wicket-taking desire,\" wrote Chappell in his column for ESPNCricinfo on Sunday. Though Kagiso Rabada has taken ten wickets, Anrich Nortje has been the most impressive South Africa pacer, troubling the Australian batters with his quick pace while taking five wickets in the process. Chappell remarked Nortje is a better bet than Lungi Ngidi to be opening the bowling with Rabada and picking wickets with the new ball.
