Brimming high in confidence and self-belief, the Mohammad Nabi-led Afghanistan side will take on Bangladesh in the second ‚ÄòGroup B‚Äô match of the ongoing Asia Cup 2022 , at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium today. The Afghans nailed pretty much every aspect of their game during the Asia Cup 2022 opener versus Sri Lanka, as they decimated them by 8 wickets a couple of days ago. While the new ball fast-bowlers punctured the Sri Lankan top-order within the Powerplay itself, the experienced spin-bowling trio of Mujeeb, Rashid, and Nabi were up to the task during the middle Overs, to restrict them to just over the 100-run mark while batting first. In reply, the opening batting pair of Hazratullah Zazai and Rahmanullah Gurbaz nailed the chase with aggression and finesse in mere 10.1 Overs, to come up with a statement of sorts. Bangladesh, on the other hand, have very little good memories worth cherishing in the T20 format for some time now. During their previous four T20I series since last year, not once have they ended up as the series winners, while playing against the likes of Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, West Indies, and Pakistan in the period.

Although the relatively smaller boundary dimensions in this venue, present the batters with a wonderful opportunity to clear the fence, the average score across the 25 T20Is here since 2013 has been mere 146.6 runs. In the past one year, spinners have trumped the pacers in terms of average, strike rate, and the economy rate. Thus, akin the first match of Asia Cup 2022, the Afghan experienced spin-bowling trio might well come into the game right from the get-go, while Bangladesh‚Äôs Shakib-al-Hasan and Mahedi Hasan will also pose a threat. All in all, the pitch at Sharjah today, is likely to assist the bowlers more than the batters.","pubDate":"2022-08-29 18:36:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rashid Khan pleads for more opportunities for Afghanistan cricket","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/international/rashid-khan-pleads-for-more-opportunities-for-afghanistan-cricket-7cee56bf-5a67-453c-b5ef-5db852b0ad2f","keywords":null,"creator":["AFP"],"video_url":null,"description":"Rashid remains the brightest star in a galaxy of talented players many of whom have seen dark days in the war-torn nation, which witnessed another takeover by the Taliban last year.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-29 17:29:28","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/9d5e4085-ded3-531b-80e8-e6aa996efde6&operation=CROP&offset=0x30&resize=1280x720","source_id":"iol","country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄúI have a huge fan base in India‚Äù: Shoaib Akhtar schools Indian journalist post her attempt to draw adverse reactions from him regarding former Indian cricketers","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-i-have-a-huge-fan-base-in-india-shoaib-akhtar-schools-indian-journalist-post-her-attempt-to-draw-adverse-reactions-from-him-regarding-former-indian-cricketers/","keywords":["Cricket","India","Pakistan","Shoaib Akhtar"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Shoaib Akhtar schools Indian journalist as latter‚Äôs attempt to fuel unwarranted tension between him and former India players take a backseat.

A cricket match between arch-rivals India and Pakistan manage to attract eyeballs of even those in both the countries not interested in watching/following the sport at all. The two major reasons for it being such a big hit is because: 1) Barring the previous few encounters, the India-Pakistan matches generally go down to the wire, making people restless on the edge of their seats, and 2) The jingoistic fervour which unwarrantedly equates a mere game of Cricket to a war-like situation, backed by the ever-rising political tensions between the two countries for more than seven decades now. As India and Pakistan geared for their first match of the ongoing Asia Cup 2022 yesterday, the media houses from both sides of the border commenced with their leg-pulling and mudslinging of former Cricketers from their rival nations, despite inviting them as part of their guest panel. An Indian journalist named Aditi Tyagi from ‚ÄòZee News‚Äô attempted to draw an adverse reaction from the former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar, who was invited to the channel‚Äôs programme ahead of the India-Pakistan clash which took place on Sunday. Tyagi referred to a statement made by former India batter Virender Sehwag, where the latter was referring to a previous incident from his playing days, when he had allegedly hurt Akhtar with an unavoidable comment.

The 47-year-old initially admitted to have enquired Sehwag and even Gautam Gambhir regarding the aforementioned claim made by the former, which, as per him, were denied by both the former Indian openers explicitly. However, instead of clinging to the nauseating bait, Akhtar gracefully schooled the anchor by stating that he has huge respect for the Indian team and he in fact has a decent Indian fan following as well. Thus, he would not only like to be respected by the anchor, but would also not wish to speak something which would escalate the differences between the two countries.

During Netflix's Films Day event in Mumbai, the streaming service shared a behind-the-scenes video of the sports drama and a special message from the lead star. In the video message, Sharma said she is in the UK training hard for the movie, in which she plays Goswami. \"Hi, I am Anushka Sharma, currently training at a cricket ground in Leeds in the United Kingdom for a very special film, called 'Chakda Xpress'. I am playing a role inspired by the life and times of the legendary pacer and former Indian captain Jhulan Goswami. \"I was absolutely blown away by the script, it was an eye-opener for me into the world of women's cricket as I am sure it will be for you all as well,\" the 34-year-old actor said.

Sharma said she is looking forward to the film's release. \"I am sorry I couldn't be there personally to present this film. But here we are so that we can bring you this soon.

Several Congress leaders slammed Jay Shah, who is Union Home Minister Amit Shah's son. Tagging the video footage of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) appearing to turn down an offer to wave the flag, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh tweeted in Hindi: \"I have papa, keep the tricolour with you.\" Congress leader Ajoy Kumar also tweeted the footage and wrote in Hindi: \"Looks like the tricolour was of 'Khadi'... not of 'polyester'!\" The Congress has been strongly criticising an amendment of the flag code under which the national flag can now be made of polyester and with the help of machines. Tagging the video, Trinamool Congress (TMC) general secretary Abhishek Banerjee tweeted: \"The prodigal prince knows not of national pride. Jay Shah not wanting to hold the national flag is symptomatic of the larger hypocrisy of the ruling dispensation. They indulge in theatrics, lack values. Excel in jumlas, lack patriotism.\" Commenting on the video, TMC leader Derek O'Brien said: \"Dear Amit Shah, please tell the nation whether this act infuriates you? Whether the act hurts your nationalistic sentiments? Or, will this act be forgiven only because he's your son?\" \"We are not looking for excuses. We are looking for concrete answers. Sincerely, an angry Indian,\" he said. TMC spokesperson Saket Gokhale said the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has argued that Jay Shah did not hold the tricolour on Sunday night because he was there as the ACC president and was following protocol. \"The same BJP hounded former VP Hamid Ansari when he (correctly by protocol) didn't salute the flag during Republic Day parade as he wasn't wearing headgear,\" Gokhale said. Hardik Pandya came up with a special all-round effort as India held their nerves to pull off an exciting five-wicket win over Pakistan in the match.

After India‚Äôs emphatic win over Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2022, all-rounder Hardik Pandya has been gaining a lot of praise from around the world for his terrific performance in the match. He scalped 3 wickets by conceding just 25 runs, whereas he scored 33 runs in 17 balls at a strike-rate of 194.12. Chasing the target of 148 runs, the Indian batting had a mini-collapse in between, but Hardik kept his calm and sealed the game for India. He was awarded the player of the match award for his brilliant performance with both bat and the ball. Hardik Pandya kept his nerves when India needed 6 runs in the last three balls, and smashed a six in the next ball to seal the game for the Indian team. Former Indian batter Robin Uthappa has compared Hardik‚Äôs ability with former Indian captain MS Dhoni, who was the most reliable finisher of the Indian team. Uthappa said that Hardis is trying to emulate MS Dhoni as both of them are really good friends, and he has often said that he looks up to MS Dhoni. He also said that if Hardik continues to play like this, he can even play a leadership role in the Indian team in the future. We fought. We fought real hard!

On this day, the Government of India is taking steps to recognize the heroes of the field who are bringing pride to India internationally, give them awards and encourage them, and introduce sports-related programs on this special day. In 2018, the announcement of ‚ÄòKhelo India‚Äô was made on this same day. Who is Dayan Chand? ‚Äì Born on 29 August 1905 in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. An incredible player who dominated hockey even when India was under British rule. He helped the Indian hockey team win a hat-trick of gold medals in 1928, 1932 and 1936 Olympics. He practiced hockey under the moonlight at night while serving in the British Army. Hence his original name Dayan Singh has changed to Dayan Chand. The moon is called Chand in Hindi. He played in the Indian hockey team from 1926 to 1949. He played 185 matches for the country and scored 570 goals. National Sports Awards: Major Dayan Chand Khel Ratna (earlier known as Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna) Arjuna Award, Dayan Chand Award, Dronacharya Award etc. are awarded to sportspersons on this day. Indian sports on the path to progress: Indian sportspersons are leaving their footprints deep at the global level. Not only hockey and cricket, Indian players and players have achieved success in various sports in the last decade. India has excelled in many sports like Boxing, Fencing, Archery, Volleyball, Wrestling, Women‚Äôs Cricket, Badminton, Table Tennis, Weightlifting, Athletics, Judo, Squash, Chess, Swimming, Golf, Lawn Bowls. This is mainly due to the fact that the government has established and developed sports-related infrastructure in the country and launched special projects. Through the ‚ÄòTarget Olympic Podium‚Äô program, the government is identifying talented athletes and providing them with everything from special training and diet. In this program foreign coaches are hired and the players are given special training. Inspire Institute of Sports (IIS): Not only the efforts of the government but also the efforts of private organizations is a reason for this. Inspire Institute of Sports is one of them. JSW management is running this training center. This is a private training center providing training to athletes in India. It has also been approved by the Sports Development Authority of India. IIS helps athletes in athletics, boxing, judo, swimming and wrestling. Promotional League Series: League series are being conducted for various sports in India for commercial purposes. However, it also helps identify talented players at the grassroots level. League series are conducted in India for sports like Cricket, Football, Kabaddi, Badminton, Table Tennis, Go-Go. It is noteworthy that league series are being conducted at the state level for some of these sports. Through this, the players who have proved their ability are also playing for the country in the international arena. The Government of Tamil Nadu has also announced various announcements related to the sports sector and related schemes. All these have been carried out depending on the development of Indian sports. We hope that through this, India‚Äôs flag will fly higher internationally.

The emergence of Cameron Green in the Australian ODI setup has given the side a much-needed balance. Green scalped a fifer in the first ODI against Zimbabwe, whereas his ability to bat at the number 8 position has also increased the batting options of the side. The aim of Australia will be to repeat the heroics of the 2015 World Cup in the next 2023 World Cup. Australia‚Äôs approach is clear for the world cup next year that they will rely on their all-rounders as the team will have 8 batting and 7 bowling options in their playing eleven. Glenn Maxwell wishes to repeat England‚Äôs template in the 2023 World Cup Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has said that they want to use England‚Äôs all-rounder-heavy approach in the upcoming T20 World Cup. In 2019, England won the World Cup by beating New Zealand in the final of the tournament. The main USP of the team was the ability to bat deep. Ben Stokes, Chis Woakes and Moeen Ali were the all-rounders, whereas bowlers like Jofra Archer and Liam Plunkett were well versed with the bat. Australia also wants to use the same template with all-rounders like Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell and Cameron Green in playing 11. Glenn Maxwell believes that they want to use the same model of England, and this can give them success as well considering the quality of players they have in their ranks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen the success England have had in the one-day format by batting down to 10 and 11,‚Äù Maxwell said. ‚ÄúAnd having their bowlers as good options with the bat.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn 2015 we probably set the standard of what a one-day side structure looked like and a lot of teams started to copy.‚Äù ‚ÄúEngland are now that benchmark that we‚Äôre sort of working towards.‚Äù What a way to win it!

Hardik first took three wickets, and then he played a match-winning knock of 33 runs of just 17 balls to take India over the line with two balls to spare.

Adelaide Strikers retained Rashid Khan, whereas they also signed New Zealand‚Äôs all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme and English batter Adam Hose. Adelaide Strikers coach Jason Gillespie has said that the availability of the players has played a huge role in deciding his picks in the draft. de Grandhomme was a surprise pick as he was not a part of the draft list initially. He has scored 3817 T20 runs at a strike-rate of 157.92, whereas he has scalped 69 wickets in bowling.

It is interesting that de Grandhomme was not even in the final list of the BBL player‚Äôs draft, but according to ESPN Cricinfo, he has give his name at the very last time. The Blackcaps will tour Pakistan in December, and the schedule will collide with the BBL as well. If de Grandhomme gets selected, he will have to go to Pakistan, whereas even if he does not gets selected, he will require a NOC from the board to take part in the competition.

They‚Äôre the rarest commodity in cricket history.‚ÄúHe has the ability to reshape Australian cricket in his own self-effacing modest, don‚Äôt look at me sort of way.‚ÄùBefore the series opener in Queensland, Green had underwhelming career figures of 1/169 in seven one-day internationals.Best ODI bowling figures by an Australian against Zimbabwe5/22 ‚Äî Brad Williams at Sydney, Jan 20045/32 ‚Äî Jason Gillespie at Harare, May 20045/33 ‚Äî Cameron Green at Townsville, Aug 2022‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of potential there, we notice it in the change rooms as we watch him go about his business,‚Äù Australian teammate Glenn Maxwell said.‚ÄúYou face him at training, you watch him bat ‚Ä¶ the day before I arrived the boys were talking about how he batted in the centre wicket on a spicy pitch that was doing a bit of everything.‚ÄúAll the rest of the top order said they nicked and nudged it around while he went in there and started smacking them and was pretty brutal on some of our bowlers.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a lot of potential and a lot of skill ‚Äî talent ‚Äî and it helps being six foot ten or whatever he is. He‚Äôs enormous, he bowls a heavy ball, bats beautifully and was probably the best move in the field in that XI today.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an exciting package when you look at it, but you don‚Äôt want to overburden him right now.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a lot of cricket ahead of him, we don‚Äôt want to burn him out at this stage of his career.‚ÄùAlthough Green walked away with a bag of wickets, leg-spinner Adam Zampa was undeniably the pick of the Australian bowlers on Sunday, finishing with 3/57 from his 10 overs.The talented tweaker, who missed the recent white-ball tour of Sri Lanka due to the birth of his first child, dismissed Zimbabwe opener Tadiwanashe Marumani (45 off 61 balls) and No. 3 batter Wessly Madhevere (72 off balls) to stem the flow of runs in the middle overs.Since the start of 2020, Zampa has taken 41 ODI wickets at 23.60 to cement his status as Australia‚Äôs best white-ball spinner.After a promising start, Zimbabwe lost 6/15 in a dire collapse at the death to be bowled out in the 48th over.‚ÄúThe wheels fell off at the end,‚Äù former Zimbabwe seamer Ed Rainsford confessed on Fox Cricket.Earlier, Australian superstar Steve Smith pulled off a stunning outfield catch to remove Tony Munyonga, diving towards the boundary rope and catching the Kookaburra over his shoulder.","pubDate":"2022-08-29 05:52:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: Pandya combines calmness and clarity to be more effective","link":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/cricket-pandya-combines-calmness-and-clarity-be-more-effective-2906591","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"DUBAI : Hardik Pandya's talent was never in doubt and the India all-rounder has now combined a calm mind with an uncluttered approach to emerge as a serious match-winner as he demonstrated in Sunday's Asia Cup thriller against Pakistan. Emotions run high whenever India and Pakistan clash in a cricket match and many a player has buckled under the pressure that accompanies these contests between the arch-rivals. Pandya appeared cut from a different cloth though as he defied the mounting pressure in the closing stages of India's nervy chase and secured victory with a nonchalant six with two balls to spare. The same calmness was evident in his muted celebration when he just did a fist bump with batting partner Dinesh Karthik, who bowed before Pandya. Pandya's 3-25 with the ball and 33 not out off 17 deliveries made him an obvious choice for the man-of-the-match award. \"In all these years I've understood that if I stay as calm as possible, it's going to help me to execute all my plans,\" the 28-year-old said after collecting the prize. \"The 50-50 chances which I take, if I'm calmer, it helps me to pull it off.\" Needing 21 runs from 12 balls, India looked in trouble but Pandya hit three boundaries in the penultimate over from Haris Rauf to ease the pressure. Spinner Mohammad Nawaz dismissed Ravindra Jadeja with the first ball of the final over but Pandya flat-batted the fourth delivery over long-on to give India a winning start to their title defence. Pandya said he was clear about how to accomplish the chase and knew the pressure was heavier on the bowler at that stage. \"The (target in) last over was seven runs, but even if it was 15, I'd have fancied my chances,\" Pandya said. \"I know it's (a matter of) one six, and I feel the bowler is much more under pressure bowling to me in 20th over.\"","pubDate":"2022-08-29 05:45:49","image_url":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--_tAi2vdV--/c_fill%2Ch_900%2Cw_1600/fl_relative%2Cg_south_east%2Cl_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters%2Cw_0.1/f_auto%2Cq_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2022-08-29t054549z_1_lynxmpei7s050_rtroptp_3_cricket-asiancup-uae.jpg?itok=lUTsi9LV","source_id":"channelnewsasia","country":["singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
