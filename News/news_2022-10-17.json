Both Richards and Miandad are involved with the inaugural edition of the Pakistan Junior League (PJL) as team mentors. The PJL began on October 6 and will conclude on October 21. On Sunday, October 16, the official Twitter handle of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) shared a video of Miandad and Richards engaging in a cycle race on the sidelines of the competition. PCB shared the clip on social media with the caption: Both retired greats seemed to enjoy the challenge and had radiant smiles as they took a short joyride. Richards and Miandad are renowned as two of the greatest batters to have graced the game. The Windies legend scored 8,540 runs in 121 Tests at an average of over 50 and amassed 6,721 runs in 187 ODIs at an average of 47. He was part of the West Indies squads that lifted the World Cup in 1975 and 1979. Richards also claimed 32 Test wickets and 118 ODI scalps. As for Miandad, he notched up 8832 runs in 124 Tests at an average of 52.57 with 23 centuries. In 233 ODIs, the former Pakistan captain scored 7381 runs at an average of 41.70 with the aid of eight centuries. Miandad was one of the key members of the Pakistan team that lifted their only 50-over World Cup title in 1992. Richards is no stranger to Pakistan cricket. He has been associated with Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) and also guided them when they won the title in 2019. Recalling his memorable association with Miandad after being named a PJL mentor, Richards was quoted as saying in an official PCB release: PJL is a T20 league for Under-19 cricketers conceptualized by PCB chairman Ramiz Raja. It is being played in a single-league format. Six sides are taking part in the competition. The top four teams will make it to the playoffs, with the final on October 21.

FP Sports October 16, 2022 23:19:19 IST U Mumba went down to Puneri Paltan in the Maharashtra derby of Pro Kabaddi League 2022.

The Indian men's cricket team has been found wanting on this front in most of the editions of the T20 World Cup since lifting the trophy in the inaugural edition of the event in 2007. So, stitching together such consistent performance has been the bane of the Indian team, not only in the T20 World Cups but practically in all tournaments in the last many years. And therefore, producing consistent performance and consecutive wins will be the biggest challenge for Rohit Shrama's team when at the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in Australia starting on with preliminary round matches this Sunday (October 16). The Indian team will get into action in the Super 12 stage with a high-octane encounter with arch-rivals Pakistan on October 23. India are in Group 2 in the Super 12 stage with Bangladesh, South Africa and two qualifiers besides Pakistan in this stage. Group 1 comprises Australia, England, New Zealand and Afghanistan besides two qualifiers. The top two teams from the Super 12 groups will qualify for the knockout semifinals. So, to win the title a team needs to win at least 6-7 watches something that Rohit Sharma's team failed to do in the Asia Cup 2022 in the UAE. After topping the Group, the Indian team faltered in the Super 4 stage, losing to Pakistan and Sri Lanka and thus eventually failing to make it to the final. The team has recently won white-ball series against Australia and South Africa but the rivals were quite depleted. The consistency in performance will come only in case the team management led by Rahul Dravid manages to put together the right bowling mix in the field. Optimizing the depleted bowling resources, especially in the tough Australian conditions will be another major challenge for the team. The team will be without some of their first-choice players — especially the bowlers as without pacers Jasprit Bumrah, Deepak Chahar and left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja. That leaves Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami — who came in as a replacement for Bumrah, Harshal Patel, Arshdeep Singh, and spinners R. Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal and Axar Patel. With all-rounder Hardik Pandya available as a medium pacer, the bowling unit looks quite good and strong on paper. But there are a few pain points — the pacers are a little short on pace. Mohammed Shami is returning from an injury and does not have enough recent match-time — that is the reason he was picked among reserves initially, while Bhuvneshwar has not been in great form recently and has been carted around in death overs. With spinners likely to play a limited role on pitches Down Under, working out the right mix so that the team can get the better of some of the strong units like Australia, England and New Zealand. Fielding has emerged as an Achilles Heel of the Indian cricket teams at all levels and this will definitely be a big challenge for Rohit Sharma's team too. Former India coach Ravi Shastri had recently pin-pointed fielding as an area of concern for India and hoped that they will be able to do well in this department of the game during this T20 World Cup. Shastri rightly had said that saving 10-15 runs in the field or not dropping a catch could make all the difference in the final analysis. Though the team has some great fielders like Virat Kohli, the absence of someone like Jadeja will definitely be felt. Most of the bowlers and a couple of batsmen will have to focus a lot on their fielding not only in Australia but otherwise too. On paper, the Indian batting does not look like a cause for worry as the likes of Suryakumar Yadav, K.L Rahul, Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya have done quite well in the last 2-3 series. Kohli was India's top scorer in the Asia Cup while Rahul has returned from injury to form by hitting a couple of half-centuries in recent matches at home. Pandya too has done well lower down the order. Skipper Rohit Sharma has done reasonably well though he too has lacked confidence. But some of his knocks have proved that he is not far away from a big knock. The aspect that has the fans worried is some of his emotional outbursts inside the field some of which have gone viral on social media. Among the positives in the batting department, India have a lot of options and the presence of all-rounders and finishers like Dinesh Karthi All in all, if the India T20 team manages to tackle the pain points, it could go all the way.

England also learned the lesson in the most painful way last year when, after playing some amazing games under Eoin Morgan's captaincy, they got eliminated in the semifinal in the 2021 edition of the T20 World Cup by New Zealand. Asked, how does he prepare himself and his team mentally for such kind of a competition, Buttler said, there is no choice but to accept the fickleness of the format. \"Yeah, I just think you have to accept it's really — as (New Zealand skipper) Kane (Williamson) mentioned, it's a fierce competition. There's some great players here, especially in T20 cricket, one person can take the game away from you. Very much just prepare for the next game. We've had good preparation. We look forward to this tournament and don't try and read too much into past tournaments or things. We try and learn and get better and improve every day, and look forward to starting this competition in the next week.\" England are coming into the competition having defeated hosts Australia in the T20I series recently and they would derive plenty of confidence following their identical eight-run wins in the two matches. The third and final match of the series in Canberra was abandoned. But Buttler, who took charge of the side after Morgan retired from all forms of cricket recently said, the hosts will still be at an advantage going into the tournament despite teams now far more familiar with the conditions Down Under. \"Yeah, I think T20 is one of those games, as you mentioned, can be unpredictable. I think history tells you that generally the host nations are slight favourites in big tournaments, I think, especially when lots of people have played in Australia in those conditions, but of course no one is going to know the conditions or be as accustomed to them as the Australian team and the reigning champions, as well. You'd have to pick them out probably as the favourites for the tournament. \"But as mentioned, T20 can be unpredictable. There's lots of very, very good teams here, very good players who will all have a say throughout this World Cup,\" added Buttler.

The duo of Rohit and Dravid took over from Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri after the last year's T20 World Cup, where the team had a disastrous campaign. Under the current team management, India have seen a fair amount of success in bilateral T20I series but the Asia Cup debacle has given them a wake up call. When Dravid and Rohit took the charge, they talked about the positive approach and intent, which has been clearly visible in the team's style of play in T20Is in recent times. \"We've made a decision after the last T20 World Cup where we sat down as a group and decided to play more positively. We believe we have the quality as a group to play more aggressively, we've been able to do that without being bowled out too often,\" Dravid said about India's aggressive batting approach, after the end of the T20 series against South Africa. India used to win back-to-back bilaterials even in the Shastri-Kohli era, but they failed to win an ICC trophy during their tenure. It was even one of the reasons for Kohil losing his captaincy in the white ball format. So, in the new era of Rohit and Dravid, fans of Indian cricket have big hopes from the team to lift the T20 World Cup, 15 years after the Men in Blue won the the inaugural tournament back in 2007. India will start their campaign on October 23 with a crunch game against Pakistan, who beat them recently in the Asia Cup and the absence of pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and star all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, coupled with the bad form of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Harshal Patel with the ball have only increased their trouble. But, as Dravid said, it's an opportunity for someone else to step up. The likes of Mohammad Shami and Axar Patel have big shoes to fill, but the good thing is they are both experienced enough to face the situation. India's death bowling has troubled them the most in the recent past and the coach and captain need to give confidence to Bhuvneshwar and Arshdeep Singh to execute that, because these two bowlers are the best possible available options for India at this moment. \"You can't show disappointment in injuries, you need to look forward to what we can do. We have backed our other boys and we are backing them. Hope they deliver,\" said a hopeful Rohit Sharma at a press conference on Saturday. \"By the time we play Pakistan, we will be prepared. We don't believe in last-minute information, I don't want to believe in telling someone at the last minute that you are playing,\" the India skipper said. Another area where Team India needs to work is fielding. They have been poor in the field, dropping many catches in 2022 which is not a good sign. After the conclusion of the South Africa series, Dravid had said the team has really worked hard and it just needs some luck for the T20 World Cup in Australia. Bilaterials, Asia Cup are done and dusted, it's time for the much-awaited T20 World Cup and the Rohit-Dravid duo has the biggest challenge in front of them. They would be keen to put on a brave performance, emerge victorious and bring smiles on the faces of Indian cricket fans.

Though there are many, IANS takes a look at the five players to watch out for in the mega sporting spectacle. Mohammad Rizwan: The World number 1 ranked batter in T20I cricket, Mohammad Rizwan has been a consistent performer for Pakistan. For the records, he is the highest run-scorer in T20I cricket in this year and also finished as the highest run-scorer during Asia Cup 2022. Opposite sides will look to unsettle him early or else he will be a danger man in the tournament. Suryakumar Yadav: Stylish Indian batter SKY is currently in the form of his life. He ranked at number 2 in the ICC T20I batsmen rankings. He is also the second-highest run-scorer in the shortest format in 2022. The stylish batter will definitely be one of the players to watch out for. His shots in every corner of the ground in the recent series against Proteas got praise from several former cricketers. He was even compared with ABD - AB de Villiers — the 360 degree player. Wanindu Hasaranga: Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga will also be a player to watch out for. He was the leading wicket-taker in the 2021 World Cup and sits in the top 10 of ICC's T20 ranking for all-rounders. His deliveries are tough to pick and that makes him so successful in the shortest format of cricket. Jos Buttler: He may not be among the top 10 ranked but no team will ever feel comfortable till he is in the crease. Buttler, who was recently named the England white-ball captain, is arguably the hardest batsman to bowl to when he is in the zone, which can be quite often. It will be interesting to see how he comes out this time. Josh Hazlewood: The seamer will look to dominate the home conditions at the T20 World Cup. Not only is he the number 1 ranked T20I bowler in the world currently, but his performances in the lead up to the tournament have also been promising, so there is a lot to look forward to for fans of the Australian team.

An ankle injury while playing for Birmingham Phoenix in The Hundred forced Livingstone to miss the long T20I series in Pakistan and he has flown straight into Australia from England to begin his limited training before the showpiece global event. Livingstone will be looking to make his Test debut in Pakistan, having been called up to the Test squad for the first time since England's tour of New Zealand in the spring of 2018. The big hitter is also the new recipient of England's Annual Central Contract. Explaining the sequence of events which landed him a place in the Test squad, Livingstone said, \"Stokesy (Test skipper Ben Stokes) had just asked if I still wanted to play Test cricket so there was that little steer that maybe there was a chance. But you never know until they actually pick you. Then Baz (head coach Brendon McCullum) rang me and just said that I was going. I was over the moon,\" Livingstone was quoted as saying by the Guardian. Livingstone added that despite being thrown in the deep end, he is \"ready to swim\". \"But I believe you learn how to deal with all of that much more in the IPL than you would in a four-day county game. So, yeah, moving up to Test cricket is me being thrown in the deep end. But some people can swim, some people can't. I feel ready to swim.\" The 29-year-old added his style of batting will suit the current blueprint being followed by Test side in its success over the last seven matches. England have won six of the seven previous Tests — against New Zealand , India and South Africa — with their aggressive and positive play under Stokes and McCullum. The 29-year-old, who has only focused on shorter formats of the game in recent years, said it was a \"really nice surprise\" to be called up for the Test series against Pakistan.

From playing under former India opener Gautam Gambhir to becoming the captain of Delhi, Rana has come a long way. He toughened himself, focusing just on his game, improving fitness and never complaining, despite the off-field controversies that plagued Delhi cricket. Rana’s exploits with IPL (Indian Premier League) franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) is well-documented. He has played many match-winning knocks for the two-time IPL winner and has a wealth of experience in domestic cricket. Having made his List A debut back in 2013, the Delhi all-rounder has come a long way. “It’s a dream that has finally come true and I can’t express my feelings in words. All I can say is it’s an honour to captain Delhi and want to thank DDCA for giving me an opportunity to lead the team. I always wanted to captain Delhi, just like my idol Gautam Gambhir, and I have learnt a lot from him. When I made my debut, Gauti bhaiya was the captain and it’s a huge achievement for me to lead Delhi now. The journey hasn’t been easy but I have enjoyed every challenge,” Rana told Sportstar. The Delhi skipper slammed a brilliant 107 off just 61 balls against Punjab and led from the front, helping his side eke out a crucial 12-run win in the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. He credited Gambhir for making him tough enough to survive in the Delhi circuit but said leadership comes naturally to him. “Gambhir bhaiya’s influence has been huge in my life and I still remember the moment when I first went out to bat in Ranji Trophy, he was at the other end. He has taught me so many lessons, both on and off the field. I have always followed him and have always observed how he used to go about things. But, I think I have in me the leadership qualities and there is absolutely no pressure. As a professional cricketer, I have played so much that I am habituated to the demands of the game and captaincy. I love taking responsibility as a batsman and the same is with my captaincy. I was expecting the captaincy for a while now and I am thankful to DDCA for trusting in my skills. The aim is to win a trophy for Delhi,” Rana, who made his List A and T20 debut for Delhi in the 2012-13 season, said. Delhi has a mix of youngsters and experience, with veteran India fast bowler Ishant Sharma in its ranks. Youngsters like Yash Dhull, India’s Under-19 World Cup winning captain, Anuj Rawat, Ayush Badoni and Lalit Yadav, to name a few, hog the limelight and Rana said his job as skipper is to allow the young guns to play their natural game. “Youngsters like Anuj, Yash, Ayush Badoni, they have been playing cricket and Dhull has played the U-19 World Cup. My seniors always used to tell me to back my game and I am exactly doing the same thing with the youngsters. I trust in their abilities and back my players to play their natural game. This is a good team and has the ability to win trophies,” the Delhi skipper said. While the youngsters are rising through the ranks, the availability of veteran India fast bowler Ishant Sharma has been a shot in the arm for the Delhi unit. When asked how he manages to lead a side that has an India speedster, a veteran of 105 Test matches, the Delhi skipper said, “Ever since Gambhir bhaiya left and Ishant bhaiya was busy playing for India, a motivational figure was missing in the dressing room. But when I got a call from Ishant bhaiya saying that he wants to play an entire season, I was really excited and the entire team is very enthusiastic. It’s very motivating to have someone who has played over 100 Test matches and the experience he brings is a huge advantage for us,” he said. Rana further stated that Ishant’s towering presence doesn’t make his job difficult, and instead, the India fast bowler allows youngsters, including the skipper, to back their decisions. “The best part is he (Ishant Sharma) is very humble and backs every call that I make on the field. He always tells me to follow my instincts and to believe in my captaincy skills. Even the same thing for the youngsters in the team. On one occassion, I was a bit under pressure when the game was running away. I went to Ishant bhaiya and he asked me what I was thinking. I thought he would advise me but instead, he said, “ Tu jo soch raha hai usko back kar. Main hoon tere saath. Harenge ya jeetenge wo baad main dekha jayega. Tu dar mat (You back your decision and I am there with you. Whether we will win or lose, that’s a different matter. Don’t be afraid). We eventually won the match and the way Ishant Bhaiya motivates even under pressure is unbelievable,” he said. “In IPL you have a lot of international players and captains but to have this guidance in Ranji Trophy and domestic cricket is very important for us. It boosts the morale of a player and especially when you are the captain. As a captain and player, I am grateful to have the backing of Ishant Bhaiya .” Like Dinesh Karthik, who sought Abhishek Nayar’s guidance and now, at 37, finds himself in the Indian squad for the T20 World Cup in Australia, Rana’s go-to man is also Nayar. “I am always in touch with Abhishek Bhaiya for all the 12 months and whenever I need, he is there. He arranges practice for me in Mumbai when it’s raining in Delhi and vice-versa and the KKR academy is open around the year and that’s something that is a boon for me. To be in that kind of an environment is a great learning curve,” Rana said. The all-rounder had sessions with Nayar ahead of the Ranji Trophy, which helped Rana approach red-ball cricket with a positive mindset. “When the Ranji Trophy resumed, I called him and insisted on getting specific red-ball sessions to get into the groove. And KKR being an IPL franchise, which only focuses on T20 and white-ball cricket, arranging special sessions for me ahead of the Ranji Trophy is something amazing. It’s not always possible to meet him but he is always available over the phone and gives me the necessary inputs. I am confident of translating my preparations into results,” Rana, who made his Ranji Trophy debut in the 2015-16 season, said. On the back of a good 2021 IPL season, where he scored 383 runs with two half-centuries, Rana earned his maiden ODI call-up against Sri Lanka in July 2021 and subsequently made his T20I debut against the same opposition. However, the middle-order batter couldn’t set the stage on fire and was subsequently dropped from the national side. “Back of my mind there is always this aim to make an India comeback as the Sri Lanka series didn’t go well for me personally and I am ready whenever the chance comes,” Rana said. The pain of disappointment when he failed to make an impact on his India debut still haunts Rana. But a level-headed Rana is determined to change the narrative by donning the blue jersey once again. “I have worked on my batting, made a few changes but most important on my fitness and Abhishek Bhaiya has helped me immensely in the KRR academy. I have lost weight and I am getting into better shape. I am keeping myself ready because I don’t want to disappoint myself when the India chance comes. I am confident, it’s just around the corner.” Read more stories on Cricket.","pubDate":"2022-10-16 15:25:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bellerive Oval Hobart Cricket Ground records T20I: Blundstone Arena T20 records and highest innings total","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-bellerive-oval-hobart-cricket-ground-records-t20i-blundstone-arena-t20-records-and-highest-innings-total/","keywords":["Cricket","Blundstone Arena","ICC T20 World Cup 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bellerive Oval Hobart Cricket Ground records: Hobart will be hosting a T20I after more than four and a half years tomorrow.

Blundstone Arena, whose last international match was an Ashes Test earlier this year, is one of the for this World Cup and will also be hosting three Super 12 matches later this month. First matches for First Round Group B teams, an afternoon match will be followed by a Zimbabwe vs Ireland encounter at night. It is noteworthy that neither of the four teams has played a T20I at the Bellerive Oval in the past. Scotland and Zimbabwe, in fact, have never played a T20I in Australia. Highest run-scorers in Hobart T20Is are Glenn Maxwell (123), Cameron White (90), Ravi Bopara (65), David Warner (53) and Aaron Finch (52). Among players taking part in this tournament, Dawid Malan (50), Alex Hales (44) and Jos Buttler (25) have played the shortest format at this venue in the past. Highest T20I wicket-takers at this stadium are Nathan Coulter-Nile (4), Maxwell (4), Dirk Nannes (3), David Willey (3) and Shaun Tait (3). As far as bowlers part of all the for this World Cup are concerned, Ashton Agar (2), Marcus Stoinis (1), Mark Wood (1) and Adil Rashid (1) have picked at least one wicket here. While the first two Hobart T20Is were won by the team batting first, the last one was won by the team batting second. Out of six completed T20I innings at the Bellerive Oval, innings totals of 200+ have been registered twice. The first Australia (213/4) vs England (200/9) T20I eight years ago was quite a high-scoring match at this venue. Highest successful T20I run-chase here belongs to hosts Australia as they had sealed a 156-run target with nine balls to spare against England in 2018.","pubDate":"2022-10-16 15:12:53","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Don't have a choice in what people call us; came here to try, focus on cricket, says New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/dont-have-a-choice-in-what-people-call-us-came-here-to-try-focus-on-cricket-says-new-zealand-skipper-kane-williamson-618466","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Williamson said that he doesn’t have a choice on what people think of them and wants to focus on the cricket ahead of the Men’s T20 World Cup","content":"MELBOURNE: New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson is unperturbed by his side not being touted as the favourites before every global event, saying that he doesn't have a choice on what people think of them and wants to focus on the cricket ahead of the Men's T20 World Cup . New Zealand boast of a formidable record at ICC events. They have been runners-up in the last two ICC Men's ODI World Cup finals, finished runners-up in the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup and won the inaugural World Test Championship in England last year. Yet, fans aren't seeing Williamson & Co. as the favourites to win T20 World Cup trophy in Australia. \"I mean, we don't really have a choice in what people call us, but for us we came here and try and focus on the cricket that we want to play and address what's in front of us. We had a pretty memorable World Cup a few months back and played these guys in the final. It was a great game of cricket, and these sorts of tournaments are always pretty special to be a part of. \"Everybody has different tags and rankings that go up and down throughout the year, and I suppose they end up with different names. But you come here in tournament sport on any day, anything can happen, especially looking across all these teams with match winners throughout,\" said Williamson during the captains' day event in Melbourne. In the run-up to the T20 World Cup, New Zealand had to deal with injuries, like a fractured hand to all-rounder Daryl Mitchell and tearaway fast bowler Lockie Ferguson suffering an abdominal injury during the recent tri-series. Asked about an update on the two, Williamson said, \"Lockie is tracking quite well. Daryl is sort of a day-by-day case, so he'll start hitting fairly soon. A few little niggles in the camp, but hopefully the timing is on our side and they can be fit and ready.\" New Zealand will travel to Brisbane to play warm-up matches against South Africa and India before opening their T20 World Cup Super 12 campaign against defending champions and hosts Australia in a re-match of 2021 final at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on October 22.

The 66-year-old has now thrown his hat in the ring for Mumbai Cricket Association’s (MCA) post for president. As the presidential candidate of the Mumbai Cricket Group, he will contest against Amol Kale of the Ashish Shelar-Sharad Pawar Group on October 20. Patil spells out his vision for Mumbai cricket in a chat with Sportstar. Q. There is a growing perception that the Mumbai cricket administration is getting messier with every passing year. What has driven you to get into the mess? I don’t see it as a mess. It is a duty of every cricketer who has played for Mumbai. I am (who I am) today because of Mumbai cricket. I am so happy if I can give something back to Mumbai cricket. I could not do it earlier since I was busy with other responsibilities. From coaching India under-19 and the senior team to director at NCA to the chief of national selection committee. And in between going to Kenya and Oman (as national coach). Now I have time. And the pandemic has done so much damage to put Mumbai cricket back. It’s going to be a massive, massive job to get it back on track. For two years, there was hardly any cricket played. Still, the clubs survived, the Mumbai Cricket Association survived, the wickets and the groundstaff survived, everyone struggled but survived. We have 325 clubs, more than 10,000 registered (senior men’s) players. We play 110 total tournaments every year, even in this pandemic we could play 47. We have 79 offices affiliated, and we host two corporate tournaments, which saw 113 teams participating in it. We have six women’s tournaments, of which only two could be hosted during the pandemic. The MPL hasn’t been staged. There is so much to do and the guy who has played, has gone through this, along with the Mumbai Cricket Group team members, all of whom have been involved with maidan cricket, it’s a massive job in front of us, if elected. To have Prof. Ratnakar Shetty and Milind Rege, two of the finest and the most experienced minds who have been involved with Mumbai cricket for five decades, as mentors is a boon. Organising cricket is a difficult job, beyond the bat and the ball. And Mumbai cricket has a reputation all over the cricket world. The MCA is still repaying the loan, to make it debt-free… so it’s just not cricket. We want to look into all these aspects. And I am confident I can do it because I have handled various roles in cricket - as a player, coach, administrator. I know what the clubs need, what facilities are required, how we can create opportunities in women’s cricket - we saw the women’s team dominate the Asia Cup, what a fabulous victory, the men lost and women won. See, you may have a brush but if you don’t have a canvas, you can’t paint. We have the grounds but making other facilities available should be the priority. There’s so much to do, so all these things taken into account, I thought I should give it a go. This is the last chance I have since I am 66 years old and soon after the three-year-stint, I’ll be 70. I am giving it a try. Q. In the last three decades, Ajit Wadekar and Dilip Vengsarkar failed in their bid to be MCA president. Why do you think there has been so much resistance to cricketers heading MCA? It’s unfortunate. I can say so many things but ultimately, it’s up to the club secretaries and the voters to decide who is the right person. I don’t know if I am the right person. But I have the will, the vision and the team at Mumbai Cricket Group to deliver. The people we have - there may not be big names - are the ones with direct contact with clubs across Mumbai. We rely on getting the job done rather than reputation. I am not talking about the other group or other candidates. I am stressing on what we can do, if given a chance. Q. You seem to have brought all the political parties - and factions - together in the opposition group. What do you feel about political involvement in MCA administration? Politics is everywhere but it should not enter cricket. We should worship the one who practises what he preaches. Everyone promises a lot but hardly anyone delivers. Whatever responsibilities the BCCI has given me starting with the Under-19 coaching role in 1994 till my chairmanship (of selection panel that ended in 2016), I have always honestly tried to do justice to the role. The results are in front of everyone. There has not been a single allegation against me. Q. You were alleged to be in conflict of interest with Mumbai senior men’s chief selector Salil Ankola since he is your son Chirag’s father-in-law. Your candidature is cleared by the Electorate Officer but how do you view it? This is plain nonsense. Salil Ankola’s appointment was not done by me. It was done by the earlier committee and the CIC (Cricket Improvement Committee), who has the power. How do you bring our relationship into the equation? Do you want to look at cricket or our relationship? But anyway, let’s see. I am not having a go at anyone. I want to stress on the fact that I, along with everyone else in the Mumbai Cricket Group, am trying a sincere effort to see that if we get elected, we will try and do a decent job. Mumbai cricket is not just about dominating Ranji Trophy, there’s much more to do, right from club cricket to women’s cricket to schools, college and corporate cricket. It’s not going to be an individual’s job. It will require all the interested parties to come together and work together as a team. Only then will it be possible. Q. How have you dealt with the personal attack? I have faced so many hurdles. I have been hit on the head and come out to bat, so I am used to facing all sorts of challenges in cricket. Every person has a right to contest, every person has a right to vote. I am standing with a clear-cut vision for Mumbai cricket. If the club cricket culture of Mumbai is strong, Mumbai cricket is strong. If Mumbai cricket is strong, Indian cricket is strong. And clubs are the factories, they produce cricketers. If you don’t pay heed to them, not provide basic facilities and organise tournaments… the pandemic has been such a huge setback that everyone - even those who aren’t elected - will have to work together to achieve the objective. Only then will it be possible. Sandeep Patil is not important but the Mumbai Cricket Group needs support from all quarters. Even our opponents - I have been reading their mandate - imagine if all the mandates are combined, Mumbai cricket will flourish. We have seen enough ego battles so far, high time we overcome it. The priority is Mumbai cricket, not Sandeep Patil. Q. Over the last few years, the administrators seem to be more involved in their own ego battles. How do you plan to change it? Exactly, so to streamline all of it, it’s going to take time and sincere effort. Starting with giving respect to Test players - men and women - who are made to stand in the queue and request a seat to watch a major match in Mumbai. They are the ones who have developed Mumbai cricket, right? Right from Vijay Merchant to Prithvi Shaw, you have a legacy of cricketing greats. From Mama Karmarkar to Vijay Patil, every administrator has contributed immensely. But to get the legacy back on track is going to be a real big challenge. I understand it’s going to take time and I want to give my best effort to save Mumbai cricket, right from a gully to Wankhede Stadium. You have to look after everyone involved, be it scorers, umpires, groundstaff and others.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Australian government have not imposed any restrictions on the participants in the mega event. TOI has learnt that there won’t be any mandatory testing either. This is the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic started that a tournament will be played with no Covid-driven restriction. Ironically, it’s happening in the same country where tennis superstar Novak Djokovic was denied from playing in the Australian Open earlier in the year because he wasn’t vaccinated. “If a player tests positive for Covid-19 but feels well enough to play then he can play in a match. It will be done in consultation with the medical team. The infected players will need to follow protocols from the bio security advisory group like wearing masks and maintain distance from his teammates,” a source told TOI on Sunday. There has been a precedent of an infected player taking the field. Australia’s women’s team’s allrounder Tahila McGrath played in the Commonwealth Games final against India in Birmingham in August this year. Australia has been one of the strictest countries while imposing restrictions during the pandemic. The Australian government’s mandatory isolation requirements for Covid-19 infected people ended last week. This has allowed ICC to be more flexible while dealing with Covid-19 for the marquee event. This development also makes it easier for teams while announcing replacements for infected players. If a player returns positive in the RT-PCR test, he will be replaced. However, the infected player may come back into the squad when he tests negative. This development comes as a huge relief for players. Cricket has been played in tight bio-bubbles since 2020. While the bubbles have been lifted from this year, there have been frequent RTPCR tests on players. This will help the team management to solely focus on the tournament rather than worrying about Covid-19 disrupting its plans. The T20 World Cup in Australia was supposed to happen in 2020. But the event was moved to 2022 even though Australia was one of the countries recording the least number of Covid-19 infections in the world at the time. However, the Indian team travelled to the country for a full tour around the same time the World Cup was initially planned. This World Cup could signal how sport has learnt to live with the virus. And perhaps, this is the new normal.","pubDate":"2022-10-16 12:10:42","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup 2022: Netherlands deny UAE a dream start; win nail-biter by 3 wickets","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup-2022-netherlands-deny-uae-a-dream-start-win-nail-biter-by-3-wickets-netherlands-beat-uae-by-3-wickets-in-t20-world-cup-2022-round-1-2022-10-16-816684","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"T20 World Cup 2022: The Netherlands cricket team on Sunday denied the UAE side of a dream start as they held on the Chundangapoyil Rizwan side by 3 wickets.
