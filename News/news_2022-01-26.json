That could include the upcoming tour of Pakistan in March which Jhye Richardson will miss so the fast bowler can “build up the way he needs to build up” after injuring himself during the Ashes series. Australian selection chairman George Bailey named Marsh and Maxwell as two players among a “handful” who have the “skillets” to transfer from one form of the game to the other easier than others. With tours of Sri Lanka and India also in 2022, subcontinental specialists like Maxwell, who starred in the Indian premier League last year and made his only Test century in India, could be considered. Marsh and Maxwell both missed all Sheffield Shield cricket before Christmas to be part of Australia’s T20 World Cup win, and are likely to miss more red ball games when the domestic season resumes amid ongoing national duties. Bailey said the decision to leave Marsh out of a five-match T20 series against Sri Lanka next month was in part duo to the potential for more opportunities beyond white ball cricket and “prepare for Pakistan”. “There’s a number of players, Glenn Maxwell, Mitch Marsh, Ash Agar, Mitch Swepson are a handful of guys off the top of my head who just through the nature of scheduling played a lot of one format and not a lot of the other,” Bailey said. “But they are still working hard at their game and the three formats are incredibly different but there are some skillets that cross over so if the opportunity arises it certainly won’t preclude us from picking them.” Marsh, who played his last Test during the 2019 Ashes, has taken his heroics at the T20 World Cup, where he was player of the match in the final, into the BBL scoring 342 runs in seven innings including a hundred. Maxwell, one of only three Australians to have an international century in all three forms of the game, smashed the highest score in BBL history, 154 not out, as one of two centuries among his 468 runs for the Melbourne Stars this season. Fast bowler Richardson has been selected for the upcoming five-match T20 series against Sri Lanka but he will be rested for the three-Test tour of Pakistan, which begins in March. The 25-year-old, who made his Test return during the Ashes and snared 5-42 in the second innings against England at the Adelaide Oval before an injury to his left foot and shin kept him out for the rest of the series. He said discussions around him playing for “the next 10 years” were behind the decision to rest him from the Pakistan tour. “These conversations have always been positive, there‘s never been a negative word said regardless,” Richardson said. “It‘s making sure we’re in the best place possible to play for the next 10 years, and making sure the body is right and 100 per cent moving forward. “It would be exciting to play Test cricket in the subcontinent, it‘s a big challenge. “But for me now the focus is most certainly on the Sri Lankan series with another T20 World Cup coming up.” Veteran Steve O’Keefe could bow out of the Big Bash forever on Wednesday night and had some frank words on his way out. Australia has unveiled its 16-player squad for the upcoming men’s T20 series against Sri Lanka, with an Ashes hero included. Two batters in red-hot form have been added to Australia’s T20 squad to replace a couple of World Cup heroes.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Marsh and Warner rested ahead of T20","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/marsh-and-warner-rested-ahead-of-t20/video/e1183e862781bee5947f3b3b1f08a1c7","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Mitchell Marsh and David Warner have been rested from the T20 series against Sri Lanka.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-25 20:52:06","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost"},{"title":"Marsh and Warner rested ahead of T20","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/marsh-and-warner-rested-ahead-of-t20/video/e1183e862781bee5947f3b3b1f08a1c7","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Mitchell Marsh and David Warner have been rested from the T20 series against Sri Lanka.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-25 20:52:06","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Tin-eared county chairmen show why English cricket is in trouble | Barney Ronay","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/25/tin-eared-county-chairmen-show-why-english-cricket-is-in-trouble","keywords":["Cricket","Race","Sport politics","Sport"],"creator":["Barney Ronay"],"video_url":null,"description":"Middlesex’s Mike O’Farrell and Hampshire’s Rod Bransgrove shone an unintended light with their painful remarks at the DCMS racism hearing“The other thing in the diversity bit is the football and rugby worlds become much more attractive to the Afro-Caribbean community.

In terms of the south Asian community, we find that they do not want to commit the time that is necessary to get to the next step. They prefer to go into educational fields.” “I know one Caribbean overseas player … who termed himself ‘Token’, so there was a degree of humour in it … It’s difficult to call it offensive.” “We have a women’s section.” “We have a full-time female physiotherapist.” “I had dinner with Desmond Haynes recently.” Thank you gentlemen. Thanks for coming. Thank you for shedding an entirely unintended shard of light. In decades to come, as future historians of what was once the national summer sport come to pick over those jealously tended ashes, trying to understand how English cricket fostered its self-sabotaging culture of exclusion, they would do well to examine the contents of Tuesday morning’s hearing before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee into how the county game hopes to address the problems around diversity and reach identified by Azeem Rafiq and others in the last year. Called to give evidence, Mike O’Farrell and Rod Bransgrove, the chairmen of Middlesex and Hampshire, dished up a performance that was often tin-eared, frequently painful, at times verging on parody; but always unintentionally illuminating. There were some good intentions here and some fine words, mixed in with the dreadful, elbow-gnawing ones. Mainly, what the men in the committee chamber told us was exactly why English cricket is in trouble: because people like this are in charge. The most notable moment came as O’Farrell tried to explain why black and south Asian cricketers don’t progress through his county’s academy to the first team. His comments, quoted at the top of this page, sparked a spasm of digital disbelief . They were subsequently retracted and “clarified”, where “clarified” means using completely different words to describe a totally different idea. Which is at least a step up on saying the unsayable thing out loud by mistake. It was a moment of genuine double take. Here we had the chairman of a professional county in one of the largest and most diverse catchments appearing to state, with a reassuring smile, that the problem is black people just don’t like cricket; and that Asian people are interested in schoolwork and therefore not committed enough. Where to start with this? Most obviously, it involves taking a trite observation and spinning it out into generalised gibberish. The popularity of football isn’t pigment-specific. Neither is wanting to do well in school. But these are tropes that are often trotted out around cricket, pub-chat nonsense that becomes genuinely restrictive, the blanket dismissal of an entire slice of humanity, when it is being trotted out by the head of a pathway that goes down to age 11. Ask yourself, Mike, exactly why some of those kids might prefer to get an education. Perhaps the most significant element was that nobody in the parliamentary committee room batted an eyelid. Presented with some entry-level stereotypes, literally the exact thing they were there to dissect, a room full of MPs and cricket chairmen just waved it through. These are people in positions where there is a duty to be informed, to understand how talent is shut down and opportunity denied. There it is, right in front of you, speaking into the mic. Nobody present heard a false note. Within a couple of hours Middlesex had issued a formal rebuttal. “I wholly accept that this misunderstanding is entirely down to my own lack of clarity … I was aiming to make the point that as a game, cricket has failed a generation of young cricketers,” O’Farrell said. And to be fair he did make exactly that point. Just not in the way he intended. On balance Bransgrove of Hampshire had an even more haphazard time in front of the cameras. His first act was to deny he had recently told a gathering of county chairmen that he understood racism because he was a 60-year-old white man, and that the real problem is people have “forgotten the worth of the white man”. Ah. Some potential problems there, Rod. Bransgrove said it was “absolute nonsense” to suggest he would ever say this. Perhaps by way of example, he proceeded to offer up some absolute nonsense of his own, including but not limited to the anecdote about “Token”, a story that seemed to make him feel good, as opposed to ashamed and uneasy. At one point Bransgrove said: “I don’t know how a streaker runs across the pitch. If you did that in public you’d be on the sex offender list.” Rod: thanks for that. A bit later he suggested that one of the best things about cricket is you don’t need height or muscle mass, and as a result is also open to “disadvantaged people”, who perhaps in his mind seem to live in Dickensian squalor drinking rainwater and eating toenails. It was Rod who had dinner with Desmond Haynes. His favourite cricketer no doubt. Along with Mr Gordon Greenidge. It is of course easy to laugh, without humour or pleasure, at the clueless executives, charged with overseeing cricket’s farrago of structural problems. And while we should still laugh at the clueless executives, it was the afternoon session at the DCMS committee that provided the more pertinent action. Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief executive, had been unctuous and slightly harried at the initial DCMS committee hearing in November. Here he came tooled up with slogans, numbers and mission statements, a marketing man with his pitch down pat. Harrison began by saying that everything in his seven years at the head of English cricket had been geared towards growing the game, and that the Rafiq affair had only given extra impetus to his reforming zeal. Both of these statements are demonstrably false. Harrison has overseen a continued shrinking back of the summer game. He also had prior knowledge of Rafiq’s complaint but only began to act or make any comment when public opinion left him no option. But hey! Why spoil a good line? There is now a hard edge to these concerns. A quarter of a century after the first alarming report into systemic racism was delivered to the ECB, and after decades of window dressing, the DCMS committee has suggested future public funding might be dependent on the ECB showing it is making tangible efforts to remove barriers to entry and progress. Nothing will be resolved by these televised talking shops. But by providing a stage for the ECB’s slick corporate deflections, for the half-formed thoughts of the county chairmen, they do at least tell us one thing. It’s pretty obvious where the problem lies.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed56efea5eba96318497efe03df681a6ffad379/0_124_5719_3433/master/5719.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e4e48b00916f20b9b2c767cdb2b399a2","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Canada’s batting attack fizzles in 94-run loss to Ireland at U19 Cricket World Cup","link":"https://www.thestar.com/sports/cricket/2022/01/25/canadas-batting-attack-fizzles-in-94-run-loss-to-ireland-at-u19-cricket-world-cup.html","keywords":null,"creator":["The Canadian Press"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-25 20:11:02","full_description":"TAROUBA, Trinidad And Tobago - Canada’s batting attack fizzled Tuesday in an 94-run loss to Ireland in consolation Plate play at the ICC Under-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup. Canada won the toss and elected to field first at Brian Lara Stadium in the Plate quarterfinal. Faced with a victory target of 180, Canada’s batsmen stumbled out of the gate with the first three wickets gone with just 12 runs on the board. Kairav Sharma (19) and Gurnek Johal Singh (15) were the only Canadians to score in double figures as Canada finished at 85 all out in the 30th over. Reuben Wilson took three wickets, including both openers, for Ireland. The Canadians had success earlier against the Ireland batsmen, save for 17-year-old Philippus le Roux who was 83 not out after a 107-ball innings that contained 12 fours. Ireland was 179 all out in 43.3 overs. Ethan Gibson took two early wickets, including Ireland’s Joshua Cox (5), who struck a century against Uganda in the group stage — to reduce Ireland to 34 for three. But le Roux steadied the ship, eventually running out of partners 17 runs short of his century. Gibson led the Canadian bowlers with three wickets while Parmveer Kharoud, Sheel Patel and Sharma had two apiece. Canada dropped into Plate play after losing Pool A matches to the United Arab Emirates, England and defending champion Bangladesh. Ireland finished third in Pool B, defeating Uganda and losing to India and South Africa. The top two teams in the four opening-round groups advanced to the Super League while the remaining 12 moved into Plate play at the tournament, which runs through Feb. 5. Canada, which beat out Argentina, Bermuda and the U.S. to get in, is making its fifth straight appearance — eighth overall — at the tournament. Its best showing was 11th in 2010. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan, 25, 2022.

Azeem Rafiq and Ebony Rainford-Brent were among those to express their disbelief after O’Farrell suggested to a digital, culture, media and sport select committee hearing that it wasn’t cricket’s fault that more players from ethnic communities weren’t playing the game. “The other thing in the diversity bit is that the football and rugby world becomes much more attractive to the Afro-Caribbean community,” explained O’Farrell. “And in terms of the south Asian community, we’re finding that they do not want necessarily to commit the same time that is necessary to go to the next step because they sometimes prefer to go into other educational fields, and then cricket becomes secondary,” he added. “Part of that is because it’s a rather more time-consuming sport than some others. So we’re finding that’s difficult.” O’Farrell’s comments were similar to those made by former FA chairman Greg Clarke, who was forced to resign after telling the same committee in 2020 that south Asian people choose careers in IT over sport. And they were immediately condemned by Rafiq, who gave explosive evidence to the same DCMS select committee in November where he described the game as “institutionally racist’”. “This has just confirmed what an endemic problem the game has,” he tweeted. “I actually can’t believe what I am listening to #GiveMeStrength.” He later told Sky Sports: “Listening to some of his narratives, I’ve got a message for him: we all love cricket. This narrative that we’ve been hearing for a long time about the Asian people wanting to go study – that’s because we’ve not been made to feel welcome in our workspaces …” Meanwhile, the former England player Rainford-Brent, whose ACE Programme Charity aims to engage young people of African and Caribbean heritage, described O’Farrell’s comments as “just painful”. “Honestly these outdated views in the game are exactly why we are in this position,” she added. “Unfortunately the decision makers hold on to these myths. ‘The Black community only likes football, and [the] Asian community is only interested in education’. Seriously, the game deserves better.” O’Farrell later apologised in a statement, saying that he was “devastated” that the lack of clarity and context in his answers had led to the “ conclusions some have made”. “I was aiming to make the point that as a game, cricket has failed a generation of young cricketers, in systematically failing to provide them with the same opportunities that other sports and sectors so successfully provide,” he said. “Cricket has to take responsibility for these failings. We at Middlesex are no different. We have an Academy side that contains in excess of 60% British born Asian and black young cricketers, and we must take responsibility for ensuring that the route into the professional game is as accessible and appealing as other sports or opportunities.” Earlier, during the hearing, another senior cricket executive, the Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove, was forced to deny allegations that he had played down the racism furore in the sport. Kevin Brennan MP had told him he had heard an allegation that, at a 19 November chairs meeting at The Oval, Bransgrove had said: “The trouble is that they’ve forgotten the value of white men.” Bransgrove was also alleged to have said: “I know what racism is like. I’m a white man over 60.” However, the executive said in response: “Absolute nonsense.” MPs were also told that, in some cases, clubs were “overachieving” on tackling discrimination – prompting more disbelief from Rafiq, who tweeted: “Overachieving? Am I hearing this?” The ECB also faced difficult questions about its response to the resignation of Leicester chair Mehmooda Duke, who had been the only female chair before leaving the county in November 2019. The chair of the committee Julian Knight MP told the ECB that he had spoken to Duke, and intimated that she had resigned because of cricket’s failure to tackle racism. “Do you think that it’s rather disturbing that a time when you talk about extra diversity on the board, the one person who is a chair from an ethnic minority decides to leave as a result of inaction in this area?” Knight said. “That’s a hammer blow to the ambitions of the ECB.” The ECB refused to answer that question and another from Brennan over whether Duke felt “intimidated, coerced, and manoeuvred by the ECB?” – citing confidentiality in both cases. However, when the deputy chairman of the ECB, Barry O’Brien, was asked whether Duke was “unhappy in any way with any of your personal dealings with her in the way that you’ve handled her concerns?” he replied: “Yeah. She may have been.” Meanwhile, the ECB chose Tuesday to confirm that Clare Connor will lead a review into dressing-room culture in professional men’s and women’s cricket as part of a bid to tackle racism and discrimination. Connor, the ECB’s managing director of women’s cricket and a former England captain, will begin her review in February and make recommendations “to address discriminatory attitudes and behaviours”. The ECB has previously published a five-point plan, including “12 tangible actions”, and pledged £25m over five years to combat the issues of race and discrimination.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f32713cea2441d510e2ede95723a94aae30fb11/32_0_1645_987/master/1645.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9129ab67efde0fa695c25c154e79c98b","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Middlesex cricket chairman Mike O’Farrell slammed for saying ‘black people prefer football’ at racism inquiry","link":"https://metro.co.uk/2022/01/25/cricket-middlesex-chairman-slammed-saying-black-people-prefer-football-racism-15989095/","keywords":["Cricket","England cricket","Middlesex","Racism"],"creator":["Louis Sealey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ebony Rainford-Brent called the remarks 'painful' and 'outdated'.","content":"Middlesex chairman Mike O’Farrell was speaking at the DCMS select committee (Pictures: Sky Sports/Getty) Middlesex chairman Mike O’Farrell has been criticised and accused of stereotyping after claiming black people are likely to prefer football over cricket, while Asian players prioritise academia.

West Indies are touring India a six-match limited-overs series, starting Feb. 6. Rohit recently missed India's tour of South Africa due to a hamstring injury and in his absence, KL Rahul led Team India in both One-Day International (ODI) series, which unfortunately the Men in Blue lost 3-0. Last year after Virat Kohli stepped down as India's Twenty20 International (T20I), the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chose to remove him as the ODI skipper as well. Rohit was appointed India's new limited-overs captain. The series against West Indies will be Rohit's first assignment as India's official captain. The BCCI is set to have the team selection meeting this week, where senior players such as Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Ravichandran Ashwin, who had a forgettable 50-over series in South Africa, could come under the scanner, according to a report in PTI. \"Rohit is fit and available for the series against the West Indies. By the time, the West Indies series starts, it will be more than seven and half weeks of rehabilitation and recuperation for Rohit. He is already training in Mumbai and is expected to be in Bangalore for the fitness test and get a formal okay from the National Cricket Academy,\" a senior BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Will Hardik Pandya return? Following a poor show at the 2021 T20 World Cup, where India even failed to make it to the semis, one of the players who were dropped was Hardik Pandya. Pandya has been bowling in the nets. Even though it is not clear whether he can bowl in full flow, he could make way into the Indian team, considering Venkatesh Iyer's inexperience at No. 6 and head coach Rahul Dravid's admission that the Mumbai Indians (MI) star was missed in the ODI series against the Proteas. \"You have to remember after the T20 World Cup, Hardik was dropped and not rested because of his fitness. The selectors wanted to send him a message after his underwhelming show at World T20 but he is too good a player to be kept out for long. If not against West Indies, then he will surely be back against Sri Lanka,\" the source added. Meanwhile, the report further claimed that all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is also close to full fitness and could play in the series either against West Indies or the subsequent one against Sri Lanka. Jasprit Bumrah could be rested Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah could be rested for the upcoming series against West Indies. This is after he featured in all the six games India played in the Rainbow Nation. He sent down the highest number of overs (104.5 overs in Tests and 30 in ODIs). It is understood that while Bhuvneshwar could face an axe, Ashwin could receive another series, considering the white-ball leg was his comeback in the ODIs. The likes of Avesh Khan and Harshal Patel could return to India's T20I squad.","pubDate":"2022-01-25 15:37:18","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/01/25/500x300_1196920-rohit-sharma.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia"},{"title":"“Draymond Green would be out till after the All-Star Game!”: Warriors’ insider Monte Poole describes the DPOY candidate’s injury, suggests he’ll be out for 3-4 more weeks","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/nba-news-draymond-green-would-be-out-till-after-the-all-star-game-warriors-insider-monte-poole-describes-the-dpoy-candidates-injury-suggests-hell-be-out-for-3-4-more-weeks/","keywords":["Basketball","Draymond Green","Golden State Warriors","NBA"],"creator":["Raahib Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Warriors’ DPOY frontrunner Draymond Green is rumored to be out till the All-Star break, or maybe even longer For the last year or two, the Golden State Warriors have had their sides of the floor clearly demarcated.

Stephen Curry was their leader when it came to the offensive side of the game. On the defensive half, Draymond Green was the unparalleled leader, and had absolute autonomy.

Draymond Green has been out of the Warriors’ lineup since 6th January, when the Dubs faced the Pelicans. What started as rest on a back-to-back, changed to a last-minute scratch due to calf tightness, on Klay Thompson‘s return game. It has been a rough stretch of 8 games(9, if one includes the game where he played just 8 seconds against Cleveland). Draymond Green would be out till at least the All-Star Game After struggling in a few games, the Warriors’ seemed to have figured their identity on the defensive floor without Green. From the top-rated defense in the NBA, the Warriors have been ranking #3 since Draymond got injured. While that’s a drop, it’s not that big of a drop, as was expected. The habits instilled by Green and the coaching staff seem to be holding for now. However, on the offensive side, Draymond’s playmaking is something the Dubs are missing terribly. On the latest episode of the Dubs Talk podcast, Warriors’ insider Monte Poole joined host Grant Liffman. There Monte shared how the team is not worried about the injury to Draymond as of now, but they all believe that he’d be out for the next 3-4 weeks. This same information was also shared by Marc Spears, except, he didn’t give out any timeframe. Marc Spears on NBA Today on Draymond: “I keep hearing there’s no light at the end of the tunnel…& it’s very uncertain when Draymond will be back” Ok — Baltej (@Baltej_hoops) January 25, 2022 Also Read: “Chris Paul could’ve been a Lakers legend!”: NBA Twitter reacts as the Suns star pours on for a 27-point double-double and near triple-double vs Jazz With the Dubs having a cushion because of their early-season start, they should take it easy with Draymond’s return. There is no hurry, and they need to make sure his back is totally healed. With Klay suffering knee stiffness and Curry being in a slump, Draymond’s presence is needed, but not urgently enough to risk a major injury. Officially, we may receive a report at the end of the month. However, it is expected that the report would tell us to wait for 2 more weeks. Hopefully, they would also give us more information with the same.

The BCCI recently removed as ODI skipper and later the star batter announced quitting leadership in Tests as well. He had already quit T20 captaincy. The manner in which all the recent developments occurred and the controversy created presented a poor picture of Indian cricket. However latif said none of it should adversely affect Indian cricket. \"They have a strong base in the and Indian cricket is now established as financially very strong so eventually I don't think these recent changes or happenings should have any bearing on Indian cricket as a brand,\" Latif said on the 'Cricket Baaz' Youtube channel. \"I think a lot now depends on how handles the team but he has his own style of leading the side and he has already achieved a lot with Mumbai Indians in the IPL. \"It remains to be seen how motivated he will be to captain in Tests. Kohli brought energy and purpose to his captaincy and team.\" Latif though felt the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) erred in removing Kohli as captain of the One-day team. \"I think it was a case of having handled things the wrong way and no way of going back as well. I know from personal experience having gone through it myself that in such a situation when a long-serving captain decides to step down or is removed it is never possible that he would not have had discussions with the board top officials.\" \"When I stepped down as captain in 2004 it was only after I spoke with our board chairman. That is why I am saying I think the BCCI has made a mistake in the way it handled this particular issue. It is not good for Indian cricket.\" The former wicketkeeper-batsman said it was never easy to change a captain who has been around there as a leader for so many years. \"When you have someone as a leader for five years or more and so successful as captain that obviously they are people in the team who are loyal to him and it does disturb the dressing room environment.\" Latif said that India’s defeats in South Africa were a result of the uncertain environment in the Indian team. The team lost both the Test and ODI series. \"I am not saying anyone deliberately didn’t want to perform, every professional wants to do well but when the environment in a team changes it does affect the players in many ways.\"","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"Middlesex chair's lack of diversity comments part of 'endemic problem': Rafiq","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/middlesex-county-cricket-club-mike-ofarrell-lack-of-diversity-comments-azeem-rafiq/article38324910.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Reuters"],"video_url":null,"description":"Speaking before the DCMS committee, O'Farrell suggested that a lack of diversity in English cricket could be attributed to minority communities focusing on other interests.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-25 14:39:17","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar"},{"title":"WWE News: Cricket Fan Zone at Royal Rumble, Dirty Dogs Tease NXT 2.0 Appearance, Royal Rumble By The Numbers","link":"https://411mania.com/wrestling/wwe-news-cricket-fan-zone-at-royal-rumble-dirty-dogs-tease-nxt-2-0-appearance-royal-rumble-by-the-numbers/","keywords":["NXT 2.0","Royal Rumble","WWE"],"creator":["JeffreyHarris"],"video_url":null,"description":"More WWE news...

Australia's national selector George Bailey has said that security plans are \"very, very robust and very, very thorough\" after multiple briefings for what would be the first Australian tour of Pakistan since Mark Taylor's men visited in 1998. \"I believe the boards are still working through some of the minor details around that tour, so once that gets the formal tick of approval then we'll announce the squad post that, but we're reasonably well down the track,\" Bailey told reporters on Tuesday, according to cricket.com.au. Keeping in mind the players that helped Australia thrash England 4-0 in the Ashes, the squad for the Pakistan tour will be picked. Selectors are set to rest Jhye Richardson after the emergence of Scott Boland as a reliable partner to the team's regular pace attack. All-rounder Mitchell Marsh is expected to return to the squad after he was rested from next month's home series against Sri Lanka, as was opening batsman David Warner. An 11-day break after the KFC Big Bash League (BBL) would see Shield cricket resuming about Feb. 9. It is still unclear how much domestic cricket would have happened for the selectors to see and decide on the Test squad for the away series against Pakistan. Western Australia border situation has been further complicating matters. As of now, at least two Shield rounds would have taken place before the Australian squad would likely depart in the last week of February ahead of a Test series scheduled to begin on March 3 in Karachi. \"Whether we need to (see any Shield cricket) or not, I'm not entirely sure what opportunity we will get,\" Bailey said today. \"But the one thing that I think we have to be really just okay with is that we've got to accept what we get at the moment and be flexible. I think one of the great things and possibly one of the reasons the players performed so well in the Ashes was there were a number of players who got a good bank of Shield cricket in prior to that series. \"Whether it's for Pakistan or not, you'd certainly hope that there is an opportunity for some Shield cricket at some stage just because of the competition and to continue to see guys improving and getting the opportunity to show their wares,\" the national selector further added. Australia and Pakistan are set to lock horns in three Tests, three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and a lone Twenty20 International (T20I). The matches are scheduled to be played across three cities: Lahore, Rawalpindi and Karachi.","pubDate":"2022-01-25 14:22:55","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/01/25/500x300_1196913-george-bailey.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia"},{"title":"Azeem Rafiq criticises Middlesex chairman’s comments on lack of diversity in cricket","link":"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/azeem-rafiq-criticises-middlesex-chairman-141744376.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-25 14:17:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo"},{"title":"ECB to review dressing room culture during 2022 season","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/ecb-review-dressing-room-culture-2022-cricket-season-azeem-rafiq-racism/article38324743.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Reuters"],"video_url":null,"description":"The England and Wales Cricket Board updated its 12-point action plan to tackle racism and discrimination, including details on a review of \"dressing room culture\" and a standardised approach to whistleblowing.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-25 14:12:51","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar"},{"title":"Lack of red-ball cricket hampering players' skills already, says Jaydev Unadkat","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/lack-of-red-ball-cricket-hampering-players-skills-already-says-jaydev-unadkat-2022-01-25-756284","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Saurashtra skipper Jaydev Unadkat feels the players' skills against the red ball have started diminishing and potential cancellation of a second consecutive Ranji Trophy season will be a \"great loss\" for domestic cricket in India.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-25 14:10:32","full_description":"Saurashtra skipper feels the players' skills against the red ball have started diminishing and potential cancellation of a second consecutive Ranji Trophy season will be a \"great loss\" for domestic cricket in India. After the COVID-19-forced cancellation of Ranji Trophy last year, a first in the tournament's rich history, the postponement of the current season due to the third wave of the pandemic has left many players worried. The premier tournament was supposed to begin on January 13 and lead pacer Unadkat and the rest of the Saurashtra players had started their preparations to defend the maiden title they won back in March 2020. It felt like a different ball game altogether at the camp with players only used to white ball cricket for the last two seasons. \"Two years in a row would be a great loss. One year itself was a great loss. When we started our pre-season camp before the eventual postponement, it felt like a whole new game,\" Unadkat told PTI. \"Leaving the ball, bowling with pace and bowling long spells. All that had gone out of the picture. It is going to be difficult for sure if it doesn't happen this year too. \"I hear that BCCI is keen on staging it. If the virus situation doesn't become threatening, we can have it in February with a stricter bubble and more vigilance,\" said the left-arm pacer who picked a record 67 wickets in a memorable 2020 season. If February is not possible, then the BCCI must start the next season with Ranji Trophy, feels the pacer who has played one Test, 7 ODIs and 10 T20Is for India. \"For batters, even when I was batting I left the first ball alone it felt very different to be honest. I had not left a ball in two years of my batting practice. Probably the same for all batters barring the openers who were doing it even in one-dayers. \"For the bowlers, bowling that full length and trying to swing the ball but people were trying different things and were bowling a few balls. It was bound to happen with such a long gap. It will hamper the skills of cricketers for sure if there is a two-year gap,\" said Unadkat recalling the experience at the training camp. The seasoned cricketer also understands that the BCCI has an enormous task at hand in staging a 38-team event amid the challenges posed by the pandemic. \"It is disappointing but I feel this was bound to happen considering the COVID situation and the right decision taken was taken. Hopefully things get better and we can play at least half of it or the league stage before the ,\" he said. The BCCI compensated all the players who were part of the 2019-2020 season but that did not include many players on the fringes of state teams. Unadkat offered a solution. \"See the maximum that BCCI can do is compensate players like last year but that is only for the guys who played the year before. The guys who were not part of that squad and are on the fringes it is more difficult for them. \"May be the state associations can take the initiative. Whosoever was on the brink of selection, for example if top 20 are being compensated by the BCCI, the next 20 too have to be taken care of.\" On his stance on central contracts, he added: \"The board was keen on it coupe of years ago when things were normal but post COVID no one really has put their hands on it. I don't know why. That can obviously help a lot of cricketers especially in this situation.\" With red-ball cricket not played in the country in the last 24 months, the India selectors can only factor in the performance of the 2020 season while giving an opportunity in the Test team. Despite a stellar season, Unadkat has been ignored repeatedly. But that doesn't impact his motivation level. \"Obviously losing out a year after having the best phase of my career in red-ball cricket was unfortunate. I would still be at the same level of motivation when the season starts. \"White ball cricket has been happening and I am improving on that front. I just hope I get a team where I can actually get to show my skills in a versatile role,\" he added referring to the upcoming IPL mega auction.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"Azeem Rafiq criticises Mike O’Farrell’s comments on lack of diversity in cricket","link":"https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/azeem-rafiq-criticises-mike-o-140333076.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-25 14:03:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo"},{"title":"“I see myself as Kobe Bryant and Sachin Tendulkar as Michael Jordan”: Former cricket legend Yuvraj Singh explains how he and the Master Blaster shared an MJ-Kobe like relationship","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/nba-news-i-see-myself-as-kobe-bryant-and-sachin-tendulkar-as-michael-jordan-former-cricket-legend-yuvraj-singh-explains-how-he-and-the-master-blaster-shared-an-mj-kobe-like-relation/","keywords":["Basketball","Cricket","Kobe Bryant","Michael Jordan","Sachin Tendulkar","Yuvraj Singh"],"creator":["Advait Jajodia"],"video_url":null,"description":"After watching “The Last Dance”, Indian cricket legend Yuvraj Singh drew comparisons between Sachin Tendulkar and Michael Jordan.

Michael Jordan and Sachin Tendulkar are two of the biggest names in the world of sports. While Jordan is regarded as the basketball GOAT for all his on-court achievements, Sachin, on the other hand, is the only player in the history of cricket to record 100 centuries. The two icons are widely considered as the greatest in their respective field. Former Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh is one of the many athletes around the world to draw comparisons between the gifted batsman and the Chicago Bulls guard. After seeing “The Last Dance”, Singh explained how he saw his former teammate as the “MJ of Indian cricket”. “When I look at The Last Dance, I see a very inspirational story of a great athlete who motivated his teammates. I see Sachin Tendulkar as Michael Jordan of Indian cricket, who’s someone you know had that weight on him for India to always win. And every time you watch him, if Tendulkar got out, India would fall most of the time. Michael Jordan wanted everybody to be better, give their 100% and that’s how Sachin was. Everytime he would go into nets or practice, he would just practice more than any of us guys.” Also Read: Matteo Berrettini explains how the “Big Three” of tennis and NBA are alike in their own way Yuvraj Singh compares his relationship with Sachin Tendulkar to that of Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan Yuvraj Singh spoke about his mentor-mentee relationship with Sachin Tendulkar and stated how it was pretty similar to that of Kobe and Jordan. The former all-rounder said: “In ‘Last Dance’, Kobe always – Kobe says that you know, he saw himself through Michael Jordan, is what you see is through him. So I kinda relate you know while probably when things are not going well for you, you always look for advice, you always look for one senior to guide you. If I look at the 2011 journey, I see myself as Kobe Bryant and I look at Sachin as Michael Jordan, and obviously, I have seen his demeanor over the years and how he represented himself off the field. I have a relationship with him where I could talk to him about life. Not just about cricket, about life” And I was really struggling with my health… with my injuries. And I was kind of like not sure whether I’m gonna be in the side. So I spoke to him (Tendulkar) and I said that you know, that I’m really struggling with my performances and I’m working very hard. So he said to me, he said every time when a storm is about to come, the sea goes silent. So he said that you will matter when it matters the most. And I think when I look at the journey, Kobe died and Michael spoke about him. I thought he was really special… the way he spoke about him. So I kinda relate that.

After the COVID-19 -forced cancellation of Ranji Trophy last year, a first in the tournament’s rich history, the postponement of the current season due to the third wave of the pandemic has left many players worried. The premier tournament was supposed to begin on January 13 and lead pacer Unadkat and the rest of the Saurashtra players had started their preparations to defend the maiden title they won back in March 2020. ‘Players’ skills are being hampered’ https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png It felt like a different ball game altogether at the camp with players only used to white ball cricket for the last two seasons.

Click here for more “Two years in a row would be a great loss. One year itself was a great loss. When we started our pre-season camp before the eventual postponement, it felt like a whole new game,” Unadkat told PTI. “Leaving the ball, bowling with pace and bowling long spells. All that had gone out of the picture. It is going to be difficult for sure if it doesn’t happen this year too. “I hear that BCCI is keen on staging it. If the virus situation doesn’t become threatening, we can have it in February with a stricter bubble and more vigilance,” said the left-arm pacer who picked a record 67 wickets in a memorable 2020 season. If February is not possible, then the BCCI must start the next season with Ranji Trophy, feels the pacer who has played one Test, 7 ODIs and 10 T20Is for India. “For batters, even when I was batting I left the first ball alone it felt very different to be honest. I had not left a ball in two years of my batting practice. Probably the same for all batters barring the openers who were doing it even in one-dayers. “For the bowlers, bowling that full length and trying to swing the ball but people were trying different things and were bowling a few balls. It was bound to happen with such a long gap. It will hamper the skills of cricketers for sure if there is a two-year gap,” said Unadkat recalling the experience at the training camp.

Hopefully things get better and we can play at least half of it or the league stage before the IPL,” he said. ‘Central contracts will ensure financial security in these uncertain times’ The BCCI compensated all the players who were part of the 2019-2020 season but that did not include many players on the fringes of state teams. Unadkat offered a solution. “See the maximum that BCCI can do is compensate players like last year but that is only for the guys who played the year before. The guys who were not part of that squad and are on the fringes it is more difficult for them. “May be the state associations can take the initiative. Whosoever was on the brink of selection, for example if top 20 are being compensated by the BCCI, the next 20 too have to be taken care of.” On his stance on central contracts, he added: “The board was keen on it coupe of years ago when things were normal but post COVID no one really has put their hands on it. I don’t know why. That can obviously help a lot of cricketers especially in this situation.” With red-ball cricket not played in the country in the last 24 months, the India selectors can only factor in the performance of the 2020 season while giving an opportunity in the Test team. Despite a stellar season, Unadkat has been ignored repeatedly. But that doesn’t impact his motivation level. “Obviously losing out a year after having the best phase of my career in red-ball cricket was unfortunate. I would still be at the same level of motivation when the season starts. “White ball cricket has been happening and I am improving on that front. I just hope I get a team where I can actually get to show my skills in a versatile role,” he added referring to the upcoming IPL mega auction.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress"}]}
