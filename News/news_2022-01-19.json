Before those meetings heat up though, Langer revealed he was planning on meeting former captain Tim Paine who fled Hobart to escape the festival of cricket coming to his home town. Langer has guided Australia to Ashes and T20 World Cup victories in the past two months but his tenure as coach has been underscored by rumours of player unrest.

Despite Australia’s dramatic improvement in results after underwhelming winter tours, Langer said there was still “plenty to be spoken about” in regards to his coaching future.

So in the next little bit, I’m sure those conversations will start to be had. “There’s plenty to be spoken about.” Langer’s contract expires in March.

So it’s not a coincidence I don’t think that we’ve had the success that we’ve had,” he said. “Whatever happens from now on, we can all be incredibly proud of this little period. We had two missions: To win the World Cup and to win the Ashes. “To do that in such a short period is a monumental effort and we’re all really satisfied with that, we’re all really happy about that, we’re all really, really proud of that. “I sit here at the moment feeling really content with the last two series.” Langer assumed the role of Australian cricket captain after the ball-tampering saga of 2018. (Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images Langer’s contract expires after Australia’s tour of Pakistan in March, before which time he will coach Australia in home series against New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Cricket legends Ricky Ponting and Shane Warne are among those to have publicly endorsed Langer for a contract renewal but Cricket Australia indicated in late December that it would seek detailed feedback from players before making a decision. Test captain Pat Cummins dodged questions about Langer’s future after the Boxing Day Test but after the final Ashes Test, declared Langer had the playing group’s full support. “He’s been doing a fantastic job, we absolutely love JL,” said Cummins after Australia claimed victory in Hobart. “He’s been really great through the World Cup and the Ashes. Honestly, (Langer’s future) has not been a talking point at all within the camp.” Meanwhile, Langer revealed he would meet up with Paine, who resigned as captain on the eve of the series commencing and then withdrew following his alleged off-field controversy from 2018, on Wednesday morning. “I’m seeing him in the morning actually,” Langer said. “He’s been away with his family for the last week or so during the Test match and he and I are catching up for breakfast in the morning, so I’m still in Hobart. “Really looking forward to seeing him. It’s probably a bit bittersweet for Painey, he was a huge part of the preparations for the series, he was so focused on winning the Ashes, to see the boys do what they did, I’m sure he’s incredibly proud of that but he obviously would have loved to have been a part of it.” MORE COVERAGE “I don’t see why they get a say”: Ponting’s big warning as Langer’s future hangs in balance England “furious” as shock twist in boozy Ashes party has coach’s position “in doubt” “Divided, distracted, uncoached”: Claims of fat shaming, drinking as Poms’ Ashes mess laid bare Justin Langer revealed he was meeting former captain Tim Paine in Hobart on Wednesday morning. Photo: Getty Images Source: Getty Images Paine, 37, has yet to retire from the game but is unlikely to return to international cricket despite Alex Carey’s indifferent start to his Test career. Carey beat Western Australia’s Josh Inglis for the role, but did not quite nail his maiden series with the gloves despite some promising signs in Hobart. Carey averaged 20.33 with the bat and took 23 catches throughout the series, but a series of missed chances behind the stumps after a strong debut at the Gabba meant selectors will be watching his progress closely. Langer shared a very close relationship with Paine, with the former taking over the captaincy responsibilities formally under the coach’s watch.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"Coach Langer not 'edgy' about his future","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/coach-langer-not-edgy-about-his-future-c-5364927","keywords":null,"creator":["Steve Larkin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Justin Langer says he's not \"edgy\" before talks with Cricket Australia bosses about his tenure as national coach.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-19 01:29:28","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5364927/9193fed2a9db6f589474447b8aa2f1e2c71d8655-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow"},{"title":"Coach Langer not \"edgy' about his future","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/coach-langer-not-edgy-about-his-future-c-5364929","keywords":null,"creator":["Steve Larkin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Justin Langer says he's not \"edgy\" before talks with Cricket Australia bosses about his tenure as national coach.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-19 01:29:28","full_description":"Australia coach Justin Langer says he's not \"edgy\" about his future before looming meetings with hierarchy. Langer, at the end of his four-year contract, will soon meet with Cricket Australia bosses. Fresh from a 4-0 Ashes triumph and capturing Australia's first World Twenty20 World Cup, Langer says he's content in the lead-up to the crucial talks. \"I'm never edgy (about the future),\" he told SEN Radio on Wednesday. \"Before the World Cup and before the Ashes, we've never ever been better prepared so it's not a coincidence ... that we've had the success that we've had. \"Whatever happens from now on, we can all be incredibly proud of this little period. \"We had two missions: to win the World Cup and to win the Ashes. \"To do that in such a short period is a monumental effort and we're all really satisfied with that, we're all really happy about that, we're all really, really proud of that. \"I sit here at the moment feeling really content with the last two series.\" Langer coached both triumphs amid speculation about his future, acknowledging he had lightened his renowned intensity which had upset some players. But Langer said he was always comfortable with his agreement with CA hierarchy to delay any discussions about his job until after the Ashes. \"People don't seem to believe this but the absolute truth is before the World Cup and the Ashes we all committed to the end of the Ashes to sit down and have some conversations,\" he said. \"It has been four really big years and it's an all-encompassing job and it's a tough gig ... that's just the truth. \"We all said that we would sit down after the Ashes so, in the next little bit, I'm sure those conversations will start to be had. \"There's plenty to be spoken about.\"","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5364929/9193fed2a9db6f589474447b8aa2f1e2c71d8655-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest"},{"title":"Ashes 2021-22: England cricket assistant coach Graham Thorpe under pressure after hotel cigar incident","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/the-ashes/ashes-2021-22-england-cricket-assistant-coach-graham-thorpe-under-pressure-after-hotel-cigar-incident-c-5364619","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Reporters"],"video_url":null,"description":"The fall out from England’s disastrous 4-0 Ashes drubbing is set to claim it’s first victim, with assistant coach Graham Thorpe reportedly facing the axe after an incident with police.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-19 01:04:30","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5364619/e7817117db3bab08454a9c0a25dccf757bfa3acf-16x9-x500y20w3381h1902.jpg","source_id":"perthnow"},{"title":"Ashes 2021-22: England cricket assistant coach Graham Thorpe under pressure after hotel cigar incident","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/ashes-2021-22-england-cricket-assistant-coach-graham-thorpe-under-pressure-after-hotel-cigar-incident-c-5364428","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Reporters"],"video_url":null,"description":"The fall out from England’s disastrous 4-0 Ashes drubbing is set to claim its first victim, with assistant coach Graham Thorpe reportedly facing the axe after an incident with police.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-19 01:01:56","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5364428/ae41641d18609a4f3981b821fa8bb43d98092994-16x9-x0y0w6283h3534.jpg","source_id":"thewest"},{"title":"Players return from Big Bash to prepare for PSL","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/926331-players-return-from-big-bash-to-prepare-for-psl","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: Pakistan players have returned home in the middle of the Big Bash League after the cricket board asked them to come back to prepare for PSL.The Big Bash League is currently taking place in Australia and the tournament features players from many countries.Many Pakistani cricketers were also...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-19 01:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews"},{"title":"London court rules in PCB's favour against Techfront and Blitz","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/926326-london-court-rules-in-pcb-s-favour-against-techfront-and-blitz","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board on Tuesday confirmed that it has received the final awards of the arbitration proceedings initiated by it against Techfront International FZE as well as the two separate arbitrations filed against it by Blitz Advertising Limited before the London Court of...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-19 01:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews"},{"title":"Bradford League and Keighley Cricket club stalwart dies","link":"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/19855484.bradford-league-keighley-cricket-club-stalwart-dies/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KEIGHLEY Cricket Club stalwart Lesley Robinson has died aged 78. She also served as secretary of Baildon CC and the Heavy Woollen Cup.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-19 00:32:00","full_description":"KEIGHLEY Cricket Club stalwart Lesley Robinson has died aged 78. A long-serving official of the Lawkholme Lane club, Lesley, well-known for serving teas at their club alongside her husband Keith, also did a lengthy stint as a well-respected secretary of the Heavy Woollen Cup, and was also secretary at Baildon Cricket Club. The phrase “second mum” sums up her involvement for many players as she gave them a hug or words of encouragement when needed but she also had a steely side and wouldn’t suffer fools gladly. Keith and Lesley, who were married for 59 years, had four children – Jamie, Richard and Philip, who were all notable Bradford League players, and a daughter Rachel, who is a married to cricketer and umpire Tim Burnley. Richard is still the leading run-scorer in Bradford League history, while Philip went on to play for Yorkshire and Leicestershire. Jamie represented the Bradford League. Lesley was still a vice-president of the Heavy Woollen Cup and attended meetings as recently as last month. In 2014, the formidable partnership of Lesley and Keith won the Bradford League’s Unsung Hero award for their outstanding contribution at Keighley, while Keith won the Sir Leonard Hutton Trophy – the league’s most prestigious award – in 2013. Another proud moment for Lesley came in 2002 when she presented the Heavy Woollen Cup to Richard after Keighley beat Baildon in the final at Liversedge. “I was also named man of the match,” recalls Richard. “That didn’t have anything to do with mum, but some people probably thought so.” Many tributes have been paid on social media to Lesley, showing the affection in which she was held League chairman David Young said: “This is very sad news. Lesley was a lovely lady who did so much for cricket. She will be very sorely missed, and our thoughts are with her family at this time.” Nasa Hussain, the league’s EDI Officer, has known Lesley since he was a teenager playing in junior cricket alongside Richard. He said: “Lesley was like a second mum to me. She was so kind, so friendly and this is an extremely sad day. “I can remember one day winning the player of the day award in the Robert Bland Indoor Finals. The prize was a bat and my brother always insisted that I only won it because Lesley was the adjudicator.”","image_url":"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/resources/images/11476480/?type=app&htype=10","source_id":"thetelegraphandargus"},{"title":"Who will win today Big Bash match: Who is expected to win Melbourne Stars vs Hobart Hurricanes BBL 11 match?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-who-will-win-today-big-bash-match-who-is-expected-to-win-melbourne-stars-vs-brisbane-heat-bbl-11-match-2/","keywords":["Cricket","BBL 11","Big Bash Match Prediction","Stars vs Hurricanes"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Melbourne Stars vs Hobart Hurricanes: The SportsRush brings you the analysis and match-prediction of the Big Bash League game.

More importantly, will he be at his usual animated best on the field or will the cricketing world see a rather subdued Kohli after his stunning resignation from Test captaincy brought an end to his innings as official leader of the team across formats? He did not want to leave ODI captaincy after relinquishing the role in the shortest format and it led to a war of words with the BCCI on how the entire matter was handled. His supporters and Indian cricket in general will be hoping that Kohli has put his differences with the BCCI firmly behind him and come Wednesday, he starts a new innings with his willow doing most of the talking. A highly desired century after two years would be cherry on top. Rahul, who is leading the side in the absence of an injured Rohit Sharma, is expected to turn to Kohli for advice during the series. Not only Kohli has a major role to play as a batter, but as vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah said on the eve of the series, the star \"will always be a leader\" in the team. With the new leadership and support staff, India will look to win the series with one eye on preparations for the 2023 World Cup and also make up for the disappointment of unexpectedly going down in the Tests last week. The last time a full strength India played an ODI series was at home against England in March before a second string squad travelled to Sri Lanka in July. Rahul batted in the middle-order against England but on the eve of the game, he made it clear that he will move back to the top of the order alongside Shikhar Dhawan in Rohit Sharma's absence. That means Ruturaj Gaikwad, who made the squad following an exceptional domestic season, will have to wait longer for his ODI debut. It will be crucial three games for the seasoned Dhawan, who has already lost his place in the T20 side. The southpaw has thrived under pressure in the past and will be looking to solidify his position as the first-choice opener alongside Rohit when the latter returns from injury. Kohli will bat at his usual number three spot while there will be a toss-up between Suryakumar Yadav and Shreyas Iyer for the number four position. Rishabh Pant is expected to come at number five while Venkatesh Iyer is set to make his 50-over debut as the all-rounder at six, having shown promise in the T20s against New Zealand. Iyer is also seen being as the sixth bowling option. The two spinners likely to play are Yuzvendra Chahal and R Ashwin, who has made a comeback after more than four years. Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar will share the load in the pace department while for the third pace option, the management could pick Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur or Prasidh Krishna. Mohammad Siraj, who injured his hamstring during the Test series, is also fit as suggested by Bumrah on Monday. On the previous tour, India hammered the hosts 5-1 in ODIs and they will draw confidence from that. South Africa will be in high spirits after a memorable victory in the five-day format. Skipper Temba Bavuma played a few crucial in the preceding Tests and he will carry that confidence into his batting as well as his leadership. Quinton de Kock, who retired from Test cricket after the series opener against India, starts his life as a white-ball only player. Tall left-arm pacer Marco Jansen, who excelled in his maiden Test series, is expected to trouble the Indian batters with his extra bounce and variations in the short format after earning a maiden call-up. If Tests were any indication, the ODIs would be an intensely-fought affair. ","pubDate":"2022-01-18 21:17:05","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/01/16/500x300_1195087-kohli.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia"},{"title":"‘Time for bed, thank you’: Inside England’s all-night boozy Ashes bender with Aussie rivals - Fox Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L2NyaWNrZXQvdGhlLWFzaGVzL2luc2lkZS1lbmdsYW5kcy1ib296eS1iZW5kZXItYXMtZGFtbmluZy1kcmlua2luZy1jdWx0dXJlLWNsYWltcy1lbWVyZ2UvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS81Y2M5MmU2ZDFiMDA4NzRhOTRiZDFmODg1ZmY4MWEyMdIBoQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L2NyaWNrZXQvdGhlLWFzaGVzL2luc2lkZS1lbmdsYW5kcy1ib296eS1iZW5kZXItYXMtZGFtbmluZy1kcmlua2luZy1jdWx0dXJlLWNsYWltcy1lbWVyZ2UvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS81Y2M5MmU2ZDFiMDA4NzRhOTRiZDFmODg1ZmY4MWEyMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"‘Time for bed, thank you’: Inside England’s all-night boozy Ashes bender with Aussie rivals  Fox SportsCoach facing the sack over Ashes video leak  NEWS.com.auWhy busting up an Ashes party is just not cricket  Daily TelegraphAshes stars kicked out of Hobart establishment  The Mercury‘Disbelief’: Poms left stunned as shock twist revealed in boozy Ashes party  Fox SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-18 20:45:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Morgan: Blaming The Hundred for Ashes loss 'laughable'","link":"https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12040/12519402/englands-ashes-defeat-blaming-the-hundred-for-loss-laughable-says-odi-captain-eoin-morgan","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Eoin Morgan thinks it is \"laughable\" that The Hundred is being blamed for England's Ashes humiliation as he insisted Test cricket \"has always been the priority\".","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-18 20:05:00","full_description":"Last Updated: 18/01/22 8:34pm Eoin Morgan thinks it is \"laughable\" that The Hundred is being blamed for England's Ashes humiliation as he insisted Test cricket \"has always been the priority\". A 4-0 defeat in Australia has prompted much soul-searching and England Test captain Joe Root reasoned that anyone coming into the set-up is doing so \"in spite of county cricket, not because of county cricket\". First-class cricket in the country has been increasingly pushed out into the margins of the season in recent years while the inaugural edition of the England and Wales Cricket's 100-ball event in 2021 was held in July and August. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player While Root has argued for changes in the domestic structure to incorporate more red-ball matches at the height of summer, his stance seemed to be contradicted by his limited-overs counterpart Morgan, who believes it is incorrect to insinuate that England's Test woes stem from favouring the shorter formats. \"People that use that as an excuse don't watch cricket,\" England's World Cup-winning captain told talkSPORT. \"Test match cricket has always been the priority - it's the format for our elite players. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"Obviously times at the moment have been tough down in Australia during the Ashes but they always are. We've lost the last two series 4-0. \"It's laughable to point the finger at The Hundred. The Hundred is an unbelievable success. Our formats in county cricket and The Hundred, in the way they're structured, are exactly the same as Australia's. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"People need something to blame so they'll point at probably the furthest point to reality because nobody wants to say, 'You know what, we've not had the prep we'd have liked, we probably haven't played as we'd have liked, and we've lost'. \"For the majority of my career, white-ball cricket was an afterthought - 95 per cent of the time was spent around planning and prep for Test match cricket and then when we got to a World Cup, it was like, 'Well, if we do well, great, but if we don't, it's fine'. \"With the skill level that guys are producing now on a consistent basis, proven over a long period of time, we're considered one of the best in the world. Trust me, I'd much rather be considered that than an afterthought.\"","image_url":"https://e1.365dm.com/22/01/1920x1080/skysports-england-ashes-test_5644182.jpg?20220117142354","source_id":"skysports"},{"title":"Eoin Morgan believes Test cricket ‘has always been the priority’ in England","link":"https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/eoin-morgan-believes-test-cricket-193927931.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-18 19:39:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo"},{"title":"Champagne gesture doesn’t mean Cricket Australia has solved its race problem","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/champagne-gesture-doesn-t-mean-cricket-australia-has-solved-its-race-problem-20220118-p59p46.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Osman Faruqi"],"video_url":null,"description":"It was a positive step, but just the bare minimum that needs to be done to make Australian cricket more inclusive.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-18 18:00:00","full_description":"There’s a story Usman Khawaja once told about growing up as a Pakistani Muslim in Australia, trying to fit in to the country’s notoriously white and conservative cricket culture. After experiencing regular racial abuse and taunts during his school years, Khawaja says he was embarrassed to call himself Pakistani. “I had been moulded to believe being from there was uncool,” he said. He talked about being called a “curry muncher” and being racially sledged by cricket players from opposing teams, as well as their parents. Usman Khawaja celebrates his century at the SCG this month. Credit: Getty Those experiences meant that Khawaja grew up not supporting the Australian team in international sports, including in cricket. Instead he, many of his friends, and many non-white Australians with similar experiences to his, barracked for the West Indies, Pakistan, India or Sri Lanka. “I mean, none of them [Australian sporting teams] looked like us. I was brought up to believe if I didn’t drink alcohol growing up I was un-Australian. So then why should I support a country that doesn’t believe in me?” It was a sentiment that reverberated for many of us who came from migrant backgrounds, and have been told our entire lives that we don’t belong here. Usman Khawaja and the victorious Australia team celebrate without booze. Credit: AP It was this story I immediately thought of after watching Khawaja quickly scramble out of the way when his teammates began spraying champagne over each other to celebrate their victory in The Ashes series against England in Hobart. His hasty exit was noted by a number of players including David Warner, Marnus Labuschagne and captain Pat Cummins. They quickly put the bubbles away and beckoned Khawaja back. He sprinted up on the stage, embraced his teammates and posed for photos. Later, he uploaded the footage to Instagram. In the caption he wrote “If this video doesn’t show you that the boys have my back, I don’t know what will. “Inclusivity in the game and our values as a sport are so important. I feel like we are trending in the right direction.” It was a poignant comment. It was also layered with meaning and history. Not just Khawaja’s personal history of experiencing racism and being made to feel like he didn’t belong, but the broader history of the migrant, Muslim experience in Australia. In just a few sentences Khawaja, the first Muslim to play international cricket for Australia, managed to emphatically thank his teammates for having his back, reiterated the importance of inclusivity in Australian cricket, but also made it clear that while this was a positive moment, there was still more work to be done. On the one hand, it might seem like focusing on a few seconds of footage of Australian cricketers slapping each other on the back while they celebrate thrashing the English might be overkill in terms of its contribution to discourse around race and inclusivity in this country. Surely, not showering your only Muslim player in alcohol, so he’s forced to leave the celebrations is the bare minimum? The answer is that yes, it actually is the bare minimum. And in fact, as much as I found the gesture from the other Australian players to Khawaja warm and genuine, seeing it going viral as some kind of statement of “Aussie diversity” and proof of how our cricket team are just “good blokes” made me cringe. As Khawaja himself said , responding to a comment on his Instagram post, this was really “baby steps”. But even baby steps can feel momentous, especially given how out of touch and disconnected Australian sports has largely been from contemporary conversations on race. Only two years ago, in 2019, Khawaja was left out of most of the celebratory photos after Australia retained The Ashes because champagne was being sprayed around. Of course, religious barriers relating to alcohol are only one relatively small part of Australian sports’ problem with racial inclusion, but they speak to a bigger culture issue. Since Khawaja was selected to play test cricket for Australia a decade ago, no other Muslim player has made the squad, and only one other player with South Asian heritage has. It’s a pretty damning statistic. It’s why Khawaja’s description of the gesture in Hobart as evidence that things are “trending in the right direction” was so apt. He was being appreciative, but making it clear that this isn’t really what the battle is about. But he was also sending a signal to those seeking to follow in his footsteps, particularly those with backgrounds similar to his, that the current culture in the Australian team is one of respect, where the non-Muslim, white players have his back. There’s some obvious steps Cricket Australia, and the Australian sporting community more broadly, could make to ensure that sporting events are as inclusive as possible, and that inclusivity isn’t reliant on the initiative of particular players (as was the case in Hobart). It’s hard to think of a sport more synonymous with outdated traditions than the Formula 1 Grand Prix, with “grid girls” still a common occurrence (despite being formally banned by the sport’s owners, they still appear at a number of races, and champagne showers are a mainstay. However, at the Bahrain and Abu Dhabi races, wine is swapped for sparkling rosewater, which still allows the athletes to continue spraying themselves and each other in some kind of liquid (which they seem very keen on) while respecting local cultural traditions. It’s a move that seems both straightforward and sensible if Australian codes genuinely want to start reflecting the country’s diversity. Khawaja grew up being told he wasn’t a real Australian because he didn’t drink. Now, on national television, the Australian men’s test cricket – historically regarded as the epitome of white, masculine Australian culture – were eschewing alcohol of all things in order to respect their Pakistani Muslim colleague. It’s not evidence of a radical shift in Australia’s racial conversation, it doesn’t prove that the other players are anti-racist heroes for doing the bare minimum, and it doesn’t demonstrate Cricket Australia has solved its race problem. But for a few seconds Australian cricket looked a little bit like the rest of Australia. And Khawaja used the moment to push things forward just a little more.

The 28-year-old is also a doubt for the ODI World Cup in New Zealand in March. Australia will fly out around Febuary 10, CA said, in order to meet the mandatory 10-day quarantine requirement ahead of the tournament. \"Beth was batting incredibly well and as can happen, just a rogue ball came up and put her in a tough position and she tried to get out of the way, but copped it on the side of the chin,\" Australia coach Matthew Mott said. A massive blow for Australia with star batter Beth Mooney to undergo surgery for a fractured jaw after a blow at training, while other changes to Australia's preparations have been forced by COVID-19 protocols. #Ashes | @CommBank pic.twitter.com/tZvhWcTPvM — cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) January 18, 2022 Australia are already without spinners Georgia Wareham and Sophie Molineux for the Ashes but all-rounder Ellyse Perry, who will miss the warm-up matches against Australia A after a COVID-19 scare, will be available for the start of the series.

The series start here on Wednesday. \"It is good to see Quinny again. We obviously miss him in the Test team. He has made his decision (to quit) and it is a decision that we respect. Having Quinny again within team is good. Knowing Quinny, he will have a point to prove,\" Bavuma said during a virtual press conference. \"I am sure he is also as excited as we are, to be in the team,\" added Bavuma in response to a question on how was it like to have de Kock back in the team after the drama surrounding his retirement from Tests in the middle of the series against India. The dashing left-handed batter-wicketkeeper had announced his retirement from the longest format of the game after the first Test of the series which India won, saying he wants to spend more time with his growing family. During last year's T20 World Cup, when Cricket South Africa (CSA) mandated players to take the knee, de Kock initially refused and missed the game against West Indies as a result. He subsequently apologised and has taken the knee since. As the focus shifted to the ODI series against India, Bavuma said they are up against a strong side but ready for the challenge. \"In terms of India, it is a strong white ball team. The ODI squad they put out... we will give the respect they deserve like we do to any other team. We know it is going to be tough considering the Test series. \"Yeah, we have been preparing as well as we can to be ready for the challenge that comes up,\" Bavuma said. He also said lanky left-arm pacer Marco Jansen has been drafted into the ODI squad and is in contention. \"Marco has obviously been drafted into the ODI squad. The world has seen what cricketing abilities he has. That was a really a no-brainer to get him into the white ball squad and see him display his skills. He comes into contention,\" Bavuma said of Jansen. With regard to the likely bowling combination for the ODIs, the SA skipper said conditions in Paarl (where the first two matches will be played) would be taken into consideration and that the spinners would have a role to play. \"In terms of bowling combination, we have to consider the conditions in Paarl. It is a lot different to the highveld wickets. Paarl is a bit more on the lower side, a bit more skiddier. \"Guys like Lungi (Ngidi), Jansen, they come into the picture. Guys who can exploit the conditions. Paarl is quite friendly towards the slower bowlers. Shamsi, Keshav, Linde all come into the picture. Everyone within the squad comes into contention,\" Bavuma said. The South Africa batters have been preparing to play spin for some time now, he said about tackling Indian spinners. \"Preparation has been happening for the past year actually. The positive result the guys displayed in Sri Lanka during the series there last year. You must have seen in the T20 WC as well. \"Coming up against India, spin bowling is a strength of them, we will try to prepare as well as we can to mitigate that,\" he added. Asked if there was pressure on him to perform, Bavuma said, \"There is always pressure. There is no bigger motivation for this group of guys than coming up against a strong outfit which the Indian team is. Come tomorrow we must make sure we pitch up and need to do what we do.\" Bavuma, who did well in the recent Test series that South Africa won, said he felt like his feet were moving well and he was hitting the ball nicely. \"Yeah, look the Test series went well for the team and me. I think the feet seemed to move well. I would like to carry on with the same feeling. To be honest I have been doing the same things. Maybe it is just a period of good form for me. \"At the moment, my feet are moving quite well and I am hitting the ball quite well,\" he signed off.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"Rashid Khan, Ruturaj Gaikwad and Prithvi Shaw announce NFT deals with Rario","link":"https://www.prnewswire.com:443/news-releases/rashid-khan-ruturaj-gaikwad-and-prithvi-shaw-announce-nft-deals-with-rario-301462482.html","keywords":["Blockchain","Computer & Electronics","Financial Technology","Banking & Financial Services","General Sports","SPT","FNT","FIN","CPR","BLN"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI, Jan. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Afghan spinner Rashid Khan and Indian batting duo Ruturaj Gaikwad and Prithvi Shaw become the latest among a growing list of International cricketers to team up with Rario - the world's first cricket NFT platform.

Published by the Sydney Morning Herald, the video comprises of a female police officer asking the players to return to their respective rooms. “Too loud. You have obviously been asked to pack up, so we’ve been asked to come. Time for bed, thank you. They just want to pack up,” a police officer is head saying in the video.
