Perry has been named in the powerful 15-player national squad for Birmingham, where women's T20 will make its Games debut. But Cricket Australia has revealed the all-rounder is nursing the injury and it's unclear for now whether she will bowl during their tour. Australia will play a T20 series against Ireland and Pakistan in Derry from July 16-23 before the Commonwealth Games. Their first Games match will be against India on July 29. \"Ellyse is recovering from a stress fracture in her lower back and is expected to play as a batter,\" team physiotherapist Kate Beerworth said. \"Her availability to bowl will be dependent on her progress in the coming weeks and on the medical advice.\" By competing at a Commonwealth Games, Perry will add to her unique sporting resume. The 31-year-old is the only Australian to have played in a cricket and a soccer World Cup, the latter in 2011 in Germany. Perry is part of the same 15-player squad that dominated the one-day World Cup earlier this year in New Zealand. The one change is the coach - Matthew Mott has left for the head role with the England men's one-day team. Assistant Shelley Nitschke will be the interim women's head coach at the Games. Australia also hold the Ashes and are the reigning T20 world champions. They will start the Games as the overwhelming gold medal favourites and will face Barbados, India and Pakistan in Group A pool matches. Group B features England, New Zealand, India and Sri Lanka, with the top two teams from the pools progressing to the semi-finals.. It will be the second time that cricket has been played at the Games - Steve Waugh's 50-over team won the silver medal at Kuala Lumpur in 1998. While Australia will be the team to beat at the Games, they are yet to win at Edgbaston. The women have lost their two Tests and sole one-day international at the ground. Squad: Meg Lanning captain, Rachael Haynes vice captain, Darcie Brown, Nicola Carey, Ashleigh Gardner, Grace Harris, Alyssa Healy, Jess Jonassen, Alana King, Tahlia McGrath, Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Megan Schutt, Annabel Sutherland, Amanda-Jade Wellington.","pubDate":"2022-05-19 21:47:14","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-6866942/ed542ed24e31baeb669f28c1ea727b99f3495b5d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jos Buttler vs CSK stats and last 5 innings list: Jos Buttler IPL record Brabourne Stadium","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-jos-buttler-vs-csk-stats-and-last-5-innings-list-jos-buttler-ipl-record-brabourne-stadium/","keywords":["Cricket","CSK","IPL 2022","Rajasthan Royals","chennai super kings","csk","Indian Premier League","Jos Buttler","rajasthan royals","RR"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jos Buttler vs CSK: The highest run-scorer of this season had been dismissed for single-digit scores in his last two innings.

He is \"not finding any self-worth or value\" in what he is doing on the field now, a far cry from the man known for his intensity and passion, things that made him a cricket icon, besides his incredible range of shots with the bat in his pomp. Kohli has not scored a hundred in competitive cricket for nearly three years and current edition of IPL happens to be his worst. \"I'm actually in the happiest phase of my life. I am not finding any self-worth or value in what I do on the field. I'm way past that phase. This is a phase of evolution for me,\" Kohli told Star Sports. The former India skipper, who also gave up captaincy at Royal Challengers Bangalore last year, is enduring his worst run with the bat, leaving his millions of fans concerned. He has had a disappointing IPL-15 so far with the bat having managed only one half-century in 13 matches for RCB. Kohli has bagged three golden ducks already this season and has managed just 200 runs at an average and strike rate that fail to define a player of his calibre. At the same time though, the 33-year-old refuses to believe that the drive is not there. \"... Not to say that I don't have the same drive, my drive will never die down. The day my drive goes away, I'll not be playing this game. \"But to understand that some things are not controllable, the only controllable you have are things that you can work towards, which is working hard on the field and in life as well and from that point of view, I feel that I am in the most balanced space that I have ever been and I am happy with who I am and how I am leading my life.\" For Kohli, on-field success or failure is increasingly becoming irrelevant. \"I am not finding any source of encouragement or disappointment by what happens on the field. \"So, this has not been about myself, this is about the fact that I have not contributed to my team's cause as much as I would have wanted to or I pride myself to, and that is something that always disappoints me, not what I do as an individual. \"It's because I don't want to let my team down.\" Kohli's remarks are not in consonance with how the cricket world -- including his million fans -- is feeling for quite sometime now. The lack of runs from the modern great has been a cause of concern for fans and experts, with few including former India head coach Ravi Shastri imploring the cricketer to take a break from the game. Regarded as one of the most prolific batters in modern day cricket, Kohli's last century in international cricket came way back in 2019. Since then, he has mostly struggled, and his failure to inspire his teams to title triumphs culminated in him stepping down from RCB and India's T20 captaincy and losing the post in the Test team. Speaking about his transition from a captain to a player, Kohli said, \"To be honest, it's different. I won't say it's hard because it's something that you're involved in regularly. \"So, the good thing is that my relationship with Faf (current RCB skipper Faf du Plessis) has always been good. We also have a leadership group in the team where we all share our inputs. \"Even on the field, when Faf is on the outfield and I am inside, I make sure to look after the fielding angles and the placement, so he's given me the liberty to adjust wherever I feel that there's a need, but always keeping him in the loop obviously. \"So, it's been a different way to look at the game, but because I've done it so much in the past, it's not something that I don't know how to do.\"","pubDate":"2022-05-19 18:25:06","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/05/19/500x300_1293183-kohli.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Virat Kohli Finds Form As Royal Challengers Bangalore Beat Gujarat Titans To Stay In Play-.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9pbmRpYW4tcHJlbWllci1sZWFndWUtMjAyMi12aXJhdC1rb2hsaS1maW5kcy1mb3JtLWFzLXJjYi1iZWF0LWd0LXRvLXN0YXktaW4tcGxheS1vZmYtcmFjZS0yOTkyMDIy0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022: Virat Kohli Finds Form As Royal Challengers Bangalore Beat Gujarat Titans To Stay In Play-..¬†¬†NDTV SportsRCB vs GT, Preview: Road to Playoff | Game Day¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreLive Cricket Score - RCB vs GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzRCB vs GT IPL 2022 Highlights: Royal Challengers Bangalore Beat Gujarat Titans By 8 Wickets¬†¬†News18RCB vs GT: Everything you need to know | IPL 2022 | 12th Man TV¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-19 18:02:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 Live Score RCB vs GT: Kohli roars back to form as RCB win by 8 wickets - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9yY2ItdnMtZ3QtaXBsLTIwMjItbGl2ZS1zY29yZS1yb3lhbC1jaGFsbGVuZ2Vycy1iYW5nYWxvcmUtdnMtZ3VqYXJhdC10aXRhbnMtdG9kYXktbWF0Y2gtMTAxNjUyOTU2MDA2NDY3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022 Live Score RCB vs GT: Kohli roars back to form as RCB win by 8 wickets¬†¬†Hindustan TimesRCB vs GT, Preview: Road to Playoff | Game Day¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreRCB vs GT IPL 2022 Highlights: Royal Challengers Bangalore Beat Gujarat Titans By 8 Wickets¬†¬†News18Live Cricket Score - RCB vs GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzRCB vs GT: Everything you need to know | IPL 2022 | 12th Man TV¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-19 17:52:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"McCullum believes England revival will benefit Test cricket","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/mccullum-believes-england-revival-will-benefit-test-cricket/article38495220.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["AFP"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brendon McCullum will take charge of an England side that has won just one of its past 17 Tests.","content":"Newly-appointed England Test coach Brendon McCullum says improving the team's flagging fortunes will also help secure the red-ball game's international future. The former New Zealand captain will take charge of an England side that has won just one of its past 17 Tests, with fans hoping his partnership with new skipper Ben Stokes proves the catalyst for a revival. English cricket chiefs are banking on McCullum, a noted limited overs as well as Test cricketer, transferring the qualities that made him a dynamic batsman and attacking leader into his first coaching job in red-ball cricket. RELATED | England recalls Broad, Anderson for NZ Tests The 40-year-old knows something about starting in difficult circumstances -- in his first Test as New Zealand captain his team was bowled out for just 45 by South Africa at Cape Town in 2013. But after that match McCullum held a \"ground zero\" meeting with then head coach Mike Hesson and other support staff, now widely seen as the start of New Zealand's ascent to its current status as world Test champion. \"Test cricket has always been the pinnacle for me and maybe the popularity of it has somehow trended south of late,\" McCullum said in an interview with the England and Wales Cricket Board's media channels. \"If red-ball cricket is to not just sustain but to thrive, it needs England to be playing an attractive brand of Test cricket, which is competing with Australia, India, New Zealand.\" \"It's a big, lofty goal but it's what is in front of us,\" added McCullum, a huge influence on the leadership style of 2019 England World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan, a close friend. McCullum, whose opening assignment as England's Test coach will be a three-match series against his native New Zealand, starting at Lord's on June 2, said his aim was to get England back to the \"top of the pile\". England managing director Rob Key said on Wednesday that the new coach has more to him than playing crowd-pleasing cricket, adding that McCullum also values players who can demonstrate resilience in the longer format. McCullum promised England supporters their team would be one \"worth following\" if he and the similarly minded Stokes achieved their ambitions. \"Hopefully we can play that kind of entertaining -- I won't say cavalier, because that's probably what other people expect us to do -- cricket. \"It's a pretty simple philosophy but if we get that right, with the talent that exists in the English cricket set-up, hopefully we'll get results to go in the right direction and build something together.\"","pubDate":"2022-05-19 17:33:59","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Brendon McCullum believes England revival will benefit Test cricket","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/international/brendon-mccullum-believes-england-revival-will-benefit-test-cricket-9cf64528-569b-4c2c-aaf5-7c96918027f2","keywords":null,"creator":["AFP"],"video_url":null,"description":"Newly-appointed England Test coach Brendon McCullum says improving the team's flagging fortunes will also help secure the red-ball game's international future.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-19 17:07:33","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/9d016b92-88d4-5a05-9efd-e7e10dcdd9fd&operation=CROP&offset=0x150&resize=5000x2809","source_id":"iol","country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RCB vs GT Live Cricket Score IPL 2022 Latest Updates: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis Provide Superb Start to RCB's Chase - News18","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMi5QFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2NyaWNrZXRuZXh0L25ld3MvbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3JlLXJjYi12cy1ndC1pcGwtMjAyMi1sYXRlc3QtdXBkYXRlcy1yb3lhbC1jaGFsbGVuZ2Vycy1iYW5nYWxvcmUtdnMtZ3VqYXJhdC10aXRhbnMtbGl2ZS1zdHJlYW1pbmctaW5kaWFuLXByZW1pZXItbGVhZ3VlLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtdG9kYXktbWF0Y2gtY292ZXJhZ2UtbGl2ZW5ld3MtNTIwNjU1NS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"RCB vs GT Live Cricket Score IPL 2022 Latest Updates: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis Provide Superb Start to RCB's Chase¬†¬†News18RCB vs GT, Preview: Road to Playoff | Game Day¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreRCB vs GT Dream11 Prediction Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022¬†¬†Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - Titans vs RCB, Indian Premier League 2022, 67th Match¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoRCB vs GT: Everything you need to know | IPL 2022 | 12th Man TV¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-19 16:42:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 RCB vs GT Live Score Updates: Gujarat post 168/5 against Bangalore - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvaXBsL2lwbC0yMDIyLXJjYi12cy1ndC1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtNzkyNTUzNi_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022 RCB vs GT Live Score Updates: Gujarat post 168/5 against Bangalore¬†¬†The Indian ExpressRCB vs GT, Preview: Road to Playoff | Game Day¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreMatch Preview - Titans vs RCB, Indian Premier League 2022, 67th Match¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoRCB vs GT Dream11 Prediction Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022¬†¬†Cricket AddictorRCB vs GT: Everything you need to know | IPL 2022 | 12th Man TV¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-19 15:50:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Gujarat Titans: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/royal-challengers-bangalore-vs-gujarat-titans-live-score-over-match-67-t20-11-15-updates-2991408","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Gujarat Titans from Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai.

During the 67th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Gujarat Titans at the Wankhede Stadium, Royal Challengers Bangalore fast bowler Josh Hazlewood drew first blood in his first over to hand his team with an early advantage. In what was Hazlewood‚Äôs 100th T20 wicket, it wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without his Australian teammate Glenn Maxwell‚Äôs mind-blowing fielding effort in the slips. While his opening partner Wriddhiman Saha was among the boundaries from the first over itself, Gujarat Titans opening batter Shubman Gill (1) failed to find any momentum during his four-ball stay tonight. Gill, who played a Hazlewood out-swinging delivery with hard hands, would‚Äôve initially thought of a single towards the third-man. However, a lone slip in Maxwell dived towards his right to grab a one-handed stunner whilst being airborne. With Royal Challengers captain Faf du Plessis bringing a slip for Gill on a delivery before the dismissal, Maxwell‚Äôs brilliance justified his captain‚Äôs thinking. Earlier, it was Titans captain Hardik Pandya who won the toss and chose to bat.

Andrew Symonds, who was popularly known as Roy passed away in a car accident in Townsville. Symonds won two ICC World Cups with Australia in 2003 and 2007, and he was one of the best ever white-ball all-rounders of the Australian cricket team. Symonds, who was born in the UK was adopted by a British pair, and they took him to Australia when he was just three months old. Andrew Symonds was often involved in quite a few controversies, but his stats spoke for himself. Shane Watson calls Andrew Symonds the best team man Delhi Capitals‚Äô assistant coach Shane Watson gave an interview to NDTV, where he talked about the death of Shane Warne, Rod Marsh and Andrew Symonds.

A half-volley, slanting on the pads. Saha flicks it to deep backward square leg for a boundary. We are all set to begin! Bangalore players have made their way out to the middle. Wriddhiman Saha and Shubman Gill are the openers for Gujarat. Saha was brilliant in the last game and Gill also seem to be in decent touch from the last few games. Siddarth Kaul to start with the ball for Bangalore. Can he make an impact on his birthday? Let's find out. So Bangalore have made a bold call to bring Siddarth Kaul in place of Mohammed Siraj. It is a fair call though as Siraj has not been at his best this season. Can Bangalore put on a spirited performance here. They need to set the tone with the ball. Let's see how things pan out. Glenn Maxwell is up for a chat. He says they have to be 100% focused, everything is not in their hands but they have to take care of things that are in control and hope to be alive in the competition. Adds that he and Patidar play in the middle order so they adopt to play spinners more. He personally just tries to adapt to whatever situation he faces. Informs, the openers need to get off to a hot start. Faf du Plessis, the skipper of Bangalore, says that they would've batted first as the wicket looks dry. Adds that the previous game was disappointed but they have to win today and Delhi need to lose their game. Informs there is one change - Siddarth Kaul comes in for Mohammed Siraj. Admits that games like this bring out characters and the experienced guys need to make sure other players fire as well. The captain of Gujarat, Hardik Pandya, says that they will bat first. Tells that with the kind of situation they are in they can test themselves by batting first. Informs that they have one change with Lockie Ferguson coming in for Alzarri Joseph. Says that they had a chat with all the boys about whether they wanted to rest but all the boys wanted to play. Tells that the pitch looks similar to the one they played against Chennai but it will play better as it is an evening game. States that captaincy has been enjoyable for him and that has helped him put his perspective more on the game and has helped him develop as a cricketer. Bangalore (Playing XI) - Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (C), Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Mahipal Lomror, Dinesh Karthik (WK), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Siddarth Kaul (In place of Mohammed Siraj), Josh Hazlewood. Gujarat (Playing XI) - Wriddhiman Saha (WK), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya (C), David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Lockie Ferguson (In place of Alzarri Joseph), Yash Dayal, Mohammad Shami. Toss - Gujarat have won the toss and they will BAT first! Pitch Report - Graeme Smith says that the corners are the smallest part of the ground. Tells that the pitch looks good and has a nice grass covering and it is probably the hardest pitch that he has seen at the Wankhede. Mentions that the conditions are overall good for the batters and he expects another cracker of a game. Gujarat, on the other hand, have sealed the top spot in the points table and would be looking to continue the momentum forward. They might look to experiment a bit and give rest to someone like Mohammad Shami keeping his workload in mind. There is also the possibility of Rahmanullah Gurbaz getting a chance ahead of Matthew Wade who has failed to deliver so far. The pressure is on Bangalore and it was Gujarat who got the better of Bangalore in the last game between these two sides, they surely have an upper hand in this game. Can Bangalore get those two crucial points on the board? Let's find out. Toss and team sheets in a while. Bangalore have blown hot and cold this season and the lack of consistency has put them on a sticky wicket now. A win here will also not guarantee them a playoff spot as Delhi is better placed than them with a higher net run rate. However, all Bangalore can and should do in this game is to put a strong performance and do everything that is in their control in this game. Big players like Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell need to step up and let's see how they go about their business tonight. Hello and a warm welcome to game number 67 and it will be Bangalore going head-to-head against the table-toppers, Gujarat. It is a must-win game for Bangalore as they already have a negative net run rate and one more slip up from their side will most probably bring curtains on their campaign. ...

Superstar opener Beth Mooney moved from the Brisbane Heat to the Perth Scorchers two seasons ago, and loved her time in orange so much, she has signed on to play for WA‚Äôs WNCL side as well ‚Äî a welcome boost for a team which has just laboured through a COVID-impacted season on the road. Ben Smith Jackson Barrett But the WBBL‚Äôs leading run-scorer won‚Äôt be making WA her home, instead travelling from Queensland to play amid commitments abroad, including England‚Äôs The Hundred. ‚ÄúI just thought it was time for me to align my Big Bash club and my State organisation to the same place,‚Äù Mooney told The West Australian. ‚ÄúI have just been really impressed with how they go about it and I‚Äôm looking forward to being a part of that organisation. ‚ÄúJust working with the Perth Scorchers and everyone over there has been really exciting for me and something I am really proud of as well and proud to be a part of. ‚ÄúLast season was a pretty special time to be associated with the Scorchers. ‚ÄúI will feel completely the same about being associated with WA Cricket as well.‚Äù Mooney says a relatively open international schedule could leave the door ajar for an extended run of WNCL games, having sat out the opening rounds of the tournament for Queensland last year to give herself a break from the sport. ‚ÄúWe might play a few more WNCL games than we have in the past couple of years which is really exciting, given I will be wearing the yellow and black,‚Äù she said. The powerful left-handed opener debuted as a fresh-faced 16-year-old for the Fire, before carving out a stellar international career, averaging an even 50 from 54 ODIs, which includes one of Australia‚Äôs most famous ever innings ‚Äî an unbeaten 85 to lead Australia to the 2019 World Cup title in front of a record crowd at the MCG. She made her international debut deputising for Alyssa Healy with the gloves, before winning a spot of her own as a batter and partnering Healy at the top of the order. The 28-year-old said she held some apprehension about leaving the organisation that had helped shape her career, but was ready to take a leap, and had been wrestling with the idea since first joining the Scorchers. ‚ÄúObviously when you have been somewhere for so long there is a little bit of trepidation in moving on and doing something different, but at the same time you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know either,‚Äù Mooney said. ‚ÄúI had been weighing it up for a little while, it was just a matter of whether or not WA were willing to make it work a little bit with me being based in Brisbane and having lots of Australian commitments. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt in my best interests to pack up and move so I have been really overwhelmed and grateful for the support they have shown me allowing me to stay in Brisbane in my home and work with them about when I can be available in Perth throughout the season.‚Äù She finished as the leading run-scorer in the Scorchers‚Äô championship-winning campaign last summer, forming a formidable opening partnership with New Zealand legend and WBBL captain Sophie Devine. She said while she saw herself becoming a leader in the group, which blooded a number of youngsters in its tough campaign last year, incumbent captain Chloe Piparo had her backing. ‚ÄúThere are always opportunities to be a leader whether you have a title next to your name or not,‚Äù Mooney said. ‚ÄúI have probably realised that people can learn of experiences I have had playing cricket in Australia and around the world and if I can help other young girls coming through achieve some of the things I have in my career that will be pretty special for me as well. ‚ÄúI have got a lot of respect and time for Chloe and I think she does an outstanding job in that role. ‚ÄúJust being able to offer advice to Chloe and to my other teammates along the way will be plenty ... WA have said they value what I can offer them there.‚Äù Western Australia finished last summer‚Äôs campaign winless and dead last, but did get games into youngsters Molly Healy, Georgia Wyllie, Zoe Britcliffe and Maddy Darke. It came after WA cricket legend Nicole Bolton gave the sport away suddenly on the eve of the last domestic season ‚Äî a top-order whole Mooney will look to fill. WA coach Shelley Nitschke has been poached as interim coach of the Australian team after Matthew Mott was appointed England‚Äôs newly-created white-ball coaching role. Nitschke will take charge on an interim basis before a full-scale search for a permanent leader is conducted, but is likely to be in the running for the full-time position, in a similar vein to men‚Äôs coach Andrew McDonald.","pubDate":"2022-05-19 09:41:00","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-6859593/0da0ee09e977b5a7eb97868e1f928d49aa023e53-16x9-x501y453w2951h1660.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
