Team India all-rounder and currently the skipper of the debutant IPL franchise Gujarat Titans (GT), Hardik Pandya, has managed to take his side through to the playoffs, by defeating another debutant side in Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by 62 runs in the ongoing 15th season of the marquee league. Marred by injury since the 2021 T20 World Cup which was held in UAE, Pandya has not only marked his return back in the capacity of an able leader, but has also come up with some notable performances with both bat and the ball in the ongoing season as well. With the bat, the 28-year-old has so far scored 344 runs across 11 innings at an average of 38.22, with the help of three fifties. With the ball, he has scalped a total of 4 wickets across 6 innings, at an economy rate of 7.58 rpo. Hardik was up against his brother Krunal Pandya, who himself has performed decently well in the ongoing season, especially with the ball in hand. The Southpaw all-rounder has picked up 9 wickets across 10 innings, at a commendable Economy rate of 6.56 runs per Over for LSG, as his side too, is just one win away from securing a place in the playoffs.

The 28-year-old had dominated the headlines last year, when the Mumbai airport customs department had the possession of one of Pandya‚Äôs luxury watches worth INR 1.5 Crore (as mentioned by Pandya) which he had purchased from Dubai, for proper valuation and documentation. As per reports, Pandya has a watch collection worth almost INR 11 Crore.

From the same aforementioned brand, he also is in possession of the Patek Philippe Nautilus 5712R, which is reportedly worth INR 1.65 Crore. Moreover, in June 2020, Pandya had also uploaded a couple of photos after taking, what he called it the ‚Äòchef duties at the Pandya household‚Äô, of the Rolex Oyster Perpetual Daytona Cosmograph which can be purchased for INR 1 Crore. ¬† View this post on Instagram ¬† A post shared by Hardik Himanshu Pandya (@hardikpandya93) Who is elder Hardik or Krunal?

During the 57th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans in Pune, Gujarat Titans beat Lucknow Super Giants by 62 runs. Having registered their ninth victory of the season, table-toppers Titans have become the first team to seal a playoffs berth. Coming on the back of four consecutive victories, Super Giants were expected to seal a 145-run target in spite of the surface being a trickier one to bat on. A total batting collapse witnessed them getting bundled out for 82 in 13.5 overs. An innings which never really got going, captain KL Rahul (8) and his batters struggled out and out to miss an opportunity of qualifying before the opposition. With bowling figures of 3.5-0-24-4, Gujarat spinner Rashid Khan was the pick of their bowlers dismissed the likes of Krunal Pandya (5), Jason Holder (1), Deepak Hooda (27) and Avesh Khan (12). While debutant spinner Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore picked a couple of wickets in as many overs, pacer Yash Dayal also contributed with two wickets.

In what wasn‚Äôt the best of batting efforts, Gujarat thrived on the back of opening batter Shubman Gill scoring 63* (49) with the help of seven fours. While all-rounder Rahul Tewatia scored 22* (16) in a 24-ball 41-run fifth-wicket partnership, it was quite evident that GT failed to finish as well as they would‚Äôve liked at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium tonight. It was only in the hindsight that one realized the importance of Gill‚Äôs knock on a surface where all others batters failed to adjust. Hence, the 22-year old player was rightly awarded with the match award. ‚ÄúAlways pleasing when you‚Äôre there till the end and finish the game for your team. I didn‚Äôt expect the ball to seam as much at the start. It was nipping around, and then I expected the spinners to get some turn. I think they didn‚Äôt bowl up much.

The only change for Super Giants has come in the form of debutant batter Karan Sharma coming in for spinner Ravi Bishnoi. One of LSG‚Äôs three acquired players before the auction, Rahul didn‚Äôt provide any rationale behind leaving out Bishnoi. Readers must note that the 21-year old spinner has picked nine wickets at an average of 38.44, an economy rate of 8.23 and a strike rate of 28 this season. Sharma, who leads Uttar Pradesh in domestic cricket, was bought by Super Giants for his base price of INR 20 lakh. In his 10-match T20 career, 23-year old Sharma has scored 301 runs at an average of 33.44 and a strike rate of 136.19 and picked a couple of wickets in as many outings at an economy rate of 5.50.

Shubman Gill is in for a chat. He says that he started off well, but he had some unfortunate dismissals, but he has found his form in the last few games and he wants to carry his momentum. Adds that the next few games are important for them if they have to stay in the top two in the points table. Talking about his inspiration, Gill replies that while growing up, it was Sachin sir but once he retired and once he started to understand the game a bit more, he was always a fan of Virat Kohli. KL Rahul, the skipper of Lucknow, says they wanted to bowl first anyway. Adds that he was not aware of the stats here that the team batting first has won 8 out of the 11 times. Mentions that batting first could be tricky and it gives their bowlers the opportunity to see what the pitch has to offer. States that they are not chasing the perfect game and they have been finding ways to win. Further says that the challenges will be different this evening and it's important to hold their composure. Feels that it's important to assess the conditions quickly and get their tactics and strategies right. Informs that they have one change - Karan Sharma comes in for Ravid Bishnoi. Hardik Pandya, the captain of Gujarat says that they are batting as they want to put runs on the board and the pitch looks fine, won't change much. Tells that the pitches have played a role here but it's more important for them to see how many runs they can put and how they defend it. Says that they have won 5 games which they could have lost so the odds have caught up and it is important as a team for them to be positive. Adds that it's important for them to forget the defeats, learn from them and move on. States that as a team they need to be positive. Informs that they have made three changes - Matthew Wade, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore and Yash Dayal come in for Lockie Ferguson, Sai Sudharsan and Pradeep Sangwan. Mentions that all the changes are tactical. Lucknow (Playing XI) - Quinton de Kock (WK), KL Rahul (C), Deepak Hooda, Marcus Stoinis, Krunal Pandya, Ayush Badoni, Jason Holder, Dushmantha Chameera, Mohsin Khan, Karan Sharma (In for Ravi Bishnoi), Avesh Khan.

TOSS - The coin goes up and lands in favour of Hardik Pandya. GUJARAT ELECT TO BAT! Pitch report - It's a breezy evening here in Pune. The surface to be used is number 8, right at the centre and it has been used twice before. Most of the wickets here have been picked by the fast bowlers, i.e. 21 out of 25. The pitch doesn't have much grass and it wears a dry look. The seamers will get a lot of help from it and the breeze will also help. The last time these two sides met was at the start of the tournament and it was Gujarat who came out on top. Lucknow will like to settle a score here and become the first team to get into the playoffs. Whatever be the result, we are in for an intriguing contest. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates. Lucknow, on the flip side, are coming into this game after winning four games on the trot. They have the winning momentum by their side and will be coming into this contest high on confidence. They have been clinical in all the departments of the game and Hooda batting at number 3 has done wonders for them. A solid and in-form batting line-up backed by an exemplary bowling attack, Lucknow look like the favourite to take this match. Gujarat have had a great tournament so far, but they seem to have lost their rhythm. They are coming into this game after suffering consecutive losses. Their batting which has helped them win matches in crunch situations has not clicked in the last few games. That remains to be a slight issue. But, they are filled with match-winners and will have to step up in this important clash. Hello and a warm welcome folks to match number 57 between the newbies of the tournament, Lucknow and Gujarat. The way they have been performing they do not really seem like the newbies. Both these sides are sitting pretty in the top half of the table with only being separated by the net run rate. The winner of this contest will get stationed at the top of the table and will also cement its spot in the playoffs. Plenty riding on this top-of-the-table clash. Stay tuned for more updates... ...

The FairBreak Invitational, featuring England captain Heather Knight , West Indies skipper Stafanie Taylor and Pakistan's Sana Mir , opened last Wednesday accompanied by calls for better funding for the sport. Women's cricket has emerged as a marketing hit in recent years with international finals played at sold-out stadiums, including a record 86,000-plus at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the T20 World Cup decider in March 2020. Progress was halted by the pandemic but the sport bounced back with a successful World Cup in New Zealand, Australia beating Knight's England at a sold-out Hagley Oval last month. Knight, whose Barmy Army-sponsored FairBreak team includes players from Vanuatu and Rwanda, said it was time that women's cricket ended its financial reliance on the men's game.

A clash of the table-toppers, both Lucknow and Gujarat have 16 points under their belt on the back of winning eight and losing three out of their 11 league matches so far. With this match having it in it to power one of these two teams to 18 points , the same would be enough for confirmed a place in the Top Four. While Super Giants will take the field as a more confident unit by virtue of winning their last four matches, Titans will have to return to winning ways after two consecutive losses. Due for an impact-generating performance, GT opening batter Shubman Gill will be expected to stand tall on his potential in order for his team to bounce back. Second-highest run-scorer for Gujarat in their inaugural IPL season thus far, Gill has scored 321 runs at an average and strike rate of 29.18 and 138.96 respectively.

England‚Äôs cricket is going through a transformation phase, and they have made some vital changes in their system. Ben Stokes has been named the new test captain of the side after the sacking of Joe Root. It is being said that Gary Kirsten is the favourite to become the new red ball coach of the side, whereas Brendon McCullum is leading the race to be the next white-ball captain. England is trying to experiment with different coaches for different formats of the games. Rob Key backs Eoin Morgan to be England‚Äôs white-ball captain After the disappointing ICC World Cup 2015 campaign, the England cricket team decided to change their approach to playing the format. They changed their whole team, and Eoin Morgan was given the free hand to lead the side according to his way of playing. Under the captaincy of Eoin Morgan, England revolutionized the way to play the white-ball format of the game. England also won the ICC 2019 World Cup at their home. However, Eoin Morgan has been in a lean phase with the bat, and there have been a lot of talks about sacking him from the team. However, Rob Key, the new director of English cricket has confirmed that Eoin Morgan‚Äôs captaincy is in his own hands, and he will play a part in England‚Äôs white-ball plans. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spoken to Eoin quite a bit,‚Äù Key said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll always do what‚Äôs right for English cricket. He‚Äôs pretty clear on that himself, if you‚Äôve got a great captain, which Eoin Morgan is, that‚Äôs like playing with 12.‚Äù Sir Clive Lloyd received his knighthood and Eoin Morgan received his CBE for services to cricket in a ceremony at Windsor Castle today pic.twitter.com/0ovwds8jbc ‚Äî ESPNcricinfo (@ESPNcricinfo) January 12, 2022 Rob Key insists that a captain impacts the game by his every decision on the field and not just by his batting. Key said that Morgan is one of the best in the business. ‚ÄúAs a captain, you [make an] impact with your decision-making: every decision you make, within a ball, you will know if that‚Äôs been the right decision or not and Eoin Morgan is the best in the world at that,‚Äù Key added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure at some point, as Eoin will probably tell you himself, if he feels he‚Äôs not that then I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll do the best thing for English cricket. He always has done.‚Äù The post ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a great captain, which Eoin Morgan is, that‚Äôs like playing with 12‚Äù: Rob Key backs Eoin Morgan to remain England‚Äôs white-ball captain, ye rakhe appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-05-10 11:15:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CSA drops all charges of misconduct against Boucher","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/cricket-south-africa-drops-all-disciplinary-charges-including-racism-against-mark-boucher-2022-05-10-775492","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Tuesday gave a clean chit to current national coach Mark Boucher and dropped all charges of gross misconduct, including racism.
