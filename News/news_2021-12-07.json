While the traditional chips, hot dog and a pie have survived the takeover, a new menu reveals cricket fans will be living high on the hog at the ground. Sport’s greatest rivalry is just around the corner and you can catch the Ashes live and ad-break free during play. New to Kayo? Start your free trial today > Alongside the old favourites, there are plenty of new fine dining options available. Feel like a steak at the cricket? The Tajima Wagyu is $60. What about seafood options? Pavilion Fish has you covered with Chilled Tiger Prawns for $25, Rock Oysters for $22, Grilled King Salmon for $38 and Raw Fish for $35. There are also noodle and dumplings options available, as well as slices from gourmet pizza place Vinnie’s Pizza — and not to mention kale bowls on offer from the Healthy Cafe. “We know that our customers expect a world class, high quality experience, whether that be while dining in one of our restaurants or enjoying a snack at a sporting match,” Merivale Group Operations manager Debbie Higgins said, per The Daily Telegraph . “It was important to us to ensure we provided an option for everyone on our stadium menu, from The Pavilion’s seafood to Jimmy’s wraps. “Vinnie’s Pizza was a hit, especially the margherita pizza and the chicken tenders.” It was revealed last month Hemmes , who has built an empire of Sydney venues, had won a competitive bidding process, beating out the likes of Bourke Street Bakery, Flying Fish and Chips, and a bidder with links to celebrity chef Matt Moran to land the deal to run food and drinks ventures both at the SCG and Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) when it opens in 2022. Merivale landed the six-year deal, replacing previous supplier Delaware North, which is the MCG’s supplier. Hemmes said the new deal would result in 1000 hospitality jobs across the venues. Merivale have opened new food options including The Pavilion, the members-only Bistro 1886, Dan Hong’s famous spring rolls and Smokehouse, a sports bar which will serve craft beer and smoked dishes. Hemmes operates about 70 venues spanning pubs, clubs, restaurants and function spaces including high-priced hot spots The Ivy, Coogee Pavilion, The Establishment and The Royal. While the debut of Hemmes’ menu options may not have had the start it was hoping for on Sunday night, with the BBL opener attracting just 10,013 fans through the door to see the Sydney Sixers’ drubbing of the Melbourne Stars , cricket and food fans alike will still have plenty of opportunities to try the new options.

The tourists managed just 29 overs of action in their first internal warm-up, while their second saw days one and two washed out before they eventually got some game time in on days three and four. Australia named their side three days ahead of the first Test, while England are keeping their plans under wraps - and, with further rain expected in Brisbane before and during the match, how might that affect team selection? Jack Leach has got plenty of practice in over the past nine months - when it comes to carrying the drinks, that is. The left-arm spinner's last Test appearance came during the final match of the series in India, when he was unable to extract the kind of lethal turn from the Ahmedabad pitch obtained by Ravi Ashwin and Axar Patel to condemn England to an innings defeat. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Since then, Leach has spent an entire summer as a non-playing member of the squad, with England opting instead to overload their line-up with seamers and rely on captain Joe Root or the now-retired Moeen Ali to offer a modicum of variety. They could maintain that policy if the Gabba wicket appears to be on the green side - but there is little doubt that Ben Stokes' return raises the prospect of Leach featuring in the first Test. Not so much because of what the all-rounder offers with the ball, but because of his presence in the middle order. That factor makes Leach more likely to get the nod over his former Somerset spin colleague Dom Bess, who is generally acknowledged to be a superior batter and therefore a better bet to add a useful 30 or 40 further down the line-up. Speaking on the Sky Sports Ashes Podcast , pundit Rob Key said: \"I would play Leach but he is going to have to be a mentally-tough lad, having gone through the whole summer with it almost seeming like Root doesn't back him. \"He is going to have to try and bowl in pretty tough conditions for spinners. He will be compared to Nathan Lyon so good luck to him. \"But you have to play a spinner as far as I am concerned - unless it is that one per cent chance that it is so green.\" There's very little time for a breather during this Ashes series, with only three blank days between the scheduled end of the Gabba Test and the start of the second match in Adelaide. Inevitably, that raises the question of whether England can realistically expect both members of their long-established seam pairing - James Anderson, 39, and Stuart Broad, four years his junior, to withstand a punishing schedule. It must be said that the situation has been clumsily managed in the past, with Anderson being rushed back for the last Ashes series only to break down, and Broad's nose put firmly out of joint by his omission against West Indies in 2020. Yet it is also worth considering that, with the second Test a day-night affair, there must be a strong temptation to hold back Anderson in particular and entrust him with the pink ball at the Adelaide Oval. \"The range of conditions determines selection,\" said Sky Sports' Nasser Hussain. \"Say you turn up and it is your typical Brisbane pitch and the sun is shining. If that is the case, you will definitely need your main spinner in Leach. \"You will also need some kind of variety in your attack, which is Mark Wood's pace. You would then probably need to split up Broad and Anderson with the day-night Test to follow. \"You have to judge conditions well on the opening morning at Brisbane, which previous England captains haven't.\" Even if England opt to play both Anderson at Broad at Brisbane, that still leaves the issue of one other bowling place to be filled. Ollie Robinson, essentially, is the man in possession after a highly impressive first international summer that yielded 28 wickets in five Tests at an average of below 20. With Jofra Archer missing the tour due to injury, Mark Wood is England's only option if they feel raw pace is the order of the day. Yet Wood's own injury history is well documented and, having missed the first four of England's six games at the T20 World Cup with an ankle problem, there will be concerns as to whether he can last the course. Again, England will want to avoid starting the series with a lengthy-looking tail and that consideration could well give Robinson, or perhaps Chris Woakes, the edge here. Sky Sports' Michael Atherton said: \"I think the balance of the side is pretty set with Stokes back. Five bowlers, with Stokes being one of them and Leach as the spinner - then it's which of the other three you go with. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"Are you going to put Anderson and Broad together? Is Wood going to be able to get through following his injury issues in the T20 World Cup? The others are Woakes and Robinson, really. \"It's three from those five. They will turn up in the morning, look at the surface and decide how they are best going to take 20 wickets.\" Unusually, there has been little debate as to the make-up of England's batting and, with Stokes pencilled in to resume his preferred position at five, there appears to be just one place up for grabs. The plan to see whether Haseeb Hameed can forge a solid opening partnership with Rory Burns is still in progress, while Dawid Malan's experience of the last Ashes tour - during which he hit a century at Perth - should count in his favour. So it looks as though only the identity of the man who follows Stokes to the crease is still unclear, with Jonny Bairstow, Ollie Pope and Dan Lawrence the candidates to fill that role. Pope, quite frankly, could consider himself lucky to be handed another chance against India at The Oval - having failed to reach 50 in his previous 14 Test knocks - but he made the most of that opportunity with an innings of 81 on home turf. Lawrence registered exactly the same score earlier in the season against New Zealand yet, despite some gutsy efforts in the Indian sub-continent last winter, his overall average of 27.32 is underwhelming. Bairstow, with not only 78 Tests but the experience of five previous Ashes series under his belt, will be viewed as the safest pair of hands available and should take the number six position when England launch their bid to regain the urn.","image_url":"https://e2.365dm.com/21/12/1920x1080/skysports-cricket-england-stuart-broad_5606537.jpg?20211206171559","source_id":"skysports"},{"title":"“Virat Kohli worships Test Cricket”: Ravi Shastri heaps praise on Virat Kohli after India win Test series versus New Zealand","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-virat-kohli-worships-test-cricket-ravi-shastri-heaps-praise-on-virat-kohli-after-india-win-test-series-versus-new-zealand/","keywords":["Cricket","New Zealand tour of India 2021","Ravi Shastri","Virat Kohli"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ravi Shastri heaps praise on Virat Kohli after India clinch yet another Test series victory on home soil against New Zealand.

The 372-run margin of victory is India’s biggest in terms of runs ever in the Test format. The 372-run loss is also New Zealand’s biggest defeat by runs in history. With this victory India go back to the number 1 spot in the ICC Test rankings, with the Kiwis falling down to the second spot.

Ravichandran Ashwin, who picked up a total of 14 wickets across the series, at an average of 11.35 was adjudged the ‘Player of the series’. This was Ashwin’s 9th Player-of-the-Series award in Tests, the joint second most for any player in the format. Skipper Virat Kohli, on the other hand marked his return in some style as the skipper in Tests for India, after opting to rest in the first Test at Kanpur. Ravi Shastri heaps praise on Virat Kohli Post securing their record 14th consecutive series victory in Tests at home, Team India’s former head coach Ravi Shastri piled up praises on Virat Kohli regarding his dedication and commitment towards Test Cricket. “I think if any team has been an ambassador for Test match over the last five years, it is this Indian cricket team. Virat worships Test match cricket, as do most of the team, which might surprise the world because of the amount of one-day cricket India plays, then IPL. If you ask anyone in the team, 99 percent of them would say they love Test match cricket. That’s why what India has done in the last five years – remain as the No. 1 team in the world at the end of every year,” Shastri told renowned author Jeffrey Archer on his podcast. Shastri further exclaimed that the greatest legacy this team would leave behind is the manner in which they embraced the Test format. “We may have lost the one-off WTC final against New Zealand – but otherwise We have dominated the format for the last five years. To win two series in Australia, to win the series that was taking place in England, to win everywhere around the world – white-ball and red-ball cricket, and to set a benchmark in red-ball cricket, the fast bowlers coming to the fore – unheard of from the Indian cricket team – it was remarkable. For me the greatest legacy this generation and this lot of players will leave is the way they have played Test cricket and embraced it,” exclaimed a proud Ravi Shastri.   The post “Virat Kohli worships Test Cricket”: Ravi Shastri heaps praise on Virat Kohli after India win Test series versus New Zealand appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2021-12-06 17:33:03","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"SA vs IND 1st Test at Centurion from December 26 in updated schedule of tour","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/sa-vs-ind-1st-test-at-centurion-from-dec-26-in-updated-schedule-of-tour-south-africa-vs-india-748410","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Monday announced an updated schedule of India's curtailed tour of the country with Centurion hosting the first of the three Tests from December 26.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-06 17:20:27","full_description":"Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Monday announced an updated schedule of India's curtailed tour of the country with Centurion hosting the first of the three Tests from December 26.

As with any home contest, the Ashes series is Australia’s to lose, and even more so given how ropey England’s 2021 has been. But expectations exist to be upset, and this is largely the same Australian side soundly beaten last season by India after dominating the first Test, and that hasn’t played since. Starting at the top, no one manifests being unproven like Marcus Harris. He has earned his spot in the manner always prescribed: 5,001 runs averaging 51 in first-class cricket outside Tests in the past five years before this season, which he started with another Sheffield Shield ton. If anyone will be sympathetic to the domestic haymaker it will be selector George Bailey, with the grass from his playing days still lodged in his spikes. But while Harris can boss Junction Oval, he hasn’t clicked in his 10 Test appearances. He topped the team for runs in his first series in 2018-19, but it was a modest tally in another loss to India. He was poor against a mild Sri Lankan attack to follow that, gave barely a whimper in England for the 2019 Ashes, lost his place, then returned for one match without impressing least season. It’s up to him to disprove the impression that the domestic lion is an international lamb. His opening partner does have a commanding record, but David Warner will be a bit of an unknown quantity to start this series. When he and Steve Smith received their long suspensions in Cape Town in 2018, a year without a Test match sounded like a lot. Tack it on to the pandemic era though, and there is a gouge out of each of their careers. In not much less than four years since his ban began, Warner has played 12 times. Smith has played 14. Both are certainly good enough to pick up after the latest delay, but it does increase the degree of difficulty. Perhaps this will be the summer that establishes Marnus Labuschagne for good. His breakout period in 2019-20 was exceptional – no Australian has scored more across five home Tests than his 896 runs. His sophomore year against India was solid, though at times when he could have taken charge he didn’t convert good scores to great ones. That said, he twice did enough to set up what should have been wins, only for India’s fifth-day batting to thwart him. His lead-up domestically has been full of confidence. At some stage someone needs to take the mantle from Smith. Like Harris, Travis Head is a left-hander with a compulsive looseness outside his off stump. But there is something about his returns that makes selectors stay interested. Head might always look like his wicket is imminent, but he almost always manages to put a score together first. Only five times in 31 innings has he been out in single figures. In between times, his 20s, 30s and 50s have helped form important partnerships more than once. If England’s bowlers can work their way this far down the order in good time, they will fancy themselves to apply pressure. All-rounder Cameron Green is a towering talent, but only played four Tests for Australia before having to wait a year. He’ll almost be starting afresh, is yet to score key runs in a match and is still waiting for his first Test wicket. Alex Carey will be keeping wicket on debut, with all the attendant pressure that brings. Both have a task ahead of them. And so Australia will be hoping to gather enough runs, while relying in large part on their old firm of bowlers. Patrick Cummins, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, the four who authored the 4-0 result last time England visited. They will be trying to recreate history, though the world has changed. Cummins is captain now. Hazlewood is bowling as well as ever. Starc and Lyon sputtered last season as the wickets ran out, but again the long layoff means there is no form line. In the end, all involved will hope that the occasion of the Ashes will be enough to bring out anything in them that may have retreated to latency. The alternative, that the occasion overwhelms them, does not bear thinking about. But if anyone is having a poor run, those on the sidelines will be just as keen to enter the fray. Things can change quickly in a series like this, and no one can be sure of much. To name your team without waiting until the coin toss is surety enough.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4df71534c67383f85a181f7481a5c5e939d528d/0_0_2341_1405/master/2341.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d2cb74aceb2a87799334780e126dfa7a","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Big Bash league 2021 coaches and support staff: Coaches of all teams in BBL 2021-22","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-big-bash-league-2021-coaches-and-support-staff-coaches-of-all-teams-in-bbl-2021-22/","keywords":["Cricket","BBL 2021-22","Big Bash League"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Big Bash league 2021 coaches and support staff: The Sportsrush presents before you all the coaches from the ongoing 11th season of BBL.

The second test will be staged in Johannesburg from Jan. 3-7, with the third in Cape Town from Jan. 11-15 in a revised itinerary after India requested to arrive a week later than originally planned for the tour. The teams will also contest a three-match One-Day International Series between Jan. 19-23, with the first two games played in Paarl and the third in Cape Town.

While speaking to renowned author Jeffrey Archer on his podcast, Shastri spoke highly of Kohli, the captain, who literally \"worships\" the longest format of the game and gives it his all, for the team to succeed. He highlighted the fact that each member of the Indian team would choose Test cricket over any format of the sport and that has played a huge part in the team topping the Test rankings for a considerable amount of time. \"I think if any team has been an ambassador for Test matches over the last five years, it is this Indian cricket team. Virat worships Test match cricket, as do most of the team, which might surprise the world because of the amount of one-day cricket India plays, then IPL. If you ask anyone in the team, 99 percent of them would say they love Test match cricket. That's why, what India have done in the last five years - remain as the No. 1 team in the world at the end of every year,\" Shastri said. Shastri listed out the achievements of the team in Tests during his reign as the head coach. He talked about the one-off World Test Championship (WTC) final loss against New Zealand, India's fighting comeback to win two series in Australia along with a phenomenal performance in the series against England in their den this year. \"We may have lost the one-off WTC final against New Zealand - but otherwise we have dominated the format for the last five years. To win two series in Australia, to win the series that was taking place in England, to win everywhere around the world - white-ball and red-ball cricket, and to set a benchmark in red-ball cricket, the fast bowlers coming to the fore - unheard of from the Indian cricket team - it was remarkable,\" added the former India coach and all-rounder. A proud Shastri also stated that the \"greatest legacy\" of this generation, which was to have embraced the longest format of the game in trying circumstances to keep it alive and kicking. Promoted \"For me the greatest legacy this generation and this lot of players will leave is the way they have played Test cricket and embraced it,\" he concluded. Shastri stepped down as the head coach of Team India post the T20 World Cup 2021 held in UAE and Oman. He was replaced by Rahul Dravid at the helm.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/2au4rjgs_virat-kohli_120x90_06_December_21.jpg","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"\"Cricket mad family, really\" - Watch Ajaz Patel's interview with Ravichandran Ashwin","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-ind-vs-nz-2021-cricket-mad-family-really-watch-ajaz-patel-s-interview-ravichandran-ashwin?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Abhimanyu Bose"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-06 13:32:57","full_description":"New Zealand's Ajaz Patel made history in the Mumbai Test, becoming only the third player ever to take all ten wickets in a Test innings.

Ajaz Patel grew up in Mumbai before his family immigrated to New Zealand when he was seven. His father was a left-arm pacer, and Patel followed on his footsteps. But he revealed that due to his height, rather the lack of it, he switched to left-arm spin about a decade ago. He also spoke about how his family is mad about the sport. Patel said that even after moving to New Zealand , they would play cricket in the backyard, even at odd hours. Regarding his switch from pace to spin, Ajaz Patel said: He was also full of praise for Ashwin, saying: Ravichandran Ashwin praised Ajaz Patel for his historic ten-wicket haul and also gifted him an India jersey signed by the entire squad. Speaking about his historic achievement, the 33-year-old said: Asked if he did anything special to get all ten wickets in the innings, Ajaz Patel said that he just kept bowling in good areas. He also revealed that he was exhausted after the first innings, and the match in general. Ajaz Patel bowled 47.5 overs in India's first innings for his ten wickets. Soon after that, he bowled 26 more in India's second as New Zealand were bowled out for just 62 in their first essay. Ajaz Patel ended the match with 14 wickets, in what would be a memorable series for him, even though India emerged the victors.","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2021/12/d8a6a-16387934715406-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda"},{"title":"India has been an ambassador for Test cricket over the last 5 years: Ravi Shastri","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/india-has-been-an-ambassador-for-test-cricket-over-the-last-5-years-ravi-shastri-1884784-2021-12-06?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India has been an ambassador for Test cricket over the last 5 years: Ravi Shastri","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-06 13:05:37","full_description":"Former head coach Ravi Shastri heaped praise on the Indian team and captain Virat Kohli for embracing Test cricket and being the \"ambassador\" of the format over the last five years.

Join Kayo Now > But Ben Duckett (46 runs off 35 balls) and Sam Heazlett (42 off 37) steadied the ship for the Heat and helped them post a defendable total. Heazlett was dropped twice in consecutive balls off the bowling of Ben Cutting when he was on 27. Thunder wicketkeeper Sam Billings nearly caught a skied shot, sprinting to dive for the ball only for it to bobble out of his gloves. Then the very next ball, Matthew Gilkes dropped another chance when Heazlett hit the ball high in to the air. The two chances appeared so similar the commentators thought they were watching a replay of the first dropped catch. Australian cricket great Andrew Symonds said: “I thought here we go, got a little replay, a little recap. But oh no, two in two balls.” Brett Lee added: “Can’t believe that. Same result.” “Incredible,” Fox Cricket’s Mark Howard said. “So extraordinary, Roy thought it was a replay! But I can guarantee you it’s two balls and two dropped catches. It’s all happening at Manuka.” We still can't believe Sam Heazlett got away with this twice in a row!

The Heat’s underwhelming performance was highlighted when wicketkeeper Jimmy Peirson didn’t lay a glove on a high miscue by Billings, who was resigned to his fate and was walking off. But once Gilkes departed for a quickfire 20 off 10 balls, Billings and Alex Ross combined to put on an unbeaten 109-run partnership to see the Thunder home with 17 balls to spare. Ross (61 off 46) was particularly impressive, dispatching the Heat’s bowlers to the boundary with some powerful stroke play. The partnership between Ross and Billings equalled the Thunder’s highest ever Big Bash record set by Michael Hussey and Eoin Morgan in 2013. ‘DJ Sue’ steals the show As the players were warming up for the game, attention was drawn to the DJ pumping the tunes at Manuka Oval. The woman spinning the decks under a giant blow-up lime green helmet and pumping up the crowd isn’t your usual DJ. “That is DJ Sue, knocking out the bangers in Canberra,” commentator Mark Howard said on Fox Cricket. “DJ Sue is on fire.” DJ Sue, who is the Thunder’s DJ of choice at all their home games in Canberra, first got in to the profession “about 11 years ago”. “I went to the wedding and the DJ didn’t play the requests and I thought, ‘That’d be a pretty awesome job to do’,” she told former Australian captain Lisa Sthalekar. “I love going out, having lots of fun, playing the music that people want to hear. That’s what it’s all about I reckon.” Viewers couldn’t get enough of DJ Sue and her infectious enthusiasm. Cricket writer Annesha Ghosh described her as a “boss lady”.

The club came under intense fire over their handling of Azeem Rafiq's allegations of racism and harassment, with chairman Roger Hutton and chief executive Mark Arthur standing down. On Friday, the county announced that 16 members of the coaching and medical staff had left the club, including first-team coach Andrew Gale and director of cricket Martyn Moxon. Gough, 51, who had two playing spells with Yorkshire, captaining them in the second, has been appointed initially until the end of the 2022 season. \"Like many, I have followed how the club handled the recent racism allegations with sadness and anger,\" said the former England paceman. \"I want to play my part in rebuilding cricket in Yorkshire and I am looking forward to working with the exceptionally talented group of players here,\" he added. \"I am also aware of my wider responsibility to listen to everyone and ensure that every person who is associated with this club feels welcome, instilling values we want associated with the White Rose: honesty, straight-talking, hard work, integrity and excellence,\" he said. New chairman Kamlesh Patel praised Gough's \"infectious\" enthusiasm. \"As we start on this journey with Darren, we want to engage everyone at the club and involve as many people as possible in shaping our direction,\" he said. \"We have a considerable job ahead of us, but we are ready to embrace the opportunity together and build a brighter future for Yorkshire County Cricket Club,\" he added. England captain Joe Root, who plays for Yorkshire, had earlier welcomed reports that Gough was set to be appointed. Promoted \"From my experience of spending time with Goughy he is obviously very passionate and knowledgeable about the game,\" the skipper said ahead of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane this week. \"His love for it is clear for anyone to see. And for the club as well, I'm sure he will be wanting to bring all of that to the fore and all of his experiences and achievements within the game and pass that knowledge onto the group,\" he concluded.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/vk0m0kt4_darren-gough_120x90_06_December_21.jpg","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"IND vs NZ: MCA felicitates Ajaz Patel for his 10 wicket-haul","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-nz-mca-felicitates-ajaz-patel-for-his-10-wicket-haul-748376","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai Cricket Association chief Vijay Patil on Monday felicitated New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel, who became only the third bowler to take all 10 wickets in an innings.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-06 11:59:03","full_description":"Mumbai Cricket Association chief Vijay Patil on Monday felicitated New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel, who became only the third bowler to take all 10 wickets in an innings.
