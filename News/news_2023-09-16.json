Pierre de Bruyn, one of his formative coaches at Tuks, is convinced he's the best white-ball batter in world cricket currently. There should be a substantial number of additions to that group following his sensational, career-best effort in the 4th ODI, an encounter the Proteas won by 164 runs to render Sunday's final match a decider. Klaasen was simply mesmerising as he took just 83 deliveries to reach an incredible 174, blitzing 13 fours and 13 sixes against an attack that was understandably shell-shocked. His innings, the eighth-highest individual score by a South African in ODIs, was also primarily responsible for his team reaching a mammoth 416/5, their fourth-highest in the format and also the seventh occasion they've passed the magical 400 mark - a world record. SCORECARD | Proteas v Australia, 4th ODI The 32-year-old's effort was also notable for the fact that he only came to the crease a delivery after the 25th over, attesting to his priceless ability of teeing off and finding boundaries when the fielding restrictions - relatively speaking - are lifted. The majority of his special qualities were on display as he chunkily hit square of the wicket on the off-side and unleashed an astonishing fusillade of hits on the on-side that sailed over the fence. Then, of course, there was also the breathtaking \"hockey flick\" played fine on the off-side that sailed over the third man boundary, an innovation his former Titans team-mate Chris Morris said he worked on over the course of a whole domestic season a few years back when Mark Boucher was still coach at the franchise. Yet it would be an injustice not to also highlight the role of the grizzled David Miller in a record fifth-wicket stand of 222 off just 92 balls, the left-hander ending with an unbeaten 82 off just 45. Their partnership boasted a run rate of 14.47, the highest for any alliance over 200 runs in the 50-over game. Moreover, South Africa scored 173 runs in the last 10 overs of the innings, beating England's 164 against Netherlands in 2022 and hapless Adam Zampa, who's 5th on the ICC's world rankings for ODI bowlers, bore the brunt of that assault, eventually equalling the worst figures in history of 0/113 in a 10-over quota. He now shares the ignominy with fellow countryman Mick Lewis, who conceded all those runs in the famous 438-match of 2006. It was indeed freakish, especially in light of the Proteas being restricted to 120/2 in the first 25 overs of their innings. That was down to some customarily disciplined bowling from Josh Hazlewood, Marcus Stoinis and Durban-born Michael Neser. Still, that progress was steady enough to allow for Quinton de Kock (45) to show he can adapt to two-paced surfaces and Rassie van der Dussen - back in for a rested Temba Bavuma - to craft a typically gritty 62 that grants him some much-needed form. Armed with the luxury of a target that was unlikely to be overhauled, the Proteas attack were given more freedom to experiment and arguably also an opportunity to relax. Handed the new ball, Lungi Ngidi looked like a man transformed, shelving most of his innovations and focusing on orthodox line-and-length stuff, a decision that immediately put South Africa in the driving seat. He had the previously irrepressible David Warner caught with a square drive to a packed off-side field after suffocating him, before trapping Mitchell Marsh in front. It clearly inspired Kagiso Rabada to reclaim his fire as he bullied a middle-order that simply couldn't get going, a situation exacerbated by Travis Head retiring hurt and going for scans on a suspected broken hand. Rookies Gerald Coetzee and Marco Jansen both tried to match their stalwart seniors' aggression and incision, but were again let down by their execution. At least it didn't matter on the night as Ngidi (4/51) and Rabada (3/41) dominated. It was all very hard on a powerfully defiant Alex Carey, who was brilliant in stroking a 77-ball 99 before falling to a Rabada snorter.","pubDate":"2023-09-15 20:34:40","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9353/27cf4aa86e474904a4952102bda3bb11.jpg","source_id":"news24","source_priority":1882,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"60cf81647aac638229aa26a891e49e31","title":"ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023: Pick England's team for New Zealand opener","link":"https://www.newsr.in/n/Sports/1zpnjb1sx8/ICC-Men-Cricket-World-Cup-2023-Pick.htm","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England's World Cup players have largely played their last competitive game before the tournament, but who makes your side for the New Zealand game?

It is only a matter of days since Malan was being floated as a potential fall-guy should Harry Brook find himself parachuted into the squad for the tournament in India, but he has picked his moment expertly, following knocks of 54 and 96 with his fifth ODI ton. Now, rather than finding himself squeezed out of the trip entirely, he seems likelier to slide into the first-choice XI. Roy, England’s long-established opener, was left kicking his heels in the dressing room once more and may now be sweating over his place. He was one of the stars of England’s 2019 triumph but his fitness issues have emerged at the worst possible time as the final squad announcement nears. Captain Jos Buttler, who admitted at the toss that Roy is frustrated by his struggles, suggested England could add the Surrey man to a second-string side that faces Ireland next week in a bid to get him up and running. His absence opened the door for Malan and he played his part impeccably, scoring 14 boundaries and three sixes as he occupied the crease for 40 overs with a combination of touch and timing that eluded his team-mates. When he finally departed, reaching for a cut and nicking Rachin Ravindra, it was an ill-fitting end. By then he had eased past 1,000 ODI runs in his 21st appearance – claiming a share of Kevin Pietersen and Jonathan Trott’s joint record. With an average of 61.52 and a strike-rate of 96.52, he has a formidable track record by any reckoning. England rested Ben Stokes after the exertions of his record-breaking 182 on Wednesday evening but Brook was unable to make a go of his chance at number four, allowing Roy some respite. Brook was dismissed for 10 when he hit a Ravindra drag down straight to mid-on and, with 37 from his three outings this series, has failed to amplify his case. Joe Root’s struggle for rhythm also continued, twice dropped in single figures before losing his stump for 29 aiming a slog sweep at Ravindra, who finished with four for 60. Tim Southee paid a heavy price for his handling error in the 14th over, leaving the field for X-rays which revealed a fractured and dislocated right thumb. Like Roy, his World Cup place now hangs in the air. A majestic Malan! 💯 We put up 3⃣1⃣1⃣ 🏏💥 See the best of the action so far 👇 — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Buttler was the best of the rest for England, chipping in a lively 36, before New Zealand took five for 68 in a busy final 10. Just 48 hours earlier New Zealand had fallen short by a massive margin of 181 batting second and would have been eager to show greater resolve this time. England, though, refused to let them into the game. Buttler took care of the dangerous Devon Conway in the fifth over, flinging off his right glove and running the opener out with an opportunistic effort behind the stumps, then held on to Will Young as David Willey found an outside. Having failed to bring the required power to the powerplay, and with news of Southee’s fractured thumb emerging, an air of resignation appeared to take hold. Twice in a row a Buttler bowling change paid off in the first over, Brydon Carse firing one into Daryl Mitchell’s off stump with a nipping delivery approaching 90mph and Moeen darting an off-break down the slope and right through Tom Latham. At 88 for four, and with two injured tailenders, it looked like game over. Ravindra completed a productive evening in north London by smashing 61 from number seven, but by then Moeen had already done enough. He had Henry Nicholls lbw thanks to Buttler’s insistence on calling for DRS, then picked off Kyle Jamieson and Matt Henry with successive deliveries.

He was one of the stars of England’s 2019 triumph but his fitness issues have emerged at the worst possible time as the final squad announcement nears. Captain Jos Buttler, who admitted at the toss that Roy is frustrated by his struggles, suggested England could add the Surrey man to a second-string side that faces Ireland next week in a bid to get him up and running. His absence opened the door for Malan and he played his part impeccably, scoring 14 boundaries and three sixes as he occupied the crease for 40 overs with a combination of touch and timing that eluded his team-mates. When he finally departed, reaching for a cut and nicking Rachin Ravindra, it was an ill-fitting end. By then he had eased past 1,000 ODI runs in his 21st appearance – claiming a share of Kevin Pietersen and Jonathan Trott’s joint record. With an average of 61.52 and a strike-rate of 96.52, he has a formidable track record by any reckoning. England rested Ben Stokes after the exertions of his record-breaking 182 on Wednesday evening but Brook was unable to make a go of his chance at number four, allowing Roy some respite. Brook was dismissed for 10 when he hit a Ravindra drag down straight to mid-on and, with 37 from his three outings this series, has failed to amplify his case. Joe Root’s struggle for rhythm also continued, twice dropped in single figures before losing his stump for 29 aiming a slog sweep at Ravindra, who finished with four for 60. Tim Southee paid a heavy price for his handling error in the 14th over, leaving the field for X-rays which revealed a fractured and dislocated right thumb. Like Roy, his World Cup place now hangs in the air. A majestic Malan! 💯 We put up 3⃣1⃣1⃣ 🏏💥 See the best of the action so far 👇 — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Buttler was the best of the rest for England, chipping in a lively 36, before New Zealand took five for 68 in a busy final 10. Just 48 hours earlier New Zealand had fallen short by a massive margin of 181 batting second and would have been eager to show greater resolve this time. England, though, refused to let them into the game. Buttler took care of the dangerous Devon Conway in the fifth over, flinging off his right glove and running the opener out with an opportunistic effort behind the stumps, then held on to Will Young as David Willey found an outside. Having failed to bring the required power to the powerplay, and with news of Southee’s fractured thumb emerging, an air of resignation appeared to take hold. Twice in a row a Buttler bowling change paid off in the first over, Brydon Carse firing one into Daryl Mitchell’s off stump with a nipping delivery approaching 90mph and Moeen darting an off-break down the slope and right through Tom Latham. At 88 for four, and with two injured tailenders, it looked like game over. Ravindra completed a productive evening in north London by smashing 61 from number seven, but by then Moeen had already done enough. He had Henry Nicholls lbw thanks to Buttler’s insistence on calling for DRS, then picked off Kyle Jamieson and Matt Henry with successive deliveries. Ben Lister defied a hamstring strain to block the hat-trick before Sam Curran ended Ravindra’s spree with a yorker.","pubDate":"2023-09-15 19:11:28","image_url":"https://www.echo-news.co.uk/resources/images/17233330/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"echo_uk","source_priority":159993,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"73f9b2e72e82649c16eda951ec34113c","title":"Zampa records joint-worst ODI bowling figures","link":"https://www.newsr.in/n/Sports/1zpnjb1sl0/Zampa-records-joint-worst-ODI-bowling-figures.htm","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia leg-spinner Adam Zampa records the joint-worst bowling figures in one-day international cricket in a heavy 164-run defeat by South Africa.

Pierre de Bruyn, one of his formative coaches at Tuks, is convinced he's the best white-ball batter in world cricket currently. There should be a substantial number of additions to that group following his sensational, career-best effort in the 4th ODI, an encounter the Proteas won by 164 runs to render Sunday's final match a decider. Klaasen was simply mesmerising as he took just 83 deliveries to reach an incredible 174, blitzing 13 fours and 13 sixes against an attack that was understandably shell-shocked. His innings, the eighth-highest individual score by a South African in ODIs, was also primarily responsible for his team reaching a mammoth 416/5, their fourth-highest in the format and also the seventh occasion they've passed the magical 400 mark - a world record. SCORECARD | Proteas v Australia, 4th ODI The 32-year-old's effort was also notable for the fact that he only came to the crease a delivery after the 25th over, attesting to his priceless ability of teeing off and finding boundaries when the fielding restrictions - relatively speaking - are lifted. The majority of his special qualities were on display as he chunkily hit square of the wicket on the off-side and unleashed an astonishing fusillade of hits on the on-side that sailed over the fence. Then, of course, there was also the breathtaking \"hockey flick\" played fine on the off-side that sailed over the third man boundary, an innovation his former Titans team-mate Chris Morris said he worked on over the course of a whole domestic season a few years back when Mark Boucher was still coach at the franchise. Yet it would be an injustice not to also highlight the role of the grizzled David Miller in a record fifth-wicket stand of 222 off just 92 balls, the left-hander ending with an unbeaten 82 off just 45. Their partnership boasted a run rate of 14.47, the highest for any alliance over 200 runs in the 50-over game. Moreover, South Africa scored 173 runs in the last 10 overs of the innings, beating England's 164 against Netherlands in 2022 and hapless Adam Zampa, who's 5th on the ICC's world rankings for ODI bowlers, bore the brunt of that assault, eventually equalling the worst figures in history of 0/113 in a 10-over quota. He now shares the ignominy with fellow countryman Mick Lewis, who conceded all those runs in the famous 438-match of 2006. It was indeed freakish, especially in light of the Proteas being restricted to 120/2 in the first 25 overs of their innings. That was down to some customarily disciplined bowling from Josh Hazlewood, Marcus Stoinis and Durban-born Michael Neser. Still, that progress was steady enough to allow for Quinton de Kock (45) to show he can adapt to two-paced surfaces and Rassie van der Dussen - back in for a rested Temba Bavuma - to craft a typically gritty 62 that grants him some much-needed form. Armed with the luxury of a target that was unlikely to be overhauled, the Proteas attack were given more freedom to experiment and arguably also an opportunity to relax. Handed the new ball, Lungi Ngidi looked like a man transformed, shelving most of his innovations and focusing on orthodox line-and-length stuff, a decision that immediately put South Africa in the driving seat. He had the previously irrepressible David Warner caught with a square drive to a packed off-side field after suffocating him, before trapping Mitchell Marsh in front. It clearly inspired Kagiso Rabada to reclaim his fire as he bullied a middle-order that simply couldn't get going, a situation exacerbated by Travis Head retiring hurt and going for scans on a suspected broken hand. Rookies Gerald Coetzee and Marco Jansen both tried to match their stalwart seniors' aggression and incision, but were again let down by their execution. At least it didn't matter on the night as Ngidi (4/51) and Rabada (3/41) dominated. It was all very hard on a powerfully defiant Alex Carey, who was brilliant in stroking a 77-ball 99 before falling to a Rabada snorter.","pubDate":"2023-09-15 20:34:40","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9353/27cf4aa86e474904a4952102bda3bb11.jpg","source_id":"news24","source_priority":1882,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"60cf81647aac638229aa26a891e49e31","title":"ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023: Pick England's team for New Zealand opener","link":"https://www.newsr.in/n/Sports/1zpnjb1sx8/ICC-Men-Cricket-World-Cup-2023-Pick.htm","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England's World Cup players have largely played their last competitive game before the tournament, but who makes your side for the New Zealand game?

His absence opened the door for Malan and he played his part impeccably, scoring 14 boundaries and three sixes as he occupied the crease for 40 overs with a combination of touch and timing that eluded his team-mates. When he finally departed, reaching for a cut and nicking Rachin Ravindra, it was an ill-fitting end. By then he had eased past 1,000 ODI runs in his 21st appearance – claiming a share of Kevin Pietersen and Jonathan Trott’s joint record. With an average of 61.52 and a strike-rate of 96.52, he has a formidable track record by any reckoning. England rested Ben Stokes after the exertions of his record-breaking 182 on Wednesday evening but Brook was unable to make a go of his chance at number four, allowing Roy some respite. Brook was dismissed for 10 when he hit a Ravindra drag down straight to mid-on and, with 37 from his three outings this series, has failed to amplify his case. Joe Root’s struggle for rhythm also continued, twice dropped in single figures before losing his stump for 29 aiming a slog sweep at Ravindra, who finished with four for 60. Tim Southee paid a heavy price for his handling error in the 14th over, leaving the field for X-rays which revealed a fractured and dislocated right thumb.

Just 48 hours earlier New Zealand had fallen short by a massive margin of 181 batting second and would have been eager to show greater resolve this time. England, though, refused to let them into the game. Buttler took care of the dangerous Devon Conway in the fifth over, flinging off his right glove and running the opener out with an opportunistic effort behind the stumps, then held on to Will Young as David Willey found an outside. Having failed to bring the required power to the powerplay, and with news of Southee’s fractured thumb emerging, an air of resignation appeared to take hold. Twice in a row a Buttler bowling change paid off in the first over, Brydon Carse firing one into Daryl Mitchell’s off stump with a nipping delivery approaching 90mph and Moeen darting an off-break down the slope and right through Tom Latham.

Ravindra completed a productive evening in north London by smashing 61 from number seven, but by then Moeen had already done enough.

Pierre de Bruyn, one of his formative coaches at Tuks, is convinced he's the best white-ball batter in world cricket currently. There should be a substantial number of additions to that group following his sensational, career-best effort in the 4th ODI, an encounter the Proteas won by 164 runs to render Sunday's final match a decider. Klaasen was simply mesmerising as he took just 83 deliveries to reach an incredible 174, blitzing 13 fours and 13 sixes against an attack that was understandably shell-shocked. His innings, the eighth-highest individual score by a South African in ODIs, was also primarily responsible for his team reaching a mammoth 416/5, their fourth-highest in the format and also the seventh occasion they've passed the magical 400 mark - a world record. SCORECARD | Proteas v Australia, 4th ODI The 32-year-old's effort was also notable for the fact that he only came to the crease a delivery after the 25th over, attesting to his priceless ability of teeing off and finding boundaries when the fielding restrictions - relatively speaking - are lifted. The majority of his special qualities were on display as he chunkily hit square of the wicket on the off-side and unleashed an astonishing fusillade of hits on the on-side that sailed over the fence. Then, of course, there was also the breathtaking \"hockey flick\" played fine on the off-side that sailed over the third man boundary, an innovation his former Titans team-mate Chris Morris said he worked on over the course of a whole domestic season a few years back when Mark Boucher was still coach at the franchise. Yet it would be an injustice not to also highlight the role of the grizzled David Miller in a record fifth-wicket stand of 222 off just 92 balls, the left-hander ending with an unbeaten 82 off just 45. Their partnership boasted a run rate of 14.47, the highest for any alliance over 200 runs in the 50-over game. Moreover, South Africa scored 173 runs in the last 10 overs of the innings, beating England's 164 against Netherlands in 2022 and hapless Adam Zampa, who's 5th on the ICC's world rankings for ODI bowlers, bore the brunt of that assault, eventually equalling the worst figures in history of 0/113 in a 10-over quota. He now shares the ignominy with fellow countryman Mick Lewis, who conceded all those runs in the famous 438-match of 2006. It was indeed freakish, especially in light of the Proteas being restricted to 120/2 in the first 25 overs of their innings. That was down to some customarily disciplined bowling from Josh Hazlewood, Marcus Stoinis and Durban-born Michael Neser. Still, that progress was steady enough to allow for Quinton de Kock (45) to show he can adapt to two-paced surfaces and Rassie van der Dussen - back in for a rested Temba Bavuma - to craft a typically gritty 62 that grants him some much-needed form. Armed with the luxury of a target that was unlikely to be overhauled, the Proteas attack were given more freedom to experiment and arguably also an opportunity to relax. Handed the new ball, Lungi Ngidi looked like a man transformed, shelving most of his innovations and focusing on orthodox line-and-length stuff, a decision that immediately put South Africa in the driving seat. He had the previously irrepressible David Warner caught with a square drive to a packed off-side field after suffocating him, before trapping Mitchell Marsh in front. It clearly inspired Kagiso Rabada to reclaim his fire as he bullied a middle-order that simply couldn't get going, a situation exacerbated by Travis Head retiring hurt and going for scans on a suspected broken hand. Rookies Gerald Coetzee and Marco Jansen both tried to match their stalwart seniors' aggression and incision, but were again let down by their execution. At least it didn't matter on the night as Ngidi (4/51) and Rabada (3/41) dominated. It was all very hard on a powerfully defiant Alex Carey, who was brilliant in stroking a 77-ball 99 before falling to a Rabada snorter.","pubDate":"2023-09-15 20:34:40","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9353/27cf4aa86e474904a4952102bda3bb11.jpg","source_id":"news24","source_priority":1882,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"60cf81647aac638229aa26a891e49e31","title":"ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023: Pick England's team for New Zealand opener","link":"https://www.newsr.in/n/Sports/1zpnjb1sx8/ICC-Men-Cricket-World-Cup-2023-Pick.htm","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England's World Cup players have largely played their last competitive game before the tournament, but who makes your side for the New Zealand game?

By then he had eased past 1,000 ODI runs in his 21st appearance – claiming a share of Kevin Pietersen and Jonathan Trott’s joint record. With an average of 61.52 and a strike-rate of 96.52, he has a formidable track record by any reckoning. England rested Ben Stokes after the exertions of his record-breaking 182 on Wednesday evening but Brook was unable to make a go of his chance at number four, allowing Roy some respite. Brook was dismissed for 10 when he hit a Ravindra drag down straight to mid-on and, with 37 from his three outings this series, has failed to amplify his case. Joe Root’s struggle for rhythm also continued, twice dropped in single figures before losing his stump for 29 aiming a slog sweep at Ravindra, who finished with four for 60. Tim Southee paid a heavy price for his handling error in the 14th over, leaving the field for X-rays which revealed a fractured and dislocated right thumb. Like Roy, his World Cup place now hangs in the air. A majestic Malan! 💯 We put up 3⃣1⃣1⃣ 🏏💥 See the best of the action so far 👇 — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Buttler was the best of the rest for England, chipping in a lively 36, before New Zealand took five for 68 in a busy final 10. Just 48 hours earlier New Zealand had fallen short by a massive margin of 181 batting second and would have been eager to show greater resolve this time. England, though, refused to let them into the game. Buttler took care of the dangerous Devon Conway in the fifth over, flinging off his right glove and running the opener out with an opportunistic effort behind the stumps, then held on to Will Young as David Willey found an outside. Having failed to bring the required power to the powerplay, and with news of Southee’s fractured thumb emerging, an air of resignation appeared to take hold. Twice in a row a Buttler bowling change paid off in the first over, Brydon Carse firing one into Daryl Mitchell’s off stump with a nipping delivery approaching 90mph and Moeen darting an off-break down the slope and right through Tom Latham. At 88 for four, and with two injured tailenders, it looked like game over. Ravindra completed a productive evening in north London by smashing 61 from number seven, but by then Moeen had already done enough. He had Henry Nicholls lbw thanks to Buttler’s insistence on calling for DRS, then picked off Kyle Jamieson and Matt Henry with successive deliveries. Ben Lister defied a hamstring strain to block the hat-trick before Sam Curran ended Ravindra’s spree with a yorker.","pubDate":"2023-09-15 19:11:28","image_url":"https://www.freepressseries.co.uk/resources/images/17233330/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"freepressseries","source_priority":6510927,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a37f7ea9c4c1770b03b9e7a01f34ae89","title":"Dawid Malan century in England’s series-clinching win strengthens World Cup case","link":"https://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk/sport/national/23793495.dawid-malan-century-englands-series-clinching-win-strengthens-world-cup-case/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Malan made a superb 127 from 114 balls at his old home ground of Lord’s.","content":"Roy was once again missing due to back spasms, meaning he has been sidelined for all four games against the Black Caps, and Malan produced a gem of an innings to lay claim to his top-order spot.
