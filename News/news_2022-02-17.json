Such was his calibre, that the former England captain and star batter Kevin Pietersen would have easily made it into any of the international teams during his playing days. But, just like most great individuals who have graced this planet have hardly remained unscathed with criticisms and controversies in their careers, Pietersen’s too was marred with many of them. It perhaps was a sum total of all the drama and fallouts he was part of and faced during his career, that eventually led the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) make up their mind that they would no longer require the services of their star right-handed batter. Pietersen had played his last international match against Australia during his team’s forgetful tour Down Under in 2013/14, where they lost the Ashes series 0-5. He had ended his Test and international career with scores of 3 and 6 in first and second innings respectively of the final Test in Sydney. ALSO READ: When Kevin Pietersen questioned ECB’s double standards around English players in IPL Kevin Pietersen remarked how the ECB did him a favour Three years post his last International outing for his country, Kevin Pietersen remarked how his axing from the team by the ECB ended up all good for him in hindsight, as he could then spend more time with his family, particularly with his kids. “England did me a favour in sacking me in 2014 because it has helped me with my relationship with my kids no end. I didn’t want to be a lousy dad. For the birth of my son Dylan in 2010 I had to fly back from playing in the Caribbean, see him being born then get a helicopter to Gatwick the next day to play in a semi-final for England. I was absent,” Pietersen was quoted as saying by news.com.au. “Jess (Pietersen’s wife) has been a rock to me but we’ve had tough times. People don’t understand the pressure that goes on between the four walls of home when it’s all going wrong, like it did for me on a daily basis for a year. We’ve put up with a hell of a lot while I was playing for England,” he further added. The now 41-year-old had a stellar Cricketing career, and the numbers speak for themselves without a need for any amplification. In Tests, Pietersen scored a total of 8,181 runs across 104 matches, at an impressive average of 47.28. He had also smashed 23 centuries in the format, and is second only to Alastair Cook in the list of most Test centuries for England. Kevin Pietersen is the only player to score 100s in his first and last test inning as captain #justsaying — Bharath Seervi (@SeerviBharath) December 21, 2014 Across all the formats, he is still ranked third in the all-time highest run scorers list with 13,779 runs across 275 matches at an average of 44.30. He is placed only behind Joe Root (16,557 runs) and Sir Alastair Cook (15,737 runs).

The fourth and fifth T20Is of the ongoing Sri Lanka’s tour of Australia will be played in Melbourne on Friday and Sunday respectively. Having last hosted a T20I (also against Sri Lanka) more than two years ago, the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground will now host two in three days. Starting with the hosts, Australia have won eight and lost four out of their 13 T20Is at the MCG till date. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have won two and lost one out of their three T20Is here. Out of the 12 completed Melbourne T20Is, teams have won five while batting first and won seven while batting second at the MCG. Hosting the fourth match of a bilateral series for the first time, fans would be expecting for the pitch at the MCG to favour the batters. It is noteworthy that no team has been able to put on board a 200+ run innings total at the MCG till now. Melbourne Cricket Ground records Australia’s regular white-ball opening pair of Aaron Finch (324) and David Warner (217) lead the charts among top-scorers in Melbourne T20Is to be followed by the retired trio of JP Duming (127), George Bailey (108) and David Hussey (91). Former India captain Virat Kohli (90), veteran Australia batter Shaun Marsh (79) and Sri Lanka wicket-keeper batter Kusal Perera (72) are next on the list among active players.

The Kiwis will be without regular skipper Kane Williamson as vice-captain Tom Latham will lead the team in his absence. The Blackcaps will also miss the services of Ross Taylor after the veteran batter announced his retirement earlier this year. The hosts were held by Bangladesh in their last test assignment as the two-match series ended 1-1. The Proteas, on the other hand, are on cloud nine after beating India 2-1 at home in the three-match Test series earlier this year. (LIVE SCORECARD) Well, I think it is now time to don your white jerseys as Test cricket returns to Hagley Oval, Christchurch with New Zealand locking horns against South Africa in a 2-match Test series. Proteas have been the one who have dominated this fixture over the years, but they haven’t met as frequently as one would expect. Still, the hosts are under a lot of pressure as they have never won a Test series against South Africa. The inaugural World Test champions would be eager to make a statement after claiming the throne. Currently, South Africa are placed fifth on the points table while the Kiwis sit on the second spot. South Africa enjoyed a really good series at home against India and came out victorious in the Test as well as the ODI series. They have a good depth in the squad and would want the players to carry on their good form into this series away from home. Coming to hosts team, this will be the first time in 14 years that New Zealand would be without Ross Taylor (due to his retirement) and Kane Williamson (out due to injury) in the Test squad. It will be interesting to see how the Kiwis fill the missing shoes of Taylor. Coach Gary Stead did mention that they will go with four specialist pace bowlers, with Matt Henry replacing Trent Boult, who is on a paternity leave. This game promises to be a cracker with 5 days of riveting cricket coming your way. Will the Proteas continue their domination in this fixture? Or will the new-age Kiwi side stomp their authority? We shall find out together.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-02/lji3gaho_dean-elgar-tom-latham-afp_625x300_15_February_22.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Seventh

West Indies skipper, Kieron Pollard says, it was a good game of cricket. To take the game down to the 19th over that feels good. Adds, they were like 20 to 30 runs short and were hurt majorly in the Powerplay. Adds, they need to play well as they progress. Adds, they will continue to work on the errors. Says, he wants his bowlers to be fresh and hopefully have a good impact on the next game. Time for the Presentation... Suryakumar Yadav is up for a quick chat. He says looking at the dew, he had a chat with Pant in the dugout and noticed the ball is running faster when hit squarer of the wicket. Adds, he asked Iyer to play good shots and have intent and is really happy with the way he played. Says he thinks the opposition spinners bowled really well but later due to the dew they were unable to get grip off the surface. West Indies seemed to be 20 runs or so short to begin with and with the dew coming into play, it was always going to be a tough ask for their bowlers. This was true, at least for the Powerplay as the pacers were hammered all around the park by Rohit Sharma. The first over of spin from Akeal Hosein too proved to be expensive but then Roston Chase came on and he picked up the Indian skipper. After that, both spinners bowled in tandem and kept on stemming the flow of runs. Kishan and Kohli too fell to the spinners and the Windies started to believe. This belief was shattered as Suryakumar Yadav hit the boundaries at the right times for the opposition and ended Windies hopes. They will now look to put on a better batting performance in the next match and will look to better their death bowling as well. After that early blitz from Rohit Sharma, India looked to be chasing the target down with overs to spare. It was not the case though as after Sharma fell, things got slowed down. Ishan Kishan did make 35 runs but they came at a struggle and he failed to build on it. Kohli was dismissed shortly after Kishan and suddenly the required rate was rising up. Suryakumar Yadav though remained fairly calm and along with the inexperienced Venkatesh Iyer, made sure that the scoreboard kept ticking over and the bad balls were sent to the fence. This 48-run stand was the difference and India won the contest with 7 balls to spare. India looked to be in a bit of jeopardy but have managed to get over the line in the end and go 1-0 up in the three-match series thanks to a brilliant partnership between Suryakumar Yadav and Venkatesh Iyer. A top effort from the West Indies bowlers but in the end, they go home empty-handed yet again. 18.5 overs (6 Runs) SIX! GAME OVER! Suryakumar Yadav wins the game in style for his team. Tossed up, full and on off. Iyer gets under it and smokes it over the long on fence. No chance for the fielder in the deep. INDIA WIN THE GAME BY 6 wickets. 18.4 overs (1 Run) Fuller, on middle and league. Suryakumar Yadav flicks it to mid-wicket for a single. 18.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Suryakumar Yadav has ice in his veins. Tossed up, full and wide outside off. Suryakumar Yadav uses his hands really well and cuts it through point for a boundary. 18.2 overs (1 Run) Fuller, on middle and leg.

Fabian Allen (1-0-10-0) to bowl the penultimate over. Just 9 needed now off 12 balls. Can Allen do something spectacular here? 17.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Iyer looks to be in a hurry now. Full toss and on off. Iyer stands tall and hits it over the bowler's head for a boundary at long on. India inching closer to the finish line. Suryakumar Yadav gets hit on the helmet and the umpire signals for the physio to come out for a mandatory concussion chacek. SKY seems fine and play will continue. 17.5 overs (1 Run) A full-toss on the bodyline. Suryakumar Yadav looks to heave it across the line but misses. It flies to the off side off the back of the blade. They take one. 17.4 overs (1 Run) Back of a length, outside off. Iyer looks to heave it away but inside-edges it towards fine leg.

Suryakumar Yadav pushes it to cover.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637806476271222703.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LIVE: India vs West Indies, 1st T20I Latest Updates: Sheldon Cottrell Hurts India with Rishabh Pant's Wicke - News18","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiygFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2NyaWNrZXRuZXh0L25ld3MvaW5kaWEtdnMtd2VzdC1pbmRpZXMtMXN0LXQyMC1saXZlLXNjb3JlLWtvbGthdGEtYmFsbC1ieS1iYWxsLWNvbW1lbnRhcnktdG9kYXktbWF0Y2gtbGl2ZS1zdHJlYW1pbmctc3Rhci1zcG9ydHMtZGlzbmV5LWhvdHN0YXItaW5kLXZzLXdpLTIwMjItbGl2ZW5ld3MtNDc3ODU1OC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LIVE: India vs West Indies, 1st T20I Latest Updates: Sheldon Cottrell Hurts India with Rishabh Pant's Wicke  News18Recent Match Report - West Indies vs India 1st T20I 2021/22  ESPNcricinfoIND vs WI: Avesh Khan Aiming To Break Into India's T20 World Cup 2022 Squad  Cricket Addictor'It's been at the back of my mind': Promising 25-year-old wants to be part of India's T20 World Cup squad  Hindustan TimesMatch Preview - West Indies vs India, West Indies in India 2021/22, 1st T20I  ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-16 17:00:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI: BCCI to allow 20,000 spectators in third T20I","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/ind-vs-wi-bcci-to-allow-20000-spectators-in-third-t20i/article38426593.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Wriddhaayan Bhattacharyya"],"video_url":null,"description":"The BCCI has allowed the Cricket Association of Bengal to allow crowd in limited capacity for the third T20I between India and West Indies on Sunday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-16 16:46:27","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs West Indies Live Score Ball by Ball, India vs West Indies 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/india-vs-west-indies-live-score-over-1st-t20i-t20-11-15-updates-2772588","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between India vs West Indies from Eden Gardens, Kolkata.

Venkatesh Iyer flicks it away fine and the ball runs away into the fine leg fence. Venkatesh Iyer comes in at number 6. 14.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Rishabh Pant is livid with himself and he should be! Banged into the deck, slower and on the body. Pant swivels back and looks to lift it over short fine leg but there's no pace on the ball to work with. Pant ends up getting it off the top edge and the ball loops up towards short fine leg. Odean Smith takes a dolly and out comes the 'salute send-off' from Sheldon Cottrell. 44 required off 33 balls. Can the Windies pull off the unthinkable? 14.2 overs (2 Runs) Back of a length, slower and around off. Pant uses his wrists to pull it finer. He doesn't get it fine enough and it will just be a couple. 14.1 overs (0 Run) Right back at the bowler! Fullish delivery, on middle. Rishabh Pant skips down the track and hammers it right back at the bowler.

Yadav drives it straight to the fielder at extra cover. 13.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Suryakumar Yadav is a master of that shot. Slower one, banged in around off.

On the body, Pant just dabs it down towards the vacant mid-wicket region and races back for the second. 13.1 overs (2 Runs) Shorter in length, a bit slower and angled at the body. Pant with a short-arm jab towards square leg. The fielder over there does well to get low to his right and make a half stop. The batters get a couple. Change.

'Catch it' is the call and Roston Chase winds up a brilliant spell with his second wicket of the night. Chase angles it on a length and into leg side. Ishan Kishan gets cramped for room and hence looks to use the depth of the crease to muscle it across. Kishan pulls it flat and the ball goes straight down the throat of the fielder at the mid-wicket fence. Fabian Allen, one of the best fielders in the world isn't going to drop that one. Ishan Kishan's troubled stay at the crease comes to an end. 65 still needed off 48 balls. 11.5 overs (1 Run) On middle and leg, Kohli dabs it 'round the corner to rotate the strike. 11.4 overs (1 Run) Quicker and fuller, around off and at 107 kph.

Ranji Trophy, India’s prestigious domestic competition, will become the source of amazement for domestic Indian cricketers and their fans from tomorrow. Despite returning after missing a solitary season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems as if the tournament is restarting after a long time. It will be for the first time that the 38-team tournament will be played in two phases. Another first-off situation is teams only getting to play three matches in the league phase. Since something is better than nothing, one can’t really complain with respect to the less number of matches this season. As far as the teams are concerned, 32 teams have been divided into eight Elite groups of four teams each. The remaining six teams form the Plate Group. While the top seven Elite teams will qualify for quarter-finals, the eighth one will face the topper of Plate group in a preliminary quarter-final. The Ranji Trophy is BACK! Just 1⃣ Sleep Away From India’s Prestigious Domestic Tournament #RanjiTrophy @Paytm pic.twitter.com/HlqqcgSm3B — BCCI Domestic (@BCCIdomestic) February 16, 2022 While the preliminary quarter-final will be played before Indian Premier League 2022, all other knockout matches will be played after the culmination of the 15th season of the biggest T20 competition of the world. Ranji Trophy Live Telecast Channel in India Star Sports Network will be broadcasting the live streaming of Ranji Trophy 2022 in India. As has been the case with all top-level cricket in the country, fans will have to follow Star to watch their favourite players taking part in domestic cricket. This season of Ranji Trophy will be televised on Star Sports 2/2 HD. The trend of domestic matches being called in English and Hindi from the same commentary box is highly likely to continue this season as well. Readers must note that only a limited number of matches will be available for broadcasting throughout the season as covering all matches of a 38-team tournament is almost improbable.

Narine brought up the milestone in the 2nd qualifier of Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) 2022 while opening the innings for Comilla Victorians against Chattogram Challengers at the Shere Bangla Stadium in Mirpur. Narine's 13-ball fifty was also the fastest in the history of Bangladesh Premier League as he fired the Victorians to the final of the ongoing edition. Sunil Narine hit 5 boundaries and 6 sixes in his carnage that helped the Victorians chase down a target of 149 in just 12.5 overs, Narine got to his fifty in the 13th ball, falling 1 delivery short of the world record for the fastest fifty in T20 cricket. Narine, opening the batting, started the innings on 6th gear and never took the foot off the pedal. His innings summary read: Dot, 6, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4, 6, Dot, 4, 6, 1, 6.

FASTEST FIFTIES IN T20 CRICKET 1. Yuvraj Singh - 12 balls - India vs England in 2007 1. Chris Gayle - 12 balls - Melbourne Renegades vs Adelaide Strikers in 2016 1. Hazratullah Zazai - 12 balls - Kabul Zwanan vs Balkh Legends in 2018 2. Marcus Trescothick - 13 balls - Somerset vs Hampshire in 2010 2. Sunil Narine - 13 balls - Comilla Victorians vs Chattogram Challengers in 2022* Speaking about his record knock, Narine said: \"No, when I was told I'd open, I was delighted, especially with just 2 fielders outside the ring. It was a good wicket to bat on, not much spin, especially with the new ball, came on nicely.\" Sunil Narine is certainly warming up to the Indian Premier League as he is not part of the West Indies squad that is currently playing a T20I series in India. Narine was also not picked for the T20 World Cup despite having a fine run in IPL 2021. Narine was retained by Kolkata Knight Riders ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction. The West Indies all-rounder was retained along with his teammate Andre Russell, Varun Chakravarthy and Venkatesh Iyer.

The Run Chase ... Right then. Looks like there is some dew on offer, that means the ball should come nicely on to the bat. The West Indies bowlers need to pull their socks up if they do not want the hosts to run away with the game. Do join us for the second essay in a short while. Ravi Bishnoi is in for a chat. He says that his heartbeat is fine now and he was a bit excited and nervous as well at the start. He says that he is a bit disappointed about the catch as he lost his presence of mind for a second. He adds that he tried to bowl stump to stump and tried not to allow the batters to free their arms. He mentions that the dew is there now and the pitch has become better for batting and is confident that India can chase it down. The spinners did the trick for India. Although the pacers could not keep the run flow in check in the death overs. It was Bhuvaneshwar Kumar who struck in the very first over. He was getting the ball to move around from the word go. Later, Chahar could not keep up the same pressure and the batters scored some runs at a brisk rate. Then the leg spin twin, Bishnoi and Chahal pulled things back really well. Chahal picked up a wicket while Bishnoi bagged a brace in a single over to have a good record on his debut. Harshal Patel took two wickets in the death overs, he continues to dominate in his department. All the bowlers got into the wicket's column except Venkatesh Iyer. West Indies could not keep up with the variations in the middle overs. Both the leg spinners of India caused a lot of problems to the batters. West Indies lost a wicket in the first over itself. But later, Mayers was dominating the bowlers with his movement in and around the crease as he raced to 31 while Pooran was playing the second fiddle. But once Mayers slipped out, West Indies lost wickets in quick succession, but Pooran still lived through the downfall. He later decided to take the charge and went after the bowlers after a cautious start. If not for Pooran, the visitors would've been left in a precarious position. Woah! What an innings! This was filled with entertainment. India would've loved to put the opposition to bed quite early on, but Pooran had other ideas. Although, India do have a stong batting line-up and would back themselves to chase the target down of 158 runs. 19.6 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! The skipper, Rohit Sharma takes a brilliant catch and that wraps up the Windies innings. This is slower and fuller again from Harshal Patel but this time it's almost at the base of off stump. Odean Smith makes a bit of room and tries to get under it but only manages to chip it towards the mid off region. Suryakumar Yadav is running in from long off but he is beaten to the ball by Rohit Sharma who runs behind from extra cover and takes a great catch beyond his shoulder. Harshal Patel ends with two wickets and West Indies finish with 157/7! 19.5 overs (2 Runs) Good running! An off-cutter, on off stump. Odean Smith was expecting another wide one and gets undone by this delivery. He manages to clip it through mid-wicket for a couple. 19.5 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Attempted slower ball, well outside off. Smith stays leg side and has a swing but misses. The ball is well outside the tramline and a wide is signalled. 19.4 overs (1 Run) Three singles in a row now and so far it's been a good final over from Harshal Patel. Full and wide, Pollard can only manage to drive it down to long off for a single. 19.3 overs (1 Run) Good bowling! Seam up and very full on middle. Smith drills it right back past the bowler for another single. 19.2 overs (1 Run) Full and wide, Pollard toe-ends it towards wide long off. Odean Smith wants the second but Pollard is content with the single. 19.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Well handled in the end by Kieron Pollard. A slower bumper, on the body. Pollard takes his eyes off the ball a bit but manages to pull it well behind square for a boundary. The 150 is up for West Indies. Who will bowl the final over? It will be Harshal Patel, as Deepak Chahar is getting treated. 18.6 overs (1 Run) Short again, well outside off. Pollard pulls it away but straight towards Virat Kohli at wide long on. One more for the batting side. 18.5 overs (1 Run) Slower one, bowled into the pitch and outside off. Smith drags the pull shot down to long on for just a single. Deepak Chahar looks to be in some pain now. He gets hit hard on his hands. The physio comes out to have a look. They decide to take him out to get nursed. Deepak Hooda comes into the field to replace Chahar. 18.4 overs (1 Run) Swung away hard but just for a run. Short of a length, on off. It is there to hit and Pollard pulls it along the ground towards square leg. Deepak Chahar makes a brilliant stop to his right and gets hit high up on the palm. It's his bowling hand as well. That must have stung and we hope he is fine. The batters get a single. 18.3 overs (0 Run) Excellent bowling! Fuller and just inside the tramline. Pollard stays leg side and cannot reach it. 18.3 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Bhuvi looks to push it even wider this time but spills it beyond the tramline. Wided. 18.2 overs (2 Runs) Better from Bhuvi. Full and pushed wider. Pollard has to fetch it and he does so but doesn't get any timing on it. The ball is chipped up towards the vacant mid-wicket region and the batters come back for two. 18.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! My word, what a hit! A nothing delivery really. Length and on off. Right in the hitting arc and Kieron Pollard clobbers it a long way, over the cow corner fence for a biggie. Odean Smith is the new man in. Also, Bhuvneshwar Kumar comes back into the attack to bowl the penultimate over. 17.6 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! Harshal Patel has done the trick here and Nicholas Pooran perishes. Full and on off. This is bowled seam up. Pooran backs away a bit and looks to hammer it over the long off fence. Pooran gets a good connection on it but just can't get the elevation. The ball rockets towards the long off fence where Virat Kohli takes a good, sharp catch. This wicket might make a huge difference to the final total. Can the Windies still finish on a high? 17.5 overs (0 Run) A rare swing and a miss from Nicholas Pooran! Slower again, bowled into the pitch and angled into the body. Pooran looks to pull it away but misses and the ball goes off the shoulder and towards the keeper. 17.4 overs (1 Run) Another off-paced delivery, full and on middle. Pollard clips it to deep mid-wicket to turn the strike over. 17.3 overs (1 Run) Full and wide, slashed away to sweeper cover for a single. 17.3 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Full and seam up, slanting down leg. Pooran gets himself into a tangle as he misses the flick. It's been called a wide in the end. 17.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Nicholas Pooran is a special player and we can see why! Slower delivery, angled in from 'round the wicket. Pooran picks it up and smokes it high and handsome over the long off fence for a biggie. 17.1 overs (1 Run) Slower one, back of a length and around off. Pollard hangs back and dabs it down towards backward point for a quick single. Change. Harshal Patel (2-0-17-0) comes back into the attack. 16.6 overs (1 Run) On middle, this is flicked through mid-wicket for a single. Venkatesh Iyer seems to have hurt himself. He goes outside the boundary ropes to get nursed by the physio. Hopefully there is nothing serious. 16.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Firmly hit down the ground but the fielder should be stopping that one. Nicely tossed up, outside off. Pollard makes a bit of room and drags it down towards long on. The ball just bounces in front of Venkatesh Iyer over there and goes through his hands. Yuzvendra Chahal is not impressed. 16.4 overs (0 Run) On a length, around middle. This is the googly and turns in a long way. Pollard gets cramped for room and cannot get it away on the leg side. 16.3 overs (1 Run) Flatter deliver, outside off. Pooran cuts it hard to deep point for a single. 16.3 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Sprayed down the leg side. Poran looks to paddle it fine but misses. Wided. 16.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Cutaway and cutaway hard! Short and outside off. Nicholas Pooran rocks back and hammers it past point for a boundary. With this boundary, he also brings up his fifty. A top-class innings from him so far. 16.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Nicholas Pooran is in full flow now! Tossed up, on middle. Pooran gets in position for the slog sweep and hits it cleanly over the mid-wicket fence for a big hit. 15.6 overs (1 Run) A tad bit short, on middle. Nicholas Pooran pushes it down to long on for a single. 15.5 overs (0 Run) Another googly, Pooran swings across the line but misses the ball completely. 15.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Top shot! One of those few deliveries that doesn't turn away. On off, Pooran goes inside-out over covers and picks up a boundary. 15.3 overs (5 Runs) FIVE LEG BYES! Overthrows! Runs aren't flowing off the bat but the Indian skipper has gifted the opposition with a few extra runs here. On middle, this is bunted out on the leg side for a quick single. The ball comes off the pads and Sharma has a shy at the striker's end. He misses but the ball runs away to the fence as Bhuvneshwar Kumar cannot stop it even after putting in the dive. 15.3 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Quicker and wider of off. This one skids through again and a wide is called. Review! Rohit Sharma takes the review for lbw. The on-field decision is not out. The replays show no bat is involved. The Ball Tracker confirms it is umpire's call on the point of impact and hence the on-field decision stands. Although India do not lose a review here. 15.2 overs (0 Run) NOT OUT! It looked to be hitting outside off and that's what it was in the end. Another wrong 'un, around off and turning in. Kieron Pollard puts a big stride outside off and looks to flick it away. He misses the ball completely and gets pinged on the pads. The bowler appeals but it is turned down. Rishabh Pant persuades Rohit Sharma to go for the review. No need for UltraEdge as the ball is a fair bit away from the bat. Ball Tracker shows that the impact was umpire's call and Pollard survives. 15.1 overs (1 Run) Tossed up, full and on middle. Pooran hits through the line and gets it on the bounce to the man at long on. Single taken.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637806417447896081.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Fastest 50 in T20: Full list of fastest 50 in BPL","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-fastest-50-in-t20-full-list-of-fastest-50-in-bpl/","keywords":["Cricket","Bangladesh Premier League","BPL","BPL 2022","Comilla Victorians"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Fastest 50 in T20: Sunil Narine’s 13-ball fifty powered the Comilla Victorians into the final of Bangladesh Premier League 2022.

Chasing the score of 148/10 posted by Chattogram, Narine took the field in a belligerent mood and went hammer and tongs at the opposition bowlers to bring up his half-century in mere 13 deliveries. He was dismissed inside the Powerplay for sure, but not before he had left the other batters to only finish the formality as far as the match’s result was concerned. The Southpaw was dismissed at the score of 57 off mere 16 deliveries, with the assistance of 5 Fours and 6 Sixes, hitting them at the strike rate of 356.25.
