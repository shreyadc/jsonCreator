The 24-year-old was selected as the second pick of the draft by Melbourne Stars, who begin their BBL campaign against Brisbane Heat at the Gabba in three weeks. Brook was a late inclusion in England's World Cup squad for the disappointing campaign in India and has since been selected for the white-ball tour of the West Indies in December. Brook, who has previous BBL experience with Hobart Hurricanes, had initially been set to link up with the Stars to play seven games after touring the Caribbean. But Stars general manager Blair Crouch said: \"Currently the coaching staff and list management team are discussing options for the remainder of the tournament and we look forward to announcing those signings once they have been finalised. \"Naturally we're disappointed that Harry has withdrawn from the BBL but we understand his decision with his increased workload.

That’s what we’ve been speaking about as a team. When the crunch moment comes, when the pressure moments come, we come together as a team and we find a way to get over the line.” “We also accept that it’s for us to control what we can control, what our story is within the Proteas. We know what we’d like to look like. We want to be there on 19 November, but for us to do that we have got to focus and deal with tomorrow as best as we can.” Compared to South African teams of the previous years this side seems to have all the ingredients to go right to the top. “The way we’ve performed as a team it’s obviously created a lot of positive sentiments but obviously high expectations. A lot of people believe that this could be the year that we see ourselves within the final. As a team, individually we’d like nothing better than that,” said Bavuma. “But we also respect the game of cricket. You know, we’re not coming up against a mickey mouse team. Australia has a lot of experience and confidence in knockout games like this, so we’ve got to respect that. I’d hate to say that we deserve to go through because of the way we played our cricket. I don’t think that’s the way things go. There are only two guys in this group that have gone into a semi-final, Quinton (de Kock), and David Miller, so there’s not a lot of experience from all the other guys. There’s a sense of calmness within the team and obviously the normal level of anxiety that you would expect of going into the game tomorrow. But I think we’ll take a lot of confidence with our performances up until this point.” Bavuma is struggling with a hamstring injury, but he is determined to play. “Physically I feel alright. Obviously not 100%. So obviously this day becomes important in terms of decisions about tomorrow. I’m quite confident, but I mean, it’s not a unilateral decision that will be made.” Australia returns to the ground where Allan Border’s men won the cricket World Cup in 1987 beating England in the final. In that tournament Australia’s success was largely based on the starts their opening batsmen Geoff Marsh and David Boon gave them. Thirty-six years later, one of Marsh’s sons Mitch Marsh is making the headlines as a top order batsman in the Australian line up. “We’ve got a great opening pair in Travis (Head) and Davey (David Warner). Trav obviously missed the first half of the tournament due to injury, but in that New Zealand match, you saw the way they took the game away from them in basically the first 10 overs. That’s how we want to play,” said Australian Captain Pat Cummins. “Mitch Marsh, showed the last time what he can do at the top of the order, albeit at number three. So, yeah, really, pumped with how the batting line-ups are functioning at the moment.” South Africa had the better of Australia in the league stage but they have a very poor record against Australia in the semi-finals. “I don’t think it counts for too much. Obviously, you start from scratch every time you play. They’re a team we’ve played quite a lot and know quite well. This week it’s probably going to be quite different to the South African series we played against them a couple of months ago,” said Cummins. “What helps us is we’ve got a lot of guys that have been in this situation before, that have won one-day World Cup, T20 World Cup, and various other tournaments in big moments. That really helps. You can draw on that in the middle of the contest. In terms of the wicket, it does look like it’s probably going to spin a bit more than some of the other wickets which again, is the same for both teams.” – (ST)","pubDate":"2023-11-15 22:29:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e968f7d70b167e84eafdc52a43f24a11","title":"Sri Lanka Cricket congratulates Aravinda de Silva","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Sri-Lanka-Cricket-congratulates-Aravinda-de-Silva/23-755247","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Aravinda de Silva with the ICC award after being inducted to the Hall of Fame Sri Lanka Cricket has congratulated Aravinda de Silva on him being inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.

India gave an exceptional batting exhibition running up an imposing total of 397-4 scored courtesy of Virat Kohli’s 50th ODI century and Shreyas Iyer’s back-to-back hundreds, proved too much for the spirited Black Caps who put up a fighting display through a courageous century from Darryl Mitchell (134 off 119 balls, 9 fours, 7 sixes) to reply with 327. It was India’s tenth successive win in the tournament. India will have to await today’s second semi-final between Australia and South Africa to find who their opponents will be in the final at Ahmedabad on Sunday 19 November. It was not plain easy for India against a combative New Zealand side who at one time threatened to take the game away from them during the third wicket partnership of 181 between Mitchell and skipper Kane Williamson (69 off 73 balls, 9 fours, 1 six). India’s bowling which hadn’t been tested at all in this tournament was put under severe pressure during this stand. And it was their resilience that saw them fight back and regain control of the game. Mohammed Shami who spilled Williamson at 52, compensated for that lapse with a brilliant spell of bowling picking up wickets at crucial stages to end with career best figures of 7/57, his third five-fer in the current tournament. He also went past 50 wickets in World Cups, and became the highest wicket-taker moving past Adam Zampa with 23 wickets. From the moment Rohit Sharma won the toss it was all India as the captain set the pace with a pulsating 47 off 29 balls inclusive of four fours and four sixes that took him past West Indian Chris Gayle’s record of 49 sixes in World Cups. Sharma and his partner Shubman Gill put on an opening stand of 71 off 50 balls. Gill however had to leave the field with his score on 79 when the Mumbai heat got the better of him. His departure brought Iyer to the middle to join Kohli. The pair joined hands to stitch a mammoth partnership of 163 that was to lay the foundation for India’s final total. They scored boundaries at regular intervals and kept the momentum going with both of them notching up their respective tons. Playing in front of his idol Sachin Tendulkar, Kohli went onto reach his 50th ODI century (117 off 113 balls, 9 fours, 2 sixes) surpassing Tendulkar’s 49 at the same venue where he carried the great man on his shoulder after the 2011 World Cup triumph. Kohli also went past Tendulkar’s aggregate of 673 runs in 2003 for the most runs in a single World Cup. And all this was achieved in the presence of his wife and family. He received a standing ovation after he was dismissed. Iyer went on to play a terrific innings. He got to his hundred off 67 balls making it the fastest in a World Cup knockout surpassing Adam Gilchrist’s 72 balls in the 2007 final against Sri Lanka. With splendid timing Iyer gave a magnificent display of power hitting racing to 105 off 70 balls (4 fours, 8 sixes). Gill returned at the fall of Iyer’s wicket to add one run to his score and remain unbeaten on 80 (66 balls, 8 fours, 3 sixes) with Lokesh Rahul 39* (20 balls, 5 fours, 2 sixes) as India racked up 110 in the final 10 overs. A special guest at the final was former England soccer legend David Beckham on a 3-day visit to India as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Shami was named Player of the Match.

MUMBAI: Virat Kohli was down on his knees. He already had put his bat down on his side, just like a gladiator would his sword after a successful combat; he removed his gloves, and bowed. His idol Sachin Tendulkar was there so was the latter's immortalised self-manifested in a straight-drive statue. The capacity Wankhede crowd was on their feet chanting his name as Kohli took a moment to soak in all the emotions his career threw up. He had reached a milestone no other batter had done before — half-century of centuries. The occasion too was as fitting -- the World Cup semifinal against New Zealand. Kohli rose, lifted both his hands up and paid his respect to his hero. Even for someone who wears his emotions on his sleeves, Kohli seemed overwhelmed when he bowed to Tendulkar. Then came a flying kiss to his wife, Anushka Sharma, who too was visibly emotional. Records have been following Kohli like a shadow and this format, in which he thrives, these milestones have swelled like a piggybank. Such has been his dominance in ODIs, that at one point it looked like he would cruise past Tendulkar and would have scored several more ODI hundreds by now. But sport like life works in mysterious ways. For almost three years between 2019-2022, Kohli would not score a century. Not in any format. Once he came back from the mental health sabbatical he took in 2022, things took a turn for good and he has not looked back since. Kohli's role in the team for this World Cup has changed too. He is not the enforcer anymore. He is now playing purely as a batter, an anchor who holds one end up while the other batters express themselves around him. Rohit sets the tone while Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav would do the job in the later half. All Kohli has to do is get his eye in, play in singles and doubles and pick up a boundary once in a while and maintain a decent strike rate. That is what he has done throughout this World Cup, and Wednesday was no different. Kohli walked in after Sharma fell. Built partnerships with Shubman Gill, first, and Iyer later. The 35-year-old made them run like hell between the wickets in the Mumbai heat, brought out his cover drives, and reached his fifty in 59 balls. From there on, he was switched on. He lofted Trent Boult downtown, jumped out and flicked Tim Southee, played a deft glance for Glenn Phillips and in doing all this, he surpassed another Tendulkar record; most runs by a batter in a single WC (673 in 2003). At that point, it was clear that the century was coming. And when it did, a hard-ran two in the most typical Virat Kohli fashion, he jumped and punched the air in delight before going down to his knees. It was the kind of emotion you hadn’t seen in Kohli in a long time. It was the kind of celebration that told you how much it meant to him. By the time Kohli was done — 117 from 115 balls, 50 centuries in 279 innings — he had amassed 711 runs at a strike rate of 90.68 in this edition. In many ways, it is fitting that Kohli went past Tendulkar at Wankhede in a World Cup knockout game on November 15 with the latter watching from the stands. It was the same venue where he walked into a void of silence when Tendulkar got out in the 2011 World Cup final 12 years ago. It was the same venue where he would carry his idol on the shoulders moments after winning the World Cup in April 2011. It was the same date when Tendulkar walked off the field as an India batter for one last time in his farewell Test ten years ago at the same venue. It was his first century in a World Cup knockout game, something even Tendulkar does not have in his 24-year-long career. The picture could not have been more perfect. Kohli himself said so. “It's the stuff of dreams. Sachin paaji was there in the stands. It's very difficult for me to express it. My life partner (Anushka Sharma), my hero - he's sitting there. And all these fans at the Wankhede. If I wanted to paint a perfect picture, this would be it,” an emotional Kohli told broadcasters during the innings break. For someone who took up the sport watching his hero play, to share the dressing room with him, to win a World Cup with him, and then to go on and surpass one of the most ridiculous records your hero holds in front of his eyes at the biggest stage — Wednesday at Wankhede seemed like destiny for Kohli, where his life came one full circle. At the humongous theatre, his coronation was complete as the most prolific ODI batter the sport has seen.","content":"MUMBAI: Virat Kohli was down on his knees.

Tendulkar wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, he “couldn’t be happier that an Indian broke my record” as Kohli moved into a class of his own in his 291st ODI – 172 fewer than his former team-mate. The first time I met you in the Indian dressing room, you were pranked by other teammates into touching my feet. I couldn’t stop laughing that day. But soon, you touched my heart with your passion and skill. I am so happy that that young boy has grown into a ‘Virat’ player. I… — Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) Reflecting on his achievement, Kohli said: “It is the stuff of dreams. “It is very difficult for me to explain this, but if I could paint a perfect picture, I would want this to be the picture. “My life partner, the person I love the most, she’s sitting there (in the stands). My hero (Tendulkar) he’s sitting there. And I was able to get the 50th in front of all of them and all these fans in such a historic venue. It was amazing.” India gained a measure of revenge for being dumped out at the same stage of the 2019 tournament by the Black Caps. Shami said: “It feels amazing. In the last two World Cups, we lost (in the semi-finals), so who knows when or if we will get a chance again. “We wanted to do everything for this, one chance we didn’t want to let go.” Congratulations India. Good luck in the Final. Thank you to everyone who has supported the team during the near and far! Scorecard | — BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS) New Zealand captain Kane Williamson was proud of his side’s efforts. “Firstly, congrats to India, they played outstandingly well, probably their best game today,” he said. “400 was naturally going to be tough, but credit to the guys, proud effort to stay in the fight. “It is disappointing to go out, but I am super proud of the effort that has gone in for the last seven weeks. “The effort was there, but India are top class, have world-class batters who didn’t give us a sniff really. “You come in and get 400, it’s a tick in the box. They deserve to be where they are, played outstandingly well. “It wasn’t to be today, but it was nice to be out there to give ourselves a chance. “It was a fantastic crowd, unbelievable atmosphere, slightly one-sided in the support, but special to be part of the tournament.”","pubDate":"2023-11-15 18:51:00","image_url":"https://www.echo-news.co.uk/resources/images/17450545/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"echo_uk","source_priority":159993,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"dea46273ff12632a19b1510f3ee6cc37","title":"Cricket World Cup 2023: '2019 Revenge Completed For MS Dhoni,' Fans React As Team India Beat New Zealand In Semifinal","link":"https://www.newsr.in/n/Sports/1zpogehwdc/Cricket-World-Cup-2023-2019-Revenge-Completed.htm","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket World Cup 2023: Fans were delighted to see India beat New Zealand in the semifinals at the Wankhede Stadium.

The 29-year-old's tenure as captain notably led the team to the pinnacle of the 50-over format rankings, a significant achievement acknowledged by cricket enthusiasts worldwide. Azam, who took on the role of white-ball captain in 2019 and later assumed the Test captaincy in 2020, faced mounting criticism in recent months. The team's lackluster performance in both the Asia Cup and the ongoing World Cup 2023 ultimately prompted his decision to step down. Teammate and wicket-keeper batsman Mohammad Rizwan expressed his admiration for Babar on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, hailing him as \"one of the greatest batsmen Pakistan has ever seen\" and declaring, \"Kaptaaana, aap Dilo k Kaptaan ho\" (Captain! You rule our hearts). Former Test captain Azhar Ali extended his gratitude to Babar for his captaincy stint, while ex-allrounder Mohammad Hafeez commended him for his services and wished him success in future endeavors. Sohail Tanveer and former spinner Saeed Ajmal also conveyed their appreciation for Babar's contributions, with Ajmal specifically acknowledging Babar's role in guiding Pakistan's ODI team to the No.1 spot. Babar's illustrious career, despite his young age, saw him dominate the rankings as the top-ranked ODI batter for over two years. He held a unique distinction as the only batter to secure top three positions across all formats. Reflecting on his achievements, Babar attributed reaching the No.1 spot in white-ball cricket to the collective efforts of players, coaches, and management.","pubDate":"2023-11-15 17:26:15","image_url":"https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/digital_images/large/2023-11-15/1700068039-9355.jpeg","source_id":"dailypakistanen","source_priority":97265,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"51f79bc528eff9340e4262beb2ba5ef0","title":"Brook pulls out of BBL to manage workload","link":"https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/20876/13009262/harry-brook-pulls-out-of-big-bash-league-to-manage-workload-and-international-commitments","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England batter Harry Brook has withdrawn from competing in this year's Big Bash League in Australia due to \"increased workload\".","content":"England batter Harry Brook has withdrawn from competing in this year's Big Bash League in Australia due to \"increased workload\".

That’s what we’ve been speaking about as a team. When the crunch moment comes, when the pressure moments come, we come together as a team and we find a way to get over the line.” “We also accept that it’s for us to control what we can control, what our story is within the Proteas. We know what we’d like to look like. We want to be there on 19 November, but for us to do that we have got to focus and deal with tomorrow as best as we can.” Compared to South African teams of the previous years this side seems to have all the ingredients to go right to the top. “The way we’ve performed as a team it’s obviously created a lot of positive sentiments but obviously high expectations. A lot of people believe that this could be the year that we see ourselves within the final. As a team, individually we’d like nothing better than that,” said Bavuma. “But we also respect the game of cricket. You know, we’re not coming up against a mickey mouse team. Australia has a lot of experience and confidence in knockout games like this, so we’ve got to respect that. I’d hate to say that we deserve to go through because of the way we played our cricket. I don’t think that’s the way things go. There are only two guys in this group that have gone into a semi-final, Quinton (de Kock), and David Miller, so there’s not a lot of experience from all the other guys. There’s a sense of calmness within the team and obviously the normal level of anxiety that you would expect of going into the game tomorrow. But I think we’ll take a lot of confidence with our performances up until this point.” Bavuma is struggling with a hamstring injury, but he is determined to play. “Physically I feel alright. Obviously not 100%. So obviously this day becomes important in terms of decisions about tomorrow. I’m quite confident, but I mean, it’s not a unilateral decision that will be made.” Australia returns to the ground where Allan Border’s men won the cricket World Cup in 1987 beating England in the final. In that tournament Australia’s success was largely based on the starts their opening batsmen Geoff Marsh and David Boon gave them. Thirty-six years later, one of Marsh’s sons Mitch Marsh is making the headlines as a top order batsman in the Australian line up. “We’ve got a great opening pair in Travis (Head) and Davey (David Warner). Trav obviously missed the first half of the tournament due to injury, but in that New Zealand match, you saw the way they took the game away from them in basically the first 10 overs. That’s how we want to play,” said Australian Captain Pat Cummins. “Mitch Marsh, showed the last time what he can do at the top of the order, albeit at number three. So, yeah, really, pumped with how the batting line-ups are functioning at the moment.” South Africa had the better of Australia in the league stage but they have a very poor record against Australia in the semi-finals. “I don’t think it counts for too much. Obviously, you start from scratch every time you play. They’re a team we’ve played quite a lot and know quite well. This week it’s probably going to be quite different to the South African series we played against them a couple of months ago,” said Cummins. “What helps us is we’ve got a lot of guys that have been in this situation before, that have won one-day World Cup, T20 World Cup, and various other tournaments in big moments. That really helps. You can draw on that in the middle of the contest. In terms of the wicket, it does look like it’s probably going to spin a bit more than some of the other wickets which again, is the same for both teams.” – (ST)","pubDate":"2023-11-15 22:29:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e968f7d70b167e84eafdc52a43f24a11","title":"Sri Lanka Cricket congratulates Aravinda de Silva","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Sri-Lanka-Cricket-congratulates-Aravinda-de-Silva/23-755247","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Aravinda de Silva with the ICC award after being inducted to the Hall of Fame Sri Lanka Cricket has congratulated Aravinda de Silva on him being inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.

India gave an exceptional batting exhibition running up an imposing total of 397-4 scored courtesy of Virat Kohli’s 50th ODI century and Shreyas Iyer’s back-to-back hundreds, proved too much for the spirited Black Caps who put up a fighting display through a courageous century from Darryl Mitchell (134 off 119 balls, 9 fours, 7 sixes) to reply with 327. It was India’s tenth successive win in the tournament. India will have to await today’s second semi-final between Australia and South Africa to find who their opponents will be in the final at Ahmedabad on Sunday 19 November. It was not plain easy for India against a combative New Zealand side who at one time threatened to take the game away from them during the third wicket partnership of 181 between Mitchell and skipper Kane Williamson (69 off 73 balls, 9 fours, 1 six). India’s bowling which hadn’t been tested at all in this tournament was put under severe pressure during this stand. And it was their resilience that saw them fight back and regain control of the game. Mohammed Shami who spilled Williamson at 52, compensated for that lapse with a brilliant spell of bowling picking up wickets at crucial stages to end with career best figures of 7/57, his third five-fer in the current tournament. He also went past 50 wickets in World Cups, and became the highest wicket-taker moving past Adam Zampa with 23 wickets. From the moment Rohit Sharma won the toss it was all India as the captain set the pace with a pulsating 47 off 29 balls inclusive of four fours and four sixes that took him past West Indian Chris Gayle’s record of 49 sixes in World Cups. Sharma and his partner Shubman Gill put on an opening stand of 71 off 50 balls. Gill however had to leave the field with his score on 79 when the Mumbai heat got the better of him. His departure brought Iyer to the middle to join Kohli. The pair joined hands to stitch a mammoth partnership of 163 that was to lay the foundation for India’s final total. They scored boundaries at regular intervals and kept the momentum going with both of them notching up their respective tons. Playing in front of his idol Sachin Tendulkar, Kohli went onto reach his 50th ODI century (117 off 113 balls, 9 fours, 2 sixes) surpassing Tendulkar’s 49 at the same venue where he carried the great man on his shoulder after the 2011 World Cup triumph. Kohli also went past Tendulkar’s aggregate of 673 runs in 2003 for the most runs in a single World Cup. And all this was achieved in the presence of his wife and family. He received a standing ovation after he was dismissed. Iyer went on to play a terrific innings. He got to his hundred off 67 balls making it the fastest in a World Cup knockout surpassing Adam Gilchrist’s 72 balls in the 2007 final against Sri Lanka. With splendid timing Iyer gave a magnificent display of power hitting racing to 105 off 70 balls (4 fours, 8 sixes). Gill returned at the fall of Iyer’s wicket to add one run to his score and remain unbeaten on 80 (66 balls, 8 fours, 3 sixes) with Lokesh Rahul 39* (20 balls, 5 fours, 2 sixes) as India racked up 110 in the final 10 overs. A special guest at the final was former England soccer legend David Beckham on a 3-day visit to India as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Shami was named Player of the Match.

His idol Sachin Tendulkar was there so was the latter's immortalised self-manifested in a straight-drive statue. The capacity Wankhede crowd was on their feet chanting his name as Kohli took a moment to soak in all the emotions his career threw up. He had reached a milestone no other batter had done before — half-century of centuries. The occasion too was as fitting -- the World Cup semifinal against New Zealand. Kohli rose, lifted both his hands up and paid his respect to his hero. Even for someone who wears his emotions on his sleeves, Kohli seemed overwhelmed when he bowed to Tendulkar. Then came a flying kiss to his wife, Anushka Sharma, who too was visibly emotional. Records have been following Kohli like a shadow and this format, in which he thrives, these milestones have swelled like a piggybank. Such has been his dominance in ODIs, that at one point it looked like he would cruise past Tendulkar and would have scored several more ODI hundreds by now. But sport like life works in mysterious ways. For almost three years between 2019-2022, Kohli would not score a century. Not in any format. Once he came back from the mental health sabbatical he took in 2022, things took a turn for good and he has not looked back since. Kohli's role in the team for this World Cup has changed too. He is not the enforcer anymore. He is now playing purely as a batter, an anchor who holds one end up while the other batters express themselves around him. Rohit sets the tone while Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav would do the job in the later half. All Kohli has to do is get his eye in, play in singles and doubles and pick up a boundary once in a while and maintain a decent strike rate. That is what he has done throughout this World Cup, and Wednesday was no different. Kohli walked in after Sharma fell. Built partnerships with Shubman Gill, first, and Iyer later. The 35-year-old made them run like hell between the wickets in the Mumbai heat, brought out his cover drives, and reached his fifty in 59 balls. From there on, he was switched on. He lofted Trent Boult downtown, jumped out and flicked Tim Southee, played a deft glance for Glenn Phillips and in doing all this, he surpassed another Tendulkar record; most runs by a batter in a single WC (673 in 2003). At that point, it was clear that the century was coming. And when it did, a hard-ran two in the most typical Virat Kohli fashion, he jumped and punched the air in delight before going down to his knees. It was the kind of emotion you hadn’t seen in Kohli in a long time. It was the kind of celebration that told you how much it meant to him. By the time Kohli was done — 117 from 115 balls, 50 centuries in 279 innings — he had amassed 711 runs at a strike rate of 90.68 in this edition. In many ways, it is fitting that Kohli went past Tendulkar at Wankhede in a World Cup knockout game on November 15 with the latter watching from the stands. It was the same venue where he walked into a void of silence when Tendulkar got out in the 2011 World Cup final 12 years ago. It was the same venue where he would carry his idol on the shoulders moments after winning the World Cup in April 2011. It was the same date when Tendulkar walked off the field as an India batter for one last time in his farewell Test ten years ago at the same venue. It was his first century in a World Cup knockout game, something even Tendulkar does not have in his 24-year-long career. The picture could not have been more perfect. Kohli himself said so. “It's the stuff of dreams. Sachin paaji was there in the stands. It's very difficult for me to express it. My life partner (Anushka Sharma), my hero - he's sitting there. And all these fans at the Wankhede. If I wanted to paint a perfect picture, this would be it,” an emotional Kohli told broadcasters during the innings break. For someone who took up the sport watching his hero play, to share the dressing room with him, to win a World Cup with him, and then to go on and surpass one of the most ridiculous records your hero holds in front of his eyes at the biggest stage — Wednesday at Wankhede seemed like destiny for Kohli, where his life came one full circle.

At the humongous theatre, his coronation was complete as the most prolific ODI batter the sport has seen.","pubDate":"2023-11-15 19:26:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"newindianexpress","source_priority":15406,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4a1178c8e7a2c259e88ff280095b6ee8","title":"Waugh-supported Udayan children bat for Australia ahead of WC semifinal","link":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/cricket/2023/nov/16/waugh-supported-udayan-children-bat-for-australia-ahead-of-wc-semifinal-2633181.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Since then the association as one of the patrons of the NGO has only grown with the World Cup-winning captain also making sure he visits the centre whenever he is in the country.

New Zealand then battled hard in the chase, but hopes of a third successive World Cup final appearance were dashed despite Daryl Mitchell’s fine 134 as they were all out for 327 as Mohammed Shami took a career-best seven for 57. 😲 Mohammed Shami – 7/57👑 Virat Kohli – 117💥 Shreyas Iyer – 105 India are through to their first men’s Cricket World Cup final in 12 years 🎉 Read the full match report 📝⬇️ — ICC Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) Rohit, though, admitted he had never taken victory as assured as the 1983 and 2011 champions kept on course for victory on home soil. “I have played a lot of cricket here, any score on this ground, you can’t relax. Got to get the job done quickly and stay at it,” Rohit said in his post-match presentation interview. “We knew there would be pressure on us. We were very calm, even though we were a bit sloppy on the field. “These things are bound to happen, but glad we could get the job done. “The form all the guys are in, top five or six batters, whenever they’ve gotten an opportunity, they’ve made it count.” 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗿! 🏆 🇮🇳 march into the FINAL of 🥳 | — BCCI (@BCCI) Rohit added: “Being the semi-final, I won’t say there was no pressure, whenever you play there’s pressure, but a semi-final adds a bit extra. “We wanted to not think too much about it, just do what we’ve been doing like in the first nine games. Things came off for us nicely in the second half.” After moving to three figures off 106 balls, Kohli leapt and punched the air, briefly sunk to his knees before rising and soaking up the acclaim from a frenzied crowd which included Tendulkar and David Beckham. Tendulkar wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, he “couldn’t be happier that an Indian broke my record” as Kohli moved into a class of his own in his 291st ODI – 172 fewer than his former team-mate. The first time I met you in the Indian dressing room, you were pranked by other teammates into touching my feet. I couldn’t stop laughing that day. But soon, you touched my heart with your passion and skill. I am so happy that that young boy has grown into a ‘Virat’ player.

My hero (Tendulkar) he’s sitting there. And I was able to get the 50th in front of all of them and all these fans in such a historic venue. It was amazing.” India gained a measure of revenge for being dumped out at the same stage of the 2019 tournament by the Black Caps. Shami said: “It feels amazing. In the last two World Cups, we lost (in the semi-finals), so who knows when or if we will get a chance again. “We wanted to do everything for this, one chance we didn’t want to let go.” Congratulations India. Good luck in the Final. Thank you to everyone who has supported the team during the near and far! Scorecard | — BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS) New Zealand captain Kane Williamson was proud of his side’s efforts. “Firstly, congrats to India, they played outstandingly well, probably their best game today,” he said. “400 was naturally going to be tough, but credit to the guys, proud effort to stay in the fight. “It is disappointing to go out, but I am super proud of the effort that has gone in for the last seven weeks. “The effort was there, but India are top class, have world-class batters who didn’t give us a sniff really. “You come in and get 400, it’s a tick in the box.

The 29-year-old's tenure as captain notably led the team to the pinnacle of the 50-over format rankings, a significant achievement acknowledged by cricket enthusiasts worldwide. Azam, who took on the role of white-ball captain in 2019 and later assumed the Test captaincy in 2020, faced mounting criticism in recent months. The team's lackluster performance in both the Asia Cup and the ongoing World Cup 2023 ultimately prompted his decision to step down. Teammate and wicket-keeper batsman Mohammad Rizwan expressed his admiration for Babar on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, hailing him as \"one of the greatest batsmen Pakistan has ever seen\" and declaring, \"Kaptaaana, aap Dilo k Kaptaan ho\" (Captain! You rule our hearts). Former Test captain Azhar Ali extended his gratitude to Babar for his captaincy stint, while ex-allrounder Mohammad Hafeez commended him for his services and wished him success in future endeavors. Sohail Tanveer and former spinner Saeed Ajmal also conveyed their appreciation for Babar's contributions, with Ajmal specifically acknowledging Babar's role in guiding Pakistan's ODI team to the No.1 spot. Babar's illustrious career, despite his young age, saw him dominate the rankings as the top-ranked ODI batter for over two years. He held a unique distinction as the only batter to secure top three positions across all formats. Reflecting on his achievements, Babar attributed reaching the No.1 spot in white-ball cricket to the collective efforts of players, coaches, and management.","pubDate":"2023-11-15 17:26:15","image_url":"https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/digital_images/large/2023-11-15/1700068039-9355.jpeg","source_id":"dailypakistanen","source_priority":97265,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"51f79bc528eff9340e4262beb2ba5ef0","title":"Brook pulls out of BBL to manage workload","link":"https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/20876/13009262/harry-brook-pulls-out-of-big-bash-league-to-manage-workload-and-international-commitments","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England batter Harry Brook has withdrawn from competing in this year's Big Bash League in Australia due to \"increased workload\".","content":"England batter Harry Brook has withdrawn from competing in this year's Big Bash League in Australia due to \"increased workload\".

That’s what we’ve been speaking about as a team. When the crunch moment comes, when the pressure moments come, we come together as a team and we find a way to get over the line.” “We also accept that it’s for us to control what we can control, what our story is within the Proteas. We know what we’d like to look like. We want to be there on 19 November, but for us to do that we have got to focus and deal with tomorrow as best as we can.” Compared to South African teams of the previous years this side seems to have all the ingredients to go right to the top. “The way we’ve performed as a team it’s obviously created a lot of positive sentiments but obviously high expectations. A lot of people believe that this could be the year that we see ourselves within the final. As a team, individually we’d like nothing better than that,” said Bavuma. “But we also respect the game of cricket. You know, we’re not coming up against a mickey mouse team. Australia has a lot of experience and confidence in knockout games like this, so we’ve got to respect that. I’d hate to say that we deserve to go through because of the way we played our cricket. I don’t think that’s the way things go. There are only two guys in this group that have gone into a semi-final, Quinton (de Kock), and David Miller, so there’s not a lot of experience from all the other guys. There’s a sense of calmness within the team and obviously the normal level of anxiety that you would expect of going into the game tomorrow. But I think we’ll take a lot of confidence with our performances up until this point.” Bavuma is struggling with a hamstring injury, but he is determined to play. “Physically I feel alright. Obviously not 100%. So obviously this day becomes important in terms of decisions about tomorrow. I’m quite confident, but I mean, it’s not a unilateral decision that will be made.” Australia returns to the ground where Allan Border’s men won the cricket World Cup in 1987 beating England in the final. In that tournament Australia’s success was largely based on the starts their opening batsmen Geoff Marsh and David Boon gave them. Thirty-six years later, one of Marsh’s sons Mitch Marsh is making the headlines as a top order batsman in the Australian line up. “We’ve got a great opening pair in Travis (Head) and Davey (David Warner). Trav obviously missed the first half of the tournament due to injury, but in that New Zealand match, you saw the way they took the game away from them in basically the first 10 overs. That’s how we want to play,” said Australian Captain Pat Cummins. “Mitch Marsh, showed the last time what he can do at the top of the order, albeit at number three. So, yeah, really, pumped with how the batting line-ups are functioning at the moment.” South Africa had the better of Australia in the league stage but they have a very poor record against Australia in the semi-finals. “I don’t think it counts for too much. Obviously, you start from scratch every time you play. They’re a team we’ve played quite a lot and know quite well. This week it’s probably going to be quite different to the South African series we played against them a couple of months ago,” said Cummins. “What helps us is we’ve got a lot of guys that have been in this situation before, that have won one-day World Cup, T20 World Cup, and various other tournaments in big moments. That really helps. You can draw on that in the middle of the contest. In terms of the wicket, it does look like it’s probably going to spin a bit more than some of the other wickets which again, is the same for both teams.” – (ST)","pubDate":"2023-11-15 22:29:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e968f7d70b167e84eafdc52a43f24a11","title":"Sri Lanka Cricket congratulates Aravinda de Silva","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Sri-Lanka-Cricket-congratulates-Aravinda-de-Silva/23-755247","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Aravinda de Silva with the ICC award after being inducted to the Hall of Fame Sri Lanka Cricket has congratulated Aravinda de Silva on him being inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.

India gave an exceptional batting exhibition running up an imposing total of 397-4 scored courtesy of Virat Kohli’s 50th ODI century and Shreyas Iyer’s back-to-back hundreds, proved too much for the spirited Black Caps who put up a fighting display through a courageous century from Darryl Mitchell (134 off 119 balls, 9 fours, 7 sixes) to reply with 327. It was India’s tenth successive win in the tournament. India will have to await today’s second semi-final between Australia and South Africa to find who their opponents will be in the final at Ahmedabad on Sunday 19 November. It was not plain easy for India against a combative New Zealand side who at one time threatened to take the game away from them during the third wicket partnership of 181 between Mitchell and skipper Kane Williamson (69 off 73 balls, 9 fours, 1 six). India’s bowling which hadn’t been tested at all in this tournament was put under severe pressure during this stand. And it was their resilience that saw them fight back and regain control of the game. Mohammed Shami who spilled Williamson at 52, compensated for that lapse with a brilliant spell of bowling picking up wickets at crucial stages to end with career best figures of 7/57, his third five-fer in the current tournament. He also went past 50 wickets in World Cups, and became the highest wicket-taker moving past Adam Zampa with 23 wickets. From the moment Rohit Sharma won the toss it was all India as the captain set the pace with a pulsating 47 off 29 balls inclusive of four fours and four sixes that took him past West Indian Chris Gayle’s record of 49 sixes in World Cups. Sharma and his partner Shubman Gill put on an opening stand of 71 off 50 balls. Gill however had to leave the field with his score on 79 when the Mumbai heat got the better of him. His departure brought Iyer to the middle to join Kohli. The pair joined hands to stitch a mammoth partnership of 163 that was to lay the foundation for India’s final total. They scored boundaries at regular intervals and kept the momentum going with both of them notching up their respective tons. Playing in front of his idol Sachin Tendulkar, Kohli went onto reach his 50th ODI century (117 off 113 balls, 9 fours, 2 sixes) surpassing Tendulkar’s 49 at the same venue where he carried the great man on his shoulder after the 2011 World Cup triumph. Kohli also went past Tendulkar’s aggregate of 673 runs in 2003 for the most runs in a single World Cup. And all this was achieved in the presence of his wife and family. He received a standing ovation after he was dismissed. Iyer went on to play a terrific innings. He got to his hundred off 67 balls making it the fastest in a World Cup knockout surpassing Adam Gilchrist’s 72 balls in the 2007 final against Sri Lanka. With splendid timing Iyer gave a magnificent display of power hitting racing to 105 off 70 balls (4 fours, 8 sixes). Gill returned at the fall of Iyer’s wicket to add one run to his score and remain unbeaten on 80 (66 balls, 8 fours, 3 sixes) with Lokesh Rahul 39* (20 balls, 5 fours, 2 sixes) as India racked up 110 in the final 10 overs.

MUMBAI: Virat Kohli was down on his knees. He already had put his bat down on his side, just like a gladiator would his sword after a successful combat; he removed his gloves, and bowed. His idol Sachin Tendulkar was there so was the latter's immortalised self-manifested in a straight-drive statue. The capacity Wankhede crowd was on their feet chanting his name as Kohli took a moment to soak in all the emotions his career threw up. He had reached a milestone no other batter had done before — half-century of centuries. The occasion too was as fitting -- the World Cup semifinal against New Zealand. Kohli rose, lifted both his hands up and paid his respect to his hero. Even for someone who wears his emotions on his sleeves, Kohli seemed overwhelmed when he bowed to Tendulkar. Then came a flying kiss to his wife, Anushka Sharma, who too was visibly emotional. Records have been following Kohli like a shadow and this format, in which he thrives, these milestones have swelled like a piggybank. Such has been his dominance in ODIs, that at one point it looked like he would cruise past Tendulkar and would have scored several more ODI hundreds by now. But sport like life works in mysterious ways. For almost three years between 2019-2022, Kohli would not score a century. Not in any format. Once he came back from the mental health sabbatical he took in 2022, things took a turn for good and he has not looked back since. Kohli's role in the team for this World Cup has changed too. He is not the enforcer anymore. He is now playing purely as a batter, an anchor who holds one end up while the other batters express themselves around him. Rohit sets the tone while Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav would do the job in the later half. All Kohli has to do is get his eye in, play in singles and doubles and pick up a boundary once in a while and maintain a decent strike rate. That is what he has done throughout this World Cup, and Wednesday was no different. Kohli walked in after Sharma fell. Built partnerships with Shubman Gill, first, and Iyer later. The 35-year-old made them run like hell between the wickets in the Mumbai heat, brought out his cover drives, and reached his fifty in 59 balls. From there on, he was switched on. He lofted Trent Boult downtown, jumped out and flicked Tim Southee, played a deft glance for Glenn Phillips and in doing all this, he surpassed another Tendulkar record; most runs by a batter in a single WC (673 in 2003). At that point, it was clear that the century was coming. And when it did, a hard-ran two in the most typical Virat Kohli fashion, he jumped and punched the air in delight before going down to his knees. It was the kind of emotion you hadn’t seen in Kohli in a long time. It was the kind of celebration that told you how much it meant to him. By the time Kohli was done — 117 from 115 balls, 50 centuries in 279 innings — he had amassed 711 runs at a strike rate of 90.68 in this edition. In many ways, it is fitting that Kohli went past Tendulkar at Wankhede in a World Cup knockout game on November 15 with the latter watching from the stands. It was the same venue where he walked into a void of silence when Tendulkar got out in the 2011 World Cup final 12 years ago. It was the same venue where he would carry his idol on the shoulders moments after winning the World Cup in April 2011. It was the same date when Tendulkar walked off the field as an India batter for one last time in his farewell Test ten years ago at the same venue. It was his first century in a World Cup knockout game, something even Tendulkar does not have in his 24-year-long career. The picture could not have been more perfect. Kohli himself said so. “It's the stuff of dreams. Sachin paaji was there in the stands. It's very difficult for me to express it. My life partner (Anushka Sharma), my hero - he's sitting there. And all these fans at the Wankhede. If I wanted to paint a perfect picture, this would be it,” an emotional Kohli told broadcasters during the innings break. For someone who took up the sport watching his hero play, to share the dressing room with him, to win a World Cup with him, and then to go on and surpass one of the most ridiculous records your hero holds in front of his eyes at the biggest stage — Wednesday at Wankhede seemed like destiny for Kohli, where his life came one full circle. At the humongous theatre, his coronation was complete as the most prolific ODI batter the sport has seen.","content":"MUMBAI: Virat Kohli was down on his knees. He already had put his bat down on his side, just like a gladiator would his sword after a successful combat; he removed his gloves, and bowed. His idol Sachin Tendulkar was there so was the latter's immortalised self-manifested in a straight-drive statue. The capacity Wankhede crowd was on their feet chanting his name as Kohli took a moment to soak in all the emotions his career threw up. He had reached a milestone no other batter had done before — half-century of centuries. The occasion too was as fitting -- the World Cup semifinal against New Zealand. Kohli rose, lifted both his hands up and paid his respect to his hero. Even for someone who wears his emotions on his sleeves, Kohli seemed overwhelmed when he bowed to Tendulkar. Then came a flying kiss to his wife, Anushka Sharma, who too was visibly emotional.

KOLKATA: Legendary former Australian captain Steve Waugh got associated with Udayan, a residential centre for the rehabilitation of leprosy patients’ children on the outskirts of Kolkata, 25 years ago. A meeting with Mother Teresa in the city in 1996 inspired him to begin charity work and a couple of years later he decided to help out children of leprosy patients through the non-government organisation. Since then the association as one of the patrons of the NGO has only grown with the World Cup-winning captain also making sure he visits the centre whenever he is in the country. The last visit he made to the centre located at Sewli Telinipara village, Barrackpore, was in 2020 when the centre celebrated its 50th anniversary. With Australia playing South Africa in their all-important semifinal in the city on Thursday, the children have decided to cheer for the team from Down Under which once was led with great pride by their philanthropist. \"The children are not visiting the stadium for the match. Instead, they will watch it live on a projector at our recreation centre,\" Dipak Sahu, director of Udayan, told this daily. As Waugh is not here at the venue, where his team once famously won its maiden World Cup with him being an integral part of it, the children wanted to send a message saying they are standing firm behind the team from his country. \"At the moment, the NGO is supporting 113 girls and 157 boys. All of them along with us will watch the match and cheer for the Aussies. We have been certified by the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) India and Waugh donates around Rs 40 lakh to Rs 50 lakh every year through it to Udayan,\" informs Sahu. The centre aims at providing children with quality education including tertiary study and training in nursing, mechanics and physiotherapy which in turn provides them with job opportunities. Waugh's donation ensures the children get involved with tertiary study and vocational training and later get placements at various sectors. \"His donation helps us impart employment-based training to children which in turn helps them land jobs and make a living out of it. He is one of our patrons and his continued support is one of the reasons we are able to deliver year after year,\" signed off Sahu.

New Zealand then battled hard in the chase, but hopes of a third successive World Cup final appearance were dashed despite Daryl Mitchell’s fine 134 as they were all out for 327 as Mohammed Shami took a career-best seven for 57. 😲 Mohammed Shami – 7/57👑 Virat Kohli – 117💥 Shreyas Iyer – 105 India are through to their first men’s Cricket World Cup final in 12 years 🎉 Read the full match report 📝⬇️ — ICC Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) Rohit, though, admitted he had never taken victory as assured as the 1983 and 2011 champions kept on course for victory on home soil. “I have played a lot of cricket here, any score on this ground, you can’t relax. Got to get the job done quickly and stay at it,” Rohit said in his post-match presentation interview. “We knew there would be pressure on us. We were very calm, even though we were a bit sloppy on the field. “These things are bound to happen, but glad we could get the job done. “The form all the guys are in, top five or six batters, whenever they’ve gotten an opportunity, they’ve made it count.” 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗿! 🏆 🇮🇳 march into the FINAL of 🥳 | — BCCI (@BCCI) Rohit added: “Being the semi-final, I won’t say there was no pressure, whenever you play there’s pressure, but a semi-final adds a bit extra. “We wanted to not think too much about it, just do what we’ve been doing like in the first nine games. Things came off for us nicely in the second half.” After moving to three figures off 106 balls, Kohli leapt and punched the air, briefly sunk to his knees before rising and soaking up the acclaim from a frenzied crowd which included Tendulkar and David Beckham. Tendulkar wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, he “couldn’t be happier that an Indian broke my record” as Kohli moved into a class of his own in his 291st ODI – 172 fewer than his former team-mate. The first time I met you in the Indian dressing room, you were pranked by other teammates into touching my feet. I couldn’t stop laughing that day. But soon, you touched my heart with your passion and skill. I am so happy that that young boy has grown into a ‘Virat’ player.

My hero (Tendulkar) he’s sitting there. And I was able to get the 50th in front of all of them and all these fans in such a historic venue. It was amazing.” India gained a measure of revenge for being dumped out at the same stage of the 2019 tournament by the Black Caps. Shami said: “It feels amazing. In the last two World Cups, we lost (in the semi-finals), so who knows when or if we will get a chance again. “We wanted to do everything for this, one chance we didn’t want to let go.” Congratulations India. Good luck in the Final. Thank you to everyone who has supported the team during the near and far!

They deserve to be where they are, played outstandingly well. “It wasn’t to be today, but it was nice to be out there to give ourselves a chance. “It was a fantastic crowd, unbelievable atmosphere, slightly one-sided in the support, but special to be part of the tournament.”","pubDate":"2023-11-15 18:51:00","image_url":"https://www.echo-news.co.uk/resources/images/17450545/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"echo_uk","source_priority":159993,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"dea46273ff12632a19b1510f3ee6cc37","title":"Cricket World Cup 2023: '2019 Revenge Completed For MS Dhoni,' Fans React As Team India Beat New Zealand In Semifinal","link":"https://www.newsr.in/n/Sports/1zpogehwdc/Cricket-World-Cup-2023-2019-Revenge-Completed.htm","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket World Cup 2023: Fans were delighted to see India beat New Zealand in the semifinals at the Wankhede Stadium.

The 29-year-old's tenure as captain notably led the team to the pinnacle of the 50-over format rankings, a significant achievement acknowledged by cricket enthusiasts worldwide. Azam, who took on the role of white-ball captain in 2019 and later assumed the Test captaincy in 2020, faced mounting criticism in recent months. The team's lackluster performance in both the Asia Cup and the ongoing World Cup 2023 ultimately prompted his decision to step down. Teammate and wicket-keeper batsman Mohammad Rizwan expressed his admiration for Babar on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, hailing him as \"one of the greatest batsmen Pakistan has ever seen\" and declaring, \"Kaptaaana, aap Dilo k Kaptaan ho\" (Captain! You rule our hearts). Former Test captain Azhar Ali extended his gratitude to Babar for his captaincy stint, while ex-allrounder Mohammad Hafeez commended him for his services and wished him success in future endeavors. Sohail Tanveer and former spinner Saeed Ajmal also conveyed their appreciation for Babar's contributions, with Ajmal specifically acknowledging Babar's role in guiding Pakistan's ODI team to the No.1 spot. Babar's illustrious career, despite his young age, saw him dominate the rankings as the top-ranked ODI batter for over two years. He held a unique distinction as the only batter to secure top three positions across all formats. Reflecting on his achievements, Babar attributed reaching the No.1 spot in white-ball cricket to the collective efforts of players, coaches, and management.","pubDate":"2023-11-15 17:26:15","image_url":"https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/digital_images/large/2023-11-15/1700068039-9355.jpeg","source_id":"dailypakistanen","source_priority":97265,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
