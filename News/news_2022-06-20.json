A resounding six-wicket victory on the back of some fine contributions from Pathum Nissanka (137 off 147) and Kusal Mendis (87 off 85) in the third ODI versus Australia, has meant that Sri Lanka are just one step away from clinching the five-match ODI series. Ever since their jaw-dropping victory during the third T20I against the Aussies a few days ago, the Dasun Shanaka-led side have continued to produce some awe-inspiring performances with both bat and the ball, from both their experienced and young players alike. Australia, on the other hand, have been poor with the ball, especially during the death. One more loss in the upcoming two matches would mean that they would lose an away ODI series against Sri Lanka for the first time since 1992. The fourth ODI would, akin the previous one, take place at the R. Premadasa Stadium on June 21, with Sri Lanka perhaps taking the field with a slight advantage after registering their highest successful chase in history at this venue on Sunday. Pathum Nissanka (137) and Kusal Mendis (87) led the charge as Sri Lanka beat Australia by 6 wickets!

He has been in talks with some Apex Council members in Tripura but nothing has been finalised yet,‚Äù an official told PTI here. ‚ÄúHe has to first get a clearance (no-objection-certificate) from the CAB and then the BCCI and then it will be taken forward,‚Äù he added. Saha was not available for a comment. The 37-year-old, who played a stellar role in Gujarat Titans‚Äô IPL triumph in their debut season this year, had pulled out of the Bengal set-up after being rejected in the Indian Test team for Sri Lanka. After that, CAB joint-secretary Debabrata Das made some unsavoury remarks about Saha‚Äôs decision in the media, questioning his commitment, something that annoyed the seasoned wicketkeeper-batter. Having made a mark in the IPL, Saha was named in Bengal‚Äôs Ranji Trophy quarterfinal match squad against Jharkhand, but without his consent. The veteran wicketkeeper took strong exception to it and reportedly sought an apology from Das. Later, he made it clear he‚Äôs not going to play for Bengal again. Having made his debut for Bengal in 2007, Saha has played 122 first-class matches. ‚ÄîPTI ¬† Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-06-19 18:53:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka tour great opportunity to build team: Harmanpreet Kaur","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/06/20/sri-lanka-tour-great-opportunity-to-build-team-harmanpreet-kaur/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"BENGALURU: The likes of Mithali Raj ‚Äî who retired recently ‚Äî and Jhulan Goswami are not there in the team but India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur on Saturday reckoned that the upcoming limited overs tour to Sri Lanka is a great opportunity to ‚Äúbuild a team‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe are working hard on our team, we have great [‚Ä¶]","content":"BENGALURU: The likes of Mithali Raj ‚Äî who retired recently ‚Äî and Jhulan Goswami are not there in the team but India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur on Saturday reckoned that the upcoming limited overs tour to Sri Lanka is a great opportunity to ‚Äúbuild a team‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe are working hard on our team, we have great combinations. And for us, it is a good tour to start, because first-time we are going to play without our seniors and a great opportunity for all of us to build a team,‚Äù Harmanpreet said at the virtual pre-departure press conference. ‚ÄúFor me, it is a great opportunity where you can build a good team because Sri Lanka, I don‚Äôt think it is going to be an easy tour for us.‚Äù Mithali Raj has retired from all forms of the game, while experienced pacer Jhulan Goswami is not travelling to the island nation. Harmanpreet has been appointed as the ODI skipper, besides his role as T20I captain. She stressed on giving opportunities to young players. ‚ÄúIn the fielding department also, we will give opportunities to young players who can bowl 10 overs and look for breakthroughs. We are trying to do little-little things, where we (have) worked in this (NCA) camp and we are having a vision, so we will look for that (in terms of implementation),‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf we talk about our bowling unit, this is the time they are getting responsibility and this tour will be an ideal platform for them to perform where they can take charge and bowl full quota. ‚ÄúFor us it is important whatever we are planning, we should go and deliver, that is what as a unit we are looking forward (to),‚Äù she added. India will be playing three ODIs and as many T20Is during their tour to the Island nation, beginning on June 23. ‚ÄúNo one can fill Mithali‚Äôs place‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, as we all know, she (Mithali) has done great for women‚Äôs cricket and I don‚Äôt think anyone can fill this place. If you talk about Mithali Di, I don‚Äôt think there is anyone who can take her place and we will always miss her in our dressing rooms and the things she has done so far,‚Äù quipped Harmanpreet. ODIs: Would look to score over 300 runs per match So, does Harman want the team to play any specific brand of cricket in ODIs? ‚ÄúI think we did set some during the World Cup, where we were looking for 300 runs, but were able to score 280, 270. But this time, we will look to score more than 300 runs. ‚ÄúNow we do have some players who are playing good cricket. I think, if we set bigger targets for us, we can look for something bigger for us and as a batting unit that is what we are going to do,‚Äù she added. Harman stressed that the team would look to zero-in on the first combination in T20s. ‚ÄúIn T20, we will look to (at) our first combination and try to give them as many games as possible. In the ODIs, we have time to prepare for the next World Cup, where we will see if we can give a chance to each and every player,‚Äù she added. As a batter, Harmanpreet will look to score as many runs as possible. ‚ÄúI want to score maximum runs for my team. Batting is something that‚Äôs very important. Leading a team will be the second part because as a batter, if I can do well, it will be easy for me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄîPTI ¬† Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-06-19 18:52:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Nissanka century helps Sri Lanka to record ODI chase against Australia - The Guardian","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyL2p1bi8xOS9uaXNzYW5rYS1jZW50dXJ5LWhlbHBzLXNyaS1sYW5rYS10by1yZWNvcmQtb2RpLWNoYXNlLWFnYWluc3QtYXVzdHJhbGlh0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3Nwb3J0LzIwMjIvanVuLzE5L25pc3NhbmthLWNlbnR1cnktaGVscHMtc3JpLWxhbmthLXRvLXJlY29yZC1vZGktY2hhc2UtYWdhaW5zdC1hdXN0cmFsaWE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Nissanka century helps Sri Lanka to record ODI chase against Australia¬†¬†The GuardianBig problem in historic Aussie ODI defeat¬†¬†news.com.auCarey not surprised by 'cagey' Kuhnemann's instant impact | Sri Lanka v Australia 2022¬†¬†cricket.com.auStar‚Äôs ‚Äòall-time‚Äô destruction exposes big Aussie ODI issue in 10-year first¬†¬†Fox SportsSri Lanka beats Australia by six wickets in Colombo to take a 2-1 lead in the ODI series¬†¬†ABC NewsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-19 18:46:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-No fireworks this time as England beat Netherlands in second ODI","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/06/20/cricket-no-fireworks-this-time-as-england-beat-netherlands-in-second-odi","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - England beat Netherlands by six wickets in the second match of their ODI series on Sunday but were made to work much harder than in their spectacular record-breaking opening win.

Going from strength to strength, Sri Lanka have managed to gain a 2-1 lead over Australia in the ongoing five-match ODI series at home. With the hosts having won three out of six white-ball matches now, they have proved Australia that beating them is no cakewalk. Sri Lanka‚Äôs latest triumph has come in the form of a 6-wicket victory while chasing a 292-run target at the R Premdasa Stadium. Their highest successful ODI run-chase at this venue (third-highest at home), it is also Sri Lanka‚Äôs highest ODI chase against Australia. Playing his first match of the series in place of injured batter Danushka Gunathilaka, it was Niroshan Dickwella‚Äôs 26-ball 25 comprising of five fours which set the tone for what was always going to be a daunting chase on this surface. That being said, a match-winning 170-run second-wicket partnership between Pathum Nissanka (137) and Kusal Mendis (87) turned the tables to the extent that the home team won without any discomfort with nine balls to spare. Nissanka, who hit 11 fours and two sixes at a strike rate of 93.19, registered the highest individual score for a Sri Lankan batter against Australia. A maiden ODI century in his 15th match earned the 24-year old player with a maiden match award in this format. Mendis, on the other hand, missed out on a third ODI century after retiring hurt due to a hamstring niggle in Colombo tonight. All-rounder Dhananjaya de Silva‚Äôs brief 17-ball 25 with the help of four fours right after Mendis‚Äô return to the dressing room had further eased pressure of the Sri Lankan batters.

The Spaniard has not yet seen his loan spell in Turin made permanent, although the Italian giants remain keen on tying him down. Morata joined London rivals Chelsea in 2017, although he failed to reach the heights compatriot Diego Costa hit in the seasons before. According to The Mirror, Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side may look to capitalise on the slow negotiations in Italy as they look for a cheaper deal.

Chasing 292 to win, Sri Lanka shook off the early dismissal of Niroshan Dickwella for 25 as Nissanka and Mendis combined for a brilliant 170-run partnership for the second wicket to put their side in complete control. But while Mendis retired hurt with a hamstring injury on 87, Nissanka hung on to take his team close to the finish line which they crossed with nine balls to spare after to a quick-fire 25 by Dhananjaya de Silva and Charith Asalanka's steady 13. Nissanka's knock came off 147 deliveries and contained 11 fours and two sixes. Australia opted to bat first after winning the toss and an unbeaten 70 from Travis Head and 62 from skipper Aaron Finch helped them to a competitive 291-6 on a tricky Colombo wicket which was slow and offered the spin bowlers some turn. Head and Alex Carey (49) combined superbly during their 72-run partnership after Australia found themselves in a difficult position at 121-4, before Glenn Maxwell smashed 33 off 18 balls in a strong finish to the innings. Jeffrey Vandersay was the pick of the bowlers claiming 3-49 for Sri Lanka, who dropped four catches, while Head was lucky to survive a big appeal for leg-before when he was on four as the hosts did not review the umpire's decision.

During the third ODI of the ongoing Australia‚Äôs tour of Sri Lanka in Colombo, Sri Lanka beat Australia by 6 wickets to gain a 2-1 lead with two more matches to be played. Chasing a 292-run target, it appeared unlikely that Sri Lanka would be able to win the match at first. However, the hosts surprised one and all by registering a comfortable victory with nine balls to spare. In what is the 11th highest successful ODI run-chase for Sri Lanka, it is their third-highest at home, second-highest of 2022 and highest against Australia and at the R Premdasa Stadium. Sri Lanka, who have now won three out of six matches against Australia this month, wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do the same if not for a match-winning 170-run second-wicket partnership between Pathum Nissanka (137) and Kusal Mendis (87). While Nissanka managed to bring up a maiden ODI century, Mendis missed out on a third ODI century after retiring hurt due to a hamstring niggle tonight. While Australia did manage to dismiss three Sri Lankan batters in the third powerplay, it all become all too late for them to stage a comeback. With bowling figures of 9-0-39-2, Australia fast bowler Jhye Richardson was the pick of the bowlers for them.

For those unaware, the start of play had already been delayed by 20 minutes due to a brief yet intense spell of downpour right before the first delivery, which resulted in the series deciding match being reduced to 19 Overs-a-side each. However, with the rain refusing to relent, and with a cut-off time of 10:12 pm IST for a 5-Over-a-side match, the match officials decided to ultimately abandon the match, with the series result ending in a stalemate at 2-2.

While a positive start to a 292-run chase was halted a bit by the dismissal of Niroshan Dickwella (25) in the eighth over, a 170-run second-wicket partnership between Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis has put the hosts in a commanding position at the R Premdasa Stadium tonight. While Nissanka has managed to register a maiden ODI century, a serious hamstring niggle forced Mendis to retire hurt when he was on the brink of a third ODI century. Pathum Nissankaüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª ‚Äî Ian Raphael Bishop (@irbishi) June 19, 2022 All-rounder Dhananjaya de Silva putting on display a positive start to his innings has further put Sri Lanka into the driver‚Äôs seat. Assuming that Nissanka and de Silva continue to play in this fashion, sealing this chase shouldn‚Äôt be difficult for Sri Lanka. The same will also put them forward in the series with a 2-1 lead with two more ODIs to be played. Sri Lankan fans have multiple options of watching this ongoing five-match series. They can tune in to either of Sri Lanka YouTube channel or Channel Eye to follow these matches on an internet streaming platform. As far as the official television channel is concerned, Dialog TV is broadcasting Australia‚Äôs tour of Sri Lanka 2022 for Sri Lankan fans. With all of these options (barring Sri Lanka Cricket YouTube channel) requiring paid subscriptions, there‚Äôs no official way of watching this series on a streaming app for free.","pubDate":"2022-06-19 16:27:40","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Highlights, IND vs SA 5th T20, Full Cricket Score: Match called off due to rain, series shared 2-2 - Firstpost - Firstpost","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maXJzdHBvc3QuY29tL2ZpcnN0Y3JpY2tldC9zcG9ydHMtbmV3cy9oaWdobGlnaHRzLWluZC12cy1zYS01dGgtdDIwLWZ1bGwtY3JpY2tldC1zY29yZS1tYXRjaC1jYWxsZWQtb2ZmLWR1ZS10by1yYWluLXNlcmllcy1zaGFyZWQtMi0yLTEwODEwODYxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Highlights, IND vs SA 5th T20, Full Cricket Score: Match called off due to rain, series shared 2-2 - Firstpost¬†¬†FirstpostIND vs SA: Bangalore Weather Today, India vs South Africa Weather Forecast, South Africa tour of India 2022, 5th T20I¬†¬†Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - India vs South Africa, South Africa in India 2022, 5th T20I¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoIND vs SA 5th T20I LIVE: India vs South Africa scorecard, ball to ball commentary¬†¬†The Indian ExpressThis ground will erupt for three people: Aakash Chopra on RCB stars‚Äôs return to their home ground in Bangalore¬†¬†India TodayView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-19 16:27:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sub air system in cricket stadium: How does sub air system at M Chinnaswamy Stadium Bengaluru work?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-sub-air-system-in-cricket-stadium-how-does-sub-air-system-at-m-chinnaswamy-stadium-bengaluru-work/","keywords":["Cricket","M Chinnaswamy Stadium","South Africa tour of India 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sub air system in cricket stadium: Despite the innovative drainage facility, chances of resumption of 5th T20I between IND vs SA look grim.

During the fifth T20I of the ongoing South Africa‚Äôs tour of India at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, the rain Gods have yet again made an appearance after mere 3.3 Overs into the match. It is worth of a mention that, the start of play had already been delayed by 20 minutes due to a brief yet intense spell of downpour right before the first delivery, which resulted in the series deciding match being reduced to 19 Overs-a-side each. The bad news for the fans is that the present rainfall at the venue doesn‚Äôt seem like a passing shower as the downpour is quite intense, which has started to puncture the spirit and enthusiasm of the spectators. The aforementioned development has meant that the match is losing one Over for every four minutes lost, which ultimately means that for it to be a 5 Overs contest, the play will have to resume by 10:12 pm IST, which is around 25 minutes from now (at the time of writing). A torrential downpour being witnessed at the stadium has meant that despite the SubAir system, the drying process will take some time, if at all the rain Gods show some mercy. The SubAir surface aeration and vacuum-powered drainage system, or simply the SubAir system is the first of a kind Cricket infrastructure innovation in the country, which was installed at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in the year 2017. The technology helps prevent water logging at the stadium ground for long as it reportedly is capable of draining water 36 times faster than under normal circumstances (information source: Cricbuzz ). Basically, SubAir system acts as a vacuum and absorbs water into the pipes much quicker. In layman‚Äôs words. https://t.co/ROhIFVoJCU ‚Äî Bharath Ramaraj (@Fancricket12) June 19, 2022 The system functions by sucking the water out via the super absorption pipes at the rate of over 10,000 litres a minute from the time it begins to rain at the ground. The technology works via activated signals from the remote sensors installed in the field. The aforementioned technology incurred an investment cost of INR 4.25 Crore, borne by the Karnataka State Association Stadium (KSCA). Moreover, the maintenance of this vacuum-powered drainage system will require the KSCA to shed its maintenance cost of INR 7 lakh per year.","pubDate":"2022-06-19 16:17:14","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch as Daniil Medvedev‚Äôs coach storms off court after Russian tennis star screams at him leaving wife in tears","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/18937205/daniil-medvedev-tennis-halle/","keywords":["Football","Tennis"],"creator":["Kealan Hughes"],"video_url":null,"description":"DANIIL MEDVEDEV lost his cool and left his wife in tears after abusing his coach in a Halle Open final defeat to Hubert Hurkacz.

Earlier, in an interview, Mithali opened up on her relationship with Harmanpreet during the controversial phase where he was left out of the Indian team during the 2018 ICC T20 World Cup semifinal match against England under the captaincy of Harmanpreet. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there has been any problem between me and Mithali. I can speak for myself. You have to speak to her and ask if she has a problem with me. I have always respected her as a senior. We are mature enough to handle the situation. We will have to play as a unit to take the team forward. We are more team players than individuals. If you think about the team cause, you will put your head down and work towards that. I have met her and spoken to her after all these events and we seem to have moved on,‚Äù Harmanpreet was quoted as saying by The Mumbai Mirror.
