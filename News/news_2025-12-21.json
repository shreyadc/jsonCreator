Afghanistan Premier League (APL) is set to return in 2026, marking the league’s second season. This time, five teams will compete in the tournament.On Saturday, the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) hosted a special ceremony in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where they officially announced key details including the number of teams, the tournament schedule, and unveiled the league’s new logo.The event was attended by the Ambassador of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to the UAE, Mawlawi Badruddin, investors, members of the International and Asian Cricket Councils, officials from the Emirates Cricket Board, and players.During the ceremony, the ACB revealed that a ten-year agreement has been signed, ensuring that the APL will be held annually during the months of September and October.ACB CEO Naseeb Khan stated: “The second season of the APL, featuring five franchises, will be held in September 2026 in the UAE.”He explained that it took nearly three years to resolve issues from the inaugural season, establish a transparent procurement process, secure credible investors, and obtain legal stadium permissions in the UAE.He said that due to the 2025 World Cup, the Indian Premier League, and the extreme summer heat in the UAE, the APL has been scheduled for September 2026.The names of the five participating teams have not yet been announced. Each franchise’s full name will include both the company name and the team identity, which will be revealed at a later date.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":null,"creator":["Omar.Sahar"],"language":"english","country":["afghanistan"],"category":["sports","top"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-20 17:24:12","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://tolonews.com/sites/default/files/2025-12/New%20Project%20(14).jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"tolonews","source_name":"Tolonews","source_priority":61736,"source_url":"https://tolonews.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/tolonews.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"86420467d4393c5d9e3f57a0de1c6c87","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/odi-world-champs-india-women-back-to-play-sri-lanka-t20is-101766251390252.html","title":"ODI world champs India women back to play Sri Lanka T20Is","description":"India's women's cricket team starts a T20I series against Sri Lanka, focusing on preparations for the upcoming Women's T20 World Cup after their ODI victory.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["cricket"],"creator":["hindustan times"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2025-12-20 17:23:09","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/20/1600x900/logo/India-skipper-Harmanpreet-Kaur-with-head-coach-Amo_1766251388169.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"hindustantimes","source_name":"Hindustan Times","source_priority":2173,"source_url":"http://www.hindustantimes.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/hindustantimes.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"11219e27eb26f7bb2dbf738907e95966","link":"https://newsable.asianetnews.com/sports/cricket-t20-world-cup-2026-did-gambhir-play-role-in-shubman-omission-india-squad-articleshow-1dqltpu","title":"T20 World Cup 2026: Did Gautam Gambhir Play a Role in Shubman Gill's Omission from India Squad?","description":"Shubman Gill, India’s Test and ODI captain, was shockingly left out of the T20 World Cup 2026 squad.
