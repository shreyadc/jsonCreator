But the wicketkeeper-batter showed immense grit and determination and made world cricket his happy hunting ground. 'MS Dhoni Ate Only Khichdi.......' Virender Sehwag Reveals MSD’s Special Diet During India’s 2011 World Cup Winning Campaign In his illustrious international career spanning over 15 years, Dhoni tormented bowlers with his marauding bat and piled on runs for fun. Also, he was an inspirational leader and piloted India to many epic triumphs. Moreover, Dhoni was a force to be reckoned with behind the stumps. As we celebrate the 42nd birthday of the Indian legend on July 7, 2023, let us revisit some of his top batting displays in international cricket. Photo of MS Dhoni’s Giant 52 Feet Cut Out in Hyderabad Ahead of His 42nd Birthday Goes Viral 91* runs off 79 balls vs Sri Lanka, World Cup 2011 India and Sri Lanka took centre stage in the final showdown of the 2011 World Cup in Mumbai. Sri Lanka batted first and posted a formidable total of 274 runs on the board. India, in reply, were 114 for 3 in the 22nd over. The game was on a knife’s edge and entered Dhoni. He played according to the situation and stitched a 109-run stand with Gautam Gambhir. Though Gambhir was dismissed, the then-India skipper carried on milking runs and shepherded the Men in Blue to a historic triumph. The wicket-keeper-batter scored 91* runs off 79 balls. 183* runs off 145 balls vs Sri Lanka, 3rd ODI, Sri Lanka Tour of India, 2005 India crossed swords against Sri Lanka in the third game of the seven-match ODI series in Jaipur. Chasing the daunting target of 299, Dhoni put up a dominant show with the bat and hammered Sri Lankan bowlers all across the park. He blasted 183* runs off 145 balls to take his team across the line in the 47th over itself. 148 runs off 123 balls vs Pakistan, 2nd ODI, Pakistan Tour of India, 2005 India clashed with Pakistan in the second game of the six-match ODI series on April 2005 in Visakhapatnam. Dhoni was in his elements and knocked the wind out of the opposition's attack. He smashed 148 runs off 123 deliveries to help India post a mammoth score of 356 runs on the board. It was the legendary cricketer’s first international century. India ended up winning the game by 58 runs. 224 runs off 265 balls vs Australia, 1st Test, Australia Tour of India, 2013 India squared off against Australia in the first Test of the four-match Test series in Chennai in 2013. MS Dhoni put up an exhibition of his swashbuckling strokeplay and notched up a magnificent double century. He piled on 224 runs off 265 balls to help India post a gigantic total of 572 in their first innings. Moreover, Dhoni’s dazzling knock was a history-making one as he became the first Indian wicketkeeper-batter to breach the 200-mark in Test cricket. 45 runs off 33 balls vs South Africa, T20 World Cup 2007 India took the stage alongside South Africa in a crunch group stage in the inaugural edition of the T20 World Cup in Durban. After electing to bat first, India were in a precarious situation at 61 for 4 in the 11th over. MS Dhoni entered the crease and joined hands with Rohit Sharma to bail India out of trouble. The wicketkeeper-batter played a brisk knock of 45 runs off 33 balls. The Men in Blue went on to post 153 runs in 20 overs and, eventually, won the game by 37 runs.

Bairstow finished on one not out at stumps in the third Ashes Test after facing 19 deliveries. The 33-year-old also ensured he wasn't stumped, seemingly having learnt his lesson from his dismissal at Lord's which has been one of the most controversial Ashes moments in recent memory. Promoted to bat at five, Bairstow set the tone by dramatically placing his bat inside his crease - while at the same time staring down the Aussies in the field. It was a cheeky piece of theatre that went over a treat at Headingley, which is the Yorkshireman's home ground. Jonny Bairstow knew all eyes would be on him at Headingley - and he didn't miss the opportunity to fire up the home crowd and also send a message to the Aussies (pictured) following his infamous Lord's dismissal But as has been the case across the Ashes series, Bairstow was poor behind the stumps, dropping a number of catches (pictured, he reacts after spilling a catch from Travis Head) Another catch left by Jhonny bairstow #Bairstow pic.twitter.com/3gkbCjeLk9 — Hammad Nasrullah (@HammadNasrulla2) July 6, 2023 But as has been the case across the entire series, Bairstow was again poor behind the stumps after Australia were sent in to bat first, with the wicketkeeper dropping a number of chances. After a pulsating day one, England are 3/68 in reply to Australia's 263, with Mitch Marsh's century saving the tourists , who at times had no answer to Mark Wood's pace, who finished with impressive figures of 5/34. Marsh, who replaced the rested Cameron Green, blasted 118 from as many balls in an innings to savour following his recall. His swashbuckling innings featured 17 boundaries and four sixes, and the much maligned all-rounder - who also claimed the key wicket of Zak Crawley with the ball - was elated after day one. 'It was pretty amazing. I'm a little lost for words,' Marsh said.

In isolation, the incident would spark little debate. However, it comes on the heels of the English skipper accusing Australia of breaching the 'spirit of cricket' in the second Test at Lord's. Bairstow was stumped by Australian wicketkeeper Alex Carey on a crucial final day of play, which proved costly as the Aussies won to lead the series 2-0. While the dismissal was completely fair under the laws of the game, Stokes was left fuming after the match. 'If I was fielding captain I would have had a real think about the spirit of the game. For Australia it was the match-winning moment. Would I want to win a game in that manner? The answer for me is no,' he said. Stokes didn't live up to those words on Thursday, however. Stokes has been very vocal about how important it is to uphold the spirit of cricket following the Bairstow dismissal at Lord's The English skipper's values took a remarkable U-turn at Headingley, though, when he claimed to save this boundary even though he clearly touched the rope Cricket fans were quick to mock Stokes and his opinions on the spirit of the game after the controversial call on day one of the third Test On the first day of play in the third Test at Headingley, Australia was on the ropes as the English pace attack had the tourists reeling at 4-85. However, Ben Stokes seemed to defy the principles of fair play in pursuit of gaining an advantage during the subsequent session. A powerful shot from Travis Head, aimed towards the boundary rope, seemed unstoppable, but Stokes gave a great chase. With astonishing agility, the English captain managed to flick the ball back into play with a swift movement of his right hand. It appeared that he had successfully saved his team from conceding four runs. However, footage revealed that Stokes left arm had made contact with the boundary rope while the ball was in his right hand. Aussie skipper Pat Cummins celebrates Bairstow's stumping by Alex Carey after the English batsman strolled out of his crease while the ball was still live Stokes believes he would have rescinded an English appeal if they had done the same thing to an Australian batter Even English commentators could see that it was a boundary. 'That looks like four, four to me,' Former England captain Nasser Hussain said as the replays rolled. Third umpire Joel Wilson looked over the replays and ultimately decided Stokes had saved the boundary and only two runs were awarded. 'Wow, how's that not a four? No idea how that's not a four.' Hussain said in disbelief. Comedian Peter Helliar was incensed, writing on Twitter: 'How wasn't that a 4?? And why didn't Stokes call it in the 'spirit of cricket'??!!!' Former Australian cricketer Darren Berry couldn't believe it either. 'OMG THIS IS WHY WE GET UPSET. Stokes clearly touching the rope for the world to see but the 3rd umpire gets it wrong. HOW️? human error even with the technology that is just not good enough,' he posted. Aussie cricket fans were also quick to seize upon the apparent hypocrisy. 'I'm surprised one of the elder statesmen of the team didn't have a chat to stokes about upholding the spirit of the game.. I'm sure he doesn't want to win a game like that,' one fan posted. 'Stokes could have put his hand up and over-ruled the third umpire. #spiritofcricket and all,' tweeted another. 'I'll take Stokes' word that he saved it, you know, in the Spirit of Cricket and all,' added another.

Mail Sport's DAVID LLOYD watched on as momentum shifted in and out of England's favour on day one, with Mark Wood picking up a five-wicket haul while Aussie all-rounder Mitchell Marsh smashed an impressive century. From the Ugly Mugs café to Gareth Southgate on the radio, Bumble shares his thoughts after a 'rock 'n' roll' day of Test cricket. Why I love Ugly Mugs They don’t miss a trick in looking after the public here in Leeds, with the pubs around Headingley opening at eight o’clock in the morning. For a hearty full English breakfast though, it’s Ugly Mugs for me. A proper caff that’s just outside the ground. You’ll see me there on a morning! Australia were bowled out for 263 on a 'rock 'n' roll' day of Test cricket in Yorkshire on Thursday Jonny Bairstow (left) and Joe Root (right) will get England's innings back underway on 68-3 Winning the toss pays off You know what they say at Headingley for the toss. Look up — don’t look down. And with plenty of cloud cover and the help of some proper pace in the excellent Mark Wood, it was brilliant to see England make the most out of winning the toss. As my mate Michael Holding would say: ‘Pace makes you do funny things!’ It's far from grim up north Players will get full value for their shots here — the outfield has been properly cropped, it’s rock-hard and the ball will run away on it. That’s all because of the weather up north — it’s very hot in the Rhubarb Triangle. If you’re ever short of a vacation, try Scarbados (Scarborough), Ponte Carlo (Pontefract), Cas Vegas (Castleford) or Barnselona (Barnsley). And if you really fancy it, go and spend a fortnight in Hull! Superb Southgate makes waves on radio What a wonderful interview with Gareth Southgate on Test Match Special. What struck me was the closeness of the dressing room and the responsibility of him and his coaches to keep the players calm, knowing how responsible they are for the emotional levels of the spectators. Gareth Southgate made an appearance on Test Match Special during his visit to Headingley Mark Wood took a five-wicket haul at Headingley after stunning Australia with his express pace It was a fabulous interview about coaching young people at elite level and getting them working together, knowing what it means to represent their country. And Southgate even revealed that he has had meetings with Rob Key! Follow Mail Sport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Don't forget Fred Well, Wood’s first over was recorded on Sky as the fastest ever here at Headingley. That’s absolute nonsense. They’ve obviously never seen Fred Trueman here. He would say he could bowl faster than Wood in a pair of wellingtons. He were like lightning! I can hear Fred now: ‘If that Wood’s 95mph, I must have been 150mph!’ Ex-England fast bowler Fred Trueman was also known for his express pace (pictured in 1968) What a rock 'n' roll day's play This is what a Test match pitch should be like. It’s absolutely fantastic with something in it for both bowler and batsman. What a counterpunch by Mitchell Marsh and ‘exhilarating’ is how I would describe Wood. The bouncer in the morning that went over the batter, the keeper and bounced once before it hit the sightscreen was seriously Jeff Thomson-esque. It was a day of real rock ‘n’ roll cricket.

Centurion Mitchell Marsh was the only batter in Australia's order who looked comfortable against England's ferocious bowling attack, spearheaded by paceman Mark Wood, as he knocked an impressive 118 on his return to the side. After picking up the crucial wicket of Usman Khawaja, Wood skittled Australia's tail to record his first ever five-wicket haul on home soil, rescuing the hosts after a series of poor dropped catches in the slip cordon. Although England felt they had the upper hand, Australia bounced back with a vengeance in the field, dismissing Ben Duckett, Harry Brook and Zak Crawley in the evening to leave Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow at the crease ahead of Friday. But which side won the first day's cricket? Mail Sport's LAWRENCE BOOTH gives his verdict. Mark Wood's five-wicket haul helped England bowl the Australians out for 263 on Thursday The tourists responded well and knocked England back in the evening session, forcing them to 68-3 at stumps with Yorkshire pair Jonny Bairstow (left) and Joe Root (right) at the crease Morning session: England (1 point) Stuart Broad began the session by removing David Warner for the 16th time in Tests, and ended it by having Steve Smith caught behind for 22, as Australia reached lunch on 91 for four. In between, Mark Wood bowled the most thrilling spell of the series so far, bowling Usman Khawaja with a delivery measuring 94.6mph, and at one point touching 96.5mph, the fastest ball recorded at Headingley. Follow Mail Sport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Afternoon session: Australia (1 point) Yet another dropped catch by England, this time by Joe Root at slip off Chris Woakes, changed the complexion of the day. Mitchell Marsh exploded at the crease with a century of 118 from as many balls at Headingley Mitchell Marsh, who had 12 at the time, went on to belt a magnificent run-a-ball 118 — including 113 in the session — before finally falling to Woakes in the last over before tea. By then, Marsh and second fiddle Travis Head had added 155. Evening session: Shared (½ point each) Wood terrorised Australia’s lower order — extending their collapse to six for 23 — as he recorded his first five-wicket haul in this country. But Pat Cummins, dismissed by Wood for a duck, then knocked over Ben Duckett and Harry Brook for two and three, respectively. Marsh then capped a superb day by having Zak Crawley caught in the slips for 33, before England closed on 68 for three. Verdict after day one: HONOURS EVEN (England: 1½ pts, Australia: 1½ pts) Root's drop of Marsh on 12 proved a costly one for England, as the visitors would've been 98-5 Play of the day: Root's reprieve of Marsh If Joe Root had held on to a regulation slip catch when Mitchell Marsh edged Chris Woakes on 12, Australia would have been 98 for five. Instead, Marsh belted his first Test century in this country, helping the tourists reach 240 for four before a late collapse brought England back into the game.

England skittled the Aussies for 263 , despite Mitchell Marsh's impressive knock of 118, before falling to 68-3 at stumps with Yorkshire pair Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root at the crease. Mail Sport's LAWRENCE BOOTH takes a look at the big stats from the first day at Headingley. Mark Wood took five wickets in a home Test for the first time, at the 14th attempt. His previous five-wicket hauls had come in St Lucia (five for 41 v West Indies in 2018-19), Johannesburg (five for 46 v South Africa in 2019-20) and Hobart (six for 37 v Australia in 2021-22). Wood’s figures of five for 34 meant he finished an innings with a Test bowling average below 30 for the first time in his career. Mark Wood's express pace helped bowl Australia out for 263 on day one of the third Ashes Test England rued dropping Mitchell Marsh after the Australian went on to score a stunning century England ended the day on 68-3 with Jonny Bairstow (left) and Joe Root (right) at the crease Mitchell Marsh has now made three Test hundreds — all against England, following 181 at Perth and 101 at Sydney, both in 2017-18. Against England, he has made 527 runs at 52; against everyone else 851 at 20. Steve Smith made only 22, but it was enough to take him into third place in the all-time Ashes run-making list, ahead of former Australia captain Allan Border’s total of 3,222. Ahead of Smith are Don Bradman (5,028) and Jack Hobbs (3,636). Border also made 326 runs against England in non-Ashes matches. England’s donations to Australian totals carried on, as they conceded another 23 extras, to go with the 44 at Edgbaston and the 74 at Lord’s — a total of 141. Australia have given up 68 extras all told.

When no one gave them a chance, the Dutch stood up and were equal to the challenge at hand. They needed to chase down the set target of 248 runs in 44 overs to book their ticket to India and they managed to sail through in the 43rd over. After winning the toss and electing to field first, Netherlands restricted Scotland to 277/9 in 50 overs, they went on to finish on 278/6 in 42,5 overs. The win was extra special for Netherlands who came into the tournament without some of their seasoned players who had opted for county cricket in England. For Netherlands, however, it is not the end as they are set to go on and play against Sri Lanka in the final at Harare Sports Club on Sunday. The two teams will proceed to the 2023 Men’s Cricket World Cup finals. Sri Lanka qualified with eight points while Netherlands had six and qualified through net run rate as they had a better one compared to Scotland. – @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-07-06 22:02:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chevrons eye T20 qualifiers","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/chevrons-eye-t20-qualifiers/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Chronicle Editor"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brandon Moyo, Brandonmalvin9@gmail.com AFTER a disappointing end to their 2023 Men’s World Cup Qualifiers, it was not the end of the road for Zimbabwe as they will take part in another qualification tournament before the end of the year.

The Chevrons are set to compete in the Africa Regional Final qualification tournament which is set for Namibia in November. Zimbabwe will have a chance of booking their place in the biggest T20 World Cup which will feature 20 teams. A total of seven African teams will compete for the two available slots to the global showpiece. The Chevrons and the tournament hosts, Namibia did not participate in the Sub-Regional Qualifiers which five of their opponents played in. Only two teams from the African Qualification tournament will proceed to the global showpiece which will be co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States of America (USA) in June next year. Besides Zimbabwe and the hosts, Namibia, the other teams that will take part in the qualification tournament are Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The tournament will run from November 20 to 1 December. Zimbabwe missed out on direct qualification to the World Cup after failing to make the top eight in the previous edition of the tournament which was held in Australia last year. A total of 12 teams have already secured their spots and they are the hosts, West Indies and USA, England, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Netherlands, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Bangladesh and Netherlands qualified automatically as the best-ranked teams in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Men’s T20I Team Rankings, as of 14 November 2022. The 20 teams in the World Cup will be divided into four groups of five, from which the top two teams in each group advance to the Super Eight round. The upcoming qualification tournament will be the perfect opportunity for the Chevrons to put past them the failure to qualify for the One Day International (ODI) World Cup which they will be missing for the second time in a row. Last year, Zimbabwe ended a six-year wait to take part in a major international event after qualifying for the T20 World Cup and going on to reach the Super 12 stage for the first time ever. Playing and winning the upcoming qualifiers will be a big confidence booster to the Chevrons camp. – @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-07-06 22:02:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"THE NOTEBOOK: Aussie brewers plan to send 'England bitter' to hosts and Carey still owes the barber!","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12272641/THE-NOTEBOOK-Aussie-brewers-plan-send-England-bitter-hosts-Carey-owes-barber.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"RICHARD GIBSON: Oh, how we laughed.

The hosts' top order continued to struggle however, as Ben Duckett, Harry Brook and Zak Crawley were dismissed cheaply by the Australians to leave England 68-3 at stumps on day one , with Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow at the crease. Ben Stokes' side came into the third Ashes Test having lost a contentious match at Lord's last week, which saw England question the tourists' sportsmanship after they stumped Bairstow controversially on the final day. England came into the clash at Headingley 2-0 down in the series and contributed to another entertaining day, with impressive bowling, dropped catches and quickfire wickets. Mail Sport takes a look at the things you might have missed in Yorkshire during the first day. Mark Wood took five wickets as England bowled Australia out for 263 on day one at Headingley Aussies brewers' bitter joke Oh, how we laughed. Australian brewers VB were planning to send Ben Stokes’ team a slab of special edition ‘England Bitter’ following the controversial defeat at Lord’s which featured the home team refusing to have a post-match drink with Australia. A note inviting the England team to drink the beers warm or cold, win, lose or draw following this Test match was due to accompany the delivery, and England Bitter T-shirts are also in production. On the other side of the Ashes divide, famous Headingley haunt Ugly Mugs is selling a Ben Stokes burger — an extra meaty offering in honour of his six-hitting last week. Rainbow Laces promote inclusion England’s players showed their support for Stonewall’s Rainbow Laces campaign — designed to promote LGBTQ+ inclusion in sport — with several wearing them as wrist bands on day one. The stumps were also decorated with the branding. ‘As a group we believe that cricket should be a game that everyone can play, watch and enjoy. We’re really proud to support LGBTQ+ inclusion in cricket,’ said England’s Joe Root. The stumps were decorated with colours in support of Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign Stubbings to join tourists' staff The locals did not hold back in their verbal hostilities on Thursday but one Yorkshireman who will be supporting the Australians in the not too distant future is Steve Stubbings.

The Bears, put in, set Essex - who'd beaten them convincingly in the four-day game recently - 168 and, although they managed to drag them game into the 40th over of the match, it was more knock-out disappointment after a stunning group campaign. Dan Lawrence, released by England after his Ashes call-up, scored 62 for the visitors and earned the player of the match award in the process as the Eagles claimed a two-wicket victory which, earlier in the chase, looked a formality. Sam Hain, with his fifth half century of the campaign, was once again the pick of the Bears' batting. We've been used to quite fast paced starts from this Bears unit in the group stage - bar that freak encounter with Nottinghamshire last week - and so this, by comparison, was quite lethargic. By the 16th ball, they were 5/1 having lost the in-form Rob Yates in the first over. Partner and captain Alex Davies swiftly - and controversially - followed, when he was adjudged to have gloved a delivery through to the keeper. UltraEdge didn't pick anything up, although it was suggested later on by Sky Sports that there was a fault with the system. Bears fans, come and join our Facebook group by clicking here! Glenn Maxwell (32) threatened to make a hefty contribution as he finally lit the blue touchpaper in the second half of the powerplay; he crashed an almighty blow, off the bowling of Daniel Sams, into the Hollies. With the Bears 54/2 and rebuilding, though, Maxwell - like Yates - sent one skyward and Sams took the catch off the bowling of Paul Walter. While exciting young talents Dan Mousley (16) and Jacob Bethell (4), despite enjoying excellent and progressive campaigns of their own, stuttered in the middle order, the ever reliable Sam Hain (52) stood tall. His straight six was a commanding stroke indeed, while a number of his five fours were particularly inventive. He put on 44 with Chris Benjamin (24), who was bumped down the order to bat with the tail, while Dominic Drakes (23) also produced a very useful late knock to help lift the Bears up to 167. Competitive if nothing else, but you'd have hoped for more - a bigger total was on the cards had the Bears begun their innings quicker. That certainly appeared to be the case almost from the off in the chase. Adam Rossington and Lawrence immediately launched an assault on the Bears' bowling attack, although there were some infuriating strokes of luck along the way as Essex enjoyed great value for their shots. At 69/1 after the powerplay, which included 12 boundaries and a maximum, the Bears' only shout was the removal of Rossington, short of his ground when Davies brilliantly threw down three stumps. The Eagles, though, were well on their way. Even after the double blow in the space of three balls - Mousley removed Michael Pepper and then Jake Lintott dismissed Feroze Khushi for a golden duck - Paul Walter joined Lawrence at the crease and inflicted a couple of meaty blows to drag Essex's required run rate to near enough a run a ball. The Bears just couldn't get Lawrence (62), whose half century arrived off 34 deliveries, even though they frequently struck at the other end - Walter, Matt Critchley and Daniel Sams all departed swiftly, one after the other. The effervescent Simon Harmer arrived at the crease to help ease Essex towards their target and restored temporary control of the innings, but the Bears to their credit took the game as deep as possible and, having finally removed Lawrence, quickly followed by Harmer, Essex's tail got them over the line in the final over to ensure that the 2019 champions would be returning to Edgbaston next Saturday. It's another year of waiting for the Bears.","pubDate":"2023-07-06 20:54:50","image_url":"https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article27273241.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Birmingham-Bears-v-Essex-Eagles-Vitality-Blast-T20-Edgbaston.jpg","source_id":"birminghammail","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"MS Dhoni Birthday Special: Revisiting the Legendary Ex-India Captain's Top Five Knocks in International Cricket","link":"https://www.latestly.com/sports/cricket/ms-dhoni-birthday-special-revisiting-the-legendary-ex-india-captains-top-five-knocks-in-international-cricket-5248224.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In MS Dhoni's illustrious international career spanning over 15 years, he tormented bowlers with his marauding bat and piled on runs for fun.

Virender Sehwag Reveals MSD’s Special Diet During India’s 2011 World Cup Winning Campaign In his illustrious international career spanning over 15 years, Dhoni tormented bowlers with his marauding bat and piled on runs for fun. Also, he was an inspirational leader and piloted India to many epic triumphs. Moreover, Dhoni was a force to be reckoned with behind the stumps. As we celebrate the 42nd birthday of the Indian legend on July 7, 2023, let us revisit some of his top batting displays in international cricket.

Sri Lanka batted first and posted a formidable total of 274 runs on the board. India, in reply, were 114 for 3 in the 22nd over. The game was on a knife’s edge and entered Dhoni. He played according to the situation and stitched a 109-run stand with Gautam Gambhir. Though Gambhir was dismissed, the then-India skipper carried on milking runs and shepherded the Men in Blue to a historic triumph. The wicket-keeper-batter scored 91* runs off 79 balls. 183* runs off 145 balls vs Sri Lanka, 3rd ODI, Sri Lanka Tour of India, 2005 India crossed swords against Sri Lanka in the third game of the seven-match ODI series in Jaipur.

Dhoni was in his elements and knocked the wind out of the opposition's attack. He smashed 148 runs off 123 deliveries to help India post a mammoth score of 356 runs on the board. It was the legendary cricketer’s first international century.

Bairstow finished on one not out at stumps in the third Ashes Test after facing 19 deliveries. The 33-year-old also ensured he wasn't stumped, seemingly having learnt his lesson from his dismissal at Lord's which has been one of the most controversial Ashes moments in recent memory. Promoted to bat at five, Bairstow set the tone by dramatically placing his bat inside his crease - while at the same time staring down the Aussies in the field. It was a cheeky piece of theatre that went over a treat at Headingley, which is the Yorkshireman's home ground. Jonny Bairstow knew all eyes would be on him at Headingley - and he didn't miss the opportunity to fire up the home crowd and also send a message to the Aussies (pictured) following his infamous Lord's dismissal But as has been the case across the Ashes series, Bairstow was poor behind the stumps, dropping a number of catches (pictured, he reacts after spilling a catch from Travis Head) Another catch left by Jhonny bairstow #Bairstow pic.twitter.com/3gkbCjeLk9 — Hammad Nasrullah (@HammadNasrulla2) July 6, 2023 But as has been the case across the entire series, Bairstow was again poor behind the stumps after Australia were sent in to bat first, with the wicketkeeper dropping a number of chances. After a pulsating day one, England are 3/68 in reply to Australia's 263, with Mitch Marsh's century saving the tourists , who at times had no answer to Mark Wood's pace, who finished with impressive figures of 5/34. Marsh, who replaced the rested Cameron Green, blasted 118 from as many balls in an innings to savour following his recall. His swashbuckling innings featured 17 boundaries and four sixes, and the much maligned all-rounder - who also claimed the key wicket of Zak Crawley with the ball - was elated after day one.

In isolation, the incident would spark little debate. However, it comes on the heels of the English skipper accusing Australia of breaching the 'spirit of cricket' in the second Test at Lord's. Bairstow was stumped by Australian wicketkeeper Alex Carey on a crucial final day of play, which proved costly as the Aussies won to lead the series 2-0. While the dismissal was completely fair under the laws of the game, Stokes was left fuming after the match. 'If I was fielding captain I would have had a real think about the spirit of the game. For Australia it was the match-winning moment. Would I want to win a game in that manner? The answer for me is no,' he said. Stokes didn't live up to those words on Thursday, however. Stokes has been very vocal about how important it is to uphold the spirit of cricket following the Bairstow dismissal at Lord's The English skipper's values took a remarkable U-turn at Headingley, though, when he claimed to save this boundary even though he clearly touched the rope Cricket fans were quick to mock Stokes and his opinions on the spirit of the game after the controversial call on day one of the third Test On the first day of play in the third Test at Headingley, Australia was on the ropes as the English pace attack had the tourists reeling at 4-85. However, Ben Stokes seemed to defy the principles of fair play in pursuit of gaining an advantage during the subsequent session. A powerful shot from Travis Head, aimed towards the boundary rope, seemed unstoppable, but Stokes gave a great chase. With astonishing agility, the English captain managed to flick the ball back into play with a swift movement of his right hand. It appeared that he had successfully saved his team from conceding four runs. However, footage revealed that Stokes left arm had made contact with the boundary rope while the ball was in his right hand. Aussie skipper Pat Cummins celebrates Bairstow's stumping by Alex Carey after the English batsman strolled out of his crease while the ball was still live Stokes believes he would have rescinded an English appeal if they had done the same thing to an Australian batter Even English commentators could see that it was a boundary. 'That looks like four, four to me,' Former England captain Nasser Hussain said as the replays rolled. Third umpire Joel Wilson looked over the replays and ultimately decided Stokes had saved the boundary and only two runs were awarded. 'Wow, how's that not a four? No idea how that's not a four.' Hussain said in disbelief. Comedian Peter Helliar was incensed, writing on Twitter: 'How wasn't that a 4?? And why didn't Stokes call it in the 'spirit of cricket'??!!!' Former Australian cricketer Darren Berry couldn't believe it either. 'OMG THIS IS WHY WE GET UPSET. Stokes clearly touching the rope for the world to see but the 3rd umpire gets it wrong. HOW️? human error even with the technology that is just not good enough,' he posted. Aussie cricket fans were also quick to seize upon the apparent hypocrisy. 'I'm surprised one of the elder statesmen of the team didn't have a chat to stokes about upholding the spirit of the game.. I'm sure he doesn't want to win a game like that,' one fan posted. 'Stokes could have put his hand up and over-ruled the third umpire. #spiritofcricket and all,' tweeted another. 'I'll take Stokes' word that he saved it, you know, in the Spirit of Cricket and all,' added another.

England bowled Australia out for 263 before falling to 68-3 at Headingley Mark Wood picked up a five-wicket haul thanks to his lethal pace with the ball Follow Mail Sport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport By David Lloyd for the Daily Mail Published: 22:57 BST, 6 July 2023 | Updated: 00:30 BST, 7 July 2023 e-mail 4 View comments England and Australia played out an enthralling opening day of the third Ashes Test at Headingley on Thursday, as Ben Stokes ' side bowled the tourists out for 263 before slumping to 68-3 at the close of play. Mail Sport's DAVID LLOYD watched on as momentum shifted in and out of England's favour on day one, with Mark Wood picking up a five-wicket haul while Aussie all-rounder Mitchell Marsh smashed an impressive century. From the Ugly Mugs café to Gareth Southgate on the radio, Bumble shares his thoughts after a 'rock 'n' roll' day of Test cricket. Why I love Ugly Mugs They don’t miss a trick in looking after the public here in Leeds, with the pubs around Headingley opening at eight o’clock in the morning. For a hearty full English breakfast though, it’s Ugly Mugs for me. A proper caff that’s just outside the ground. You’ll see me there on a morning! Australia were bowled out for 263 on a 'rock 'n' roll' day of Test cricket in Yorkshire on Thursday Jonny Bairstow (left) and Joe Root (right) will get England's innings back underway on 68-3 Winning the toss pays off You know what they say at Headingley for the toss. Look up — don’t look down. And with plenty of cloud cover and the help of some proper pace in the excellent Mark Wood, it was brilliant to see England make the most out of winning the toss. As my mate Michael Holding would say: ‘Pace makes you do funny things!’ It's far from grim up north Players will get full value for their shots here — the outfield has been properly cropped, it’s rock-hard and the ball will run away on it. That’s all because of the weather up north — it’s very hot in the Rhubarb Triangle. If you’re ever short of a vacation, try Scarbados (Scarborough), Ponte Carlo (Pontefract), Cas Vegas (Castleford) or Barnselona (Barnsley). And if you really fancy it, go and spend a fortnight in Hull! Superb Southgate makes waves on radio What a wonderful interview with Gareth Southgate on Test Match Special. What struck me was the closeness of the dressing room and the responsibility of him and his coaches to keep the players calm, knowing how responsible they are for the emotional levels of the spectators. Gareth Southgate made an appearance on Test Match Special during his visit to Headingley Mark Wood took a five-wicket haul at Headingley after stunning Australia with his express pace It was a fabulous interview about coaching young people at elite level and getting them working together, knowing what it means to represent their country. And Southgate even revealed that he has had meetings with Rob Key! Follow Mail Sport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Don't forget Fred Well, Wood’s first over was recorded on Sky as the fastest ever here at Headingley. That’s absolute nonsense. They’ve obviously never seen Fred Trueman here. He would say he could bowl faster than Wood in a pair of wellingtons. He were like lightning! I can hear Fred now: ‘If that Wood’s 95mph, I must have been 150mph!’ Ex-England fast bowler Fred Trueman was also known for his express pace (pictured in 1968) What a rock 'n' roll day's play This is what a Test match pitch should be like. It’s absolutely fantastic with something in it for both bowler and batsman. What a counterpunch by Mitchell Marsh and ‘exhilarating’ is how I would describe Wood. The bouncer in the morning that went over the batter, the keeper and bounced once before it hit the sightscreen was seriously Jeff Thomson-esque. It was a day of real rock ‘n’ roll cricket.

Centurion Mitchell Marsh was the only batter in Australia's order who looked comfortable against England's ferocious bowling attack, spearheaded by paceman Mark Wood, as he knocked an impressive 118 on his return to the side. After picking up the crucial wicket of Usman Khawaja, Wood skittled Australia's tail to record his first ever five-wicket haul on home soil, rescuing the hosts after a series of poor dropped catches in the slip cordon. Although England felt they had the upper hand, Australia bounced back with a vengeance in the field, dismissing Ben Duckett, Harry Brook and Zak Crawley in the evening to leave Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow at the crease ahead of Friday. But which side won the first day's cricket? Mail Sport's LAWRENCE BOOTH gives his verdict. Mark Wood's five-wicket haul helped England bowl the Australians out for 263 on Thursday The tourists responded well and knocked England back in the evening session, forcing them to 68-3 at stumps with Yorkshire pair Jonny Bairstow (left) and Joe Root (right) at the crease Morning session: England (1 point) Stuart Broad began the session by removing David Warner for the 16th time in Tests, and ended it by having Steve Smith caught behind for 22, as Australia reached lunch on 91 for four. In between, Mark Wood bowled the most thrilling spell of the series so far, bowling Usman Khawaja with a delivery measuring 94.6mph, and at one point touching 96.5mph, the fastest ball recorded at Headingley. Follow Mail Sport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Afternoon session: Australia (1 point) Yet another dropped catch by England, this time by Joe Root at slip off Chris Woakes, changed the complexion of the day. Mitchell Marsh exploded at the crease with a century of 118 from as many balls at Headingley Mitchell Marsh, who had 12 at the time, went on to belt a magnificent run-a-ball 118 — including 113 in the session — before finally falling to Woakes in the last over before tea. By then, Marsh and second fiddle Travis Head had added 155. Evening session: Shared (½ point each) Wood terrorised Australia’s lower order — extending their collapse to six for 23 — as he recorded his first five-wicket haul in this country. But Pat Cummins, dismissed by Wood for a duck, then knocked over Ben Duckett and Harry Brook for two and three, respectively. Marsh then capped a superb day by having Zak Crawley caught in the slips for 33, before England closed on 68 for three. Verdict after day one: HONOURS EVEN (England: 1½ pts, Australia: 1½ pts) Root's drop of Marsh on 12 proved a costly one for England, as the visitors would've been 98-5 Play of the day: Root's reprieve of Marsh If Joe Root had held on to a regulation slip catch when Mitchell Marsh edged Chris Woakes on 12, Australia would have been 98 for five. Instead, Marsh belted his first Test century in this country, helping the tourists reach 240 for four before a late collapse brought England back into the game.

England skittled the Aussies for 263 , despite Mitchell Marsh's impressive knock of 118, before falling to 68-3 at stumps with Yorkshire pair Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root at the crease. Mail Sport's LAWRENCE BOOTH takes a look at the big stats from the first day at Headingley. Mark Wood took five wickets in a home Test for the first time, at the 14th attempt. His previous five-wicket hauls had come in St Lucia (five for 41 v West Indies in 2018-19), Johannesburg (five for 46 v South Africa in 2019-20) and Hobart (six for 37 v Australia in 2021-22). Wood’s figures of five for 34 meant he finished an innings with a Test bowling average below 30 for the first time in his career. Mark Wood's express pace helped bowl Australia out for 263 on day one of the third Ashes Test England rued dropping Mitchell Marsh after the Australian went on to score a stunning century England ended the day on 68-3 with Jonny Bairstow (left) and Joe Root (right) at the crease Mitchell Marsh has now made three Test hundreds — all against England, following 181 at Perth and 101 at Sydney, both in 2017-18. Against England, he has made 527 runs at 52; against everyone else 851 at 20. Steve Smith made only 22, but it was enough to take him into third place in the all-time Ashes run-making list, ahead of former Australia captain Allan Border’s total of 3,222. Ahead of Smith are Don Bradman (5,028) and Jack Hobbs (3,636). Border also made 326 runs against England in non-Ashes matches. England’s donations to Australian totals carried on, as they conceded another 23 extras, to go with the 44 at Edgbaston and the 74 at Lord’s — a total of 141. Australia have given up 68 extras all told.

When no one gave them a chance, the Dutch stood up and were equal to the challenge at hand.

After winning the toss and electing to field first, Netherlands restricted Scotland to 277/9 in 50 overs, they went on to finish on 278/6 in 42,5 overs. The win was extra special for Netherlands who came into the tournament without some of their seasoned players who had opted for county cricket in England. For Netherlands, however, it is not the end as they are set to go on and play against Sri Lanka in the final at Harare Sports Club on Sunday. The two teams will proceed to the 2023 Men’s Cricket World Cup finals.

The Chevrons are set to compete in the Africa Regional Final qualification tournament which is set for Namibia in November. Zimbabwe will have a chance of booking their place in the biggest T20 World Cup which will feature 20 teams. A total of seven African teams will compete for the two available slots to the global showpiece. The Chevrons and the tournament hosts, Namibia did not participate in the Sub-Regional Qualifiers which five of their opponents played in. Only two teams from the African Qualification tournament will proceed to the global showpiece which will be co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States of America (USA) in June next year. Besides Zimbabwe and the hosts, Namibia, the other teams that will take part in the qualification tournament are Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The tournament will run from November 20 to 1 December. Zimbabwe missed out on direct qualification to the World Cup after failing to make the top eight in the previous edition of the tournament which was held in Australia last year. A total of 12 teams have already secured their spots and they are the hosts, West Indies and USA, England, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Netherlands, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Bangladesh and Netherlands qualified automatically as the best-ranked teams in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Men’s T20I Team Rankings, as of 14 November 2022. The 20 teams in the World Cup will be divided into four groups of five, from which the top two teams in each group advance to the Super Eight round. The upcoming qualification tournament will be the perfect opportunity for the Chevrons to put past them the failure to qualify for the One Day International (ODI) World Cup which they will be missing for the second time in a row. Last year, Zimbabwe ended a six-year wait to take part in a major international event after qualifying for the T20 World Cup and going on to reach the Super 12 stage for the first time ever. Playing and winning the upcoming qualifiers will be a big confidence booster to the Chevrons camp. – @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-07-06 22:02:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"THE NOTEBOOK: Aussie brewers plan to send 'England bitter' to hosts and Carey still owes the barber!","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12272641/THE-NOTEBOOK-Aussie-brewers-plan-send-England-bitter-hosts-Carey-owes-barber.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"RICHARD GIBSON: Oh, how we laughed.

The hosts' top order continued to struggle however, as Ben Duckett, Harry Brook and Zak Crawley were dismissed cheaply by the Australians to leave England 68-3 at stumps on day one , with Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow at the crease. Ben Stokes' side came into the third Ashes Test having lost a contentious match at Lord's last week, which saw England question the tourists' sportsmanship after they stumped Bairstow controversially on the final day. England came into the clash at Headingley 2-0 down in the series and contributed to another entertaining day, with impressive bowling, dropped catches and quickfire wickets. Mail Sport takes a look at the things you might have missed in Yorkshire during the first day. Mark Wood took five wickets as England bowled Australia out for 263 on day one at Headingley Aussies brewers' bitter joke Oh, how we laughed. Australian brewers VB were planning to send Ben Stokes’ team a slab of special edition ‘England Bitter’ following the controversial defeat at Lord’s which featured the home team refusing to have a post-match drink with Australia. A note inviting the England team to drink the beers warm or cold, win, lose or draw following this Test match was due to accompany the delivery, and England Bitter T-shirts are also in production. On the other side of the Ashes divide, famous Headingley haunt Ugly Mugs is selling a Ben Stokes burger — an extra meaty offering in honour of his six-hitting last week. Rainbow Laces promote inclusion England’s players showed their support for Stonewall’s Rainbow Laces campaign — designed to promote LGBTQ+ inclusion in sport — with several wearing them as wrist bands on day one. The stumps were also decorated with the branding. ‘As a group we believe that cricket should be a game that everyone can play, watch and enjoy. We’re really proud to support LGBTQ+ inclusion in cricket,’ said England’s Joe Root. The stumps were decorated with colours in support of Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign Stubbings to join tourists' staff The locals did not hold back in their verbal hostilities on Thursday but one Yorkshireman who will be supporting the Australians in the not too distant future is Steve Stubbings. The Huddersfield-born former Derbyshire player is to join Australia’s backroom staff next winter to allow batting coach Michael Di Venuto time away from international cricket’s relentless schedule.

The Bears, put in, set Essex - who'd beaten them convincingly in the four-day game recently - 168 and, although they managed to drag them game into the 40th over of the match, it was more knock-out disappointment after a stunning group campaign. Dan Lawrence, released by England after his Ashes call-up, scored 62 for the visitors and earned the player of the match award in the process as the Eagles claimed a two-wicket victory which, earlier in the chase, looked a formality. Sam Hain, with his fifth half century of the campaign, was once again the pick of the Bears' batting. We've been used to quite fast paced starts from this Bears unit in the group stage - bar that freak encounter with Nottinghamshire last week - and so this, by comparison, was quite lethargic. By the 16th ball, they were 5/1 having lost the in-form Rob Yates in the first over. Partner and captain Alex Davies swiftly - and controversially - followed, when he was adjudged to have gloved a delivery through to the keeper. UltraEdge didn't pick anything up, although it was suggested later on by Sky Sports that there was a fault with the system. Bears fans, come and join our Facebook group by clicking here! Glenn Maxwell (32) threatened to make a hefty contribution as he finally lit the blue touchpaper in the second half of the powerplay; he crashed an almighty blow, off the bowling of Daniel Sams, into the Hollies. With the Bears 54/2 and rebuilding, though, Maxwell - like Yates - sent one skyward and Sams took the catch off the bowling of Paul Walter. While exciting young talents Dan Mousley (16) and Jacob Bethell (4), despite enjoying excellent and progressive campaigns of their own, stuttered in the middle order, the ever reliable Sam Hain (52) stood tall. His straight six was a commanding stroke indeed, while a number of his five fours were particularly inventive. He put on 44 with Chris Benjamin (24), who was bumped down the order to bat with the tail, while Dominic Drakes (23) also produced a very useful late knock to help lift the Bears up to 167. Competitive if nothing else, but you'd have hoped for more - a bigger total was on the cards had the Bears begun their innings quicker. That certainly appeared to be the case almost from the off in the chase. Adam Rossington and Lawrence immediately launched an assault on the Bears' bowling attack, although there were some infuriating strokes of luck along the way as Essex enjoyed great value for their shots. At 69/1 after the powerplay, which included 12 boundaries and a maximum, the Bears' only shout was the removal of Rossington, short of his ground when Davies brilliantly threw down three stumps. The Eagles, though, were well on their way. Even after the double blow in the space of three balls - Mousley removed Michael Pepper and then Jake Lintott dismissed Feroze Khushi for a golden duck - Paul Walter joined Lawrence at the crease and inflicted a couple of meaty blows to drag Essex's required run rate to near enough a run a ball. The Bears just couldn't get Lawrence (62), whose half century arrived off 34 deliveries, even though they frequently struck at the other end - Walter, Matt Critchley and Daniel Sams all departed swiftly, one after the other. The effervescent Simon Harmer arrived at the crease to help ease Essex towards their target and restored temporary control of the innings, but the Bears to their credit took the game as deep as possible and, having finally removed Lawrence, quickly followed by Harmer, Essex's tail got them over the line in the final over to ensure that the 2019 champions would be returning to Edgbaston next Saturday. It's another year of waiting for the Bears.","pubDate":"2023-07-06 20:54:50","image_url":"https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article27273241.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Birmingham-Bears-v-Essex-Eagles-Vitality-Blast-T20-Edgbaston.jpg","source_id":"birminghammail","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"MS Dhoni Birthday Special: Revisiting the Legendary Ex-India Captain's Top Five Knocks in International Cricket","link":"https://www.latestly.com/sports/cricket/ms-dhoni-birthday-special-revisiting-the-legendary-ex-india-captains-top-five-knocks-in-international-cricket-5248224.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In MS Dhoni's illustrious international career spanning over 15 years, he tormented bowlers with his marauding bat and piled on runs for fun.

But the wicketkeeper-batter showed immense grit and determination and made world cricket his happy hunting ground. 'MS Dhoni Ate Only Khichdi.......' Virender Sehwag Reveals MSD’s Special Diet During India’s 2011 World Cup Winning Campaign In his illustrious international career spanning over 15 years, Dhoni tormented bowlers with his marauding bat and piled on runs for fun. Also, he was an inspirational leader and piloted India to many epic triumphs. Moreover, Dhoni was a force to be reckoned with behind the stumps. As we celebrate the 42nd birthday of the Indian legend on July 7, 2023, let us revisit some of his top batting displays in international cricket. Photo of MS Dhoni’s Giant 52 Feet Cut Out in Hyderabad Ahead of His 42nd Birthday Goes Viral 91* runs off 79 balls vs Sri Lanka, World Cup 2011 India and Sri Lanka took centre stage in the final showdown of the 2011 World Cup in Mumbai. Sri Lanka batted first and posted a formidable total of 274 runs on the board. India, in reply, were 114 for 3 in the 22nd over. The game was on a knife’s edge and entered Dhoni. He played according to the situation and stitched a 109-run stand with Gautam Gambhir. Though Gambhir was dismissed, the then-India skipper carried on milking runs and shepherded the Men in Blue to a historic triumph. The wicket-keeper-batter scored 91* runs off 79 balls. 183* runs off 145 balls vs Sri Lanka, 3rd ODI, Sri Lanka Tour of India, 2005 India crossed swords against Sri Lanka in the third game of the seven-match ODI series in Jaipur. Chasing the daunting target of 299, Dhoni put up a dominant show with the bat and hammered Sri Lankan bowlers all across the park. He blasted 183* runs off 145 balls to take his team across the line in the 47th over itself. 148 runs off 123 balls vs Pakistan, 2nd ODI, Pakistan Tour of India, 2005 India clashed with Pakistan in the second game of the six-match ODI series on April 2005 in Visakhapatnam. Dhoni was in his elements and knocked the wind out of the opposition's attack. He smashed 148 runs off 123 deliveries to help India post a mammoth score of 356 runs on the board. It was the legendary cricketer’s first international century. India ended up winning the game by 58 runs. 224 runs off 265 balls vs Australia, 1st Test, Australia Tour of India, 2013 India squared off against Australia in the first Test of the four-match Test series in Chennai in 2013. MS Dhoni put up an exhibition of his swashbuckling strokeplay and notched up a magnificent double century. He piled on 224 runs off 265 balls to help India post a gigantic total of 572 in their first innings. Moreover, Dhoni’s dazzling knock was a history-making one as he became the first Indian wicketkeeper-batter to breach the 200-mark in Test cricket. 45 runs off 33 balls vs South Africa, T20 World Cup 2007 India took the stage alongside South Africa in a crunch group stage in the inaugural edition of the T20 World Cup in Durban.

The wicketkeeper-batter played a brisk knock of 45 runs off 33 balls. The Men in Blue went on to post 153 runs in 20 overs and, eventually, won the game by 37 runs.

Bairstow finished on one not out at stumps in the third Ashes Test after facing 19 deliveries. The 33-year-old also ensured he wasn't stumped, seemingly having learnt his lesson from his dismissal at Lord's which has been one of the most controversial Ashes moments in recent memory. Promoted to bat at five, Bairstow set the tone by dramatically placing his bat inside his crease - while at the same time staring down the Aussies in the field. It was a cheeky piece of theatre that went over a treat at Headingley, which is the Yorkshireman's home ground. Jonny Bairstow knew all eyes would be on him at Headingley - and he didn't miss the opportunity to fire up the home crowd and also send a message to the Aussies (pictured) following his infamous Lord's dismissal But as has been the case across the Ashes series, Bairstow was poor behind the stumps, dropping a number of catches (pictured, he reacts after spilling a catch from Travis Head) Another catch left by Jhonny bairstow #Bairstow pic.twitter.com/3gkbCjeLk9 — Hammad Nasrullah (@HammadNasrulla2) July 6, 2023 But as has been the case across the entire series, Bairstow was again poor behind the stumps after Australia were sent in to bat first, with the wicketkeeper dropping a number of chances. After a pulsating day one, England are 3/68 in reply to Australia's 263, with Mitch Marsh's century saving the tourists , who at times had no answer to Mark Wood's pace, who finished with impressive figures of 5/34. Marsh, who replaced the rested Cameron Green, blasted 118 from as many balls in an innings to savour following his recall. His swashbuckling innings featured 17 boundaries and four sixes, and the much maligned all-rounder - who also claimed the key wicket of Zak Crawley with the ball - was elated after day one. 'It was pretty amazing. I'm a little lost for words,' Marsh said.

In isolation, the incident would spark little debate. However, it comes on the heels of the English skipper accusing Australia of breaching the 'spirit of cricket' in the second Test at Lord's. Bairstow was stumped by Australian wicketkeeper Alex Carey on a crucial final day of play, which proved costly as the Aussies won to lead the series 2-0. While the dismissal was completely fair under the laws of the game, Stokes was left fuming after the match. 'If I was fielding captain I would have had a real think about the spirit of the game. For Australia it was the match-winning moment. Would I want to win a game in that manner? The answer for me is no,' he said. Stokes didn't live up to those words on Thursday, however. Stokes has been very vocal about how important it is to uphold the spirit of cricket following the Bairstow dismissal at Lord's The English skipper's values took a remarkable U-turn at Headingley, though, when he claimed to save this boundary even though he clearly touched the rope Cricket fans were quick to mock Stokes and his opinions on the spirit of the game after the controversial call on day one of the third Test On the first day of play in the third Test at Headingley, Australia was on the ropes as the English pace attack had the tourists reeling at 4-85. However, Ben Stokes seemed to defy the principles of fair play in pursuit of gaining an advantage during the subsequent session. A powerful shot from Travis Head, aimed towards the boundary rope, seemed unstoppable, but Stokes gave a great chase. With astonishing agility, the English captain managed to flick the ball back into play with a swift movement of his right hand. It appeared that he had successfully saved his team from conceding four runs. However, footage revealed that Stokes left arm had made contact with the boundary rope while the ball was in his right hand. Aussie skipper Pat Cummins celebrates Bairstow's stumping by Alex Carey after the English batsman strolled out of his crease while the ball was still live Stokes believes he would have rescinded an English appeal if they had done the same thing to an Australian batter Even English commentators could see that it was a boundary. 'That looks like four, four to me,' Former England captain Nasser Hussain said as the replays rolled. Third umpire Joel Wilson looked over the replays and ultimately decided Stokes had saved the boundary and only two runs were awarded. 'Wow, how's that not a four? No idea how that's not a four.' Hussain said in disbelief. Comedian Peter Helliar was incensed, writing on Twitter: 'How wasn't that a 4?? And why didn't Stokes call it in the 'spirit of cricket'??!!!' Former Australian cricketer Darren Berry couldn't believe it either. 'OMG THIS IS WHY WE GET UPSET. Stokes clearly touching the rope for the world to see but the 3rd umpire gets it wrong. HOW️? human error even with the technology that is just not good enough,' he posted. Aussie cricket fans were also quick to seize upon the apparent hypocrisy. 'I'm surprised one of the elder statesmen of the team didn't have a chat to stokes about upholding the spirit of the game.. I'm sure he doesn't want to win a game like that,' one fan posted. 'Stokes could have put his hand up and over-ruled the third umpire. #spiritofcricket and all,' tweeted another. 'I'll take Stokes' word that he saved it, you know, in the Spirit of Cricket and all,' added another.

Mail Sport's DAVID LLOYD watched on as momentum shifted in and out of England's favour on day one, with Mark Wood picking up a five-wicket haul while Aussie all-rounder Mitchell Marsh smashed an impressive century. From the Ugly Mugs café to Gareth Southgate on the radio, Bumble shares his thoughts after a 'rock 'n' roll' day of Test cricket. Why I love Ugly Mugs They don’t miss a trick in looking after the public here in Leeds, with the pubs around Headingley opening at eight o’clock in the morning. For a hearty full English breakfast though, it’s Ugly Mugs for me. A proper caff that’s just outside the ground. You’ll see me there on a morning! Australia were bowled out for 263 on a 'rock 'n' roll' day of Test cricket in Yorkshire on Thursday Jonny Bairstow (left) and Joe Root (right) will get England's innings back underway on 68-3 Winning the toss pays off You know what they say at Headingley for the toss. Look up — don’t look down. And with plenty of cloud cover and the help of some proper pace in the excellent Mark Wood, it was brilliant to see England make the most out of winning the toss. As my mate Michael Holding would say: ‘Pace makes you do funny things!’ It's far from grim up north Players will get full value for their shots here — the outfield has been properly cropped, it’s rock-hard and the ball will run away on it. That’s all because of the weather up north — it’s very hot in the Rhubarb Triangle. If you’re ever short of a vacation, try Scarbados (Scarborough), Ponte Carlo (Pontefract), Cas Vegas (Castleford) or Barnselona (Barnsley). And if you really fancy it, go and spend a fortnight in Hull! Superb Southgate makes waves on radio What a wonderful interview with Gareth Southgate on Test Match Special. What struck me was the closeness of the dressing room and the responsibility of him and his coaches to keep the players calm, knowing how responsible they are for the emotional levels of the spectators. Gareth Southgate made an appearance on Test Match Special during his visit to Headingley Mark Wood took a five-wicket haul at Headingley after stunning Australia with his express pace It was a fabulous interview about coaching young people at elite level and getting them working together, knowing what it means to represent their country. And Southgate even revealed that he has had meetings with Rob Key! Follow Mail Sport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Don't forget Fred Well, Wood’s first over was recorded on Sky as the fastest ever here at Headingley. That’s absolute nonsense. They’ve obviously never seen Fred Trueman here. He would say he could bowl faster than Wood in a pair of wellingtons. He were like lightning! I can hear Fred now: ‘If that Wood’s 95mph, I must have been 150mph!’ Ex-England fast bowler Fred Trueman was also known for his express pace (pictured in 1968) What a rock 'n' roll day's play This is what a Test match pitch should be like. It’s absolutely fantastic with something in it for both bowler and batsman. What a counterpunch by Mitchell Marsh and ‘exhilarating’ is how I would describe Wood. The bouncer in the morning that went over the batter, the keeper and bounced once before it hit the sightscreen was seriously Jeff Thomson-esque. It was a day of real rock ‘n’ roll cricket.

Centurion Mitchell Marsh was the only batter in Australia's order who looked comfortable against England's ferocious bowling attack, spearheaded by paceman Mark Wood, as he knocked an impressive 118 on his return to the side. After picking up the crucial wicket of Usman Khawaja, Wood skittled Australia's tail to record his first ever five-wicket haul on home soil, rescuing the hosts after a series of poor dropped catches in the slip cordon. Although England felt they had the upper hand, Australia bounced back with a vengeance in the field, dismissing Ben Duckett, Harry Brook and Zak Crawley in the evening to leave Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow at the crease ahead of Friday. But which side won the first day's cricket? Mail Sport's LAWRENCE BOOTH gives his verdict. Mark Wood's five-wicket haul helped England bowl the Australians out for 263 on Thursday The tourists responded well and knocked England back in the evening session, forcing them to 68-3 at stumps with Yorkshire pair Jonny Bairstow (left) and Joe Root (right) at the crease Morning session: England (1 point) Stuart Broad began the session by removing David Warner for the 16th time in Tests, and ended it by having Steve Smith caught behind for 22, as Australia reached lunch on 91 for four. In between, Mark Wood bowled the most thrilling spell of the series so far, bowling Usman Khawaja with a delivery measuring 94.6mph, and at one point touching 96.5mph, the fastest ball recorded at Headingley. Follow Mail Sport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport Afternoon session: Australia (1 point) Yet another dropped catch by England, this time by Joe Root at slip off Chris Woakes, changed the complexion of the day. Mitchell Marsh exploded at the crease with a century of 118 from as many balls at Headingley Mitchell Marsh, who had 12 at the time, went on to belt a magnificent run-a-ball 118 — including 113 in the session — before finally falling to Woakes in the last over before tea. By then, Marsh and second fiddle Travis Head had added 155. Evening session: Shared (½ point each) Wood terrorised Australia’s lower order — extending their collapse to six for 23 — as he recorded his first five-wicket haul in this country. But Pat Cummins, dismissed by Wood for a duck, then knocked over Ben Duckett and Harry Brook for two and three, respectively. Marsh then capped a superb day by having Zak Crawley caught in the slips for 33, before England closed on 68 for three. Verdict after day one: HONOURS EVEN (England: 1½ pts, Australia: 1½ pts) Root's drop of Marsh on 12 proved a costly one for England, as the visitors would've been 98-5 Play of the day: Root's reprieve of Marsh If Joe Root had held on to a regulation slip catch when Mitchell Marsh edged Chris Woakes on 12, Australia would have been 98 for five. Instead, Marsh belted his first Test century in this country, helping the tourists reach 240 for four before a late collapse brought England back into the game.

England skittled the Aussies for 263 , despite Mitchell Marsh's impressive knock of 118, before falling to 68-3 at stumps with Yorkshire pair Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root at the crease. Mail Sport's LAWRENCE BOOTH takes a look at the big stats from the first day at Headingley. Mark Wood took five wickets in a home Test for the first time, at the 14th attempt. His previous five-wicket hauls had come in St Lucia (five for 41 v West Indies in 2018-19), Johannesburg (five for 46 v South Africa in 2019-20) and Hobart (six for 37 v Australia in 2021-22). Wood’s figures of five for 34 meant he finished an innings with a Test bowling average below 30 for the first time in his career. Mark Wood's express pace helped bowl Australia out for 263 on day one of the third Ashes Test England rued dropping Mitchell Marsh after the Australian went on to score a stunning century England ended the day on 68-3 with Jonny Bairstow (left) and Joe Root (right) at the crease Mitchell Marsh has now made three Test hundreds — all against England, following 181 at Perth and 101 at Sydney, both in 2017-18. Against England, he has made 527 runs at 52; against everyone else 851 at 20. Steve Smith made only 22, but it was enough to take him into third place in the all-time Ashes run-making list, ahead of former Australia captain Allan Border’s total of 3,222. Ahead of Smith are Don Bradman (5,028) and Jack Hobbs (3,636). Border also made 326 runs against England in non-Ashes matches. England’s donations to Australian totals carried on, as they conceded another 23 extras, to go with the 44 at Edgbaston and the 74 at Lord’s — a total of 141. Australia have given up 68 extras all told.

When no one gave them a chance, the Dutch stood up and were equal to the challenge at hand. They needed to chase down the set target of 248 runs in 44 overs to book their ticket to India and they managed to sail through in the 43rd over. After winning the toss and electing to field first, Netherlands restricted Scotland to 277/9 in 50 overs, they went on to finish on 278/6 in 42,5 overs. The win was extra special for Netherlands who came into the tournament without some of their seasoned players who had opted for county cricket in England. For Netherlands, however, it is not the end as they are set to go on and play against Sri Lanka in the final at Harare Sports Club on Sunday. The two teams will proceed to the 2023 Men’s Cricket World Cup finals. Sri Lanka qualified with eight points while Netherlands had six and qualified through net run rate as they had a better one compared to Scotland. – @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-07-06 22:02:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chevrons eye T20 qualifiers","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/chevrons-eye-t20-qualifiers/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Chronicle Editor"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brandon Moyo, Brandonmalvin9@gmail.com AFTER a disappointing end to their 2023 Men’s World Cup Qualifiers, it was not the end of the road for Zimbabwe as they will take part in another qualification tournament before the end of the year.

The Chevrons are set to compete in the Africa Regional Final qualification tournament which is set for Namibia in November. Zimbabwe will have a chance of booking their place in the biggest T20 World Cup which will feature 20 teams. A total of seven African teams will compete for the two available slots to the global showpiece. The Chevrons and the tournament hosts, Namibia did not participate in the Sub-Regional Qualifiers which five of their opponents played in. Only two teams from the African Qualification tournament will proceed to the global showpiece which will be co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States of America (USA) in June next year. Besides Zimbabwe and the hosts, Namibia, the other teams that will take part in the qualification tournament are Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The tournament will run from November 20 to 1 December. Zimbabwe missed out on direct qualification to the World Cup after failing to make the top eight in the previous edition of the tournament which was held in Australia last year. A total of 12 teams have already secured their spots and they are the hosts, West Indies and USA, England, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Netherlands, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Bangladesh and Netherlands qualified automatically as the best-ranked teams in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Men’s T20I Team Rankings, as of 14 November 2022. The 20 teams in the World Cup will be divided into four groups of five, from which the top two teams in each group advance to the Super Eight round. The upcoming qualification tournament will be the perfect opportunity for the Chevrons to put past them the failure to qualify for the One Day International (ODI) World Cup which they will be missing for the second time in a row. Last year, Zimbabwe ended a six-year wait to take part in a major international event after qualifying for the T20 World Cup and going on to reach the Super 12 stage for the first time ever. Playing and winning the upcoming qualifiers will be a big confidence booster to the Chevrons camp. – @brandon_malvin","pubDate":"2023-07-06 22:02:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"THE NOTEBOOK: Aussie brewers plan to send 'England bitter' to hosts and Carey still owes the barber!","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12272641/THE-NOTEBOOK-Aussie-brewers-plan-send-England-bitter-hosts-Carey-owes-barber.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"RICHARD GIBSON: Oh, how we laughed.

England bowled Australia out for 263 before finishing the first day on 68-3 There was still plenty of fallout at Headingley after the controversial second Test Follow Mail Sport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport By Richard Gibson for the Daily Mail Published: 21:46 BST, 6 July 2023 | Updated: 22:54 BST, 6 July 2023 e-mail View comments Headingley provided its spectators with another enthralling day of Test cricket on Thursday, as England bowled Australia out for 263 thanks to a five-wicket haul from pace bowler Mark Wood . The hosts' top order continued to struggle however, as Ben Duckett, Harry Brook and Zak Crawley were dismissed cheaply by the Australians to leave England 68-3 at stumps on day one , with Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow at the crease. Ben Stokes' side came into the third Ashes Test having lost a contentious match at Lord's last week, which saw England question the tourists' sportsmanship after they stumped Bairstow controversially on the final day. England came into the clash at Headingley 2-0 down in the series and contributed to another entertaining day, with impressive bowling, dropped catches and quickfire wickets. Mail Sport takes a look at the things you might have missed in Yorkshire during the first day. Mark Wood took five wickets as England bowled Australia out for 263 on day one at Headingley Aussies brewers' bitter joke Oh, how we laughed. Australian brewers VB were planning to send Ben Stokes’ team a slab of special edition ‘England Bitter’ following the controversial defeat at Lord’s which featured the home team refusing to have a post-match drink with Australia. A note inviting the England team to drink the beers warm or cold, win, lose or draw following this Test match was due to accompany the delivery, and England Bitter T-shirts are also in production. On the other side of the Ashes divide, famous Headingley haunt Ugly Mugs is selling a Ben Stokes burger — an extra meaty offering in honour of his six-hitting last week. Rainbow Laces promote inclusion England’s players showed their support for Stonewall’s Rainbow Laces campaign — designed to promote LGBTQ+ inclusion in sport — with several wearing them as wrist bands on day one. The stumps were also decorated with the branding. ‘As a group we believe that cricket should be a game that everyone can play, watch and enjoy. We’re really proud to support LGBTQ+ inclusion in cricket,’ said England’s Joe Root. The stumps were decorated with colours in support of Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign Stubbings to join tourists' staff The locals did not hold back in their verbal hostilities on Thursday but one Yorkshireman who will be supporting the Australians in the not too distant future is Steve Stubbings. The Huddersfield-born former Derbyshire player is to join Australia’s backroom staff next winter to allow batting coach Michael Di Venuto time away from international cricket’s relentless schedule.

The Bears, put in, set Essex - who'd beaten them convincingly in the four-day game recently - 168 and, although they managed to drag them game into the 40th over of the match, it was more knock-out disappointment after a stunning group campaign. Dan Lawrence, released by England after his Ashes call-up, scored 62 for the visitors and earned the player of the match award in the process as the Eagles claimed a two-wicket victory which, earlier in the chase, looked a formality. Sam Hain, with his fifth half century of the campaign, was once again the pick of the Bears' batting. We've been used to quite fast paced starts from this Bears unit in the group stage - bar that freak encounter with Nottinghamshire last week - and so this, by comparison, was quite lethargic. By the 16th ball, they were 5/1 having lost the in-form Rob Yates in the first over. Partner and captain Alex Davies swiftly - and controversially - followed, when he was adjudged to have gloved a delivery through to the keeper. UltraEdge didn't pick anything up, although it was suggested later on by Sky Sports that there was a fault with the system. Bears fans, come and join our Facebook group by clicking here! Glenn Maxwell (32) threatened to make a hefty contribution as he finally lit the blue touchpaper in the second half of the powerplay; he crashed an almighty blow, off the bowling of Daniel Sams, into the Hollies. With the Bears 54/2 and rebuilding, though, Maxwell - like Yates - sent one skyward and Sams took the catch off the bowling of Paul Walter. While exciting young talents Dan Mousley (16) and Jacob Bethell (4), despite enjoying excellent and progressive campaigns of their own, stuttered in the middle order, the ever reliable Sam Hain (52) stood tall. His straight six was a commanding stroke indeed, while a number of his five fours were particularly inventive. He put on 44 with Chris Benjamin (24), who was bumped down the order to bat with the tail, while Dominic Drakes (23) also produced a very useful late knock to help lift the Bears up to 167. Competitive if nothing else, but you'd have hoped for more - a bigger total was on the cards had the Bears begun their innings quicker. That certainly appeared to be the case almost from the off in the chase. Adam Rossington and Lawrence immediately launched an assault on the Bears' bowling attack, although there were some infuriating strokes of luck along the way as Essex enjoyed great value for their shots. At 69/1 after the powerplay, which included 12 boundaries and a maximum, the Bears' only shout was the removal of Rossington, short of his ground when Davies brilliantly threw down three stumps. The Eagles, though, were well on their way. Even after the double blow in the space of three balls - Mousley removed Michael Pepper and then Jake Lintott dismissed Feroze Khushi for a golden duck - Paul Walter joined Lawrence at the crease and inflicted a couple of meaty blows to drag Essex's required run rate to near enough a run a ball. The Bears just couldn't get Lawrence (62), whose half century arrived off 34 deliveries, even though they frequently struck at the other end - Walter, Matt Critchley and Daniel Sams all departed swiftly, one after the other. The effervescent Simon Harmer arrived at the crease to help ease Essex towards their target and restored temporary control of the innings, but the Bears to their credit took the game as deep as possible and, having finally removed Lawrence, quickly followed by Harmer, Essex's tail got them over the line in the final over to ensure that the 2019 champions would be returning to Edgbaston next Saturday. It's another year of waiting for the Bears.","pubDate":"2023-07-06 20:54:50","image_url":"https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article27273241.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Birmingham-Bears-v-Essex-Eagles-Vitality-Blast-T20-Edgbaston.jpg","source_id":"birminghammail","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"}]}
