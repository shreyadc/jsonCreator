The 36-year-old burst onto the scene with an unforgettable 89 against South Africa in a T20 match back in 2009 but had to bide his time playing for NSW before he made his Test debut three years later. Warner has since played 101 matches in the baggy green and hopes the next generation of stars continue to make Test cricket a priority rather than chasing the big bucks in T20 leagues around the world.

Picture: Jeremy Ng/Getty Images Source: Getty Images “I’ve got this little bit of scaredness (sic) about what’s going to happen in the next 5-10 years with where cricket is actually heading,” Warner said at the Australian Cricket Awards. “I’d love for guys who are coming through to actually play red-ball cricket because that’s the legacy that you should want to leave behind. “Playing in the Test arena is amazing and it’s a true test of cricket and how good you measure up to the greats of the game. “At the end of the day, everything comes with financial rewards. If you aspire to get a central Australian contract, then you’re going to be rewarded. “I think guys see the short term at the moment with all the leagues around, but the best way to get value for your currency is to actually make a name for yourself. “There’s only been a small minority of people who have been able to do that and have a long career. You want to aspire to play cricket for Australia, and you’re only going to get there by putting numbers on the board. “Through Big Bash, if you think that’s going to be your way and you don’t want to play red-ball cricket, then you probably won’t get that value of currency in the other franchise leagues.” Mitchell Starc is still recovering from a finger injury and will miss the first Test in India. Picture: Daniel Pockett/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Warner is preparing to fly out to India for next month’s four-Test tour, but he won’t be joined on the plane by Mitchell Starc for the early portion of the trip. The fast bowler injured the middle finger on his bowling hand during the Boxing Day Test and hasn’t played since, although he remains confident that he’ll return for the second match in India after getting through plenty of work at a training camp in Sydney. “It’s definitely on track. I’ve still got a week-and-a-half in the splint,” he said. “I’ve been able to train and get my workloads and everything up, and I’m probably bowling close to full training intensity as I can with the splint on. I’m on track for the second Test. I’ll get a scan in about a week and then get on the plane over there.”","pubDate":"2023-01-30 23:18:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Is it my turn?’: Aussie skippers’ hilarious Oscars-style live TV gaffe is pure chaos","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/is-it-my-turn-aussie-skippers-hilarious-oscarsstyle-live-tv-gaffe-is-pure-chaos/news-story/8e347e5d60651fb807d6ed9666665256","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"We’ve finally discovered something Pat Cummins can’t do.","content":"We’ve finally discovered something Pat Cummins can’t do. The Australian Test captain and his counterpart Meg Lanning introduced the TV coverage of the Australian Cricket Awards on Monday night, but everything didn’t quite go to plan. Cummins and Lanning were recapping the cricketing year that was and having a light hearted back-and-forth exchange, before handing over hosting duties to Mel McLaughlin and Jason Richardson.

Cummins stumbled over his lines a few times and shamelessly broke the fourth wall, confessing that he and Lanning were reading pre-written prepared scripts. After Lanning complimented him on the men’s team’s successful year, Cummins replied: “And speaking of achievements, you guys won another World Cup and claimed Australia’s first ever gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in cricket.” “We wrote these scripts ourselves,” he joked, breaking into laughter.

I know all the MCG crowd wants to see that. Sorry Uzzie, there is one people’s champ.” But it got even more cringeworthy when Lanning missed her next cue and the pair awkwardly stared into dead silence for 10 seconds, glancing at each other with confused looks while the audience in Sydney burst into laughter. Lanning finally broke the awkward silence: “Is it my turn? It’s actually my turn to speak. “Just really good luck to everyone tonight, hope it’s a great evening and hope you have fun.” Cummins added: “Far too much of us. Let’s get the night started. Thank you.” Viewers joked the agonising moment was proof Cummins is human after all. AAP’s Scott Bailey tweeted: “Is it possible that after 30 years, the world has discovered something Pat Cummins can’t do? “Read off an autocue. (Don’t blame him, it’s bloody hard).” Sports writer and broadcaster Brett McKay joked: “Haha, as MCs they both make bloody good Australian captains...” The recent second season of the ‘The Test’ documentary also revealed Cummins also struggles playing the video game Call of Duty. As for the cricket awards themselves, Steve Smith won a record-equalling fourth Allan Border Medal as Australia’s best player across all formats last year, while Beth Mooney took out the Belinda Clark Medal.

The former Test skipper polled 171 votes, finishing in front of Travis Head (144) and David Warner (141), who both enjoyed terrific years with the bat. It’s the latest in a long line of achievements for Smith, who recently moved past Sir Donald Bradman with his 30th Test century and now only trails Ponting and Steve Waugh in terms of Australian centurions. Smith scored 1547 runs in 32 matches across all three formats, headlined by a stunning 200 not out against the West Indies in the first Test innings of the home summer in Perth. Mooney had an equally stunning season, claiming her second Belinda Clark Medal. It was a bumper year for Mooney and the Australian women’s cricket team as they clinched the Ashes in January, won the 50-over World Cup and claimed the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games. Mooney finished on 129 votes ahead of Meg Lanning (110 votes) and Tahlia McGrath (95) in one of her most dominant years on the field. Usman Khawaja was the other big winner of the night, taking out the Community Champion award and the inaugural Shane Warne Men’s Test Player of the Year gong. — With NCA NewsWire","pubDate":"2023-01-30 22:46:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bavuma and the Proteas keep the feel-good factor going in SA cricket","link":"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2023-01-30-bavuma-and-the-proteas-keep-the-feel-good-factor-going-in-sa-cricket/","keywords":null,"creator":["Craig Ray"],"video_url":null,"description":"After the Proteas’ dismal tour to Australia, the domestic SA20 competition brought the feel-good factor back to local cricket and Temba Bavuma’s white-ball ODI squad have carried that happy momentum forward. The post Bavuma and the Proteas keep the feel-good factor going in SA cricket appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"Cricket is a game of fine margins and usually more disappointment than success. Batters are almost always dismissed. The good ones might score more than 50 about every fourth trip to the crease. It’s a hard job. For Proteas captain Temba Bavuma, it’s been an emotionally draining year or so. Runs have been hard to come by, criticism has been harsh and he endured the most chastening public snub when failing to secure an SA20 contract at the auction. Which is why, when he reached his century against England in Bloemfontein on Sunday, he gestured to his name on his back and the badge on his chest. It was a natural outpouring of relief, anger and joy for the skipper, who happens to be leading at a time when South African cricket’s world-class playing stocks are thin. Still, they are a team of battlers and thanks to Bavuma’s 109 off 102 balls at the Mangaung Oval, chased down 343 in 49.1 overs to seal a 2-0 series victory over the world champions, England. It was a win that took the Proteas a step closer to automatic qualification for the One-Day International (ODI) World Cup later this year, but as importantly, continued to keep cricket in the headlines for the right reasons. After years of boardroom drama and inconsistency on the field at international level, the SA20 has been a revelation in bringing fans back to stadiums in the past three weeks. But due to the late confirmation of the SA20 tournament, the three-match ODI series against England needed to be accommodated simultaneously. The compromise was to pause the SA20 for a week while South Africa and England battle it out. Fortunately, the Proteas continued the feel-good momentum SA20 created with two pulsating wins over England in Bloemfontein, with the third match set for Kimberley on 1 February. Barring Bavuma, the star Proteas performers during the first two ODIs all have SA20 contracts. So, it was a pleasure to see the skipper do the only thing he could do, and score runs to remind people why he is captain in the white-ball format. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations “Emotionally, it [being snubbed and struggling for runs] can be draining and it can be taxing. As much as you try to block it out, it does affect you,” Bavuma said. “The biggest one is when it affects people around you — your family. As a player, I have my ways of dealing with it. It is a part of the journey. “We all go through periods of ups and downs, whether in our careers and family life,” Bavuma said. “The difference is that it’s in the eyes of everyone, and everyone wants to have a piece of you. It’s about trying to not be as emotional as you can and to see things as plainly, as they are. “Blocking out the noise is something you have to do but that is quite impossible, especially me in the situation I find myself in, as the captain.” He took some time out after the recent Test tour to Australia where the Proteas lost 2-0. Bavuma top-scored for the tourists with 185 runs across the three Tests at an average of 37. But when the SA20 party started, he was a spectator watching an entertaining and enthralling competition play out. He will return to that status on Thursday morning, which is an odd situation for the national captain. “Being out of action for two weeks and being at home and away from the game also helped me,” Bavuma said. “Physically, I’m maybe not in the best shape, but mentally I am. I’ve become a bit more open towards the team and how we would like to go about things.” There has been a change in coaching since the Australia tour, with respected coach Shukri Conrad handling the white-ball duties temporarily before Rob Walter takes over. Conrad will then assume full-time Test coaching duties. Conrad, who has been on the domestic cricket scene for more than two decades, has seen it all and understands more than most what makes cricketers, batters and captains tick. Bavuma leaned on Conrad and admitted to taking the risk of being vulnerable with the coach. It’s an approach that appears to be paying off. “The conversation I had with Shukri helped. It was just being vulnerable to the coach about where I see myself and how I feel about everything,” Bavuma revealed after his superb innings in Bloemfontein. “He helped me clear through all the nonsense that was in my head and helped me get ready for the series. “It was just him giving me an ear, hearing me out and validating the feelings that I’ve had. The biggest thing is getting your mind into the right state to play the game. Shuks is not a therapist. What I enjoyed was the honesty and the clarity that he gave in the chat.” Whatever the exact content of their conversation, it clearly helped. And South African cricket is better for it.

England’s Grace Scrivens has been named the captain of the side. The team has three Indians — Shweta Sehrawat, Shafali Verma and Parshavi Chopra — while three players from England have also been named in the lineup. In a lineup with incredible hitters like Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh, it was Shweta Sehrawat who shined the brightest for India in the inaugural U19 Women’s T20 World Cup. With a polished 92* against South Africa to open their U19 Women’s T20 World Cup campaign, the team’s vice-captain set the standard for the rest of the competition. With 297 runs at an average of 99 and a strike rate of 139.43, she eventually finished as the tournament’s leading run-scorer. She added two additional half-centuries (74* vs. UAE and 61* vs. New Zealand). There wasn’t much that England’s Grace Scrivens couldn’t do at the U19 Women’s T20 World Cup, including bat, bowl, and captain. It is understandable why the England captain received the Player of the Tournament award despite playing in the final and losing. Scrivens, who batted first, finished as the second-highest run-scorer with 293 runs, three fifty-plus runs, and an average of 41.85. Her 93 off 56 versus Ireland gave her the highest score of the competition. Throughout the competition, the stylish Shafali Verma demonstrated her offensive prowess with the bat and her leadership prowess as captain. Although Shafali would have preferred to bat more consistently, the pace at which her runs were scored (at 193.25) made up for it. Her 34-ball 78 against the UAE was a power-hitting display as she smacked the bowlers for 12 fours and 4 sixes. With 172 runs, she was the third-highest run scorer in the competition. The captain contributed with useful overs as well, taking four wickets in seven games at a mere 5.04 economy. Only two wickets were taken by Parshavi Chopra in India’s first three games of the tournament. She made up for it, though, by finishing as the second-highest wicket-taker at the T20 World Cup with 11 wickets in six games. The leggie dominated Sri Lanka in the final Super Six game, recording statistics of 4/5. She followed that up with a 3/20 in the crucial semifinal match against New Zealand and a 2/13 in the Final, where she also claimed the wicket of Ryana MacDonald-Gay, England’s top scorer for the day. U19 Women’s T20 World Cup Team of the Tournament: Shweta Sehrawat (India), Grace Scrivens (captain) (England), Shafali Verma (India), Georgia Plimmer (New Zealand), Dewmi Vihanga (Sri Lanka), Shorna Akter (Bangladesh), Karabo Meso (Wicket-keeper) (South Africa), Parshavi Chopra (India), Hannah Baker (England), Ellie Anderson (England), Maggie Clark (Australia) and Anosha Nasir (12th Player) (Pakistan).

Coming to the match, Indian bowlers’ tremendous bowling performance followed by Gongadi Trisha and Soumya Tiwari’s knocks helped India lift the inaugural U19 Women’s T20 World Cup title after defeating England by seven wickets in the summit clash at Senwes Park in Potchefstroom, South Africa on Sunday. The Shafali Verma-Team India defeated England in a one-sided summit clash, first bowling them out for 68 and then chasing down the target in 14 overs. It was another clinical display with the ball that held the key to India’s march to victory, with Titas Sadhu setting the pace, with the spinners delivering another telling performance when it mattered. Supplementing the fine bowling was outstanding fielding. The dismissal of England’s captain, Grace Scrivens, epitomised the sheer determination in the Indian ranks. The left-hander hit Archana towards long-off, where Gongadi Trisha sprinted in, then leapt forward to take an excellent, tumbling catch. It Changes From Black To Translucent Depending On Emotional StateHerbeauty9 Interesting Facts About Indira GandhiHerbeautyIt was the key wicket, in many ways, and the celebrations from India confirmed as much. Scrivens would go on to scoop the Player of the Tournament award, but she would have given all of that up for a better English display with the bat. Shafali Verma won the toss and elected to bowl, and Sadhu struck yet again in the first over. She hurried one onto Liberty Heap, who could only loop her attempted pull straight up and back to a gleeful Sadhu. Her figures of two for 6 in four overs deservedly earned her the Player of the Match award with just the start that India craved. She was backed up well by Archana (two for 17) and the irrepressible Parshavi Chopra, who snared two for 13 to close out a terrific tournament offering. There were also wickets apiece for Mannat Kashyap, Verma and Sonam Yadav, as England tumbled to 22 for four and then eventually 68 all out in 17.1 overs. After a tournament of free-scoring, only Ryana Macdonald-Gay (19 off 24 balls), Niamh Holland (10) and Sophia Smale (11) could reach double figures. England’s hopes for more heroics with the ball were raised when they removed Verma (15) and Shweta Sehrawat (5) inside the first four overs. Verma hit a four and a six as she tried to put the heat on England early before she top-edged Hannah Baker to short fine-leg. Soumya Tiwari and Trisha were having none of it. Tiwari smacked three fours in her 24 not out from 37 balls, while Trisha got more and more fluent as the target came into sight. Her 29-ball stay was ended on 24, bowled by Alexa Stonehouse as she tried to finish it off in style. (ANI) This report is filed by ANI news service.

Last week, Khawaja was named in the ICC Test Team of the Year alongside Australian teammates Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon and Marnus Labuschagne. During his acceptance speech, Khawaja thanked Travis Head for making way from the Australian team – due to Covid – midway through last summer’s Ashes series, which ultimately gave Khawaja another opportunity at Test level – an opportunity he’s grasped forcefully. “I honestly thought that game at the SCG … I always thought it could be my last game. I was playing it as my last game,” Khawaja said. Usman Khawaja of Australia. Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images Source: Getty Images “It’s funny when you play with that kind of mindset how things can actually work out. I was just worried about getting off the mark and doing the process right and trying to win the game for the team. Life’s very funny at times.” The Queenslander was unstoppable in Pakistan, his country of birth, registering scores of 97, 160, 44 not out, 92 and 104 not out during the historic tour. “What we did as a team going to Pakistan … I mean, New Zealand had an opportunity to go, they didn’t go. England had an opportunity to go, they didn’t go,” he said. “All the way from CA up to the top, up to Pat (Cummins), all the players – it was a sacrifice at some level because the families … it was uncertain. We hadn’t been back there for so long, so for a lot of people they don’t see behind the scenes it’s a tough decision to make. Credit to everyone who went. “Obviously I was born in Pakistan. I know what it means to Pakistan cricket. I know what it means to Pakistan. I know what it means to my dad because I grew up and I saw what the passion he had for cricket and supporting Pakistan and now Australia. For the guys to do that, I think speaks volumes for the team and where we’re headed.” Usman Khawaja shares a moment with Marnus Labuschagne. Picture: Mark Evans Source: Getty Images Khawaja was then asked to say a few thank you’s, which prompted a cheeky self-plug. “I’ll just start by saying congrats to everyone on the team.

I was just a little bit better I think … I’m just joking guys, I had to get it out there,” he said with a laugh. Khawaja then turned his attention to his family and delivered touching tributes. “For my wife, Rachel – you are the rock. You know how much I love you,” he said. “When I got dropped in 2019, you gave me unconditional love. I’m getting emotional thinking about a very tough time in my life. You loved me when I was playing for Australia, you loved me when I was playing for Queensland, even when I was a ‘clubbie’ playing for ‘Valleys’ you gave me unconditional love. “You love Usman Khawaja the person, not Usman Khawaja the cricketer – and for that, I’m truly indebted to you. Without you, I wouldn’t be standing here right now. “I’ll just give a quick mention to my daughters, Aisha and Ayla.

Marnus gives Usman the wind up | 00:45 “Aisha I love you so much. You bring so much happiness to my life, something I could never ever explained. You mean the world to me. Ayla, you’re only eight months old, you’re attached to your mum right now, the most I get is ‘ba ba ba’ from you – but that ‘ba ba ba’ melts my heart and I love you too very much. “To my mum, I’m sure you probably would have seen her in the stands. She’s the lady with the scarf who’s always panicking every single match I play. She still thinks it’s my first Test match – Mum I’ve played 50 Test matches, I’m 36 years old, relax! Enjoy the game please. I love you so much. I’m hoping the next little bit of the journey you can enjoy. “To my dad, who’s an absolute cricket tragic. You made the biggest sacrifice of all for us kids. We lived a very good life in Pakistan, we were comfortable. But you moved, you decided to take a leap – without a job, without anything – for us children to have a better life. For that I will always be indebted and for that I will always thank you for allowing me to be in Australia and representing the Australian cricket team. Who knows if you never moved, I might have been at the PCB awards right now getting an award … probably for best all-rounder because my offies would’ve been devastating out there!” Usman Khawaja arrives ahead of the 2023 Australian Cricket Awards.

When The People’s Champ’s talking, don’t rush The People’s Champ, alright?” Khawaja said. He then thanked cricket fans – because “The People’s Champ has to thank the fans”. “The love I’ve gotten over the last year, I could never ever imagined getting that kind of love,” he said. “I finally feel like not only my teammates, but Australia as a country and as a cricketing organisation is finally respecting me as the person, the beliefs I have. I love where we’ve been and where we’re going.

It began during a summer of transition following Eoin Morgan’s retirement and the appointment of Matthew Mott as white-ball head coach, has roots in the de-prioritising of the format during back-to-back T20 World Cup cycles and is now being amplified by scheduling conflicts that have seen most recent series played with nothing like a full strength side. SPONSORED “It’s not easy not having the best players here all the time,” Moeen said. “I hate going on about the schedule, but [Joe] Root’s not here and he’s our best ODI player in terms of stats and stuff like that. “Rooty is a massive player at No3, Jonny [Bairstow] is out, [Mark] Wood would be in as well. A lot of strength and players to come in, to get that experience. “Come the crunch time, what really matters is pressure and how you handle the pressure. We have been in that situation many times and we can hopefully do it again. “There is no panic in the changing room. We know with the World Cup coming up it is about getting the right team together.” Moeen’s own role will be intriguing to monitor over the next nine months. With Ben Stokes, for now at least, retired, he has been batting up the order at No6 in an attempt to balance the side and must start to deliver consistent runs, particularly with the likes of Liam Livingstone and Will Jacks in contention and capable of playing a similar role as a spinning all-rounder. Moeen’s half-century in Sunday’s defeat was his first in the format since 2017 and he admits that existing on a diet of almost exclusively T20 cricket outside the international set-up has made adjusting to the 50-over game more challenging. “I’ve played so much T20 cricket lately that it’s hard to go in and not play shots from ball one,” he said. “I nearly got out trying to play a big shot, but it is difficult. I mean 50 overs is a completely different mindset but you want to keep that intensity. “I want to keep myself going otherwise I get a little bit lazy and I have this fight between being lazy and being too aggressive.” Coming in later in a 50-over innings also requires a different approach from a player used to batting, more often than not, in the top-order in franchise cricket. “One of the hardest things is when you’re so used to the powerplay and then coming in having to whack guys bowling at 90mph,” he said. “It is not easy. I’m not a powerful guy. But I need to give myself that time and that’s something I need to really trust. “Sometimes I do panic. I don’t trust my own game at times because I see the boundaries and then I feel like they’re really big at times, but then I’ll hit one and I’m okay.” The 35-year-old does at least profess to still enjoy batting in the longer form of the white-ball game, which is more than can be said for his other suit. “I hate bowling in 50-over cricket,” he admitted. “I actually think it’s quite unfair for spinners. I genuinely think that because we always have to have one guy up [in the field]. “I just feel like it’s hard to build pressure unless it’s absolutely ragging. [Adil] Rashid bowled four dot-balls to [South African batter] Rassie [van der Dussen] and he just went to sweep for four - normally that should be a one, in my opinion. “Obviously, we have to get better, but a lot go the time you can only bowl straight. As soon as you give a bit of width, it’s four on good wickets.”","pubDate":"2023-01-30 19:01:42","image_url":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/01/30/18/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"standarduk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lancashire Cricket sign New Zealand duo Daryl Mitchell, Colin de Grandhomme","link":"https://thenewsmill.com/2023/01/lancashire-cricket-sign-new-zealand-duo-daryl-mitchell-colin-de-grandhomme/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","ANI"],"creator":["ANI"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Lancashire Cricket Club (LCC) have signed New Zealand internationals Daryl Mitchell and Colin de Grandhomme ahead of the 2023 season, the club announced on Monday. “The all-rounders have signed overseas contracts with the Club and will be available in both the County Championship and Vitality Blast as head coach Glen Chapple adds to his already strong squad which finished runners-up in both competitions last summer,” Lancashire Cricket Club said in an official statement. De Grandhomme will arrive in the UK for the Red Rose’s first four matches of the County Championship season before Mitchell joins his compatriot at Emirates Old Trafford ahead of facing Somerset on May 11. The pair will be with the Club for the entirety of Lancashire Lightning’s Vitality Blast campaign – alongside fellow overseas contracted player, Dane Vilas. Mitchell will then be available for selection for Lancashire’s County Championship fixtures against Hampshire, Surrey and Essex which all take place during the Vitality Blast group stage. In addition to the opening four County Championship fixtures, De Grandhomme will also be available to play in – and provide cover for – the Club’s red ball matches that take place in June and July during the Vitality Blast. “We are really excited to add both Daryl and Colin to our squad and to be able to do so for such a large portion of the 2023 season – which was a key factor for us when looking to make overseas additions this year,” the Director of Cricket Performance Mark Chilton said. “The schedule, as it has been for the last few years, continues to be really challenging particularly in the middle part of the summer throughout May, June and July, due to the amount of cricket we’re playing in a short period. With that in mind, we want to ensure we’ve got enough strength in depth to cover for all eventualities and Daryl and Colin provide us with exactly that,” Chilton said. “It has been a tricky process to try and add the right overseas players to our squad – in terms of both availability and quality – but I think we have found the perfect fit with two experienced international cricketers, who will bring quality to our changing room. Colin will be with us from the very start against Surrey in the County Championship before Daryl joins up in mid-May, the pair will then both be available throughout our Vitality Blast campaign and, alongside Dane Vilas, provide us with plenty of options for different matches and scenarios,” he added. Mitchell, who played as a professional player at Blackpool Cricket Club in 2016, averages 58.35 in his 14-match Test career and grabbed headlines on New Zealand’s tour of England in 2022, scoring two fifties and three hundreds in the series, including 190 at Trent Bridge. In 90 First-Class matches, the 31-year-old has scored 5,038 runs at an average of just over 40 and has a knack for picking up important wickets with the red ball – taking 91 with his right-arm seamers. Mitchell’s scored more than 3,000 runs in T20 cricket – including 13 fifties – and played a key role when promoted to open at the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE during New Zealand’s run to the final, which included a match-winning 72 not out against England in the semis. He experienced the Vitality Blast for the first time in 2021, playing eight matches for Middlesex – scoring 209 runs and picking up eight wickets. He was also drafted by Rajasthan Royals for the 2022 IPL. “I am delighted to be joining Lancashire this English summer. The county has a proud history and having lived in Manchester as a child for a couple of years – it’s special to return in this way. I had a taste of the Vitality Blast and County Championship with Middlesex in 2021 and I am really looking forward to trying to make contributions in both competitions for Lancashire this summer. The chance to test my skills again in two strong competitions is exciting as a player,” Daryl Mitchell said. “I really enjoy playing in English conditions and the special history of the game around the country. I have very fond memories of my two tours to England with New Zealand and hope to build more with Lancashire. It will also be great to link up with my old Blackpool teammates Steven Croft and Richard Gleeson having played there for a summer in 2016,” he added. A bruising, broad-shouldered batter – and disciplined medium-pace bowler – de Grandhomme has experience in all three international formats and in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Big Bash League (BBL). The 36-year-old averages 37.79 with the bat in First-Class cricket – with 15 centuries to his name – and has taken 212 wickets the red ball at 29.51. In T20 cricket, de Grandhomme has represented Royal Challengers Bangalore (IPL), Adelaide Strikers (BBL) and Hampshire Hawks (Vitality Blast) and has scored over 4,000 runs striking at 156.90 whilst picking up 74 wickets. “I’m really looking forward to the opportunity of playing for Lancashire this season. I’ve loved playing county cricket previously and I can’t wait to get to England in April to kick off the season with the Red Rose. Lancashire has an exciting squad who have been so close to silverware in the last couple of years, hopefully I can help to add some experience to the dressing room so that we can go one step further this season,” Colin de Grandhomme said. “Emirates Old Trafford is a world-class venue, one which I have played at before in New Zealand colours and I can’t wait to pull on a Lancashire shirt in front of the Club’s Members and supporters,” he added.

If you aspire to get a central Australian contract, then you’re going to be rewarded. “I think guys see the short term at the moment with all the leagues around, but the best way to get value for your currency is to actually make a name for yourself. “There’s only been a small minority of people who have been able to do that and have a long career. You want to aspire to play cricket for Australia, and you’re only going to get there by putting numbers on the board. “Through Big Bash, if you think that’s going to be your way and you don’t want to play red-ball cricket, then you probably won’t get that value of currency in the other franchise leagues.” Mitchell Starc is still recovering from a finger injury and will miss the first Test in India.

The post Bavuma and the Proteas keep the feel-good factor going in SA cricket appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"Cricket is a game of fine margins and usually more disappointment than success. Batters are almost always dismissed. The good ones might score more than 50 about every fourth trip to the crease. It’s a hard job. For Proteas captain Temba Bavuma, it’s been an emotionally draining year or so. Runs have been hard to come by, criticism has been harsh and he endured the most chastening public snub when failing to secure an SA20 contract at the auction. Which is why, when he reached his century against England in Bloemfontein on Sunday, he gestured to his name on his back and the badge on his chest. It was a natural outpouring of relief, anger and joy for the skipper, who happens to be leading at a time when South African cricket’s world-class playing stocks are thin. Still, they are a team of battlers and thanks to Bavuma’s 109 off 102 balls at the Mangaung Oval, chased down 343 in 49.1 overs to seal a 2-0 series victory over the world champions, England. It was a win that took the Proteas a step closer to automatic qualification for the One-Day International (ODI) World Cup later this year, but as importantly, continued to keep cricket in the headlines for the right reasons. After years of boardroom drama and inconsistency on the field at international level, the SA20 has been a revelation in bringing fans back to stadiums in the past three weeks. But due to the late confirmation of the SA20 tournament, the three-match ODI series against England needed to be accommodated simultaneously. The compromise was to pause the SA20 for a week while South Africa and England battle it out. Fortunately, the Proteas continued the feel-good momentum SA20 created with two pulsating wins over England in Bloemfontein, with the third match set for Kimberley on 1 February. Barring Bavuma, the star Proteas performers during the first two ODIs all have SA20 contracts. So, it was a pleasure to see the skipper do the only thing he could do, and score runs to remind people why he is captain in the white-ball format. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations “Emotionally, it [being snubbed and struggling for runs] can be draining and it can be taxing. As much as you try to block it out, it does affect you,” Bavuma said. “The biggest one is when it affects people around you — your family. As a player, I have my ways of dealing with it. It is a part of the journey. “We all go through periods of ups and downs, whether in our careers and family life,” Bavuma said. “The difference is that it’s in the eyes of everyone, and everyone wants to have a piece of you. It’s about trying to not be as emotional as you can and to see things as plainly, as they are. “Blocking out the noise is something you have to do but that is quite impossible, especially me in the situation I find myself in, as the captain.” He took some time out after the recent Test tour to Australia where the Proteas lost 2-0. Bavuma top-scored for the tourists with 185 runs across the three Tests at an average of 37. But when the SA20 party started, he was a spectator watching an entertaining and enthralling competition play out. He will return to that status on Thursday morning, which is an odd situation for the national captain. “Being out of action for two weeks and being at home and away from the game also helped me,” Bavuma said. “Physically, I’m maybe not in the best shape, but mentally I am. I’ve become a bit more open towards the team and how we would like to go about things.” There has been a change in coaching since the Australia tour, with respected coach Shukri Conrad handling the white-ball duties temporarily before Rob Walter takes over. Conrad will then assume full-time Test coaching duties. Conrad, who has been on the domestic cricket scene for more than two decades, has seen it all and understands more than most what makes cricketers, batters and captains tick. Bavuma leaned on Conrad and admitted to taking the risk of being vulnerable with the coach. It’s an approach that appears to be paying off. “The conversation I had with Shukri helped. It was just being vulnerable to the coach about where I see myself and how I feel about everything,” Bavuma revealed after his superb innings in Bloemfontein. “He helped me clear through all the nonsense that was in my head and helped me get ready for the series. “It was just him giving me an ear, hearing me out and validating the feelings that I’ve had. The biggest thing is getting your mind into the right state to play the game. Shuks is not a therapist. What I enjoyed was the honesty and the clarity that he gave in the chat.” Whatever the exact content of their conversation, it clearly helped. And South African cricket is better for it.

England’s Grace Scrivens has been named the captain of the side. The team has three Indians — Shweta Sehrawat, Shafali Verma and Parshavi Chopra — while three players from England have also been named in the lineup. In a lineup with incredible hitters like Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh, it was Shweta Sehrawat who shined the brightest for India in the inaugural U19 Women’s T20 World Cup. With a polished 92* against South Africa to open their U19 Women’s T20 World Cup campaign, the team’s vice-captain set the standard for the rest of the competition. With 297 runs at an average of 99 and a strike rate of 139.43, she eventually finished as the tournament’s leading run-scorer. She added two additional half-centuries (74* vs. UAE and 61* vs. New Zealand). There wasn’t much that England’s Grace Scrivens couldn’t do at the U19 Women’s T20 World Cup, including bat, bowl, and captain. It is understandable why the England captain received the Player of the Tournament award despite playing in the final and losing. Scrivens, who batted first, finished as the second-highest run-scorer with 293 runs, three fifty-plus runs, and an average of 41.85. Her 93 off 56 versus Ireland gave her the highest score of the competition. Throughout the competition, the stylish Shafali Verma demonstrated her offensive prowess with the bat and her leadership prowess as captain. Although Shafali would have preferred to bat more consistently, the pace at which her runs were scored (at 193.25) made up for it. Her 34-ball 78 against the UAE was a power-hitting display as she smacked the bowlers for 12 fours and 4 sixes. With 172 runs, she was the third-highest run scorer in the competition. The captain contributed with useful overs as well, taking four wickets in seven games at a mere 5.04 economy. Only two wickets were taken by Parshavi Chopra in India’s first three games of the tournament. She made up for it, though, by finishing as the second-highest wicket-taker at the T20 World Cup with 11 wickets in six games. The leggie dominated Sri Lanka in the final Super Six game, recording statistics of 4/5.

The young cricketers have made India proud and we will honour their achievements,” Jay Shah wrote on Twitter. Coming to the match, Indian bowlers’ tremendous bowling performance followed by Gongadi Trisha and Soumya Tiwari’s knocks helped India lift the inaugural U19 Women’s T20 World Cup title after defeating England by seven wickets in the summit clash at Senwes Park in Potchefstroom, South Africa on Sunday. The Shafali Verma-Team India defeated England in a one-sided summit clash, first bowling them out for 68 and then chasing down the target in 14 overs. It was another clinical display with the ball that held the key to India’s march to victory, with Titas Sadhu setting the pace, with the spinners delivering another telling performance when it mattered. Supplementing the fine bowling was outstanding fielding. The dismissal of England’s captain, Grace Scrivens, epitomised the sheer determination in the Indian ranks. The left-hander hit Archana towards long-off, where Gongadi Trisha sprinted in, then leapt forward to take an excellent, tumbling catch. It Changes From Black To Translucent Depending On Emotional StateHerbeauty9 Interesting Facts About Indira GandhiHerbeautyIt was the key wicket, in many ways, and the celebrations from India confirmed as much. Scrivens would go on to scoop the Player of the Tournament award, but she would have given all of that up for a better English display with the bat. Shafali Verma won the toss and elected to bowl, and Sadhu struck yet again in the first over. She hurried one onto Liberty Heap, who could only loop her attempted pull straight up and back to a gleeful Sadhu. Her figures of two for 6 in four overs deservedly earned her the Player of the Match award with just the start that India craved. She was backed up well by Archana (two for 17) and the irrepressible Parshavi Chopra, who snared two for 13 to close out a terrific tournament offering. There were also wickets apiece for Mannat Kashyap, Verma and Sonam Yadav, as England tumbled to 22 for four and then eventually 68 all out in 17.1 overs. After a tournament of free-scoring, only Ryana Macdonald-Gay (19 off 24 balls), Niamh Holland (10) and Sophia Smale (11) could reach double figures. England’s hopes for more heroics with the ball were raised when they removed Verma (15) and Shweta Sehrawat (5) inside the first four overs. Verma hit a four and a six as she tried to put the heat on England early before she top-edged Hannah Baker to short fine-leg. Soumya Tiwari and Trisha were having none of it. Tiwari smacked three fours in her 24 not out from 37 balls, while Trisha got more and more fluent as the target came into sight. Her 29-ball stay was ended on 24, bowled by Alexa Stonehouse as she tried to finish it off in style. (ANI) This report is filed by ANI news service.

And he delivered a quintessentially Khawaja acceptance speech. Since returning to the Test side in January last year, Khawaja has been Australia’s leading run-scorer in the five-day format, accumulating 1020 runs at 78.46 during the voting period.

Last week, Khawaja was named in the ICC Test Team of the Year alongside Australian teammates Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon and Marnus Labuschagne. During his acceptance speech, Khawaja thanked Travis Head for making way from the Australian team – due to Covid – midway through last summer’s Ashes series, which ultimately gave Khawaja another opportunity at Test level – an opportunity he’s grasped forcefully. “I honestly thought that game at the SCG … I always thought it could be my last game. I was playing it as my last game,” Khawaja said. Usman Khawaja of Australia. Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images Source: Getty Images “It’s funny when you play with that kind of mindset how things can actually work out. I was just worried about getting off the mark and doing the process right and trying to win the game for the team. Life’s very funny at times.” The Queenslander was unstoppable in Pakistan, his country of birth, registering scores of 97, 160, 44 not out, 92 and 104 not out during the historic tour. “What we did as a team going to Pakistan … I mean, New Zealand had an opportunity to go, they didn’t go. England had an opportunity to go, they didn’t go,” he said. “All the way from CA up to the top, up to Pat (Cummins), all the players – it was a sacrifice at some level because the families … it was uncertain. We hadn’t been back there for so long, so for a lot of people they don’t see behind the scenes it’s a tough decision to make. Credit to everyone who went. “Obviously I was born in Pakistan. I know what it means to Pakistan cricket. I know what it means to Pakistan. I know what it means to my dad because I grew up and I saw what the passion he had for cricket and supporting Pakistan and now Australia. For the guys to do that, I think speaks volumes for the team and where we’re headed.” Usman Khawaja shares a moment with Marnus Labuschagne. Picture: Mark Evans Source: Getty Images Khawaja was then asked to say a few thank you’s, which prompted a cheeky self-plug. “I’ll just start by saying congrats to everyone on the team. I think there’s been outstanding performances – Marnus, Smudger, Patty always, Gaz the amount of wickets you’ve taken this year is unbelievable. I was just a little bit better I think … I’m just joking guys, I had to get it out there,” he said with a laugh. Khawaja then turned his attention to his family and delivered touching tributes. “For my wife, Rachel – you are the rock. You know how much I love you,” he said. “When I got dropped in 2019, you gave me unconditional love. I’m getting emotional thinking about a very tough time in my life. You loved me when I was playing for Australia, you loved me when I was playing for Queensland, even when I was a ‘clubbie’ playing for ‘Valleys’ you gave me unconditional love. “You love Usman Khawaja the person, not Usman Khawaja the cricketer – and for that, I’m truly indebted to you. Without you, I wouldn’t be standing here right now. “I’ll just give a quick mention to my daughters, Aisha and Ayla. They won’t understand what’s going on right now, but I’m sure at some level at some time in life, they’ll be like ‘you should’ve thanked us’. Feisty girls, those ones. Marnus gives Usman the wind up | 00:45 “Aisha I love you so much. You bring so much happiness to my life, something I could never ever explained. You mean the world to me. Ayla, you’re only eight months old, you’re attached to your mum right now, the most I get is ‘ba ba ba’ from you – but that ‘ba ba ba’ melts my heart and I love you too very much. “To my mum, I’m sure you probably would have seen her in the stands. She’s the lady with the scarf who’s always panicking every single match I play. She still thinks it’s my first Test match – Mum I’ve played 50 Test matches, I’m 36 years old, relax! Enjoy the game please. I love you so much. I’m hoping the next little bit of the journey you can enjoy. “To my dad, who’s an absolute cricket tragic. You made the biggest sacrifice of all for us kids. We lived a very good life in Pakistan, we were comfortable. But you moved, you decided to take a leap – without a job, without anything – for us children to have a better life. For that I will always be indebted and for that I will always thank you for allowing me to be in Australia and representing the Australian cricket team. Who knows if you never moved, I might have been at the PCB awards right now getting an award … probably for best all-rounder because my offies would’ve been devastating out there!” Usman Khawaja arrives ahead of the 2023 Australian Cricket Awards. Photo by Mark Evans/Getty Images Source: Getty Images As Khawaja was thanking his teammates, Marnus Labuschagne screamed out from his seat and appeared to give Khawaja the wind-up. “This is my time. When The People’s Champ’s talking, don’t rush The People’s Champ, alright?” Khawaja said. He then thanked cricket fans – because “The People’s Champ has to thank the fans”. “The love I’ve gotten over the last year, I could never ever imagined getting that kind of love,” he said. “I finally feel like not only my teammates, but Australia as a country and as a cricketing organisation is finally respecting me as the person, the beliefs I have. I love where we’ve been and where we’re going. I love where we’ve come over the last 10 to 15 years and hopefully over the next 10 to 15 years we can be even further. “Thank you.” Khawaja earlier in the night also won the Community Impact Award for his work off the field.

It began during a summer of transition following Eoin Morgan’s retirement and the appointment of Matthew Mott as white-ball head coach, has roots in the de-prioritising of the format during back-to-back T20 World Cup cycles and is now being amplified by scheduling conflicts that have seen most recent series played with nothing like a full strength side. SPONSORED “It’s not easy not having the best players here all the time,” Moeen said. “I hate going on about the schedule, but [Joe] Root’s not here and he’s our best ODI player in terms of stats and stuff like that. “Rooty is a massive player at No3, Jonny [Bairstow] is out, [Mark] Wood would be in as well. A lot of strength and players to come in, to get that experience. “Come the crunch time, what really matters is pressure and how you handle the pressure. We have been in that situation many times and we can hopefully do it again. “There is no panic in the changing room. We know with the World Cup coming up it is about getting the right team together.” Moeen’s own role will be intriguing to monitor over the next nine months. With Ben Stokes, for now at least, retired, he has been batting up the order at No6 in an attempt to balance the side and must start to deliver consistent runs, particularly with the likes of Liam Livingstone and Will Jacks in contention and capable of playing a similar role as a spinning all-rounder. Moeen’s half-century in Sunday’s defeat was his first in the format since 2017 and he admits that existing on a diet of almost exclusively T20 cricket outside the international set-up has made adjusting to the 50-over game more challenging. “I’ve played so much T20 cricket lately that it’s hard to go in and not play shots from ball one,” he said. “I nearly got out trying to play a big shot, but it is difficult. I mean 50 overs is a completely different mindset but you want to keep that intensity. “I want to keep myself going otherwise I get a little bit lazy and I have this fight between being lazy and being too aggressive.” Coming in later in a 50-over innings also requires a different approach from a player used to batting, more often than not, in the top-order in franchise cricket. “One of the hardest things is when you’re so used to the powerplay and then coming in having to whack guys bowling at 90mph,” he said. “It is not easy. I’m not a powerful guy. But I need to give myself that time and that’s something I need to really trust. “Sometimes I do panic. I don’t trust my own game at times because I see the boundaries and then I feel like they’re really big at times, but then I’ll hit one and I’m okay.” The 35-year-old does at least profess to still enjoy batting in the longer form of the white-ball game, which is more than can be said for his other suit. “I hate bowling in 50-over cricket,” he admitted. “I actually think it’s quite unfair for spinners. I genuinely think that because we always have to have one guy up [in the field]. “I just feel like it’s hard to build pressure unless it’s absolutely ragging. [Adil] Rashid bowled four dot-balls to [South African batter] Rassie [van der Dussen] and he just went to sweep for four - normally that should be a one, in my opinion. “Obviously, we have to get better, but a lot go the time you can only bowl straight. As soon as you give a bit of width, it’s four on good wickets.”","pubDate":"2023-01-30 19:01:42","image_url":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/01/30/18/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"standarduk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lancashire Cricket sign New Zealand duo Daryl Mitchell, Colin de Grandhomme","link":"https://thenewsmill.com/2023/01/lancashire-cricket-sign-new-zealand-duo-daryl-mitchell-colin-de-grandhomme/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","ANI"],"creator":["ANI"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Lancashire Cricket Club (LCC) have signed New Zealand internationals Daryl Mitchell and Colin de Grandhomme ahead of the 2023 season, the club announced on Monday. “The all-rounders have signed overseas contracts with the Club and will be available in both the County Championship and Vitality Blast as head coach Glen Chapple adds to his already strong squad which finished runners-up in both competitions last summer,” Lancashire Cricket Club said in an official statement. De Grandhomme will arrive in the UK for the Red Rose’s first four matches of the County Championship season before Mitchell joins his compatriot at Emirates Old Trafford ahead of facing Somerset on May 11. The pair will be with the Club for the entirety of Lancashire Lightning’s Vitality Blast campaign – alongside fellow overseas contracted player, Dane Vilas. Mitchell will then be available for selection for Lancashire’s County Championship fixtures against Hampshire, Surrey and Essex which all take place during the Vitality Blast group stage. In addition to the opening four County Championship fixtures, De Grandhomme will also be available to play in – and provide cover for – the Club’s red ball matches that take place in June and July during the Vitality Blast. “We are really excited to add both Daryl and Colin to our squad and to be able to do so for such a large portion of the 2023 season – which was a key factor for us when looking to make overseas additions this year,” the Director of Cricket Performance Mark Chilton said. “The schedule, as it has been for the last few years, continues to be really challenging particularly in the middle part of the summer throughout May, June and July, due to the amount of cricket we’re playing in a short period. With that in mind, we want to ensure we’ve got enough strength in depth to cover for all eventualities and Daryl and Colin provide us with exactly that,” Chilton said. “It has been a tricky process to try and add the right overseas players to our squad – in terms of both availability and quality – but I think we have found the perfect fit with two experienced international cricketers, who will bring quality to our changing room. Colin will be with us from the very start against Surrey in the County Championship before Daryl joins up in mid-May, the pair will then both be available throughout our Vitality Blast campaign and, alongside Dane Vilas, provide us with plenty of options for different matches and scenarios,” he added. Mitchell, who played as a professional player at Blackpool Cricket Club in 2016, averages 58.35 in his 14-match Test career and grabbed headlines on New Zealand’s tour of England in 2022, scoring two fifties and three hundreds in the series, including 190 at Trent Bridge. In 90 First-Class matches, the 31-year-old has scored 5,038 runs at an average of just over 40 and has a knack for picking up important wickets with the red ball – taking 91 with his right-arm seamers. Mitchell’s scored more than 3,000 runs in T20 cricket – including 13 fifties – and played a key role when promoted to open at the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE during New Zealand’s run to the final, which included a match-winning 72 not out against England in the semis. He experienced the Vitality Blast for the first time in 2021, playing eight matches for Middlesex – scoring 209 runs and picking up eight wickets. He was also drafted by Rajasthan Royals for the 2022 IPL. “I am delighted to be joining Lancashire this English summer. The county has a proud history and having lived in Manchester as a child for a couple of years – it’s special to return in this way. I had a taste of the Vitality Blast and County Championship with Middlesex in 2021 and I am really looking forward to trying to make contributions in both competitions for Lancashire this summer. The chance to test my skills again in two strong competitions is exciting as a player,” Daryl Mitchell said. “I really enjoy playing in English conditions and the special history of the game around the country. I have very fond memories of my two tours to England with New Zealand and hope to build more with Lancashire. It will also be great to link up with my old Blackpool teammates Steven Croft and Richard Gleeson having played there for a summer in 2016,” he added. A bruising, broad-shouldered batter – and disciplined medium-pace bowler – de Grandhomme has experience in all three international formats and in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Big Bash League (BBL). The 36-year-old averages 37.79 with the bat in First-Class cricket – with 15 centuries to his name – and has taken 212 wickets the red ball at 29.51. In T20 cricket, de Grandhomme has represented Royal Challengers Bangalore (IPL), Adelaide Strikers (BBL) and Hampshire Hawks (Vitality Blast) and has scored over 4,000 runs striking at 156.90 whilst picking up 74 wickets. “I’m really looking forward to the opportunity of playing for Lancashire this season. I’ve loved playing county cricket previously and I can’t wait to get to England in April to kick off the season with the Red Rose. Lancashire has an exciting squad who have been so close to silverware in the last couple of years, hopefully I can help to add some experience to the dressing room so that we can go one step further this season,” Colin de Grandhomme said. “Emirates Old Trafford is a world-class venue, one which I have played at before in New Zealand colours and I can’t wait to pull on a Lancashire shirt in front of the Club’s Members and supporters,” he added.

If you aspire to get a central Australian contract, then you’re going to be rewarded. “I think guys see the short term at the moment with all the leagues around, but the best way to get value for your currency is to actually make a name for yourself. “There’s only been a small minority of people who have been able to do that and have a long career.

The fast bowler injured the middle finger on his bowling hand during the Boxing Day Test and hasn’t played since, although he remains confident that he’ll return for the second match in India after getting through plenty of work at a training camp in Sydney. “It’s definitely on track. I’ve still got a week-and-a-half in the splint,” he said. “I’ve been able to train and get my workloads and everything up, and I’m probably bowling close to full training intensity as I can with the splint on.

The Australian Test captain and his counterpart Meg Lanning introduced the TV coverage of the Australian Cricket Awards on Monday night, but everything didn’t quite go to plan. Cummins and Lanning were recapping the cricketing year that was and having a light hearted back-and-forth exchange, before handing over hosting duties to Mel McLaughlin and Jason Richardson.

Cummins stumbled over his lines a few times and shamelessly broke the fourth wall, confessing that he and Lanning were reading pre-written prepared scripts. After Lanning complimented him on the men’s team’s successful year, Cummins replied: “And speaking of achievements, you guys won another World Cup and claimed Australia’s first ever gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in cricket.” “We wrote these scripts ourselves,” he joked, breaking into laughter.

I know all the MCG crowd wants to see that. Sorry Uzzie, there is one people’s champ.” But it got even more cringeworthy when Lanning missed her next cue and the pair awkwardly stared into dead silence for 10 seconds, glancing at each other with confused looks while the audience in Sydney burst into laughter. Lanning finally broke the awkward silence: “Is it my turn? It’s actually my turn to speak. “Just really good luck to everyone tonight, hope it’s a great evening and hope you have fun.” Cummins added: “Far too much of us. Let’s get the night started. Thank you.” Viewers joked the agonising moment was proof Cummins is human after all. AAP’s Scott Bailey tweeted: “Is it possible that after 30 years, the world has discovered something Pat Cummins can’t do? “Read off an autocue. (Don’t blame him, it’s bloody hard).” Sports writer and broadcaster Brett McKay joked: “Haha, as MCs they both make bloody good Australian captains...” The recent second season of the ‘The Test’ documentary also revealed Cummins also struggles playing the video game Call of Duty. As for the cricket awards themselves, Steve Smith won a record-equalling fourth Allan Border Medal as Australia’s best player across all formats last year, while Beth Mooney took out the Belinda Clark Medal.

(Photo by Mark Evans/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images Smith joins legends Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke as the only men to win the award four times, with Smith also claiming men’s cricket’s highest honour in 2015, 2018 and 2021. The former Test skipper polled 171 votes, finishing in front of Travis Head (144) and David Warner (141), who both enjoyed terrific years with the bat. It’s the latest in a long line of achievements for Smith, who recently moved past Sir Donald Bradman with his 30th Test century and now only trails Ponting and Steve Waugh in terms of Australian centurions. Smith scored 1547 runs in 32 matches across all three formats, headlined by a stunning 200 not out against the West Indies in the first Test innings of the home summer in Perth. Mooney had an equally stunning season, claiming her second Belinda Clark Medal. It was a bumper year for Mooney and the Australian women’s cricket team as they clinched the Ashes in January, won the 50-over World Cup and claimed the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games. Mooney finished on 129 votes ahead of Meg Lanning (110 votes) and Tahlia McGrath (95) in one of her most dominant years on the field.

The post Bavuma and the Proteas keep the feel-good factor going in SA cricket appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"Cricket is a game of fine margins and usually more disappointment than success. Batters are almost always dismissed. The good ones might score more than 50 about every fourth trip to the crease. It’s a hard job. For Proteas captain Temba Bavuma, it’s been an emotionally draining year or so. Runs have been hard to come by, criticism has been harsh and he endured the most chastening public snub when failing to secure an SA20 contract at the auction. Which is why, when he reached his century against England in Bloemfontein on Sunday, he gestured to his name on his back and the badge on his chest. It was a natural outpouring of relief, anger and joy for the skipper, who happens to be leading at a time when South African cricket’s world-class playing stocks are thin. Still, they are a team of battlers and thanks to Bavuma’s 109 off 102 balls at the Mangaung Oval, chased down 343 in 49.1 overs to seal a 2-0 series victory over the world champions, England. It was a win that took the Proteas a step closer to automatic qualification for the One-Day International (ODI) World Cup later this year, but as importantly, continued to keep cricket in the headlines for the right reasons. After years of boardroom drama and inconsistency on the field at international level, the SA20 has been a revelation in bringing fans back to stadiums in the past three weeks. But due to the late confirmation of the SA20 tournament, the three-match ODI series against England needed to be accommodated simultaneously. The compromise was to pause the SA20 for a week while South Africa and England battle it out. Fortunately, the Proteas continued the feel-good momentum SA20 created with two pulsating wins over England in Bloemfontein, with the third match set for Kimberley on 1 February. Barring Bavuma, the star Proteas performers during the first two ODIs all have SA20 contracts. So, it was a pleasure to see the skipper do the only thing he could do, and score runs to remind people why he is captain in the white-ball format. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations “Emotionally, it [being snubbed and struggling for runs] can be draining and it can be taxing. As much as you try to block it out, it does affect you,” Bavuma said. “The biggest one is when it affects people around you — your family. As a player, I have my ways of dealing with it. It is a part of the journey. “We all go through periods of ups and downs, whether in our careers and family life,” Bavuma said. “The difference is that it’s in the eyes of everyone, and everyone wants to have a piece of you. It’s about trying to not be as emotional as you can and to see things as plainly, as they are. “Blocking out the noise is something you have to do but that is quite impossible, especially me in the situation I find myself in, as the captain.” He took some time out after the recent Test tour to Australia where the Proteas lost 2-0. Bavuma top-scored for the tourists with 185 runs across the three Tests at an average of 37. But when the SA20 party started, he was a spectator watching an entertaining and enthralling competition play out. He will return to that status on Thursday morning, which is an odd situation for the national captain. “Being out of action for two weeks and being at home and away from the game also helped me,” Bavuma said. “Physically, I’m maybe not in the best shape, but mentally I am. I’ve become a bit more open towards the team and how we would like to go about things.” There has been a change in coaching since the Australia tour, with respected coach Shukri Conrad handling the white-ball duties temporarily before Rob Walter takes over. Conrad will then assume full-time Test coaching duties. Conrad, who has been on the domestic cricket scene for more than two decades, has seen it all and understands more than most what makes cricketers, batters and captains tick. Bavuma leaned on Conrad and admitted to taking the risk of being vulnerable with the coach. It’s an approach that appears to be paying off. “The conversation I had with Shukri helped. It was just being vulnerable to the coach about where I see myself and how I feel about everything,” Bavuma revealed after his superb innings in Bloemfontein. “He helped me clear through all the nonsense that was in my head and helped me get ready for the series. “It was just him giving me an ear, hearing me out and validating the feelings that I’ve had. The biggest thing is getting your mind into the right state to play the game. Shuks is not a therapist. What I enjoyed was the honesty and the clarity that he gave in the chat.” Whatever the exact content of their conversation, it clearly helped. And South African cricket is better for it.

England’s Grace Scrivens has been named the captain of the side. The team has three Indians — Shweta Sehrawat, Shafali Verma and Parshavi Chopra — while three players from England have also been named in the lineup. In a lineup with incredible hitters like Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh, it was Shweta Sehrawat who shined the brightest for India in the inaugural U19 Women’s T20 World Cup. With a polished 92* against South Africa to open their U19 Women’s T20 World Cup campaign, the team’s vice-captain set the standard for the rest of the competition. With 297 runs at an average of 99 and a strike rate of 139.43, she eventually finished as the tournament’s leading run-scorer. She added two additional half-centuries (74* vs. UAE and 61* vs. New Zealand). There wasn’t much that England’s Grace Scrivens couldn’t do at the U19 Women’s T20 World Cup, including bat, bowl, and captain. It is understandable why the England captain received the Player of the Tournament award despite playing in the final and losing. Scrivens, who batted first, finished as the second-highest run-scorer with 293 runs, three fifty-plus runs, and an average of 41.85. Her 93 off 56 versus Ireland gave her the highest score of the competition. Throughout the competition, the stylish Shafali Verma demonstrated her offensive prowess with the bat and her leadership prowess as captain. Although Shafali would have preferred to bat more consistently, the pace at which her runs were scored (at 193.25) made up for it. Her 34-ball 78 against the UAE was a power-hitting display as she smacked the bowlers for 12 fours and 4 sixes. With 172 runs, she was the third-highest run scorer in the competition. The captain contributed with useful overs as well, taking four wickets in seven games at a mere 5.04 economy. Only two wickets were taken by Parshavi Chopra in India’s first three games of the tournament. She made up for it, though, by finishing as the second-highest wicket-taker at the T20 World Cup with 11 wickets in six games. The leggie dominated Sri Lanka in the final Super Six game, recording statistics of 4/5. She followed that up with a 3/20 in the crucial semifinal match against New Zealand and a 2/13 in the Final, where she also claimed the wicket of Ryana MacDonald-Gay, England’s top scorer for the day. U19 Women’s T20 World Cup Team of the Tournament: Shweta Sehrawat (India), Grace Scrivens (captain) (England), Shafali Verma (India), Georgia Plimmer (New Zealand), Dewmi Vihanga (Sri Lanka), Shorna Akter (Bangladesh), Karabo Meso (Wicket-keeper) (South Africa), Parshavi Chopra (India), Hannah Baker (England), Ellie Anderson (England), Maggie Clark (Australia) and Anosha Nasir (12th Player) (Pakistan).

Coming to the match, Indian bowlers’ tremendous bowling performance followed by Gongadi Trisha and Soumya Tiwari’s knocks helped India lift the inaugural U19 Women’s T20 World Cup title after defeating England by seven wickets in the summit clash at Senwes Park in Potchefstroom, South Africa on Sunday. The Shafali Verma-Team India defeated England in a one-sided summit clash, first bowling them out for 68 and then chasing down the target in 14 overs. It was another clinical display with the ball that held the key to India’s march to victory, with Titas Sadhu setting the pace, with the spinners delivering another telling performance when it mattered. Supplementing the fine bowling was outstanding fielding. The dismissal of England’s captain, Grace Scrivens, epitomised the sheer determination in the Indian ranks. The left-hander hit Archana towards long-off, where Gongadi Trisha sprinted in, then leapt forward to take an excellent, tumbling catch. It Changes From Black To Translucent Depending On Emotional StateHerbeauty9 Interesting Facts About Indira GandhiHerbeautyIt was the key wicket, in many ways, and the celebrations from India confirmed as much. Scrivens would go on to scoop the Player of the Tournament award, but she would have given all of that up for a better English display with the bat. Shafali Verma won the toss and elected to bowl, and Sadhu struck yet again in the first over. She hurried one onto Liberty Heap, who could only loop her attempted pull straight up and back to a gleeful Sadhu. Her figures of two for 6 in four overs deservedly earned her the Player of the Match award with just the start that India craved. She was backed up well by Archana (two for 17) and the irrepressible Parshavi Chopra, who snared two for 13 to close out a terrific tournament offering. There were also wickets apiece for Mannat Kashyap, Verma and Sonam Yadav, as England tumbled to 22 for four and then eventually 68 all out in 17.1 overs. After a tournament of free-scoring, only Ryana Macdonald-Gay (19 off 24 balls), Niamh Holland (10) and Sophia Smale (11) could reach double figures. England’s hopes for more heroics with the ball were raised when they removed Verma (15) and Shweta Sehrawat (5) inside the first four overs. Verma hit a four and a six as she tried to put the heat on England early before she top-edged Hannah Baker to short fine-leg. Soumya Tiwari and Trisha were having none of it. Tiwari smacked three fours in her 24 not out from 37 balls, while Trisha got more and more fluent as the target came into sight. Her 29-ball stay was ended on 24, bowled by Alexa Stonehouse as she tried to finish it off in style. (ANI) This report is filed by ANI news service.

Last week, Khawaja was named in the ICC Test Team of the Year alongside Australian teammates Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon and Marnus Labuschagne. During his acceptance speech, Khawaja thanked Travis Head for making way from the Australian team – due to Covid – midway through last summer’s Ashes series, which ultimately gave Khawaja another opportunity at Test level – an opportunity he’s grasped forcefully. “I honestly thought that game at the SCG … I always thought it could be my last game. I was playing it as my last game,” Khawaja said. Usman Khawaja of Australia. Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images Source: Getty Images “It’s funny when you play with that kind of mindset how things can actually work out. I was just worried about getting off the mark and doing the process right and trying to win the game for the team. Life’s very funny at times.” The Queenslander was unstoppable in Pakistan, his country of birth, registering scores of 97, 160, 44 not out, 92 and 104 not out during the historic tour. “What we did as a team going to Pakistan … I mean, New Zealand had an opportunity to go, they didn’t go. England had an opportunity to go, they didn’t go,” he said. “All the way from CA up to the top, up to Pat (Cummins), all the players – it was a sacrifice at some level because the families … it was uncertain. We hadn’t been back there for so long, so for a lot of people they don’t see behind the scenes it’s a tough decision to make. Credit to everyone who went. “Obviously I was born in Pakistan. I know what it means to Pakistan cricket. I know what it means to Pakistan. I know what it means to my dad because I grew up and I saw what the passion he had for cricket and supporting Pakistan and now Australia. For the guys to do that, I think speaks volumes for the team and where we’re headed.” Usman Khawaja shares a moment with Marnus Labuschagne. Picture: Mark Evans Source: Getty Images Khawaja was then asked to say a few thank you’s, which prompted a cheeky self-plug. “I’ll just start by saying congrats to everyone on the team.

I was just a little bit better I think … I’m just joking guys, I had to get it out there,” he said with a laugh. Khawaja then turned his attention to his family and delivered touching tributes. “For my wife, Rachel – you are the rock. You know how much I love you,” he said. “When I got dropped in 2019, you gave me unconditional love. I’m getting emotional thinking about a very tough time in my life. You loved me when I was playing for Australia, you loved me when I was playing for Queensland, even when I was a ‘clubbie’ playing for ‘Valleys’ you gave me unconditional love. “You love Usman Khawaja the person, not Usman Khawaja the cricketer – and for that, I’m truly indebted to you. Without you, I wouldn’t be standing here right now. “I’ll just give a quick mention to my daughters, Aisha and Ayla.

Marnus gives Usman the wind up | 00:45 “Aisha I love you so much. You bring so much happiness to my life, something I could never ever explained. You mean the world to me. Ayla, you’re only eight months old, you’re attached to your mum right now, the most I get is ‘ba ba ba’ from you – but that ‘ba ba ba’ melts my heart and I love you too very much. “To my mum, I’m sure you probably would have seen her in the stands. She’s the lady with the scarf who’s always panicking every single match I play. She still thinks it’s my first Test match – Mum I’ve played 50 Test matches, I’m 36 years old, relax! Enjoy the game please. I love you so much. I’m hoping the next little bit of the journey you can enjoy. “To my dad, who’s an absolute cricket tragic. You made the biggest sacrifice of all for us kids. We lived a very good life in Pakistan, we were comfortable. But you moved, you decided to take a leap – without a job, without anything – for us children to have a better life. For that I will always be indebted and for that I will always thank you for allowing me to be in Australia and representing the Australian cricket team. Who knows if you never moved, I might have been at the PCB awards right now getting an award … probably for best all-rounder because my offies would’ve been devastating out there!” Usman Khawaja arrives ahead of the 2023 Australian Cricket Awards. Photo by Mark Evans/Getty Images Source: Getty Images As Khawaja was thanking his teammates, Marnus Labuschagne screamed out from his seat and appeared to give Khawaja the wind-up. “This is my time. When The People’s Champ’s talking, don’t rush The People’s Champ, alright?” Khawaja said. He then thanked cricket fans – because “The People’s Champ has to thank the fans”. “The love I’ve gotten over the last year, I could never ever imagined getting that kind of love,” he said. “I finally feel like not only my teammates, but Australia as a country and as a cricketing organisation is finally respecting me as the person, the beliefs I have. I love where we’ve been and where we’re going. I love where we’ve come over the last 10 to 15 years and hopefully over the next 10 to 15 years we can be even further. “Thank you.” Khawaja earlier in the night also won the Community Impact Award for his work off the field.

It began during a summer of transition following Eoin Morgan’s retirement and the appointment of Matthew Mott as white-ball head coach, has roots in the de-prioritising of the format during back-to-back T20 World Cup cycles and is now being amplified by scheduling conflicts that have seen most recent series played with nothing like a full strength side. SPONSORED “It’s not easy not having the best players here all the time,” Moeen said. “I hate going on about the schedule, but [Joe] Root’s not here and he’s our best ODI player in terms of stats and stuff like that. “Rooty is a massive player at No3, Jonny [Bairstow] is out, [Mark] Wood would be in as well. A lot of strength and players to come in, to get that experience. “Come the crunch time, what really matters is pressure and how you handle the pressure. We have been in that situation many times and we can hopefully do it again. “There is no panic in the changing room. We know with the World Cup coming up it is about getting the right team together.” Moeen’s own role will be intriguing to monitor over the next nine months. With Ben Stokes, for now at least, retired, he has been batting up the order at No6 in an attempt to balance the side and must start to deliver consistent runs, particularly with the likes of Liam Livingstone and Will Jacks in contention and capable of playing a similar role as a spinning all-rounder. Moeen’s half-century in Sunday’s defeat was his first in the format since 2017 and he admits that existing on a diet of almost exclusively T20 cricket outside the international set-up has made adjusting to the 50-over game more challenging. “I’ve played so much T20 cricket lately that it’s hard to go in and not play shots from ball one,” he said. “I nearly got out trying to play a big shot, but it is difficult. I mean 50 overs is a completely different mindset but you want to keep that intensity. “I want to keep myself going otherwise I get a little bit lazy and I have this fight between being lazy and being too aggressive.” Coming in later in a 50-over innings also requires a different approach from a player used to batting, more often than not, in the top-order in franchise cricket. “One of the hardest things is when you’re so used to the powerplay and then coming in having to whack guys bowling at 90mph,” he said. “It is not easy. I’m not a powerful guy. But I need to give myself that time and that’s something I need to really trust. “Sometimes I do panic. I don’t trust my own game at times because I see the boundaries and then I feel like they’re really big at times, but then I’ll hit one and I’m okay.” The 35-year-old does at least profess to still enjoy batting in the longer form of the white-ball game, which is more than can be said for his other suit. “I hate bowling in 50-over cricket,” he admitted. “I actually think it’s quite unfair for spinners. I genuinely think that because we always have to have one guy up [in the field]. “I just feel like it’s hard to build pressure unless it’s absolutely ragging. [Adil] Rashid bowled four dot-balls to [South African batter] Rassie [van der Dussen] and he just went to sweep for four - normally that should be a one, in my opinion. “Obviously, we have to get better, but a lot go the time you can only bowl straight. As soon as you give a bit of width, it’s four on good wickets.”","pubDate":"2023-01-30 19:01:42","image_url":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/01/30/18/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"standarduk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lancashire Cricket sign New Zealand duo Daryl Mitchell, Colin de Grandhomme","link":"https://thenewsmill.com/2023/01/lancashire-cricket-sign-new-zealand-duo-daryl-mitchell-colin-de-grandhomme/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","ANI"],"creator":["ANI"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Lancashire Cricket Club (LCC) have signed New Zealand internationals Daryl Mitchell and Colin de Grandhomme ahead of the 2023 season, the club announced on Monday. “The all-rounders have signed overseas contracts with the Club and will be available in both the County Championship and Vitality Blast as head coach Glen Chapple adds to his already strong squad which finished runners-up in both competitions last summer,” Lancashire Cricket Club said in an official statement. De Grandhomme will arrive in the UK for the Red Rose’s first four matches of the County Championship season before Mitchell joins his compatriot at Emirates Old Trafford ahead of facing Somerset on May 11. The pair will be with the Club for the entirety of Lancashire Lightning’s Vitality Blast campaign – alongside fellow overseas contracted player, Dane Vilas. Mitchell will then be available for selection for Lancashire’s County Championship fixtures against Hampshire, Surrey and Essex which all take place during the Vitality Blast group stage. In addition to the opening four County Championship fixtures, De Grandhomme will also be available to play in – and provide cover for – the Club’s red ball matches that take place in June and July during the Vitality Blast. “We are really excited to add both Daryl and Colin to our squad and to be able to do so for such a large portion of the 2023 season – which was a key factor for us when looking to make overseas additions this year,” the Director of Cricket Performance Mark Chilton said. “The schedule, as it has been for the last few years, continues to be really challenging particularly in the middle part of the summer throughout May, June and July, due to the amount of cricket we’re playing in a short period. With that in mind, we want to ensure we’ve got enough strength in depth to cover for all eventualities and Daryl and Colin provide us with exactly that,” Chilton said. “It has been a tricky process to try and add the right overseas players to our squad – in terms of both availability and quality – but I think we have found the perfect fit with two experienced international cricketers, who will bring quality to our changing room. Colin will be with us from the very start against Surrey in the County Championship before Daryl joins up in mid-May, the pair will then both be available throughout our Vitality Blast campaign and, alongside Dane Vilas, provide us with plenty of options for different matches and scenarios,” he added. Mitchell, who played as a professional player at Blackpool Cricket Club in 2016, averages 58.35 in his 14-match Test career and grabbed headlines on New Zealand’s tour of England in 2022, scoring two fifties and three hundreds in the series, including 190 at Trent Bridge. In 90 First-Class matches, the 31-year-old has scored 5,038 runs at an average of just over 40 and has a knack for picking up important wickets with the red ball – taking 91 with his right-arm seamers. Mitchell’s scored more than 3,000 runs in T20 cricket – including 13 fifties – and played a key role when promoted to open at the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE during New Zealand’s run to the final, which included a match-winning 72 not out against England in the semis. He experienced the Vitality Blast for the first time in 2021, playing eight matches for Middlesex – scoring 209 runs and picking up eight wickets. He was also drafted by Rajasthan Royals for the 2022 IPL. “I am delighted to be joining Lancashire this English summer. The county has a proud history and having lived in Manchester as a child for a couple of years – it’s special to return in this way. I had a taste of the Vitality Blast and County Championship with Middlesex in 2021 and I am really looking forward to trying to make contributions in both competitions for Lancashire this summer. The chance to test my skills again in two strong competitions is exciting as a player,” Daryl Mitchell said. “I really enjoy playing in English conditions and the special history of the game around the country. I have very fond memories of my two tours to England with New Zealand and hope to build more with Lancashire. It will also be great to link up with my old Blackpool teammates Steven Croft and Richard Gleeson having played there for a summer in 2016,” he added. A bruising, broad-shouldered batter – and disciplined medium-pace bowler – de Grandhomme has experience in all three international formats and in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Big Bash League (BBL). The 36-year-old averages 37.79 with the bat in First-Class cricket – with 15 centuries to his name – and has taken 212 wickets the red ball at 29.51. In T20 cricket, de Grandhomme has represented Royal Challengers Bangalore (IPL), Adelaide Strikers (BBL) and Hampshire Hawks (Vitality Blast) and has scored over 4,000 runs striking at 156.90 whilst picking up 74 wickets. “I’m really looking forward to the opportunity of playing for Lancashire this season. I’ve loved playing county cricket previously and I can’t wait to get to England in April to kick off the season with the Red Rose. Lancashire has an exciting squad who have been so close to silverware in the last couple of years, hopefully I can help to add some experience to the dressing room so that we can go one step further this season,” Colin de Grandhomme said. “Emirates Old Trafford is a world-class venue, one which I have played at before in New Zealand colours and I can’t wait to pull on a Lancashire shirt in front of the Club’s Members and supporters,” he added.

The ceremony, at Sydney’s Randwick Racecourse, was the first time Australia’s elite male and female cricketers had gathered together for the awards in three years. The awards also included two inductions to the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, with Ian Redpath and Margaret Jennings in the class of 2023. After receiving 171 votes to easily earn his fourth Allan Border Medal, Steve Smith won the highest individual award given to an Australian male cricketer. Travis Head (144 votes), David Warner (141), Marnus Labuschagne, and Usman Khawaja round out the top five, finishing much behind Smith. The 33-year-old Smith is the only four-time winner of the trophy, joining Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting. He also won it in 2015, 2018 and 2021. Since the AB Medal’s inception in 2000, no one has ever won five of them. Ahead of a busy domestic summer that included three different ODI series, a T20 World Cup on home soil, and Tests against the West Indies and South Africa, the star batter participated in tours of Pakistan and Sri Lanka and played in 10 Tests, 17 ODIs, and 20 T20 internationals during the voting period. During the voting period, Smith collected 1,524 runs across the formats and recorded Test centuries against Sri Lanka (145 in Galle), the West Indies (200 in Perth), and South Africa (104 in Sydney). Mooney, who won in 2021 as well, had 129 votes, beating out captain Meg Lanning (110 votes) and all-around player Tahlia McGrath (95 votes). Mooney amassed 1,109 runs at 69.31, more than any other Australian woman in all formats during the voting period, ahead of Lanning (991 runs at 55.05) and Alyssa Healy (771 at 32.15). The voting period took in last January’s multi-format Ashes, the 50-over World Cup in New Zealand, the T20 tri-series against Ireland and Pakistan, the Commonwealth Games, December’s T20I tour of India and the ODI leg of this month’s series against Pakistan.
