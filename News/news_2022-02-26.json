As the title sponsor, TikTok will provide a place where cricket fans can follow their favourite cricket content creators, share the best TikTok cricket content, and create their own special moments, reactions and celebrations around this historic series with Australia. Alongside the partnership, the PCB will launch an official TikTok account prior to the series with a mission to inspire and entertain millions of cricket fans not just in Pakistan but also around the world with exclusive behind-the-scene content as well as current and archival footage. PCB Chief Executive Faisal Hasnain said: “We have already established an excellent relationship with TikTok, starting with the HBL Pakistan Super League 7. Given that relationship, we are delighted to extend it further for the historic Pakistan-Australia Test series, which will probably be the series of the year.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Another look at peaking India","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/another-look-at-peaking-india-373169","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Dharamsala, February 25 A reinvigorated India will look to pocket their second series win and build on the gains made from a drastic change in their batting approach in the second T20I against Sri Lanka here tomorrow.

While Bangladesh have improved their position in the points table, Afghanistan have now slipped below Australia to seventh. When the series between Bangladesh and Afghanistan began, the Afghan team was sixth with 60 points. Courtesy of the two losses they have suffered in this series so far, Afghanistan's net run rate has gone down to +0.344, leading to their fall. Here are the updated standings: Bangladesh beat Afghanistan by 88 runs in the second game of their three-match series earlier today. Playing in Chattogram, the home side batted first and posted a 306-run total on the board. Chasing 307 to level the series, Afghanistan lost all their wickets for 218 runs in 45.1 overs. Opening batter Litton Das played an integral role in Bangladesh's win by scoring 136 runs against Afghanistan. Das opened the innings with skipper Tamim Iqbal. While Iqbal departed after scoring 12 runs, Das held one end till the 47th over and took the score closer to 300. Das received great support from Mushfiqur Rahim , who scored 86 runs off 93 deliveries. In reply, Rahmat Shah and Najibullah Zadran recorded a fifty each for Afghanistan, but their efforts went in vain. Shakib Al Hasan and Taskin Ahmed scalped two wickets each for the Bangladesh team.","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/02/dd05a-16458120277560-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Dharamsala weather today: What is the weather forecast for IND vs SL 2nd T20I at HPCA Cricket Stadium today?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-dharamsala-weather-today-what-is-the-weather-forecast-for-ind-vs-sl-2nd-t20i-at-hpca-cricket-stadium-today/","keywords":["Cricket","Dharamsala","HPCA Stadium Dharamsala","india vs sri lanka","Sri Lanka tour of India 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Dharamsala weather today: Sri Lanka to take on India in the remainder of the two T20Is at the HPCA stadium in Dharamsala.

It appeared the local journalists were unusually close to the players as they filed in, until it became apparent they were autograph hunters in the middle of Pakistan’s most important court. Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum, an imposing figure in his flowing black robes, appeared as though he was sitting on a throne in this large and majestic colonial red-brick building dating back to the 1860s. The hearings were in Urdu, with short English summaries every five minutes. As Inzamam-ul-Haq, one of Pakistan’s leading batters, gave ever quieter replies in Urdu, Justice Qayyum erupted. “What do you mean, who can’t remember swearing on the Koran!” he roared in English. “Take this man away and give me a good reason why I shouldn’t put him in jail!” Inzamam’s story improved sufficiently the next day to avoid jail. Following the Test series, Australia flew to Bangladesh for the first ICC Knockout, which has become the Champions Trophy, and immediately lost to India. While the squad and media were booked to stay in Bangladesh for several days before a one-day series back in Pakistan, colleague Mark Ray from the Herald and I flew back to Pakistan, where we spent several days being driven along the old Silk Route by a hotel car and driver.

As we left the shop, our driver started laughing. “What’s funny?” we asked. “They’re bookmakers taking bets on the cricket,” he replied. Returning to Peshawar, we stayed in a historic Sikh mansion converted into a guest house.

Some of the hashish blocks on display in the shops dwarfed bricks. Forms were completed by Bashir and a guard was required to travel up the Khyber Pass. His rifle seemed to be from the same colonial era as the collapsing railway tunnels; great feats of engineering through the rugged passage.

A man stood on the bullbar of each truck with the radiator cap off, constantly pouring water into it. So slowly did they move, he had time to regularly run to the back of the truck for another full container on the way to Smugglers’ Bazaar near Peshawar.

( LIVE SCORECARD ) That's a wrap to the first day's play. For a change, New Zealand had to toil hard at the Hagley Oval and would have to come up with a better show on Day 2. South Africa, unexpectedly, have gained the upper hand and they will aim to bat once and bat big. Will they succeed? Do join us to find out. The first ball will be at 3.30 am IST (10 pm GMT, previous day) but as usual, our build-up will begin in advance. Until then, it's goodbye and cheers! New Zealand didn't bowl badly. They were just countered well with discipline by the Saffas. There was some adjustment visible in the technique of the South African batters. In the first Test, they played at too many deliveries meant to be left alone. The tourists addressed that and their batters looked more assured at the crease. Massive credit goes to Sarel Erwee who had a debut to forget but showed character to bounce back and register his maiden Test ton. Aiden Markram too, who has his Test spot under the scanner, played a responsible hand and was involved in an 88-run stand to keep the Kiwis at bay in the afternoon. 'Really?' That's the expression most of us had when Dean Elgar elected to bat. Given how their batting flopped in the first Test, it was a gutsy and bold decision. 'It's important for us to front up...' this is what Dean Elgar stated at the toss and he led from the front. A wicket-less first session, a century stand for the opening wicket - South Africa's first away from home in 10 years and 34 Tests - and the touring team vindicated its skipper's decision. A session that finally brought some success for the Kiwis! They managed to remove both the set batters in Aiden Markram and Sarel Erwee and it would have been even better had Will Young not dropped Rassie van der Dussen. Even Temba Bavuma had a shaky start but survived the nervy period as a couple of edges evaded the slip cordon. All in all, with a bit of luck, New Zealand could have managed to end the day's play more brightly. Full in length around middle, angling in, Rassie flicks it off his pads to mid-wicket. That will be it - Stumps on Day 1! Delivers it on a length, around off and shooting off the surface, Rassie van der Dussen tries to defend but gets hit on the splice. Is that a run out? NOT OUT! Fuller and around off, Rassie van der Dussen gets on the front foot and scuffs his drive off the inner half to mid on. He steps out for a run but Bavuma has turned his back on him. The fielder there dives and parries it to mid off who fires a direct hit at the striker's end. New Zealand appeal, it's referred upstairs but the replays find that Rassie is easily home. In the channel outside off, Rassie offers no shot. Lands it on a length and around off, Rassie van der Dussen gets across the stumps a bit and defends it near his body. Serves it full and close to off, Rassie closes the face of his bat and works it to square leg. Last over of Day 1 coming up... Length ball, shaping away, outside off. Temba Bavuma leaves it alone. Fuller now, outside off. Temba Bavuma offers no shot to that. Touch short, shaping away, around off. Temba Bavuma taps it towards point. On a good length, around middle and swinging in. Temba Bavuma once again gets an inside edge onto his pads. Length ball, angling in, around off. Temba Bavuma leans to defend but gets an inside edge onto his pads. Good-length delivery, around middle, Temba Bavuma pushes it towards mid-wicket. He leaves his crease for a single but decides against it in the end. Length ball, around off. Rassie van der Dussen blocks it out. Pitches it up, around middle. Rassie van der Dussen taps it towards mid on.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-02/rqdaa4mo_new-zealand-afp_625x300_25_February_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PSL winners list all season final: Pakistan Super League all edition winners and runners-up","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-psl-winners-list-all-season-final-pakistan-super-league-all-edition-winners-and-runners-up/","keywords":["Cricket","Pakistan Super League","PSL","PSL 2022","PSL winners"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"PSL winners list all season final: Defending champions Multan Sultans to face either of Islamabad United or Lahore Qalandars in PSL 7 final.

When I looked out of the window, it was like a movie… children running across the streets, some of them with boxes in their hands which had pets in them. Their parents were visibly panicking and rows of cars were waiting in the queue to leave the city. I knew the war had come,” recounted Kobus Olivier, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Ukraine Cricket Federation. As tension soared in the country, the 62-year-old former club cricketer in his native South Africa who now resides in Nyvky ( a Kyiv suburb, 15 minutes from the city centre) was glued to the television catching updates. As Russia launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine, targeting cities and military bases with airstrikes or shelling, Olivier says he is better prepared than most of the other civilians.

A lot of people did not want to believe it. “Now they are near our apartment. The Russian army can enter anytime soon. I keep hearing sounds of missiles and bombs so pray for us that it all ends soon,” he told indianexpress.com on Friday morning. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Friday the Ukrainian capital “has entered into a defensive phase” as Russian troops brought the sounds of war to the city. “Shots and explosions are ringing out in some neighbourhoods. Saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us,” he told a news briefing. Meanwhile, Olivier is accompanied in his apartment by his four dogs. “They are my family and I can’t take them out now. So, all of us are here in this room,” he said. Olivier is accompanied in his apartment by his four dogs. (Instagram) In his playing days, Olivier even batted with former South Africa opener and head coach of the 2011 World Cup winning Indian side Gary Kirsten. Together they opened the batting at club level for Alma Marist. “We batted at the top for two seasons and then when I was the director of cricket at the University of Cape Town, he was the coach.” Incidentally, it was during this period that Kirsten would appear for the interview for the post of India coach. As their careers moved in different directions, Olivier moved from South Africa and fell in love with Ukraine. He stayed back in the country, working as a teacher. Simultaneously, he followed his passion of taking cricket to new frontiers, coaching youngsters. His team mainly features Indians who are in Ukraine pursuing courses. Gary Kirsten and Kobus Olivier.

The equipment for the junior sides mostly comes from Dubai. But for cricket to take root in the country, locals need to be engaged.

(Screengrab) Russia’s tryst with cricket reportedly goes back to the 1870s when the first game was played in St. Petersburg. However, it soon faded out before making a comeback in the late 1990s through expats. In 2004, the United Cricket League was registered as a legal entity, later rechristened as Cricket Russia. Now there is a cricket academy where 50 native boys, 32 native men, and 58 native girls are enrolled. Olivier wants the war to end and hopes good sense prevails so that people can live a normal life again and young children can return for a game on the field. “Maybe against Russia, it will take some time but after two years of battling Covid, people deserve a chance to go out and play,” he said.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ranji Trophy: Rohan leads Kerala’s chase with second straight hundred","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/domestic/gujarat-vs-kerala-ranji-trophy-2022-match-report-result-scores-highlights/article38439215.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["P.

Kerala ended day two at the Saurashtra Cricket Stadium on 277 for four, trailing by 111 runs. It was the third-wicket stand of 119 between Rohan (129, 171b, 16x4, 4x6) and captain Sachin Baby (53, 100b, 6x4, 1x6) that steadied the ship after opener P. Rahul (44, 51b, 8x4) and Jalaj Saxena gave away their wickets in the last 11 minutes before lunch. Rahul got carried away, rather uncharacteristically, after adding 85 for the opening wicket with Rohan inside 14 overs. He stepped out against left-arm spinner Siddharth Desai, only to be stumped. Jalaj, at the stroke of lunch, went for a cut off the same bowler and gave an outside edge to slip.

It didn’t give any in the entire second session, until Baby was bowled, through the gate, by a ball that came into the left-hander from left-arm seamer Arzan Nagwaswalla. Eight overs later, Kerala lost its fourth wicket, as Rohan, right after pulling seamer Roosh Kalaria for a boundary through mid-wicket, tried an ambitious stroke on the other side, but managed to give only a catch to deep point. Rohan, light on his feet, timed his shots beautifully and played some lovely shots all around the ground. A gorgeous cover drive off Nagwaswalla stood out, probably. Earlier, Gujarat, resuming at 334 for four, was all out for 388, a considerable improvement from 33 for four.

India, on the other hand, have won 99 matches from a total of 157 matches played so far. India, thus, have a higher success rate in terms of win percentage, as compared to Pakistan. With the 2nd T20I of a three-match series against Sri Lanka in Dharamshala on Saturday, India have the chance to join Pakistan to become only the second team with 100 or more T20I wins. Both Pakistan and India are some distance ahead of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, who are placed third, fourth and fifth, respectively, in the list.

Moreover, if India manage to win the 2nd T20I against Sri Lanka, it will be India's 16th win against them.

The 32-year-old left-hander's sparkling 108 on day one of the second Test at Hagley Oval helped the Proteas to a position of strength at 238 for three at Stumps after captain Dean Elgar won the toss and sent his team in to bat. It was a stunning turnaround for both team and player, with Erwee managing only 10 runs on debut last week as South Africa crashed to its second-worst defeat in Tests in the first meeting at Christchurch. ALSO READ : After Ashes cakewalk, Cummins prepares for slow grind in Pakistan It was also a day that Erwee could scarcely have dreamt of while in \"dark places\" two years ago. \"I was probably a phone call away from calling it quits,\" Erwee told reporters. \"But my parents kind of picked me up and (I) saw a sports performance psychologist and we worked through it daily. \"It was a hard slog, if I can call it that, to try to get motivated again, to kind of give my best after wanting to give up.\" Erwee, who bats for the Durban-based Dolphins and has racked up nearly 100 first class matches, has had to be patient. He was called into his first Test squad at the end of 2020 for the Sri Lanka series but missed out on a debut. He might have remained uncapped this tour if Dolphins teammate Keegan Petersen had not contracted COVID-19. With fellow-opener Elgar demanding fight from his batters after their twin capitulations in the series-opener, Erwee answered his captain's call on Friday. He anchored its 111-run opening partnership, South Africa's biggest on foreign soil in 10 years, and shared in an 88-run stand with Aiden Markram for the second wicket to frustrate world champion New Zealand.

The 32-year-old lefthander's sparkling 108 on day one of the second Test at Hagley Oval helped the Proteas to a position of strength at 238 for three at stumps after captain Dean Elgar won the toss and sent his team in to bat. It was a stunning turnaround for both team and player, with Erwee managing only 10 runs on debut last week as South Africa crashed to their second-worst defeat in Tests in the first meeting at Christchurch. It was also a day that Erwee could scarcely have dreamt of while in “dark places” two years ago. “I was probably a phone call away from calling it quits,” Erwee told reporters. “But my parents kind of picked me up and (I) saw a sports performance psychologist and we worked through it daily.” \"It was a hard slog, if I can call it that, to try to get motivated again, to kind of give my best after wanting to give up.\" Erwee, who bats for the Durban-based Dolphins and has racked up nearly 100 first class matches, has had to be patient. He was called into his first Test squad at the end of 2020 for the Sri Lanka series but missed out on a debut. He might have remained uncapped this tour if Dolphins team mate Keegan Petersen had not contracted COVID-19. With fellow opener Elgar demanding fight from his batters after their twin capitulations in the series-opener, Erwee answered his captain's call on Friday. He anchored their 111-run opening partnership, South Africa's biggest on foreign soil in 10 years, and shared in an 88-run stand with Aiden Markram for the second wicket to frustrate world champions New Zealand. The runs dried up when he hit the 90s, and he had to grind through five consecutive maiden overs before pulling Neil Wagner to the fence to bring up his hundred just before tea. He ripped off his helmet and punched the air in celebration, soaking up warm applause from a small, COVID-capped crowd that included his New Zealand-based sister.

Adeel Raza, the spin bowler, then led the way in win number seven, his 4-8 from just nine balls helping bowl out Swiss side Olten for 59. Carlton won by eight wickets in the end. Carlton will have to finish off the job without former Scotland rugby international Hugo Southwell, though, as he is heading home early to make sure he gets back to host hospitality at the rugby at BT Murrayfield on Saturday. On Wednesday in the T10 event, two wickets apiece from captain Ally Evans, Shiv Gupta, Umair Mohammed and Angus Beattie and then 29 runs from Ali Shah saw Carlton home versus Brescia. In that one 82 all out played 86-5, while they then bowled Zeytinburnu out for just 22 in a nine wicket triumph.

Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer hit fifties before a combined bowling performance helped India thrash Sri Lanka by 62 runs in the first T20I. \"Once I got going, I wanted to play my shots and keep the intent going, just wanted to play my shots. He (Ishan Kishan) wasn't able to time (in the middle overs), was losing patience. I just told him to take his time, look for twos and threes. Our plan was to hit the pockets, initially, that's what we did, and things came out pretty well for us. Coming from Kolkata, this ground had different dimensions,\" said Shreyas Iyer in a post-match presentation. \"I wasn't thinking a lot, thought 180 was a good total, was just looking to watch the ball closely and then played my shots. I had already put my hand up (for a bowl). Around the 16th over when he (Rohit) went it he had already told Bumrah these are the bowlers who need to bowl. I tried to bribe Bumrah but it didn't work for me (laughs),\" he added. With this 62-run win over Sri Lanka, India took a 1-0 lead in the three-match T20I series. Both teams will now lock horns in the second T20I on Saturday. Chasing 200, Sri Lanka got off to the worst possible start as the side two wickets inside three overs. Bhuvneshwar removed both openers Pathum Nissanka and Kamil Mishara as Sri Lanka struggled in the chase. Sri Lanka reach the 50-run mark in the tenth over but lost two more wickets. Charith Asalanka did hit a fifty for the visitors but the asking rate was too much to ask for as Sri Lanka lost momentum. Sri Lanka needed 102 runs in the last four overs and the visitors were completely outplayed in the first T20I as they lost the match by a considerable margin.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Captain Cummins defends Pakistan call - NEWS.com.au","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0L2F1c3NpZS10ZXN0LWNhcHRhaW4tcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtZGVmZW5kcy1wYWtpc3Rhbi1jYWxsLWFzLWlwbC1kcmF3cy1uZWFyZXIvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS9kNWU4MzM0ODkzNmMxOTI5Y2RlOTM4OTQzMWRkNjZjNdIBnwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0L2F1c3NpZS10ZXN0LWNhcHRhaW4tcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtZGVmZW5kcy1wYWtpc3Rhbi1jYWxsLWFzLWlwbC1kcmF3cy1uZWFyZXIvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS9kNWU4MzM0ODkzNmMxOTI5Y2RlOTM4OTQzMWRkNjZjNT9hbXA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Captain Cummins defends Pakistan call  NEWS.com.auHat-tricks, heroes & heartache: Australia's Tests in Pakistan  cricket.com.au'Biggest league in the world, nothing can come close': Ex-Pakistan spinner thanks IPL franchises for 'immense gesture'  Hindustan TimesPAK v AUS: Mohammad Nawaz Out Of The Test Series against Australia; Naseem Shah, Sarfaraz Ahmed Named Traveling Reserves  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-25 08:20:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australian Cricket Legend Rod Marsh Suffers Heart Attack","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/australian-cricket-legend-rod-marsh-suffers-heart-attack-580038","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Marsh played 97 first-class games for Western Australia with WA Cricket CEO Christina Matthews also wishing him a “full and speedy recovery”.","content":"Sydney: Australian cricket legend Rod Marsh has been admitted to a hospital in Queensland after suffering a serious heart attack.

The same could happen on Saturday if Gaekwad is able to regain full fitness.Such is Rohit's class that he has not taken any time to find his rhythm after coming from an injury break.

India were forced to look in the mirror after their early exit from the T20 World Cup last year but four months later, they look a transformed unit with a bunch of youngsters being tried out in various positions and roles. It is still early days but the Rohit Sharma-led side has already figured out the core group of players that will travel to Australia for the World Cup Down Under later this year. Young opener Ishan Kishan got a massive dose of confidence in the series opener on Thursday after his struggles against the West Indies. Finding strike rotation tough in the preceding series, Kishan was able to overcome that weakness against the Sri Lankan bowlers besides flaunting the strokeplay he is known for in the IPL. There is no time to settle in a T20 game and India have finally realised that, allowing them to post 180 plus totals regularly. If it wasn't for Ruturaj Gaekwad's wrist injury, he could have opened with Kishan and Rohit would have dropped himself down the order like he did against the West Indies. The same could happen on Saturday if Gaekwad is able to regain full fitness. Such is Rohit's class that he has not taken any time to find his rhythm after coming from an injury break. He looked in sublime touch en route to his 44 but must be disappointed to not have carried on for longer. Shreyas Iyer made merry at number three in the absence of the rested Virat Kohli and would be aiming to repeat that for the rest of the series. When a full strength India take the field next, he might not find a place in the playing eleven and therefore, he needs to make the most of the opportunities that come his way.

Brisbane-based Khawaja had been contracted with the Thunder for next summer’s Big Bash League tournament but with a second child on the way, he said remaining close to family was his top priority. Khawaja has been on the Thunder’s books since the first Big Bash League tournament in the summer of 2011/12 and served as the side’s captain in BBL|11 when he returned from Ashes duty.

Start your free trial now > The 35-year-old, who will travel to Pakistan with the Australian Test team in the coming days, said he was shattered to be leaving the Thunder. “I hate talking about the decision I’ve made,” said Khawaja. “It’s the toughest call I’ve made as a cricketer because Sydney Thunder, the players, the coaching and support staff, and the club’s supporters mean so much to me. “However, it is for family reasons, and while I’m leaving people who know me realise a big part of my heart will always remain with Thunder. “I don’t want people to think I’ve cut my ties with Sydney Thunder because I’ll always care about the club; the players; the entire organisation. “A part of that is because I believe I helped shape Thunder from the start. In many ways Sydney Thunder is, to me, like a baby I’ve watched grow and develop.” A source at the Thunder said the club was unaware whether Khawaja would seek a contract at the Brisbane Heat for BBL|12. The BBL is currently in an embargo period, meaning clubs are not yet permitted to negotiate with rival players as the dust settles on BBL|11. Michael Klinger, Cricket NSW’s head of male cricket said the Thunder was sad to say goodbye to one of its favourite sons. “It’s disappointing because Usman is such a well-respected member of Thunder,” said Klinger. “Sydney Thunder and CNSW definitely wanted him to stay, and we offered a highly competitive contract. “However, we appreciate Usman’s decision has been made for his family, and we respect and support that. “Usman leaves Sydney Thunder with our best wishes for the future. He’s a foundation player who leaves a legacy as a great competitor and player, a strong leader, and someone who actively helped Thunder become the club he always believed it could be.” Khawaja made a swashbuckling return to the Australian side in the fourth Ashes Test after Travis Head was struck down with Covid-19. He was named player of the match after hitting two centuries at the SCG and was moved to the top of the order for the final Ashes Test. Earlier in the week, interim Australian head coach Andrew McDonald said Khawaja was “a fair chance” to retain his spot opening the batting for the first Test of the series against Pakistan. The tour, Australia’s first to the country since 1998, could well turn out to be career milestone for the Pakistan-born Khawaja. Khawaja thanked the Thunder’s fans for their support during his time at the club. “I’ve said for a long time that from what I’ve seen, Sydney Thunder has the greatest supporters because even in those first few years where we struggled we had crowds packed into the ground, supporting us and giving us love,” he said. “I don’t think any team has a fan base that is so loyal, and the players know that . . . I thank them all for everything because they brought so much to the experience.”","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5838339/d44e825daeebca20fb964d95157d370cf933d5cb-16x9-x1y0w2000h1125.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
