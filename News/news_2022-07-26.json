The members of the Indian ODI team chose to chill out and have fun ahead of the third and final ODI on Wednesday (July 27). The team took a bizarre ride in Tobago in a mini-van where the players – in their casuals – were seen having a blast. The players looked happy and upbeat going on to reflect the positive atmosphere in the group. This video which is already going viral will surely make the fans happy. Here is the video that is going viral ahead of the final ODI… #TeamIndia l #IndvsWI l #WIvIND #3rdODI pic.twitter.com/upfD0jPzRA — Cricket Gyaan (@AnmolMa74473063) July 26, 2022 With talismanic batter Virat Kohli rested for the series, Shreyas Iyer has made the most of his opportunities of batting at number three in the series, scoring back-to-back fifties and insisting that batting in top-order is fun. “I was really happy to get what score I got, but really unhappy with the way I was dismissed. I thought I could have taken the team through easily. I was setting up the total, but was very unfortunate with the wicket. Hopefully, I get to score a century in the next game,” Iyer said after the second ODI . “It’s (number three) one of the best positions in ODIs as you go in at a tough situation if the openers have fallen. Then you have to see off the new ball and build an innings. If the openers have a really good partnership, you get to carry forward that momentum and see to it that run rate is maintained. It’s a fun position to bat at and I really enjoy it,” said Iyer in the post-match press conference. Asked about his partnership with Samson, Iyer remarked, “We lost two back-to-back wickets. We were 60 for 3 (79/3), and from there, we had to rebuild. Sanju came in and he obviously showed a lot of intent. I was already batting. I had faced around 20 balls and was batting on 15. “I knew what I was going to do, and Sanju at the same time, he faced a few balls, and then he went after the spinners. He hit them for two sixes, and suddenly, the momentum shifted towards us. From there onwards, we built on the partnership and carried forward the momentum towards us,” he added. Iyer was pleased that his hard work in net sessions with head coach Rahul Dravid and batting coach Vikram Rathour was being rewarded in the form of back-to-back fifties in the ongoing series. “I have been working with them (Dravid and Rathour) for many years. We talk about technique and temperament on a match-to-match basis. Situations change and when we have team discussions, everyone talks.” (with IANS inputs)","pubDate":"2022-07-26 02:46:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Allan Border addresses Travis Head's woes on subcontinent tracks and advises him to work on his technique","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/allan-border-addresses-travis-head-s-woes-on-subcontinent-tracks-and-advises-him-to-work-on-his-technique-2022-07-26-794907","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Australian cricket team has been faring quite well under their newly appointed skipper Pat Cummins.

What raised many eyeballs was their debacle in a single session when they were taking on Sri Lanka in the second Test match at Galle. Amongst the likes of David Warner, Usman Khwaja, Marnus Labuschagne, and Steven Smith, it was Travis Head who seemed to struggle endlessly against spin bowling. Head who was the highest run-getter with 357 in the 2021-22 Ashes series now finds himself in a rough spot. He was awarded the 'Player of the Series' when England toured Australia for Test matches, but after that, he failed to contribute to the team's success. The Aussie batsman just managed to score 91 odd runs at an average of 15.17 in his recent tours to Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

With Australia scheduled to tour India for the Border-Gavaskar trophy, the Aussie batsmen must put their technique in place to tackle spin better feels Border. \" \", said the Aussie legend. Allan Border further cited the example of Matthew Hayden who scored 549 runs, including two hundreds and a double hundred on Indian tracks in 2001, and said Head needs to put in a lot of work against spin if wants to be equally successful in spinning conditions as he everywhere else around the globe.","pubDate":"2022-07-26 02:34:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Axar Patel spells trouble, India win","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/axar-patel-spells-trouble-india-win-415744","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Port of Spain, July 25Axar Patel smashed a whirlwind unbeaten 35-ball 64, his maiden One-day International 50, to steer India to a series-clinching two-wicket win over West Indies in a tense second match here on Sunday.Set a stiff target of 312, the visitors were tottering at 205/5 in 38.4 overs but Patel rescued India with his six-hitting prowess, taking the visitors home with two balls to spare.1 Axar smashed five sixes and three boundaries, which is now the most by an India batter at No.7 or lower in a successful ODI chase.

Black Caps coach Gary Stead is using the tour to help finalise his squad for the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia this October. “We are getting closer and closer to finalising the squad for the T20 World Cup just on the horizon,” Stead told reporters on Monday. “For Kane, Trent, Tim and Devon (Conway), this will be the first time they have played white ball cricket for New Zealand since last year’s T20 World Cup and tour to India - so this trip will be important for them.” A tight schedule means New Zealand will play six matches in 11 days, with three T20 matches in Jamaica and three ODIs in Barbados. Stead said the squad is relishing the prospect of taking on the West Indies at home. “It’s always exciting to be heading somewhere you’ve not been in a while and I know this group can’t wait for the challenge of taking on the West Indies in the Caribbean,” he added. “We also have players such as Michael and Finn who are relatively new to the international stage but have really put their hands up for selection when given opportunities.” New Zealand squad: Kane Williamson (capt), Finn Allen, Trent Boult, Michael Bracewell, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Jimmy Neesham, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee.","pubDate":"2022-07-26 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Aussie cricket great hits out over David Warner saga: 'Get on with it'","link":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/cricket-2022-david-warner-australia-leadership-ban-allan-border-criticism-223829638.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-25 22:38:29","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-07/68b6dca0-0c68-11ed-bc63-8068aa235a7a","source_id":"yahoo","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket Scotland: Damning racism report can lead to a brighter future for the sport","link":"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/other-sport/cricket-scotland-damning-racism-report-can-lead-to-a-brighter-future-for-the-sport-3781515","keywords":["Other Sport","Sport"],"creator":["Matthew Elder"],"video_url":null,"description":"So, Scottish sport’s worst kept secret is out – Cricket Scotland is institutionally racist.","content":"comments From the moment Stewart Harris, sportscotland’s Chief Executive said in a press release in November 2021 that: “it is clear something must be done about the problem of racism in Scottish cricket,” there was only ever going to be one outcome. This was before Plan4Sport’s independent review had even been commissioned, as were the public admissions of guilt and apology from the former Board of Cricket Scotland. Perhaps, therefore, no-one should be surprised at the findings but what may have taken some aback is the extent of the problem: 448 examples of institutional racism, of the 31 indicators Cricket Scotland failed to meet the standard in 29, 68 individual concerns have been referred for further review. The sorry list goes on. Yet, there is light at the end of the tunnel, not least of which is that Cricket Scotland has undertaken to implement the recommendations contained in the report as a matter of priority. In her summary of the findings Louise Tideswell, Plan4Sport’s Managing Director noted: “But I also want to add that whilst the governance and leadership practices of the organisation have been institutionally racist, the same should not be said of cricket in Scotland. There are many outstanding clubs and individuals delivering local programmes which truly engage with diverse communities.” There was also significant support for the findings of the report with many clubs taking to social media to air their views. Western Premier champions Clydesdale typified the response in tweeting: “the racism review may be a difficult read but the need to move the game into a safe, fair place for all remains paramount. We will continue to promote inclusion in the game.” Meanwhile, Majid Haq who was one of the first players to speak out about the problem of racism in Scottish cricket, is cautiously optimistic that the report may lead to a brighter future. He said: “I’m relieved today is over and the report has vindicated what I said all along. “More than that I hope that the recommendations will lead to a fairer playing field for all and that the current and next generation of Asian players will get a better chance. “They always used to say you had to be twice as good as a white player to have any chance of getting in the team and that should never be the case. “I’d also like to see Scottish cricket run by good human beings – normal, decent people that you can go and speak to and know that you’ll get the support you need. “It’s brilliant to see Saffy (Sharif) and Hamza (Tahir) in the men’s team and Abtaha (Maqsood) in the women’s team all doing so well but there should be more. “If there is a good legacy to come out of what Qasim and I have done it will be that young Asian players get better opportunities. “But time will tell.” If Haq’s final remark cast a little doubt as to the long-term picture for Scottish cricket, the immediate future is clear, at least for the senior men’s team who tomorrow will take on New Zealand in the first of two T20Is at the Grange. Richie Berrington’s side also go head-to-head with the Black Caps in a single ODI on Sunday with the opportunity to put a much-needed smile back on the game which, as Plan4Sport’s report acknowledged, is loved by so many.

At the age of just 18 years and 280 days, he became the first teenager to score a ton in the shortest format of cricket. Before Gustav's brilliant knock, Afghanistan’s Hazratullah Zazai was the youngest player to hit a 100. He had smashed a century at the age of 20 years and 337 days in the year 2019. He is also the first cricketer from France to cross the 100-run mark. In his second T20I, Gustav hit 100 off 58 deliveries before getting run out on a score of 109. The France opener hammered five boundaries and nine maximums. This means almost half of the total runs scored by him were by hitting sixes. In his first ever T20 International, the 18-year-old had scored a 54-ball 76 against the Czech Republic. However, Switzerland registered a one-wicket win in the last ball of the match. Earlier in the match, France had won the toss and had opted to bat first. They set a target of 158 runs for the opponents.

Consultancy firm Plan4Sport was commissioned by sportscotland in December after former Scotland players Majid Haq and Qasim Sheikh made claims of racism in the wake of revelations on Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After almost 1,000 people engaged with the review, the conclusions were damning. Of the two criteria the sporting organisation did pass, there were partial failings. From an anonymous survey, 122 people reported experiencing racial discrimination and 49 people reported experiencing discrimination on grounds of religion or belief. Most (62 per cent) of the survey respondents had experienced, seen or received reports of racism or other forms of discrimination. From conversations, 68 individual concerns have been referred for further investigation, including 31 allegations of racism against 15 people, two clubs and one regional association. Some cases have been referred to Police Scotland, some to Children First and others to Cricket Scotland. No other details were given, but someone has already appeared in court. The allegations include racial abuse, use of inappropriate language, favouritism towards white children from public schools and a lack of a transparent selection process. The review also found a lack of any diversity or anti-racist training, no consistent process for handling racist incidents with people who did raise issues “sidelined or ignored”, a lack of diversity from board level to the coaching workforce and within the talent pathway, and a lack of transparency in the selection process. The managing director of Plan4Sport, Louise Tideswell, declared it was clear the “governance and leadership practices of Cricket Scotland have been institutionally racist”. “I am shocked that a sport can meet 29 of the 31 indicators,” she said. “The reality is that the leadership of the organisation failed to see the problems and, in failing to do so, enabled a culture of racially aggravated micro-aggressions to develop. “But I also want to add that, whilst the governance and leadership practices of the organisation have been institutionally racist, the same should not be said for cricket in Scotland. \"There are many outstanding clubs and individuals delivering local programmes which truly engage with diverse communities.” Although no details were given about individual cases in the report, the public accounts of Haq and Sheikh give context to the findings. Sheikh never played for Scotland again after the age of 25 despite being made to apologise for claiming that race was a factor in selection. Now 37 and with his international career long gone, Sheikh feels he was dropped for two poor performances soon after hitting consecutive centuries for his country. Haq is the nation’s leading wicket-taker and played more than 200 internationals, but is not in Scotland’s hall of fame. He saw his international career end after sending a tweet giving his opinion that race was a factor in selection when he was dropped at the 2015 World Cup. Haq was sent home, suspended for three months and claimed he was denied support for mental health problems despite feeling suicidal. He has outlined a number of examples of being the subject of racial and religious discrimination throughout his Scotland career and made 10 referrals to the review team. The Changing the Boundaries report made three key recommendations. Cricket Scotland, whose entire board stepped down on Sunday, will be taken under special measures by sportscotland until at least October 2023 while diversity ratios have been suggested for the composition of the new board. The second key recommendation is that one of Scotland’s five regional associations, the Western District Cricket Union, is placed in special measures by Cricket Scotland, which has also been encouraged to address the backlog in referrals with any resulting investigations to be undertaken by a third party with suitable expertise. The chief executive of sportscotland, Stewart Harris, described the findings as “deeply concerning and in some cases shocking”. He said: “As the national agency for sport, we will work with and support Cricket Scotland to help change the culture of Scottish cricket and that must now be the focus. “There has been some progress in recent months but we need to see more steps being taken to address the issues raised and importantly that includes the referrals.” Cricket Scotland interim chief executive Gordon Arthur, who started in his role earlier this month, issued a “heartfelt apology” to the victims of racism and other discrimination, although he stopped short of apologising publicly to Haq and Sheikh until the referral processes are complete. Mr Arthur added: “It’s clear that significant cultural change must happen and it must happen quickly. “The immediate priority must be to get the independent referral process agreed and implemented so the investigations into the referrals can start.”","pubDate":"2022-07-25 17:45:13","image_url":"https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjY4MDA5OWM2LWU4ZWYtNGM5ZS05NWI2LTI1YzkxNzYxNGRhNDpmZjBkNDhhNy00OGI0LTRjOTgtOTVjOS01NDVhZWNiY2IwOGI=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"scotsman","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘People don’t even know my name’: Rahul Dravid recalls funny incident after first century in school cricket","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rahul-dravid-recalls-funny-incident-after-first-century-in-school-cricket-8051136/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-25 17:27:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WI vs IND: Unhappy with my dismissal, says Shreyas Iyer after failing to convert twin fifties","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/wi-vs-ind-unhappy-with-my-dismissal-says-shreyas-iyer-after-failing-to-convert-twin-fifties-755052","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"Shreyas Iyer has scored two back-to-back fiftiesIndia defeated WI by 2 wickets on SundayThe dead rubber third ODI is on July 27","content":"WI vs IND: Unhappy with my dismissal, says Shreyas Iyer after failing to convert twin fifties Shreyas Iyer has said he is \"unhappy\" with the way he got out in the second ODI against the West Indies before adding he would like to convert his fifties in the coming games.

However, the Mumbai batsman is not very happy about not being able to convert either of the knocks but is looking to do so in the third and final ODI. \"It [No. 3] is a fun position to bat at, and I really enjoy it. It is one of the best positions to bat because you go into a very tough situation if the wicket falls in early. You go in and you have to see the new ball and then build your innings. Also if the openers have got into a really good partnership, then you have to go carry forward that momentum, take it on from where they have left and see to it that the run rate is maintained,\" said Iyer at the post-match conference. Iyer now has batted at No. 3 in the ODIs five times, scoring 279 runs at an average of 55.80, including four half-centuries. He has one ODI century to his name, which came while batting at No. 4. \"Really fortunate to get to consecutive half-centuries. But I should have converted it into a century. You don't get such kind of start every time in international cricket. The more you convert your fifties into hundreds, the better it is. Today was a golden opportunity for me to convert my innings. But at the same time as long as the team is winning, I am happy to contribute. \"I was really happy to get to what score I got today. But was unhappy with the way I got dismissed. I thought that I could have taken the team through easily and set up the total, but I was very unfortunate with the way I got out. Hopefully, I will be able to score a century in the next one,\" added Iyer, who made his ODI debut in 2017. On being asked about his partnership with Samson, Iyer said it was a \"crucial\" one considering India had lost a couple of wickets in quick succession. \"It was a crucial partnership. We lost two back-to-back wickets. We were 60 for 3 [79/3], and from there, we had to rebuild. Sanju came in and obviously showed a lot of intent. I was already batting. I had faced around 20 balls and was batting on 15. I knew what I was going to do, and Sanju at the same time, he faced a few balls, and then he went after the spinners. He hit them for two sixes, and suddenly, the momentum shifted towards us. From there onwards, we built on the partnership and carried forward the momentum,\" Iyer said. Samson and Iyer put up 99 runs for the fourth wicket before the former was trapped leg before wicket by Alzarri Joseph in the 33rd over. Rahul sir was getting tensed towards the end, reveals Shreyas Iyer The 27-year-old Iyer also revealed that tension arose in the dressing room during the final stages of the game and head coach Rahul Dravid constantly sent messages to the players on the field. \"It was fun, to be honest. We were all sitting together, and Rahul sir was getting very tensed; he was consistently passing on the message. I think a lot of players showed really good emotions out there and were very calm and composed in the pressure situation. And since we have played so many matches lately, I think we have already seen all these emotions. \"It was just another game for us. I think we did pretty well, especially Axar, the way he finished off today. It was an outstanding knock,\" added Iyer. Meanwhile, Iyer also spoke about batting coach Vikram Rathour and how net sessions with the latter have been helping him. \"Hard work off the field always pays off. This is the reflection of what you do off the field. I am working hard because wickets and conditions are changing frequently, and you have to stay fit and keep motivating yourself. My mindset is that I will do my work and try to control the controllable,\" Iyer who has 12 50-plus ODI scores in 26 innings said. The dead rubber third ODI between India and West Indies is scheduled to be played on Wednesday (July 27) at Queen's Park Oval, Trinidad. After this, the five-match T20I series will go underway, starting from July 29. For the T20I series, Rohit Sharma will return to lead the side. Other senior players including Hardik Pandya and Rishabh Pant will also return.","pubDate":"2022-07-25 17:27:05","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/07/25/500x300_1304747-srey.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mumbai Cricket Association calls meeting to discuss major changes to constitution","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mumbai-cricket-association-calls-meeting-to-discuss-major-changes-to-constitution-8051171/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":["Devendra Pandey"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-25 17:20:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Fue el primer campeón peruano y el club más antiguo de América: ¿qué es del Lima Cricket?","link":"https://larepublica.pe/deportes/2022/07/25/lima-cricket-and-football-club-que-paso-con-el-primer-campeon-peruano-y-quinto-club-mas-antiguo-del-mundo-liga-1-futbol-peruano-ntlr/","keywords":["Deportes"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"El Decano de América logró 2 ligas peruanas y un subcampeonato.

Tales son los casos de Alianza Lima, Universitario de Deportes, Sporting Cristal, Cienciano, FBC Melgar, Sport Boys, entre otros. Sin embargo, el deporte rey tiene un origen, no solo en nuestro país, sino también en el continente, y Lima Cricket and Football Club es el claro ejemplo. Los cricketeros son el equipo más antiguo de América y quinto a nivel mundial. Fundado el 9 de septiembre de 1859 en Lima, el también llamado Decano de América tiene la marca imborrable de ser el primer campeón del fútbol peruano, galardón que obtuvo en 1912. Además, también disputaron el primer encuentro oficial del campeonato nacional en el que derrotaron por 6-1 al Sport Vitarte. Fueron protagonistas los años venideros hasta que en 1916 la institución decidió dejar el fútbol para priorizar otros deportes. El equipo peruano fue fundado por una comunidad inglesa que radicaba en nuestro país. En un inicio, era conocido como Lima Cricket Club, pero en 1885 fue fusionado con Lima Lawn Tennis Club, por lo que pasó a llamarse Lima Cricket and Tennis Club. No fue hasta 1906 que se le conoce como Lima Cricket and Football Club. Lima Cricket en la inauguración del campo Santa Sofía.

It found that governing body Cricket Scotland failed in 29 out of 31 indicators of institutional racism set out by a consultancy firm leading the investigation. Moreover, it only partially passed the other two tests and there were 448 examples of institutional racism. The entire cricket board of Scotland resigned on Sunday ahead of the publication of the report. Scotland's Majid Haq and his former teammate, Qasim Sheikh had made allegations of racism which sparked the investigation. Hundreds of people came forward to recount their experiences as part of the investigation. The allegations include racial abuse, the use of inappropriate language, favoritism toward white children from public schools, and a lack of a transparent selection process. The review also found a lack of any diversity or anti-racist training. It stated that there is no consistent process for handling racist incidents by the board and the people who did raise issues are “sidelined or ignored.\" The consultancy firm leading the review said it was clear that the “governance and leadership practices of Cricket Scotland have been institutionally racist.” “The reality is that the leadership of the organization failed to see the problems and, in failing to do so, enabled a culture of racially aggravated micro-aggressions to develop,\" said Louise Tideswell, the firm's managing director. Stewart Harris, chief executive of sportscotland, described the findings of the report as “deeply concerning and in some cases shocking” and said it should “act as a wake-up call for all of Scottish sport.” “Racism is a societal problem,” he said, “and it is no longer good enough to simply be non-racist, Scottish sport must now be actively anti-racist.” Cricket Scotland interim CEO Gordon Arthur, who started in his role this month, issued what he described as a “heartfelt apology” to the victims of racism and other discrimination. “We hope the report provides them with some reassurance that their voices have been heard, and we are sorry this did not happen sooner,” Arthur said. “This report is a watershed moment for cricket in Scotland and taking its recommendations forward is the top priority. It's clear that significant cultural change must happen and it must happen quickly.” However, Arthur refused to give personal apologies to Majid and Qasim.

Jones 🤝 Lees 50 partnership, solid start. #ForTheNorth pic.twitter.com/unHm3rqwwO — Durham Cricket (@DurhamCricket) July 25, 2022 5h ago 12.18 Make that five down for Yorkshire! Matthew Waite is caught at third slip by Joe Weatherley off Kyle Abbott for 4. Anything Derbyshire can do, they can do, er, worse? 5h ago 12.14 It’s not just New Road where wickets are tumbling. Yorkshire are 25-4, and Mohammad Abbas has taken three of those for just seven runs. Meanwhile, Gloucestershire have trotted along to 61-1 at against Northants at Cheltenham, and Essex are an eminently sensible 39-0 off 102 balls after winning the toss at Chelmsford. And Lancashire and Kent have spent the morning playing card games, or Candy Crush, or reading multi-volume sci-fi novel series – whatever it is cricketers do when it rains these days. 6h ago 12.00 There’ll be no play before lunch at Old Trafford, say the umpires, and an early lunch will be taken at 12.30pm. Which always makes me think: aren’t they just going to start eating their sarnies now anyway? Or do professional cricketers have more restraint than the rest of us? I mean, if someone even mentions lunch, I start getting hungry. I’m hungry even typing this. News from the umpires, there will be no play before lunch - which will be taken early at 12.30pm. 🤞 for an improvement this afternoon! 🌹 #RedRoseTogether https://t.co/25yykNXNOu — Lancashire Cricket (@lancscricket) July 25, 2022 6h ago 11.48 But first this : Derbyshire are really having a time of it against Worcestershire. Dillon Pennington has been on fire in his opening spell, completing a second two-wicket over of the morning to leave the visitors 14 for 5… They’ve recovered slightly since then. They’re now 24 for 5. Mohammad Hasnain has just taken over from Joe Leach but I’d wager Pennington’s not coming off any time soon. 6h ago 11.40 Just seen that the Cricket Scotland racism report has been released although I haven’t managed to navigate the website to find more than the official responses to it from the interim CEO, Gordon Arthur. More when I can figure it out… Plan4Sport, the independent team that has led the review into racism in Scottish cricket, has published its report and recommendations.

The entire board of Cricket Scotland resigned on Sunday in advance of the report’s publication and released a joint statement apologising “to everyone who has experienced racism, or any other form of discrimination, in cricket in Scotland”. But Aamer Anwar, the lawyer who represents Majid Haq and Qasim Sheikh, the two former internationals whose descriptions of the discrimination they experienced during their playing careers prompted the report, said the apology was “too little and too late” and that the board’s resignation was “the cowardly option, meaning that today there is nobody to answer for their failure of leadership”. ‘Truly sorry’: Cricket Scotland board resigns before report into racism Read more Stewart Harris, chief executive of Sportscotland, who have been urged to place Cricket Scotland in special measures while they undergo a complete reorganisation, described the report’s conclusions as “deeply concerning and in some cases shocking” while Gordon Arthur, who took over as Cricket Scotland’s interim chief executive earlier this month, pledged on Monday to “address the past, repair the sport and ensure history does not repeat itself”. Following the review, 31 allegations of racism against 15 different people, two clubs and one regional association have been referred for continued investigation. Some allegations have been shared with Police Scotland as potential hate crimes, and others may be referred to the police in future. In addition, many participants who had “clearly witnessed or experienced racism” have chosen not to proceed with the process. In 325 responses to an anonymous survey, a further 122 examples of people seeing, hearing or being made aware of racism were detailed and another 49 of prejudice on the grounds of religion. Of those 325 participants, 34% had personally experienced racial discrimination and 62% were aware of specific incidents of racism, inequality or discrimination. In addition to prejudice on the grounds of race, gender, religion and nationality, the report’s authors also found grounds for “concern over the perceived bias towards the recruitment of players from public schools over state schools”. Opaque selection processes for national teams at all levels was a constant issue, while the board of Cricket Scotland is described as being “only concerned about the men’s national squad and [having] no interest or oversight on any other part of cricket”. Louise Tideswell, managing director of Plan4Sport, and Stewart Harris, chief executive of Sportscotland. Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA The report, compiled by the charity Plan4Sport, found that not only were Cricket Scotland not trusted to manage allegations of racism effectively, several allegations “had not been investigated at all”. Meanwhile some of those who raised concerns had been victimised or forced out of the organisation completely. One volunteer within the Western District Cricket Union – whose area covers half the population of Scotland, and who the report also recommends should be placed in special measures – said “it was very difficult to work in West Scotland and not witness racism”. The managing director of Plan4Sport, Louise Tideswell, declared it was clear that the “governance and leadership practices of Cricket Scotland have been institutionally racist”. She added: “Over the review period we have seen the bravery of so many people coming forward to share their stories which had clearly impacted on their lives … The reality is that the leadership of the organisation failed to see the problems and, in failing to do so, enabled a culture of racially aggravated micro-aggressions to develop.” In a statement delivered on behalf of Haq and Sheikh, Anwar said: “Today’s report is the most devastating verdict of racism to be delivered on any sporting institution in the United Kingdom. Scottish cricket owes a debt of gratitude to Majid and Qasim for never giving up. It is they who have been a catalyst for change, it is too late for their careers, but they did this for future generations.” Haq is Scotland’s all-time leading wicket-taker and made 209 appearances, and after he made an allegation of discrimination during the 2015 World Cup he was sent home and never picked again. Sheikh was also not picked again, aged 27, after in 2012 publicly questioning why he was not being selected for the national team. “It should never be normal for a young person to be made to feel worthless, to be dehumanised in a sport they love, to be brainwashed into thinking it’s their fault,” said Anwar, “but that sadly is the brutal story of hundreds of young people of colour who played cricket in Scotland.”","pubDate":"2022-07-25 15:34:16","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf21d5f0ed3e252ad99070b4390fe2a413ef474/0_70_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6a4ac12bf785046b41dfc08f4e69c484","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"I had love to play a Test match over in India, I love watching cricket over there: Australia spinner Ashton Agar","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/i-had-love-to-play-a-test-match-over-in-india-i-love-watching-cricket-over-there-australia-spinner-ashton-agar-1979871-2022-07-25?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"I had love to play a Test match over in India: Australia spinner Ashton Agar","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-25 15:28:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Report Finds Cricket Scotland \"Institutionally Racist\"","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/report-finds-cricket-scotland-institutionally-racist-3192310","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"An independent review into allegations of racism at Cricket Scotland has found the governance and leadership practices of the organisation to be \"institutionally racist\"","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-25 13:51:17","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-11/h6i1pnfg_cricket-bat-ball-afp_625x300_20_November_20.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Barry Larkin helping to launch new baseball league in Dubai","link":"https://www.wcpo.com/sports/baseball/barry-larkin-helping-to-launch-new-baseball-league-in-dubai","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cincinnati Reds legend Barry Larkin has teamed up with a local firm to launch a new international baseball league in Dubai.","content":"Cincinnati Reds Hall of Famer Barry Larkin is teaming up with a local company to launch a new professional baseball league in Dubai.The United International Baseball League will try to entice an estimated 900 million cricket fans in India, Pakistan and the Middle East to fall in love with America’s pastime with an “Inaugural Showcase” featuring four franchises in 2023.Larkin and former New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera have been retained to promote and grow the league by advising on player development and other matters.“We truly believe that player development has to start at the grassroots level,” Larkin said in a press release. “I’ve spent the last 20 years of my life focused on helping young people learn the fundamentals of our great game, as well as the fundamentals of great leadership. That’s the beauty of baseball – when you teach it the right way with the right conviction, you can help young people succeed on and off the field. I’ve seen it here in the U.S., I’ve seen it during my time in Brazil, and I’ve witnessed it during my trips to East Asia. Now, I’m very excited to help bring that level of instruction and guidance to India, Pakistan, and the UAE.”UIBL estimates American baseball is a $13 billion business with nearly 100 million fans across the North and South America. But the game has yet to grab a major fan base in Asia and the Middle East, where cricket is the most popular bat and ball sport. The International Cricket Council T20 World Cup last year drew a television audience of 167 million. That’s 150 million more than the World Series.Its press release said the UIBL will “introduce new rule changes” and provide “a more immersive viewing experience for fans at the stadium and home.”The league’s president is a former Procter & Gamble Co. executive whose public relations firm, BSB Group, is launching the new league with press events in New York and Cincinnati.“Not many moments in sports measure up to the energy and excitement of a home run,” said Kash Shaikh, President and Chief Marketing Officer of the UIBL. “The crack of the bat. The roar of the crowd. The elevation of the ball met by the rise in the stands. A home run can unite a stadium with a single swing. And it’s done just that for over a century. We wanted to capture that moment, and share some of that magic with a new generation of fans in South Asia and the Middle East. I can’t wait until our fans in Dubai can experience it for themselves.”","pubDate":"2022-07-25 13:02:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"wcpo","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mithali Raj terms THIS India women cricketer as 'once-in-a-generation' player","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/mithali-raj-terms-this-india-women-cricketer-as-once-in-a-generation-player-2489540.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mithali Raj, who recently announced her retirement from international cricket, is amazed at the kind of ''raw power'' that the 18-year-old generates in her shots.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-25 12:54:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Report finds Cricket Scotland 'institutionally racist'","link":"https://www.the42.ie/cricket-scotland-racism-5825317-Jul2022/","keywords":["Investigation"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The report found 448 examples of institutional racism.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-25 12:44:30","image_url":"https://c3.thejournal.ie/media/2022/07/a-view-of-scottish-flags-at-malahide-cc-630x420.jpg","source_id":"the42","country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Sri Lanka eye big lead after Mendis all-round display","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/07/25/cricket-sri-lanka-eye-big-lead-after-mendis-all-round-display","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"COLOMBO (Reuters) - Ramesh Mendis chipped in with a lower order cameo and then claimed three wickets for 42 runs to put Sri Lanka on course for a significant first innings lead against Pakistan on day two of the second test in Galle on Monday.
