Chappell, one of the most respected voices in world cricket, says that the advent of IPL has acted as a catalyst for India‚Äôs ‚Äúenormous depth in pace bowling‚Äù and it is not showing any signs of abating. ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs pace-bowling revolution shows no sign of abating, and the name on IPL watchers‚Äô lips is currently that of the pacy Umran Malik. In the past India has displayed patience in developing its fast-bowling group but the genuine pace of Malik will be hard to ignore,‚Äù Chappell wrote in his column for ‚ÄòESPNcricinfo‚Äô. ‚ÄúIn a world where fast bowling is a valuable commodity, India are now a shining light.‚Äù The IPL indeed has played a huge role in transforming India from a side with potential to a dominant force in world cricket. ‚ÄúIndia are currently a dominant international side and if they continue to show the required resolve, will continue to be a leading team. That is an envious position and India can thank the highly successful IPL for much of their lofty reputation.‚Äù Chappell feels that India‚Äôs pace bowling arsenal is a matter of ‚Äúenvy‚Äù for rival countries. ‚ÄúThe development of star quick bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Mohammed Siraj has been instrumental in India‚Äôs improved overseas reputation. There is also a depth below that group, in the successful Ishant Sharma, the underrated Umesh Yadav, and handy back-up in Shardul Thakur.‚Äù Chappell, who first toured India in 1969 and played against the top sides in his time, believes the situation now is a far cry from the days when some Indian players were happy being non-playing members in adverse conditions. ‚ÄúIndia have evolved from a team that had a reputation where some players treasured the blazer, sweater and cap more than actual selection in the Test side, to one that was extremely difficult to beat under any conditions,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúHowever, India, who had produced the odd faster bowler, lacked a pace conglomerate. Then the IPL began to bare its teeth, and now we have the current generation of fast bowlers to round out a versatile attack, which accompanies a strong batting line-up and a decent catching combination,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄîPTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-05-08 20:35:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kohli falls for third golden duck in IPL 2022","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/05/09/kohli-falls-for-third-golden-duck-in-ipl-2022/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"MUMBAI: Virat Kohli on Sunday fell for his third golden duck this IPL season to extend the Indian superstar‚Äôs grave batting slump.

Kohli‚Äôs miserable run with the bat has coincided with his stepping down as captain of India in T20 and Test cricket and also being removed as ODI skipper.

CSK thrashed DC by 91 runs at DY Patil Stadium, Navi Mumbai, in the Indian Premier League (IPL 2022). The victory pulled them one place up to No. 8 in the points table. DC captain Rishabh Pant won the toss and asked CSK to bat. The lost toss turned into a blessing for Dhoni and Co as they posted 208 for 6 in 20 overs. Eventual Player of the Match Devon Conway top scored with his knock of 87 off 49 deliveries. He struck at a strike rate of 177.55 as he hit five sixes and seven fours. CSK bowlers produced a collective effort as they never allowed a Delhi batter to settle in the middle. Openers David Warner and KS Bharat, who threatened at the beginning, were sent back inside the powerplay overs. The next two batsmen Mitchell Marsh and Pant were also removed at the correct time. Marsh scored 25 off 20, while Pant scored a quick-fire 21. Following that, only Shardul Thakur scored in double digits. The former CSK all-rounder scored 25 off 19 balls. CSK's opening bowling duo Mukesh Choudhary and Simarjeet Singh had a great outing against DC. They made two dismissals each and bowled quite economically to help CSK secure their fourth victory in the IPL 2022. \"It would have been better if we would have had a win like this somewhere early. It was a perfect game. The batters did really well. It was a toss where we wanted to win and field first, but in the heart, I was fine to lose the toss. The ball stops and comes, and it behaves only after 13-14 overs. Everybody contributed a bit. Runs on the board really help, and it was important to restrict their big-hitters. Both Simarjeet and Mukesh have taken time to mature. They have the capability, the more they play, the better they'll get at game sense,\" said Dhoni after CSK's big win on Sunday. Mukesh has played 10 out of CSK's 11 games in the ongoing season. The fast bowler has picked up 13 wickets, including a four-wicke haul. Simarjeet, who made his IPL debut this season, has three scalps in three games.

In T20 cricket, it is all about knowing which delivery not to bowl. I don't like going in and hitting straightaway. But with only 12 deliveries left, if a few of us contribute with scores of 8 off 2, it helps. But scoring just 2 or 3 runs doesn't help. I am not a big fan of maths. Even in school I wasn't good at it. Thinking of the NRR doesn't help. You just want to enjoy the IPL. When two other teams are playing, you don't want to be under pressure and thinking. You just have to think about what to do in the next game. If we make the playoffs, great. But even if we don't it's not the end of the world,\" added Dhoni. If we make the playoffs, great.

It was just about communicating with Ruturaj. With Hussey, I just discussed how the surface would be and who the bowlers would be to target. I am just happy to build that partnership up with Rutu, and the way he's playing, he makes my job easier. I have to be true to myself, authentic to myself. I look to play cricket shots and just assess where to put my foot down.

Defending champions Chennai Super Kings batted in a manner they are commonly known for in Indian Premier League 2022 match against Delhi Capitals at the Dr DY Patil Sports Academy tonight. Invited to bat first by Delhi captain Rishabh Pant, Chennai thrived on the back of a 110-run opening partnership between Ruturaj Gaikwad (41) and Devon Conway (87). While the two highest IPL 2022 partnerships also belong to CSK, their batters also have two entries in Top Five IPL 2022 opening partnerships. As a result, Gaikwad strengthened his position at the top of the list among highest run-scorers for Super Kings. Conway, on the other hand, has reached to the fourth position despite playing only four matches this season thus far. Having already scored three half-centuries, Conway already has the most half-centuries for his team in IPL 2022. All-rounder Shivam Dube, who had been their top run-scorer this season for a long while before being left out for a couple of matches, scored a hard-hitting 32 (19) to surpass batter Ambati Rayudu (5) to reach the second spot. Chennai, who are at the penultimate position on the points table, have won just three and lost seven matches this season. Although their overall performance hasn‚Äôt been up to the mark, CSK have managed to score the maximum 200+ innings total in this season. While Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men have crossed the 200-run mark on four occasions, both Capitals and Rajasthan Royals have done the same thrice this season. Most runs for CSK in IPL 2022 Devon Conway‚Äôs a good starter.

The left-handed batter scored over 10,000 runs in international cricket and over 2500 runs in IPL. He was the Player of the Series in ICC ODI World Cup 2011, scoring over 300 run and picking over 10 wickets as well. However, Yuvraj still has one regret and that is not leading the Indian men's cricket team. In an interview to News18, he made a big statement, saying that he was supposed to lead India but the Greg Chappell incident changed everything and MS Dhoni was handed over the captaincy suddenly. Overwhelmed to share my journey as a father on this Mother's Day. I believe the best thing we can do for mommies is to be an equal partner in parenting.

Not to forget, the Greg Chappell contorversy had rocked the Indian cricket and it had made two factions within the team. It led to India's dismal performance in 2007 ODI World Cup when they were ousted in only the first stage of the tournament. Yuvraj said that with Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar opting out of maiden T20 World Cup in South Africa, he was the front-runner to lead India in the mega event but Dhoni was suddenly made the skipper. \"I am not sure how true it is. Suddenly from vice-captaincy I was removed. Sehwag was not there in the team. So, out of nowhere, Mahi (MS Dhoni) became captain for the 2007 T20 World Cup. I thought I was going to be the captain,\" he added.","pubDate":"2022-05-08 14:58:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Faf du Plessis Fifty, Wanindu Hasaranga 5-Wicket Haul Set Up RCB's Thrashing Of SRH - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9zcmgtdnMtcmNiLWZhZi1kdS1wbGVzc2lzLWZpZnR5LXdhbmluZHUtaGFzYXJhbmdhLTUtd2lja2V0LWhhdWwtc2V0LXVwLXJjYnMtdGhyYXNoaW5nLW9mLXNyaC0yOTU3MjIx0gGLAWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2lwbC0yMDIyL3NyaC12cy1yY2ItZmFmLWR1LXBsZXNzaXMtZmlmdHktd2FuaW5kdS1oYXNhcmFuZ2EtNS13aWNrZXQtaGF1bC1zZXQtdXAtcmNicy10aHJhc2hpbmctb2Ytc3JoLTI5NTcyMjEvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022: Faf du Plessis Fifty, Wanindu Hasaranga 5-Wicket Haul Set Up RCB's Thrashing Of SRH¬†¬†NDTV SportsSRH vs RCB, Go Green Game: Preview | IPL 2022¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreVirat Kohli's poor form continues as he falls for third golden duck in IPL¬†¬†DAWN.comLive Cricket Score - SRH vs RCB, Match 54, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzIPL 2022: Hasaranga‚Äôs five-wicket haul seals Bangalore‚Äôs crushing 67-run win over Hyderabad¬†¬†Gulf NewsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-08 14:42:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chennai Super Kings vs Delhi Capitals: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/chennai-super-kings-vs-delhi-capitals-live-score-over-match-55-t20-6-10-updates-2957181","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Chennai Super Kings vs Delhi Capitals from Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy, Navi Mumbai.

Also, on a side note, Dwayne Bravo returns to side which MS Dhoni forgot to mention at the toss and he replaces Dwaine Pretorius. MS Dhoni the skipper of Chennai says that they would have bowled first looking at their combination. But toss is not in their control and they are happy to bowl second. Adds that they had a bad season earlier but they had made the most of it and it helped them. Further adds that there have been a few changes after the auction and sometimes they need to find the best combination. Informs that Ravindra Jadeja is not fit and Shivam Dube comes in. Rishabh Pant the skipper of Delhi says that they will have a bowl first because the wicket looks like a good one and 170 looks like a good score to chase. Adds that the season has been a bit of up and down and hopes to continue the momentum from the last game and keep the winning run going. On being asked about MS Dhoni, he says that he has learned a lot from him and hopefully they can get a win over his side. Informs that they have a couple of changes with Axar Patel and Srikar Bharat coming in. Chennai (Playing XI) - Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devon Conway, Robin Uthappa, Ambati Rayudu, Shivam Dube (In for Ravindra Jadeja), MS Dhoni (C/WK), Moeen Ali, Dwayne Bravo (In for Dwaine Pretorius), Mukesh Choudhary, Maheesh Theekshana, Simarjeet Singh. Delhi (Playing XI) - Srikar Bharat (In for Mandeep Singh), David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Rishabh Pant (C/WK), Rovman Powell, Ripal Patel, Axar Patel (In for Lalit Yadav), Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav, Anrich Nortje, Khaleel Ahmed. TOSS - Up goes the coin and it lands in favour of Delhi. They have elected to BOWL first. Right now, there's action going on in the first match of Super Sunday, where Bangalore and Hyderabad are battling it out in order to bolster their chances of making it through to the playoffs. You can switch tabs and follow both games as the build for the match between Chennai and Delhi continues. Chennai on the flip side have not been at their best and are virtually knocked out of the tournament. Dwayne Bravo's absence has cost the team and they will be hoping he returns to the side. However, Devon Conway's return has solved their top-order woes. Their chance to seal a spot in the top four might be slim, but they can get over the line and disturb the qualification chances for the other teams. So folks who are you backing today? Stay tuned as we bring to you the toss and other updates. Delhi have been blown hot and cold this season. They have been winning alternative games for the past few matches. They have been knocking on the doors for a spot in the playoffs and a victory today will surely help their cause. Prithvi Shaw is likely to miss the game once again due to illness and this could be a concern for them. Hello and a warm welcome to match number 55 between Chennai and Delhi. This game was in doubt due to a couple of Covid cases in Delhi's camp. But thankfully, all the others tested negative and we are ready to witness some action. So, buckle up folks! Get ready for an enticing contest. ...

Legendary Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be in action in less than 30 minutes from now as his team will take on Delhi Capitals at the Dr DY Patil Sports Academy in the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League. Defending champions CSK, who are at the penultimate position on the points table on the back of winning three and losing seven out of their 10 matches this season, would want to not lose even an iota of hope with respect to their qualification for the playoffs despite minimal chances of the same. Dhoni, who had kick-started IPL 2022 with a fighting half-century against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede Stadium, has shown glimpses of his big-hitting skills against Lucknow Super Giants and Mumbai Indians this season. Having said that, him continuing to bat at his preferred position of No. 7 hasn‚Äôt provided him with a lot of batting opportunities. As a result, all Dhoni had scored in IPL 2022 are 142 runs at an average and strike rate of 28.40 and 130.27 respectively. It was almost four weeks ago that Dhoni had returned to the pavilion without scoring a run against Royal Challengers Bangalore. However, it wasn‚Äôt counted as a quintessential duck as the 40-year old player wasn‚Äôt dismissed. Dhoni has registered a similar instance of scoring 0* during an IPL 2020 match against Mumbai at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium. Apart from these two innings, Dhoni has been dismissed for a duck on only four occasions in the IPL. The aforementioned number is quite low as compared to other IPL greats namely Rohit Sharma (14) and Virat Kohli (9) .","pubDate":"2022-05-08 13:34:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, SRH vs RCB Live Score Updates: Fifty up for feisty Rahul Tripathi - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvaXBsL2lwbC0yMDIyLXNyaC12cy1yY2ItbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLTc5MDYzMTcv0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, SRH vs RCB Live Score Updates: Fifty up for feisty Rahul Tripathi¬†¬†The Indian ExpressSRH vs RCB, Go Green Game: Preview | IPL 2022¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreSRH vs RCB Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022¬†¬†Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - Sunrisers vs RCB, Indian Premier League 2022, 54th Match¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoIPL 2022, SRH vs RCB Live Score: Rahul Tripathi Fifty Keeps SRH Hopes Alive In Massive Chase vs RCB¬†¬†NDTV SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-08 13:13:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh and other cricketers extend heartfelt wishes on Mother's Day","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/virat-kohli-sachin-tendulkar-yuvraj-singh-and-other-cricketers-extend-heartfelt-wishes-on-mothers-day-10647941.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh and other cricketers extend heartfelt wishes on Mother's Day","content":"The second Sunday of May is celebrated as the Mother‚Äôs Day around the world every year.

During the 54th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Wankhede Stadium, veteran Royal Challengers Bangalore wicket-keeper batter Dinesh Karthik has played yet another impact-generating innings this season. Coming in to bat at No. 5 in the penultimate over, Karthik‚Äôs knock has it in it to be the difference between the two teams. Aided by a reprieve on the boundary by Sunrisers Hyderabad batter Rahul Tripathi, Karthik smashed a four and four sixes in his eight-ball 30*. Having hit a six off Kartik Tyagi in the 19th over, Karthik hit three sixes and a four off debutant Fazalhaq Farooqi to power Bangalore to 192/3 in 20 overs after captain Faf du Plessis (73*) won the toss and chose to bat. Following former captain Virat Kohli‚Äôs golden duck , du Plessis and Rajat Patidar (48) put together a rescuing act in the form of a 105-run second-wicket partnership. As far as Karthik is concerned, him scoring 274 runs this season at a strike rate of 200 has resulted in him topping the list of batters with highest strike rate (minimum 75 runs) this season. Former England captain Michael Vaughan is among the many admirers of Karthik for his evolved big-hitting skills this season. Vaughan, who took to social media platform Twitter to suggest a break to Kohli earlier in the day, called for Karthik‚Äôs comeback into the T20I squad for the ICC T20 World Cup 2022.

Maxwell with a wild swing and a miss. 14.1 overs (1 Run) A length ball, outside off, it is hit to cover for a single. DRINKS! Bangalore have lost Rajat Patidar but the youngster has set the platform for Glenn Maxwell and Bangalore to go big in this final phase of the innings. Faf du Plessis isalso well set and we all know how dangerous he can be at the death overs and with plenty of batting to follow, Bangalore are looking set for a big total. However, if Hyderabad manage to get wickets here, they can stem the run-flow and let's see how things pan out as Kartik Tyagi is back on. 13.6 overs (0 Run) NOT OUT! Malik serves a bumper, around middle. Maxwell makes room and tries to slash at it but misses. An appeal by Hyderabad but the umpire is unmoved. Kane Williamson asks if there was any sound and eventually takes the review but to no avail as UltraEdge shows nothing on it. Review! Hyderabad have taken a review for a caught behind against Glenn Maxwell. The replays roll in and the UltraEdge shows no bat involved. So Glenn Maxwell will continue. 13.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR!

Faf du Plessis whips it to deep square leg for a single. Umran Malik is back on. He went for 20 runs in his first over. 12.6 overs (0 Run) Tossed up, outside off.

Maxwell tucks it to square leg for a single. Glenn Maxwell walks out at number 4. 12.2 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! Finally Hyderabad get the crucial breakthrough. Rajat Patidar misses out on his fifty as well. Again an arm ball from Jagadeesha Suchith, sliding around middle and leg. Rajat Patidar tries to heave it but does not connect well and Rahul Tripathi at deep mid-wicket takes a sharp catch. 12.1 overs (0 Run) This one comes with an angle, fuller and sliding on leg. Patidar misses his slog-sweep and gets hit on the pads. 11.6 overs (1 Run) Shorter and on off, Rajat pushes it through covers for one. 11.6 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Down the leg side this time. Wided. 11.5 overs (1 Run) Now takes one as this is pushed down to long off. 11.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! This will release the little pressure that was building. Shorter and outside off, Faf slaps it over covers for a boundary. Fifty for Faf du Plessis! 11.3 overs (0 Run) Make that three! Outside off, shorter, Faf is early in the pull, he is beaten. 11.2 overs (0 Run) Two dots in a row! That is a rarity! Length around off, this one jags back in sharply. Faf looks to flick but misses. It goes just over the middle pole. 11.1 overs (0 Run) Length and outside off, stays a touch low. Faf looks to cut but misses. Kartik Tyagi is back on. 10.6 overs (1 Run) Darts it on leg, Rajat Patidar flicks it towards deep mid-wicket and gets a single. 10.5 overs (1 Run) Fuller one and on off, Faf du Plessis flicks it towards mid wicket and rotates the strike. 10.4 overs (1 Run) Flatter one on off, this is flicked towards square leg for a single. 10.3 overs (0 Run) On the pads, darts it on leg, Patidar tries to sweep it but misses and the ball hits his pads. There is an appeal but it is going down leg. 10.2 overs (1 Run) Flatter one on leg, this is played towards covers for a single. 10.1 overs (1 Run) Flatter one on middle, Patidar plays it towards long on and gets a single.","pubDate":"2022-05-08 11:12:05","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637876249166653691.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: Virat Kohli disappoints with third golden duck of IPL 2022","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/srh-vs-rcb-watch-video-virat-kohli-suffers-third-golden-duck-in-ipl-2022-10647741.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Watch: Virat Kohli disappoints with third golden duck of IPL 2022","content":"Virat Kohli got out for another golden duck, his third of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL 2022) season as the Royal Challengers Bangalore batter was out in the first ball of the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai on Sunday.Opening for RCB after the side opted to bat first, Kohli suffered a soft dismissal as he flicked a full delivery by left-arm orthodox J Suchith straight to SRH skipper Kane Williamson standing at mid-wicket.The 33-year-old batter was expectedly and visibly upset as he did a facepalm in disbelief while walking back to the dugout.

Suchith bowled a ball on the pads of Virat Kohli, and Kohli flicked it straight to the fielder at short midwicket. Virat was shocked at the dismissal and even he took a lot of time to reach the pavilion as well. Former English captain Michael Vaughan also commented on the form of Virat Kohli after his dismissal. He said that a rest can do wonders for Virat Kohli as he is playing just too much of cricket at the moment. ‚ÄúSometimes a break from the game is all a player needs .. the amount of cricket these players play a break is as good as anything,‚Äù Michael Vaughan tweeted.
