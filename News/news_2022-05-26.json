Cricket Australia’s chief executive Nick Hockley, chair Lachlan Henderson and board director Richard Freudenstein - the former Foxtel CEO and head of CA’s broadcast rights committee - have several days of talks lined up either side of a Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) invitation to the IPL final on Sunday night. This year’s IPL final will provide the backdrop to critical meetings for Australian cricket’s future. Credit: Getty The broadcast contract to beam the IPL around India and the world is set to be fought over in a public auction for the first time in June, with the tournament’s value widely expected to rocket to more than US$1 billion a season. Any companies missing out on auction day will be left scrambling for other available cricket. These include the ICC’s global rights for men’s and women’s World Cups, but also the rights to broadcast Australian cricket into India - the second-most valuable rights commodity for CA after the $1.2 billion domestic rights held by Foxtel and Seven. For most of the past 20 years, the India rights have assumed ever more significance on CA’s balance sheets, growing from around $35 million to $85 million and then up to $140 million for the cycle including the 2014-15 India tour of Australia. In 2017, CA signed a six-year deal estimated to be worth around $150 million for Sony to hold the rights, outbidding the previous holders Star. The deal expires in 2023, a year before the Foxtel and Seven agreement. India celebrate a stunning series victory over Australia in 2020-21. Credit: Getty Images However, last year it was revealed that the agreement was in fact only worth about $110 million because the fine print included the playing of extra matches between Australia and India that were not a part of the globally agreed schedule and did not ultimately take place. That $40 million shortfall, combined with a similar drop in the value of the UK rights to Australian cricket last year, has made the Hockley, Henderson and Freudenstein mission to India even more crucial. CA is trying to overturn a projected $90 million revenue shortfall over the next two years into a financial position that buttresses the organisation against the risk of another major disruption redolent of COVID-19. More broadly, there is an acknowledgement within CA that numerous past deals, while financially lucrative, have not always been strategically successful, either in terms of relationships with partners or setting up the game to be best placed for the future. As such, CA’s next deal in the Indian market may not be as simple as going to the highest bidder: the rights holder’s reach and the possibility of future co-operation in other territories may also come into the equation. The International Cricket Council is set to unveil the next men’s future tours program in July and reveal, among other things, how often India will tour Australia over the next cycle of series. It will not be the first visit by members of CA’s broadcast team to India this year. In March, the head of media rights Nikki Linney was part of another group that met with representatives from broadcasters and streaming services including Viacom Network, Star Network, Amazon Prime and Fan Code. CA’s relationship with Amazon is already well established through the production of The Test documentary series about the fortunes of the men’s team in 2018-19. Audiences for the IPL have been down by about 25 pe cent this year, attributed partly to the end of COVID lockdowns in India, the playing of four instalments of the tournament in the space of about two years, and the poor campaigns of the league’s biggest clubs: Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders all missed the finals. Nevertheless, a broader field of rights bidders in a world where digital streaming is playing an increasing part in the way sport is watched should aid the BCCI in wringing a huge sum out of the IPL rights. In the meantime, Australian cricket’s leaders will test the ground and hope to swoop on crumbs falling from the table of the auction’s unsuccessful bidders. CA declined to comment.

India playing international cricket right after an Indian Premier League season is a common practice in times when cricketers seldom get a lengthy break between two tournaments. Having said that, India playing international cricket at home right after an IPL season is only happening for the second time. IPL, which concludes in the last week of May in the general run of things, will be followed by a T20I series between India and South Africa less than two weeks after the completion of the ongoing 15th season. Hence, in a rare development, India’s bumper home season 2021-22 will resume after IPL 2022 as the two teams will play five T20Is between 10 days. Readers must note that it will only be the second time in the history of cricket when India will be playing international cricket at home in the month of June. IND vs SA T20 tickets online booking As far as the tickets for stand-in captain KL Rahul’s maiden T20I series as a captain and first as captain at home is concerned, they haven’t been put on sale at this point in time. Scheduled to start on June 9, there are more than two weeks remaining for the first India-South Africa T20I. With the business end of IPL 2022 in action, tickets are currently being sold for the same. Therefore, going by past experience, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that fans won’t be able to book India-South Africa T20Is tickets before next month. Speaking particularly about Bengaluru, host for the fifth T20I on June 19, expect the ticket sales to commence around the mid of June. M Chinnaswamy Stadium, which had last hosted an India vs Sri Lanka Test earlier this year, will be hosting a T20I after almost 32 months. With tickets for the last international match at this venue sold online on Paytm Insider, expect the same platform to sell tickets this time round as well. Having said that, we will update you with the same whenever an official confirmation is issued by KSCA (Karnataka State Cricket Association).

Langer quit as coach of Australia in February after being offered an insulting six-month contract extension despite guiding the team to T20 World Cup and Ashes glory. A rumoured breakdown in the relationship between Langer and a core of senior players led to CA's move to push the 51-year-old towards the exit. A host of Australia's greatest Test players, including Mark Waugh, Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting, Steve Waugh, Matthew Hayden and the late Shane Warne, lambasted CA for the way it treated Langer. The anger Langer felt about his treatment from CA was still evident on Wednesday when he recalled the conversation he had with Freudenstein the day after he quit as Australia coach. \"The first thing he said to me was, 'It must make you feel so good that all your mates are supporting you in the media,'\" Langer told a Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA event in Perth. \"I said, 'Yeah it is, acting chairman, but with all due respect, those mates are also the all-time greats of Australian cricket. They are the fabric of Australian cricket. They are Australian cricket. They also work all around the world in cricket. So yeah, I'm glad my mates are looking after me. Imagine if you had have'. \"Ironically, the last six months of my coaching career were the most enjoyable period of 12 years of coaching. \"Not only did we win everything, but I had energy, and I had focus, and I was happy - besides the bulls*** politics.\" Australia have since appointed Andrew McDonald as Langer's replacement. After resigning, Langer's name was immediately linked to the England coaching position. Langer, whose pride and passion for Australia is renowned, made it crystal clear he never considered the role. \"I've never spoken to English cricket,\" Langer said. \"The thought of coaching England (shakes his head fervently) ... mate!\" Langer is unsure what his next move will be, but said staying in Western Australia with his family is his priority. \"I love WA. I love being home. I haven't been home for 31 years,\" he said. Langer, who is a board member at AFL club West Coast, backed Eagles chief executive Trevor Nisbett and coach Adam Simpson despite the disastrous 1-9 start to the year.","pubDate":"2022-05-25 17:38:16","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-6938286/f9677b6b13546b941b3986c55837bf2fe8f18f94-16x9-x0y75w800h450.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The Glazers' reasons for wanting to buy East Bengal and what it could mean for Man Utd","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-glazers-east-bengal-27065526","keywords":["Football"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Felix Keith)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Glazer family, who have owned Manchester United since 2005, are in talks with cricket legend Sourav Ganguly to take over Indian Super League side East Bengal","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-25 16:11:59","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article27065553.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-53173712.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lucknow Super Giants vs Royal Challengers Bangalore: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/lucknow-super-giants-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-live-score-over-eliminator-t20-16-20-updates-3009490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Lucknow Super Giants vs Royal Challengers Bangalore from Eden Gardens, Kolkata.

After losing Faf du Plessis early, Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar recovered well and put up a good show in the Powerplay. However, Virat Kohli perished soon after, Glenn Maxwell was dismissed for a timid score as well.

TOSS - Lucknow have won the toss and they have elected to BOWL first.

Playing conditions for the playoffs! If the match starts by 9.40 pm IST (4.10 pm GMT), there will be no overs lost. In case of an extended rain dance, a 5-over shootout can start as late as 11.56 pm IST (6.26 pm GMT). Also, even if that isn't possible, we will have a Super Over, starting no later than 12.50 am IST (7.20 pm GMT). In the event of no play, the team that has finished higher in the league stage will be declared the winner. The good thing though is that the covers have slowly started to come off. UPDATE - 7.30 pm IST (2.00 pm GMT) - We have good news folks! It has stopped raining completely and the covers are coming off! The weather forecast for the rest of the evening also seems clear, so we can expect a full 20 over game here. UPDATE - 7.20 pm IST (1.50 pm GMT) - Now, the entire Eden Gardens has been covered. Looks like the delay might be stretched but we hope that the rain gods stay away from this mega event. Stay tuned for further updates. Actually, there are no umbrellas seen at the moment. Glenn Maxwell is down for a chat. He says that they rode the emotions of every ball in the Mumbai versus Delhi game, but it was awesome to be involved. Mentions that it was a real feeling of euphoria when Mumbai beat Delhi and they had a feeling that they had a second chance. Adds that he has played his first-ever Indian T20 League game here in Eden Gardens and he has a lot of memories. Informs that he has been bed-ridden and he is trying to get his health up and trying to get ready for the game. States that Lucknow is a really good side, they have all the bases covered and they will be coming onto them with a heavy pace attack. UPDATE - 7.00 pm IST (1.30 pm GMT) - Oh, dear! Just the last thing we wanted to hear. The conditions are windy, it has started to drizzle and the covers are coming on. The toss has been delayed. Let's hope the rain stays away. PITCH REPORT - Graeme Smith is near the pitch. He says there were some potential thunderstorms so the pitch was covered a little while ago. Says the outfield is pristine and is hard to defend boundaries. Tells that the average score since 2019 is 183, so the team will at least look for a score above 180. Shares, they saw in the last game that the pitch was slow and a touch two-paced initially but in the evening games the ball comes nicely onto the bat. The pitch here in Eden Gardens has been batting friendly and we can expect some fireworks in this important clash. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates. The newbies in this tournament, Lucknow have a well-balanced side. They started the tournament well but have not been as consistent and as a result, they finished third in the points table. Their bowling unit seems lethal, the likes of Avesh Khan and Mohsin Khan have been exceptional and they will be hoping they trouble the formidable batting unit of Bangalore. On their batting unit, it's their top order, Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul, and Deepak Hooda who have scored most of the runs, and this time their middle-order will have to step up. They have enough firepower in their ranks and are capable of chasing any target down. The road to the playoffs has not been an easy one for Bangalore. They won their final game in the group stage and had to rely on Mumbai to beat Delhi for them to go through. Things did go in their favour and they managed to seal the final spot in the playoffs. But they have to put their best foot forward if they want to continue their journey. A big boost for them is the form of Virat Kohli. We witnessed a rejuvenated Kohli in the previous game. Bangalore will be hoping he displays his magic once again. A problem for them is their bowling mainly in the Powerplay. They have not been at their best with the ball in the first six overs and they will want to change things around in this crucial clash. Hello and a warm welcome folks! We are now in the knockout game! It is time for the Eliminator where Lucknow will lock horns with Bangalore. The equation is simple, the winner of this contest will progress and join Rajasthan in Qualifier 2 while the team on the losing side will be knocked out of this exuberant league. Both teams will be coming out all guns blazing to try and progress to the next round of the playoffs. Buckle up folks we are in for another thrilling ride! ...

The spin-bowling great, who died in March 2022, will be remembered throughout the first Test by former players and the Sky Sports cricket team, with whom Warne spent a number of years working following his playing career. During the first Test, Sky Sports viewers will be shown a two-part documentary entitled \"Bowled Shane,\" which tells the story of the '05 and '06/07 Ashes series. Warne was the main character throughout both dramatic series, cementing his reputation as one of the game's greatest ever players. In partnership with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Sky Sports will also be commemorating its former colleague by renaming the main commentary box in the J.P. Morgan Media Centre at Lord's after the former leg-spinner. The tribute will be unveiled on the morning of June 2 by another of Warne's former Sky Sports Cricket colleagues Rob Key, now Managing Director of England Men's Cricket. Mark Taylor, the former Australian captain and Warne's close friend, will also join Sky Sports' coverage to discuss Warne's impact on the game alongside Nasser Hussain, Michael Atherton, Mel Jones, Ian Ward, Simon Doull and Eoin Morgan. Finally, to celebrate the cricketing great whose playing number was 23, there will be a minute's applause on 23 overs. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports Director of Cricket Bryan Henderson said \"On the pitch, he was simply the greatest, while off it, he was a wonderful and loyal friend. No words can capture his contribution to the game, but his magic on the field as well as in the commentary box and in life itself will never be forgotten. We hope our tributes to him during this Test will remind those who witnessed him in action of his greatness as well as hopefully introduce young cricket fans to a cricketing legend.\" Guy Lavender, MCC Chief Executive & Secretary, said: \"Shane Warne was a man who entertained us on the field and was passionate about improving the sport off it. He was an Honorary Life Member of MCC and we were fortunate to benefit from this directly through his work on our World Cricket committee and also as our Head Coach of London Spirit men's team last summer. We are hugely supportive of Sky's commemoration of Shane which I am sure will be a fitting tribute to a true legend of the game\".","pubDate":"2022-05-25 14:30:00","image_url":"https://e1.365dm.com/22/05/1920x1080/skysports-shane-warne-england_5783773.jpg?20220525151622","source_id":"skysports","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies tour of Pakistan for three-match ODI series to go as scheduled: PCB","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/west-indies-tour-of-pakistan-for-three-match-odi-series-to-go-as-scheduled-pcb-2022-05-25-779339","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"West Indies will be touring Pakistan for the rescheduled three-match ODI series that will be held at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi, starting June 8.

Rishabh Pant has emerged as the front-runner in the role. The Delhi Capitals captain has impressed with his performances for the Indian cricket team. Pant's stellar shows include Test centuries in overseas conditions along with his power-hitting skills. He has also improved his wicketkeeping by leaps and bounds. However, Pant did not set the IPL 2022 on fire with his performance as he scored 340 runs in 14 matches at an average of 30.91. Pant has also failed to impress with his DRS decisions but BCCI president Sourav Ganguly feels with time he would improve. \"Don't compare Pant with MS Dhoni. Dhoni has so much experience, has captained in 500-plus games in IPL, Tests and ODIs. So, it's not fair for Rishabh to be compared with Dhoni,\" Ganguly said in a promotional event on Tuesday. Sunrisers Hyderabad fast bowler Umran Malik has been one of the finds of the IPL with his raw pace and he has been picked in the Indian squad for the five-T20I series against South Africa too. Ganguly is happy with Umran. Promoted \"His future is in hands. If he stays fit and bowls at this pace, I'm sure he will be around for a long time. Many have played well in this IPL. Tilak (Varma) has done well for MI. Rahul (Tripathi) for Sunrisers, Tewatia for GT,\" Ganguly said. \"We have seen many emerging fast bowlers like Malik, Mohsin Khan, Arshdeep Singh, Avesh Khan ...

In February, the 51-year-old stepped down as the national men’s coach after rejecting a six-month contract extension, hoping instead to be offered a multi-year deal. Langer’s contract was slated to expire in June, but the writing was on the wall following a breakdown in his relationship with senior players, who had become worn down by his overbearing style and intense attitude. Watch Every Game of The 2022 Indian Premier League Finals on Kayo. New to Kayo? Try 14-Days Free Now > Several Australian cricket icons jumped to Langer’s defence, questioning how a national coach could win a T20 World Cup title and Ashes series before essentially giving him no other option but to quit. Speaking at a Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA event in Perth on Wednesday, Langer detailed a heated conversation with Freudenstein the day after he resigned. “The first thing he said to me was: ‘It must make you feel so good that all your mates are supporting you in the media,’” Langer began. “I said: ‘Yeah it is acting chairman, but with all due respect, those mates are also the all-time greats of Australian cricket. They are the fabric of Australian cricket. They are Australian cricket. They also work all around the world in cricket. So yeah, I’m glad my mates are looking after me. Imagine if you had have.’ “Ironically, the last six months of my coaching career were the most enjoyable period of 12 years of coaching. “Not only did we win everything, but I had energy, and I had focus, and I was happy — besides the bulls*** politics.” Former Australian head coach Justin Langer. Photo by Quinn Rooney/Getty Images Source: Getty Images CA confirmed last month that Andrew McDonald, who was acting as interim coach after Langer resigned, had been appointed the new national men’s head coach . The 40-year-old joined Australia’s coaching staff in 2019 after stints in charge of Victoria and the Melbourne Renegades. McDonald mentored Australia during the recent tour of Pakistan, the side’s first Test series victory in Asia since 2011. “The journey so far has been particularly pleasing, and I am honoured to be given this incredible opportunity for what is an exciting period ahead,” McDonald said. “The success of the World Cup, the Ashes series and now Pakistan has been testament to the hard work and leadership of Justin, Pat (Cummins) and Aaron (Finch) along with the players and the support staff. “My plan is to build on the growth, depth and experience of the squad while working collectively with the group and across the game. There are many challenges in the short-term which I know excites the leadership group, the players and the staff.” Australian Test captain Pat Cummins was reluctant to endorse Langer as coach last summer, but the pace bowler was full of praise for McDonald following the historic 1-0 series triumph in Pakistan. “He’s been fantastic, which is not unexpected,” Cummins said in March. “He’s just a great operator. The boys absolutely love him. He’s very diligent, very thorough and strategic and organised. He’s a huge part of this tour win. It’s not my place to employ the coach, but ‘Ronnie’ has been fantastic.” Australia will embark on a multi-format tour of Sri Lanka next month.","pubDate":"2022-05-25 11:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Umran Malik will be around for a long time: Ganguly","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/umran-malik-will-be-around-for-a-long-time-says-sourav-ganguly/articleshow/91790307.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sourav Ganguly while praising Umran Malik on Wednesday said if the pacer stayed fit then he would be around for a long time.","content":"KOLKATA: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sourav Ganguly while praising Umran Malik on Wednesday said if the pacer stayed fit then he would be around for a long time.
