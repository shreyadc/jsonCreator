Weather could be the only other aid to Australia's hopes but rain isn’t predicted in Sydney on Saturday.It’s crunch time at the T20 World Cup and you can catch every match live and ad-free in play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >It’s been the tale of this World Cup for Australia, who has had to chase its tail ever since the 89-run loss to New Zealand in the opening match of the tournament.But cricket fans have been left baffled by a series of decision when a monster victory could have opened another avenue to make it into the semi-finals.Australia were well behind the run rate and needed at least a 50-run win to try to push its run rate ahead of England. The bigger the win, the better it would be for Australia. Already needing to cover the loss of Aaron Finch and Tim David through injury, Australia made a bold call, dropping Mitchell Starc.It saw Cam Green, Steve Smith and Kane Richardson come into the team but none of the players had much of an impact.Green scored three off two balls and had two overs for 0/13, Steve Smith scored 4 off 4 balls, and Richardson took 1/48 off his four overs.After a red hot start at the top of the order from David Warner and Mitchell Marsh, it was left to Glenn Maxwell’s 54 not out off 32 balls to salvage Australia’s innings after losing regular wickets.Although Maxwell entered the tournament under pressure, he’s hit double figures in every match, and it raised a question as to why he came in at No. 6 in the order.CODE Sports’ Ben Jones wrote: “When it came to Maxwell’s deployment in tonight’s contest, there was questionable decision making on a wider level. In a match where a total of 200 was likely to be necessary, if not for the win but for that much discussed net run rate boost, then unleashing Glenn Maxwell early felt like an easy call.“In the last non rain-affected game where Maxwell opened the batting he scored 151* (64). Given the injury to Finch, a more aggressive and creative solution would have been to replace one Victorian veteran with another, and promote Maxwell to the top. Even without that level of inventiveness, there was a chance to manage him better; sending Steve Smith in at No.4 during Maxwell’s ideal entry point even in a normal match felt like the move of a frazzled side, compounded by sending in the admittedly in-form Stoinis.“Australia needed a miracle, had a miracle-worker in their side, but refused to give him the best chance to pull it off.”Then with 168 runs on the board, Australia could have done with a proven wicket-taker in Starc.Assistant coach Daniel Vettori said after the match the decision to leave the left-armer out of the team was a “tactical” decision to use Richardson at the death.It backfired as Richardson was taken for 16 off his final over, the 18th of the innings, including two sixes from Rashid Khan.“It was more about the effectiveness of Hazlewood and Cummins at the top, and their ability to take the new ball and be wicket-takers,” Vettori said.“Therefore that pushed Starcy into a different role, and he came up against Kane Richardson and it was thought among the hierarchy that Kane was exceptional at the death, and so to use him there as opposed to Mitch.“In his first over, he (Richardson) was incredibly unlucky.“He could have had two wickets and then suddenly the whole game’s turned, and that first breakthrough (of Rahmanullah Gurbaz) was a big wicket for us because he played so well and had been so aggressive.“So we reflect on that, and I think Richo himself would say that he probably missed at the back end of two overs.“But apart from that, the majority of his spell was what we expected.”Although hindsight is always 20/20, cricket fans were still in shock by the decision to leave Starc out of the match.Former Australian batter Mark Waugh tweeted: “Starc should be playing. He is an aggressive wicket taking bowler who could easily rip through Afghanistan. Richardson more of a holding type bowler.”Former Aussie captain Michael Clarke added in commentary: “He’s got to be injured.“There’s absolutely no way you can leave him out ... If anyone’s going to rip through Afghanistan’s batting, it’s Mitchell Starc.“I don’t get it.”Even Ashes villain Stuart Broad was baffled by the call. “Just flicked on T20 World Cup. #AUSvsAFG. Why No Mitch Starc for Aus?” he said.“Have we disagreed before? Please tell me Starc injured. He’s a beast in this format, wicket taker, game changer. Must win game? You want them.”","pubDate":"2022-11-04 23:21:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watto: I was scared to death of playing cricket","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-2022-shane-watson-opens-up-on-his-inner-battles-after-the-shock-death-of-mate-phil-hughes/news-story/1f08cad2984e3e81eb4e371ff8439d33","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In 2015, Shane Watson’s chance encounter with racing car driver Will Power resulted in a trip to America to meet the doctor who armed him with a set of skills and unleashed performances in the twilight of his career that he and the country had craved in the decade previous.","content":"“I played the most consistently successful and enjoyable cricket of my life in my mid-to-late 30s,” he writes in his new book Winning the Inner Battle.Tragedy was the trigger that encouraged Watson to discover what he now believes are the simple steps to the sort of mindset and success in sport he craved.For the best part of 18 months in the wake of Phillip Hughes death Watson battled inner demons, unable to tell his wife, coach or friends. He was, he admit, “petrified” that he would suffer the same fate.Power and Watson met at a rugby league awards night, the driver told Watson how his driving and his personal life had been rocked by the death of a good friend, Dan Wheldon, in an IndyCar race in Los Vegas, 2011. “It had broken him,” Watson wrote. “I immediately saw parallels between his experience, and the devastating effect on my generation of cricketers the year before of the death of one ours,” he wrote.“I had found this extremely difficult to talk about, even to my wife. It had not only intensified the stress of my underperformance on the field, but eaten away at my life at home: I was struggling to do things as simple as play in the backyard with my two-year-old son.”Power and Watson were both unfortunate enough to have been present when the tragedies occurred. Power, who is the reigning IndyCar Drivers’ Champion, had sought help from a Dr Jaques Dallaire in Charlotte, North Carolina, and recommended Watson do the same. The meeting led to the book which is a fascinating exposition on the mental side of sport and life It is sobering to reflect on the mental battles Watson and his teammates went through after the Hughes tragedy — something to this day he struggles to talk about.“Facing fast bowling was always one of my biggest strengths as a batter,” he writes. “I was totally fearless … After the tragic event fear came into my batting while facing fast bowling. I was thinking this could happen to me as well …”He held his place in the side, battling his fear, for seven Tests before being dropped in England.At the SCG, against India, he made 81 in four frustrating hours and was out to “one of the worst shots I ever played to end one of the worst innings of my career”.In the first Test of the 2015 Ashes — his last — he was out LBW to full deliveries from Mark Wood, on both occasions he was horrendously out of position because his mind was yelling “short ball!”.“I definitely couldn’t have told my coach at the time or any players around me that I was petrified that the next ball from a fast bowler could have the same impact on my life,” Watson said.“The tragedy of what happened to Phil Hughes is something no one would ever have thought would occur on a cricket field and the majority of cricketer’s mindsets shifted from there,” Watson told the Cricket Et Cetera podcast this week. ”In the end it became a real internal battle around not letting the fear of the ball coming down facing fast bowling. My mind was in the wrong place. The wrong thought at the wrong time kept coming into my mind. I was allowing it because I didn’t know how to control my mind to that point. I had anxiety, worry, fear around what might happen.”Watson’s book is a simple self help guide that draws on his vast experiences in cricket and his series of podcasts, Lessons Learnt with the Greats. He readily admits that despite winning two World Cups and two Allan Border Medals he was his own worst enemy for the majority of his career.“I wish I had known then what I know now,” he writes.Honest as always, Watson is perfectly positioned to help others. He was a supremely talented cricketer and a fine man, but one who found ways to trip himself up.Winning the Battle is an extraordinary and easy to read book that draws on anecdotes and encounters, while inviting the reader to take simple mental exercises that highlight the ongoing battles between the conscious and unconscious mind — and how they are best won.There’s no old scores settled but he does admit the team environment after Ricky Ponting left the Test side was poor and results focused.Watson revisits his chance to score an Ashes century and how he allowed his mind to trip him up on 95 when he began to focus on the outcome. Michael Clarke told Watson that he had a simple method of dealing with anxiety in the 90s. “My goal is actually 150, it’s not 100,” Clarke said. “So, when I’m in the 90s I don’t care because my goal is to get 150, not 100.”Watson learned later, after meeting the doctor, to control his inner dialogue and to concentrate on what needed to be done in the moment rather than obsessing with the outcome and fretting about doing the wrong thing.“The demon of expectation is a beast,” he writes.Ricky Ponting, Watson writes, would always ask an umpire if there were two balls to go as a cue to staying focused on getting to the end of the over and nothing else.Ponting also had a simple approach to focusing his mind before every ball by telling himself once at when the bowler was at the top of his mark, once halfway through his run up he repeated it and once again as he jumped into his delivery stride. Watson says that Ponting instinctively knew that the “conscious mind can only actively process one thought at a time”.The book rings alarm bells for players like Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne who cannot switch off during Test matches — Smith struggles to sleep.Watson realises he was burning himself out by fretting about strategies and failure before a game. He learned in the last four years of his career to set aside 45 minutes before the game to “do some conscious and unconscious mind preparation. Any time a single thought about the game popped into my head prior to those 45 minutes, I would exercise the control that I had over my conscious mind and redirect these thoughts”.“I was the king of burning mental energy. I didn’t understand the mind was like a muscle. I only had a certain amount of energy per day and I was ploughing through it.”He warns, ominously for the majority of young Test players, that the obsession with video gaming contributes to the fatigue factor.Winning the Inner Battle by Shane Watson is available at shanewatson.au","pubDate":"2022-11-04 22:10:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England vs Sri Lanka cricket LIVE: Stream, TV channel, latest updates for massive T20 World Cup quarter-final","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/20311267/england-vs-sri-lanka-live-stream-tv-channe-watch-t20-world-cup-online/","keywords":["Cricket","Sport","Men's T20 World Cup","Sport Live Blogs","T20 cricket"],"creator":["Kieran Davies"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"ENGLAND face Sri Lanka in their final clash of Group 1, with their hopes of a T20 World Cup semi-final still alive.

The unfortunate incident took place in Punjab’s Wazirabad town, where one of Khan’s supporters lost his life while at least 13 other people sustained injuries during the firing. The 70-year-old on Friday address the press post his surgery in Lahore, and disclosed the fact that he was hit by 4 bullets, and that he already had the information pertaining the attack a day before. As per recent reports, the police has so far arrested the man who had fired the pistol, along with two other suspects for plotting the incident. From the Cricketing point of view, the incident has in it to yet again form clouds of doubt pertaining the security of visiting players in the country, or at least Mark Wood does believe so. England are supposed to tour Pakistan to partake in a three-match Test series, scheduled to take place from December 1 onwards this year. For those unaware, it has been 17 years since they last played a Test match in the Asian nation. Ahead of England’s must-win match for semi-final qualification in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2022 against Sri Lanka in Sydney, pacer Mark Wood has exclaimed that he is ‘worried’ regarding security reasons as his side is yet again set to visit a country where there has been ‘trouble’ in the past. “I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried because you’re going back there when there’s been trouble. It’s obviously not great, is it? First of all, he’s an ex-cricketer so it’s close to home for us. It’s obviously hugely sad news to hear this news. But obviously it’s worrying when you’re going back there as a cricketer and there’s unrest in the country,” remarked Wood. Having said that, the tall right-arm pacer was all in praise for the secure environment and the security measures in which he and the English side played the against Pakistan in September-October. Wood’s aforementioned statement might well take the situation back to October 2021, when the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had pulled out of the scheduled white-ball tour to Pakistan citing concerns over “mental and physical wellbeing”. This, after there were repeated assurances from the Pakistani side, for which the Cricketing fraternity had even lashed out at the ECB for their decision.","pubDate":"2022-11-04 21:18:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"La dichiarazione d'intenti di 777 Partners: \"Intendiamo sviluppare il Genoa per più generazioni\"","link":"https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-b/la-dichiarazione-d-intenti-di-777-partners-intendiamo-sviluppare-il-genoa-per-piu-generazioni-1752337","keywords":["Serie B"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Tramite un comunicato ufficiale apparso sul sito la 777 Partners, holding proprietaria del Genoa, ha espresso la propria volontà di portare avanti un progetto di largo respiro e durevole nel tempo con il club rossoblù: “Fondato nel 1893, il Genoa Cricket...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-04 19:48:07","image_url":"https://tmw-storage.tcccdn.com/storage/tuttomercatoweb.com/img_notizie/thumb3/c4/c4a64cb5a6dd413d60241902f7e20150-72804-oooz0000.jpeg","source_id":"tuttomercatoweb","country":["italy"],"category":["sports"],"language":"italian"},{"title":"All India Vice Chancellor’s Cricket Cup T20 tournament","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/11/05/all-india-vice-chancellors-cricket-cup-t20-tournament/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["KR Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"SKUAST-K win their opening match by 7 wickets SRINAGAR: SKUAST-Kashmir registered a comprehensive seven wicket win over MANUU- Hyderabad in their inaugural match of All India Vice Chancellor’s Cricket Cup T20 tournament match played at Hissar, Haryana.

I think the opportunities of having a board member who is also president of the past players just makes perfect sense.“Player welfare is becoming more and more relevant as the years pass by. There are greater challenges now for players when they leave the game. Due to the soft cap, clubs are really limited to an extent on what they can do to prepare players for life after football.“That’s something I really want to drive and I would work with Wrighty (Graham Wright) and Lica (Paul Licuria), who I both get on well with.”Tuddenham, who played 40 games for the club from 1987 to 1991, said he would also bring his property development experience, including freehold/lease reviews, implementation of strategic plans and development opportunities at the AIA Centre and MCG, to the board.“I’ve been involved in property development for the last 25 years and have managed big projects and would be able to drive whatever the club needs in regard to that,” he said.The election will run for three weeks, from November 18 to December 9, with more Collingwood members now able to vote after the club agreed to change part of the eligibility, as part of membership feedback.SOCCER POWERBROKER LINKED WITH NORTH CEO JOB Sam Landsberger and Jay Clark One of Australia's leading soccer executives is in the mix to take over North Melbourne.The Herald Sun can reveal Football Australia's head of marketing, communications and corporate affairs Peter Filopoulos has been interviewed for the job vacated by Ben Amarfio.Three clubs — North Melbourne, Collingwood and Essendon — plus the AFL are in the market for chief executives and the Kangaroos are open to looking outside the footy bubble.While other candidates appear to be higher on the Kangaroos’ shortlist, Filopoulos boasts an impeccable resume and spent five years at Arden St earlier this century.He has worked as a chief executive of South Melbourne FC (1993-1999), Perth Glory (2015-2018) and Football Victoria (2018-2020).He was also chief commercial officer at Swimming Australia and worked as a director of sales, marketing and corporate affairs at North Melbourne (2002-2007) and Marvel Stadium (2007-2014).Filopoulos started working in footy at Hawthorn as director of sales and corporate marketing from 1999-2002, but has been out of the AFL system since leaving Arden St in 2007.However Filopoulos’ background has him a highly-sought after candidate and those who have worked with him have praised his passion for gender balance in the workplace.The Kangaroos have cast their net wide and it's understood more than 20 candidates have been interviewed for the role.Jen Watt, who is general manager of commercial operations and partnerships at the Melbourne Cricket Club, is considered a frontrunner.Watt is highly-regarded by MCC boss Stuart Fox and has a strong relationship with former Melbourne and Essendon chief executive Peter Jackson, who is helping North Melbourne secure its new boss.Watt spent 14 years at the Demons, overlapping with Jackson, and was awarded the AFL’s Graeme Samuel Scholarship in 2016.The Herald Sun revealed on Friday the Kangaroos and Bombers had both reached out to Collingwood boss Mark Anderson, who resigned on Thursday.But Anderson is far more likely to pursue the Essendon job if he remains in the AFL.Former AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou has been helping the Roos in the background while external recruiting firm Six Degrees is leading the appointment process.Meanwhile, industry speculation has linked Craig Kelly to Collingwood’s top job.But Kelly is known to be reluctant to take up an official role at the club while his son, Will, is on the list. Kelly did not return the Herald Sun’s calls on Friday.As reported on Thursday, former Essendon chief executive Xavier Campbell plans to travel to France shortly with his wife after launching a beer called ‘Travla’ with his Echuca mate.EX-PIES BOSS LINKED WITH TWO RIVAL CLUBS Essendon and North Melbourne sounded out Collingwood chief executive Mark Anderson for their vacant top jobs before he resigned from the Magpies after five seasons in charge.Anderson is understood to be weighing up whether to remain in football or start fresh in another industry after he departs Collingwood on November 16.The Magpies were aware of the approaches to Anderson from their rivals but were unsure whether Anderson would land at Tullamarine or Arden St when he tendered his resignation to president Jeff Browne.Should Anderson stay in football it is more likely that would find his way to Essendon than the Roos.The Herald Sun linked former Bombers boss Xavier Campbell to Collingwood last month and speculation he could join the arch rival has intensified on the back of Anderson‘s departure.While there is a lot to play out, it is not impossible that Campbell and Anderson could switch clubs in 2023.Campbell is also understood to be considering spending 2023 in Europe to further his professional development.Campbell has enjoyed studying overseas and flew in and out of Singapore to complete his executive MBA in 2018.Stream Over 50 Sports Live & On-Demand with Kayo.

He navigated a turbulent period that included the departures of coach Nathan Buckley, president Eddie McGuire, the Do Better racism report and Covid.The board was happy to accept Anderson’s resignation and he spoke to staff at the club’s headquarters on Thursday.While Anderson’s decision came as somewhat of a surprise, his tenure was consistent with his previous chief executive stints.Anderson also spent five years in charge of Swimming Australia (2013-2018) and Hockey Australia (2008-2013).He worked at the Bombers as their chief commercial officer from 2005-08 alongside current AFL executive Travis Auld, who is a strong contender to secure the top job at Tullamarine.“With the club in great shape I feel it is the right time for me to move on,” Anderson said.The Herald Sun revealed last week that respected Brisbane Lions boss Greg Swann was set to remain at the Gabba next year despite the vacancies in Melbourne.Browne paid tribute to Anderson.“We recognise Mark’s stewardship through the ongoing work of Do Better and we acknowledge his unwavering commitment to ensuring Collingwood continues to listen and learn from our First Nations people and their

athletes and staff with a quality high performance environment.”Magpies boss calls it quits—Matt TurnerCollingwood chief executive Mark Anderson has resigned after five years in the role.The Magpies released a statement on Thursday morning saying Anderson had stepped down and football manager Graham Wright would serve in the position in the interim.Anderson joined the Magpies in 2018, overseeing the club’s rise to the grand final that season.The last two years have proven something of a rollercoaster, featuring the release of the Do Better Report into the Magpies’ treatment of First Nations people, president Eddie McGuire’s resignation, coach Nathan Buckley’s departure and the club’s surprise climb to a preliminary final under Craig McRae.Collingwood president Jeff Browne said Anderson had shown great passion and commitment to the club.“We thank Mark for his guidance and expertise which has resulted in strong football and netball programs, record membership numbers, the highest home and away crowds in the competition and a club that has great momentum,” Browne said.“Each of our elite teams are performing well. “From a football perspective, Collingwood qualified for AFL finals in four of five seasons including a grand final in 2018 and two Preliminary Finals (2019 and 2022) while our AFLW team has qualified for the last three finals series and is about to embark on our next final’s campaign this weekend. “Mark has also overseen the Collingwood netball program which made great progress across season 2022, performing well to make finals.“We recognise Mark’s stewardship through the ongoing work of Do Better and we acknowledge his unwavering commitment to ensuring Collingwood continues to listen and learn from our First Nations people and their experiences.“From a facilities perspective, the club is currently completing a redevelopment at the AIA Vitality Centre which will position us well for on-field success by providing all athletes and staff with a quality high performance environment. “As a club, our wider community programs have also continued to grow and strengthen.“On behalf of the board, we sincerely thank Mark and his wife Michelle for their absolute commitment and support of the Collingwood Football Club. “Mark is a very talented executive and I wish him well for whatever future endeavours he may turn his many talents to.” Anderson said he was grateful for the opportunity to have been in the role but believed the time was right to move on.“Collingwood is truly a club that is made by many and whose members and supporters are the most loyal, dedicated and passionate fans across the competition,” Anderson said.“One of the highlights throughout my time at the club has been seeing the Magpie Army return to the ‘G’ this year after two tough years impacted by the pandemic. “To feel the roar and atmosphere after another one of our amazing wins this season is something that I will always remember and treasure.“The Collingwood Football Club is a great club because of the quality of our people and it has been a pleasure to work alongside so many brilliant coaches, staff and players across each of our teams. “I want to especially

It feels like more.","content":"Australian fans celebrated as the home side pipped a plucky Afghanistan in yet another sensational World Cup finish at the Adelaide Oval.Australia were hoping to restrict them to under 106 to lift their run rate above England but there was never a chance of that.Australia now needs Sri Lanka to beat England on Saturday night at the SCG otherwise the home nation will surrender its title as world champions by failing to make the semi-finals. Already it has surrendered its white ball aura. Like Ireland in the previous game, Afghanistan may have been beaten but they were never overawed. Even as Australia struggled to get on top, world cricket fans luxuriated in the sight of another emerging nation playing without fear and plenty of flamboyance to rattle one of the big boys.If Australia makes an early exit there will be no tears or excuses. Australia has had some useful performances but has not really had a standout player and never really clicked.On a night where Australia was asked to do something outlandish it was a surprise to see them leave out it’s most outlandish bowler.Bill “Tiger’’ O’Reilly, the late, great leg-spinner from the Bradman era, would have rolled in his grave at news of the omission of white ball star Mitchell Starc, not that the great man ever saw a game of T20 cricket.Tiger had a theory – supported by bowlers of most eras - that bowlers were often dropped by selectors far quicker than batsmen and his thoughts on Starc being dropped after the patience showed to Aaron Finch would no doubt have been typically strident. Starc stands as one of Australia’s greatest white ball bowlers of all time. No matter what his recent form says, he was unlucky, especially as his absence meant sending an undercooked Kane Richardson out to try and raise a sinking ship.Cricviz analyst Ben Jones sensed Starc’s position in the side was vulnerable after he did a mid-tournament deep dive into his performances over the past few years.It’s not as if Starc was going poorly – but just lacking his world class snap and crackle.Cricviz revealed that since the start of 2021 Starc has bagged just four Powerplay wickets in 22 innings and his average speed this year – 140kph – was his lowest for a decade.This suggests he has not been the robust enforcer with a reputation for rattling teams with an irresistible cocktail of pace and swing. That being the case he was shunted to the middle overs in recent overs where he could muscle up with reasonable pace and bounce.Normally when a big time player is dropped the critics are calling for it long before the selectors make a move. Rarely does it sneak up on you. This one did.If Australia make the semi-finals it would be a surprise if Starc is not recalled on his home ground.World Cups are won by heavy duty players who tend to rise for big moments - no matter what their recent statistics say.","pubDate":"2022-11-04 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Happy Birthday Virat Kohli: Best birthday wishes for King Kohli on 34th birthday","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-happy-birthday-virat-kohli-best-birthday-wishes-for-king-kohli-on-34th-birthday/","keywords":["Cricket","Virat Kohli","Virat Kohli birthday"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Indian Cricket team’s very own superstar and former all-format skipper Virat Kohli is 34-years-‘young’ today, and there perhaps could not be a better happy birthday for King Kohli on his Cricketing career front, especially after what all has transpired in the past one year or so.

But it inevitably arrived. In the format (T20) which he himself least expected it to, during the Asia Cup 2022 fixture . But, when it did, it made sure to roar so loud and deafening that all the naysayers and detractors had no other option but to hide for cover, as Kohli had arrived yet again to rise and shine. As things stand presently, Virat Kohli is the , having smashed three half-centuries across four innings already, at a jaw-dropping average of 220.0, and strike rate of 144.73. As for the records, he is way above the active players across formats in almost all disciplines of batting. Despite having scored an international century after almost a three-year gap in September this year, Virat Kohli still averages 49.53, 57.68, and 53.13 in the Test, ODI, and T20I respectively.

There are no winners in these narratives. Both parties, the sports and their corporate sponsors came off looking terrible.","content":"In life it is important you know what you stand for. When you do, it becomes very clear when to fight and when to walk away. Values form the strong foundation for success and I have learnt they can vary personally and professionally. When I was coaching the Australian cricket team our shared goal was to “Make Australians Proud”. This was united from the top down and it made life clear and simple. Developing great cricketers AND great people was high priority. Call them values or expectations, but there were also clear guidelines of the expected behaviours within the group. These parameters were important, and within them, we respected that everyone would go about their business a little differently. Mitchell Woodcock Tim Clarke Professionalism, honesty, humility, learning and mateship. These simple words helped us with our decision-making and offered a simple guide to how we would become a successful team. These weren’t my personal values but rather the behaviours I had seen through 25 years of involvement in Australian cricket. They worked and they were important. There has been much commentary in recent weeks about sponsorship in sport. The spotlight has been shone upon netball, cricket and the AFL. This has been interesting for me because it highlights a common mistake made in leadership. If you know what you stand for, decisions become clear and effective. If you don’t, you are in trouble. When you try to please everyone, you generally please no one. But at least when an organisation or individual knows what they stand for, their lives, in an increasingly difficult and judgmental world, become imminently easier. Currently, holes can be picked in almost everything. Unless you have something to fall back on — which is a strong foundation of values — then you will get caught up in an inferno of criticism. There is no fun in that. The problem comes when there is a gap between personal and collective opinion. This will always occur, but with transparency, honest conversations, respect and a win/win philosophy, issues can be avoided. This week I listened to an interview between journalist Gerard Whateley and swimming great Kieren Perkins. I have never met our Olympic champion but his articulate and intelligent perspective of the sponsorship sagas was worth listening to. Kieren is now the chief executive of the Australian Sports Commission. In the firestorm of debate, he offered a balanced assessment. He is also in a unique position to talk on this subject. Not only was he one of the most marketable athletes of his generation, but now, he would have regular negotiations with the government and corporate sponsors in his ASC leadership role. In the interview, Kieren talked about the need for strong relationships based on shared values. “I think one of the things that you can’t change about the human condition is that we all have opinions and we all have things that we stand for, don’t stand for, agree with, don’t agree with,” he said. “As an athlete, I know it’s been 20-plus years but the corporations that I signed contracts with to sponsor me, the conversation started with an alignment of values and beliefs. I never entertained signing up with organisations that I didn’t see an alignment with. “Finding the right partnerships is absolutely key. “I’m pretty confident that ... every organisation and every group of individuals — if they are actually able to clearly communicate what their values and beliefs are, what the things are that they are willing to stand up and be heard about — there’s a lot of very good corporations in this country that are in a position to sponsor sport.” These days if you put your head above the parapet, you are likely to get it shot off. For some this is a good thing, for others it is a shame. Great partnerships and shared values generally go hand-in-hand. When there is a breakdown in these, there is usually a collapse in the love affair. How many happy divorces do you know of? Commonly, marriages end because of a dismantling of trust, respect or values. Or a lack of genuine communication. In the recent cases of cricket, AFL and netball, it was like watching a public divorce. There are no winners in these narratives. Both parties, the sports and their corporate sponsors, came off looking terrible. Often this is so avoidable, but today it seems more common. There was a nice moment this week which highlighted a different way to react to a perceived disagreement in opinion. At a Fortescue Metals Group event on Monday, Nyamal Pitjikarli elder, Aunty Doris Mitchell-Eaton used a welcome to country to share some of her personal views with Andrew Forrest, WA Deputy Premier Roger Cook, Elizabeth Gaines and others. On the surface, Mr Forrest may have been excused for being blindsided by the comments. Instead, he not only gave Aunty Doris a hug, but he smiled and said, “I was only too pleased”, with “that little story” that Aunty had promised to deliver. He also replied: “I’m really, really proud to ensure that, what we shook hands on in the first place, always stays.” I’m sure there’s more to that moment than we saw on our TV sets, but it struck me that when a disagreement arises, we can aggressively retaliate and get our backs up, OR we can have genuine respect for an alternative opinion, smile, take a breath and work through it. That sounds like a better option to me. John Gardiner a communications professional told me this week: “In business, as in life, disagreements, misunderstandings or issues between two or more parties are usually best dealt with by rolling up sleeves and working collaboratively to find a solution. “The Hancock Prospecting sponsorship of Netball Australia was trumpeted in various media releases as a partnership. What we have seen in recent weeks was anything but a partnership. “Rather, we have witnessed the foibles of the much-outdated sports sponsorship model. Ultimately, there was no solution (between them), an opportunity missed and both parties suffering reputational damage. And a first-class fail in communication. “At a time when competition for capital has never been greater, whether in the corporate, sporting or not-for-profit sectors, the ability to genuinely partner — rather than sponsor — has never been more profound.” Justin Langer Again, the word partnership stands out on the page. As does communication and collaboration. “Rolling up sleeves” conjures images of working hard. In this case TOGETHER. Marriage is a partnership that usually takes lots of communication and at times hard work. Done well, it is a brilliant unity of love, success, friendships and memories. The alternative is divorce, separation and often ugly outcomes. The same can be said in sport and business. As with divorce, it is often hard to remain friends with both parties. Sadly, you tend to take the side of one of the partners. That is something I have also noticed over the past few weeks in these debates. Either the players are good or bad, nothing in-between. The same as the corporations or sponsors. But it’s not really that simple, is it? Maybe I am wrong, but there is usually so many layers that none of us see. Coming up with a simple judgment of good, bad, right, wrong, just doesn’t feel right to me. Back to Kieren Perkins, and when asked about Pat Cummins’ perceived stance on Alinta Gas, he said: “I think for a lot of athletes who have seen Pat do that, it’s probably given them a little confidence that they can have an opinion, and their opinion needs to be recognised and needs to be heard. Human beings whether they’re businesspeople, athletes, or anyone else in between, having the right to make choices about the things that they will support and who they will support. We all do it every day. “But the athletes also need to understand that there is consequence to the choices that they make.” One of those consequences is financial but there is also the pile-on from the masses if they don’t agree with your opinion. This can be brutal. Black, white, right, wrong. Whilst I agree with Kieren’s sentiment about choice, consequence and confidence to be heard, athletes may become less likely to make their thoughts public. Even private. Pat Cummins, Donnell Wallam, Daisy Pearce and others would never have dreamed of the unintended exposure their personal stances on various matters would garner. They will now. These days if you put your head above the parapet, you are likely to get it shot off. For some this is a good thing, for others it is a shame. In my world, life can be so much easier if people work together, build relationships and respect varying opinions.

Pakistan launched a recovery from 48-4 to post 185-9 and then took regular wickets to deny South Africa in a chase shortened by rain to win by 33 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method. The result means Pakistan can still qualify for the semi-finals but need to beat Bangladesh on Sunday and hope South Africa fail to beat the Netherlands or India lose to Zimbabwe. They are indebted to Shadab Khan and Iftikhar Ahmed, who combined for a wild partnership of 82 from 35 balls. Shadab smashed 52 from 22 balls and Iftikhar a 35-ball 51 in an infectious display of hitting, to the delight of a raucous, Pakistan-dominated crowd. Then, after Temba Bavuma and Aiden Markram put on 49 in 27 balls to give South Africa hope, leg-spinner Shadab removed both within three deliveries. Rain arrived soon after, with the target reduced to 142 off 14 overs, South Africa needing 73 off 30 balls from 69-4. Heinrich Klaasen hinted at an improbable Proteas win by striking three fours in his first four balls after the restart but his dismissal, caught off Shaheen Afridi, allowed Pakistan to clinically close out the match.","pubDate":"2022-11-04 17:22:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"leadership","country":["nigeria"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"TNCA Annual Day: M.

Even the likes of Mohammad Amir , Babar Azam , and Haris Rauf , as well as many former Pakistani cricketers, are big fans of the Indian batting icon. In the T20 World Cup 2022, Kohli arguably produced his finest T20 performance ever in the match against Pakistan, scoring an unbeaten 82 to help Rohit Sharma's men secure a thrilling last-ball win in a group clash. Kohli is also the top-scoring batter in the tournament so far, having aggregated 220 runs in 4 matches. He has been dismissed only once in these 4 matches and has been crowned the 'Player of the Match' on two different occasions. He also has three half-centuries to his name in the tournament so far. Promoted Pakistan, on the other hand, have won only won 2 of their 4 group matches and are on the brink of elimination from the tournament. Following their defeat to India, Babar Azam & Co. also lost to Zimbabwe. They bounced back by defeating the Netherlands and South Africa in the subsequent matches but are still placed 3rd in the group standings. Neither of the two semi-final spots from Group 2 have been sealed yet, with a total of 4 teams in the running.","pubDate":"2022-11-04 14:26:07","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-11/udvu3hg_virat-kohli-afp-practice_625x300_04_November_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"All eyes on England at T20 World Cup as New Zealand make semis","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/all-eyes-on-england-at-t20-world-cup-as-new-zealand-make-semis/articleshow/95305625.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All eyes at the Twenty20 World Cup will fall on England against Sri Lanka on Saturday after New Zealand booked their place in the semi-finals and Australia just about stayed alive.

When Australia scored 168 for 8 in the first innings against Afghanistan in their final Super 12s game, the BlackCaps were officially declared one of the four semi-finalists in the tournament. Australia went on to win the game by four runs but failed to boost their net run-rate and now, semi-final fate is not in their hands. It means if England beat Sri Lanka by any margin on Saturday, they will progress to the last-four at the expense of the defending champions. In their Group 1, Ireland, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka have already been eliminated. By beating England at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Saturday, Sri Lanka could deny the 2010 champions from progressing to the next round. On Friday, Kane Williamson-led New Zealand defeated Ireland by 35 runs in their final Super 12 game. The Kiwi skipper was the Player of the Match for scoring a 35-ball 61, where he struck three sixes and five fours at a strike-rate of 174.29. After failing to reach the 50-run mark in the last four innings in the T20 World Cup, Williamson said he was \"happy to time a few balls well today.\" \"The ball held on the surface a little bit, I think the guys at the top were brilliant to give us the start and help us build the momentum. Then I think the spinners bowled brilliantly to get us the win. I was just trying to build some partnerships and contribute, happy to time a few balls as well today but it was a real team effort,\" Williamson said at the post-match presentation on Friday. The New Zealand captain also credited the Irish side for playing \"some amazing and challenging cricket.\" \"They [Ireland] played some amazing cricket, played some challenging cricket and we had to adapt well, which I thought we did. The ball was stopping on the surface, the openers made a great start and the rest of the batters adjusted well to the conditions, especially against spin. I wanted to take my options, work on partnerships, and speak with the batters about things to do going forward. We had to wait until the 9-over mark to get our first wicket. We needed to adjust our lines, bowl a bit slower and I thought the bowlers did so beautifully,\" added Williamson. T20 World Cup: Josh Little is a class operator, says Ireland captain Andy Balbirnie Ireland bowler Josh Little clinched a hat-trick against New Zealand at Adelaide Oval and got a special mention from his skipper Andy Balbirnie. \"We played a top-class team and when you play such teams, you need to capitalize on all opportunities. We bowled well right through the tournament, the fielding was a bit off. (Coming to today) It was nice to set-up a platform - that has been a trend in this tournament, but we needed someone to kick on from there. \"We're quite happy with what we achieved (in the tournament), compared to where we were in the last 12 months, we have improved a lot, especially against good teams and we are looking forward to meeting these sides once again,\" added Balbirnie. Speaking of Little, who finished with figures of 3 for 22 in his quota of four overs, Balbirnie said,\" He's a class operator and showed it today.\"","pubDate":"2022-11-04 14:04:55","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/11/04/500x300_1319124-andy-balbirnie.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mohammad Nabi Steps Down As Afghanistan Captain: Full Statement","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/mohammad-nabi-steps-down-as-afghanistan-captain-upon-conclusion-of-t20-world-cup-campaign-3491018","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["NDTV"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mohammad Nabi on Friday announced that he has decided to step down as the captain of Afghanistan men's cricket team","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-04 13:52:23","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-11/mfbg2uq_mohammad-nabi-afp_625x300_04_November_22.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Aussie cricket legend Adam Gilchrist opens up about shocking loss of Rod Marsh, Shane Warne and Andrew Symonds","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/aussie-cricket-legend-adam-gilchrist-opens-up-about-shocking-loss-of-rod-marsh-shane-warne-and-andrew-symonds-c-8762037","keywords":null,"creator":["Kellie Balaam"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australian cricket champion Adam Gilchrist has opened up about the harrowing loss of three of the sport’s greatest figures who he says were not only former team players, but also his best mates.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-04 13:33:26","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-8762037/ad8731a272f3c3db1e33d8b236a3ce2950b826aa-16x9-x1y0w2446h1376.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Weather in Sydney Cricket Ground tomorrow: SCG Stadium weather tomorrow 5th November 2022 Sri Lanka vs England weather forecast","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-weather-in-sydney-cricket-ground-tomorrow-scg-stadium-weather-tomorrow-5th-november-2022-sri-lanka-vs-england-weather-forecast/","keywords":["Cricket","England","ICC T20 World Cup 2022","SCG","Sri Lanka","Sydney Cricket Ground"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"The conclusion of ICC T20 World Cup 2022 Match 38 between Australia and Afghanistan in Adelaide has instantaneously diverted all the attention towards Sydney Cricket Ground – venue for the last Group 1 Super 12 match between England and Sri Lanka tomorrow.

Fortune of age-old rivals England and Australia will be decided via the result of England-Sri Lanka clash. Only match to be played on Saturday, an English victory will confirm a semi-final berth for them. Australia, on the other hand, are hoping for Sri Lanka to defeat England for the first time after eight years in order for them to qualify for the semi-finals. The same has already been validated by all-rounder Glenn Maxwell and wicket-keeper batter Matthew Wade. Currently, Australia (7) are at the second position on Group 1 points table followed by England (5). A victory will equal both Australia and England’s points but the latter will qualify due to a superior NRR (Net Run Rate). Weather in Sydney Cricket Ground tomorrow A major development in the affirmative with respect to November 5 in Sydney is the presence of conducive weather for live action to happen without any major interruption. Considering Australia’s weather in the ongoing summer thus far, a last-minute change in plans of the weather gods could still play a bit of a spoilsport. However, as far as the weather prediction is concerned, there is absolutely no probability of rain in Sydney throughout the day tomorrow. Preparing at the @SCG Another massive match ahead #T20WorldCup | #England pic.twitter.com/NifYbrlmLk — England Cricket (@englandcricket) November 4, 2022 According to weather portal AccuWeather, weather in the city will remain cool and pleasant on Saturday. Speaking particularly about the evening match hours, temperature will remain between 17-19 degree with a 0% rain probability. Australia, who were at the suffering end of one of the four abandoned matches in this World Cup, would have benefited from a rain abandoned England-Sri Lanka T20I. However, even that has worked against the home team in what is a tense situation for them.
