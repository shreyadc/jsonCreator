To remark that England chased down their highest ever target in Test match history against India at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground, would be a massive understatement. The Joe Root‚ÄìJonny Bairstow juggernaut which wrecked havoc on the Indian bowlers on Day 4, managed to deflate whatever spirits remained in the Indian camp on the final day, to register a 7-wicket victory while returning back unscathed only after stitching a 315-ball 269-run stand for the 4th wicket. While Bairstow (114*) smashed his 12th Test ton, and his sixth this year ‚Äì the joint-most for an English player in a calendar year, Root (142*) went on to score his 5th Test century this year as well, to further strengthen their position at the top of the list of highest run-scorers in 2022. As for team India, they lost a golden opportunity to win their first away Test series victory versus England since 2007, especially after remaining in the driver‚Äôs seat on the first three days of the Test. Thus, just like every thing comes to an end, this wonderfully contested series too ended at a 2-2 stalemate, with the action to now shift towards the limited-Overs series starting tomorrow, with the 3-match T20I series. The 8th largest run-chase in history has been a stroll in the park. Bat hasn‚Äôt faced a challenge from the ball for the last 200 runs ‚Äî Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) July 5, 2022 Next Test series of India With the Asia Cup set to be played in the T20 format in August-September this year, followed by the T20 World Cup in Australia, team India would now focus all its attention especially towards the shortest format of the game. Thus the Rohit Sharma-led side would play their next Test series only after the T20 World Cup, with a two-match away Test series versus Bangladesh in November-December 2022. After the completion of the three-match ODI and T20I series against England by July 17, the team would tour West Indies for a three-match ODI and five-match T20I series. Australia is also slated to tour India in October-November this year, for three T20Is and a four-match Test series. However, it is learnt that the Tests would be played later in February-March in 2023. The schedule for the same, however, has not been announced as yet.

Set 378, more than any other England team have made in the fourth innings to win a Test, the hosts achieved their target with more than two sessions to spare as Joe Root (142 not out) and Jonny Bairstow (114 not out) saw them to a victory that ensured the five-match series ended level at 2-2. AFP Sport looks at three things we learned from an enthralling contest: No target off limits for EnglandCricket followers may have to revise their concept of a 'stiff chase' if England keep batting like this in the fourth innings of a Test. England's pursuit of 378 in Birmingham followed successful chases of 277, 299 and 296 during a 3-0 whitewash of world champions New Zealand and this latest success means they have now won all four of their Tests under the new leadership duo of captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum . The in-form Root and Bairstow batted superbly, but one of the most impressive aspects of the Edgbaston run-chase was the performance of the struggling Alex Lees and Zak Crawley , who shared a century opening stand in 19.5 overs -- the fastest in England Test history. Kohli theatrics no substitute for runsIndia star Virat Kohli is one of the outstanding batsmen of his generation as evidenced by a record of over 8,000 runs including 27 hundreds at an average of nearly 50 from 102 Tests. But scores of 11 and 20 at Edgbaston mean he has not scored an international century in any format since 2019, with the 33-year-old having just endured his worst IPL season for 13 years. His attempts, while fielding, to wind up the England batsmen in Birmingham saw Kohli spoken to by the umpires. But few international players allow themselves to be 'talked out' and former India captain Kohli's actions looked like those of a man desperately trying to compensate for a lack of runs. Promoted Slow play a blight on the gameEntertaining as much of the play was, there were times when both England and India were guilty of deliberately slowing the game down, particularly when batsmen tried to wind down the clock near the end of a day's play to ensure they did not face a full allocation of overs. India were, however, fined 40 percent of their match fee and docked two World Test Championship points for maintaining a slow over-rate.","pubDate":"2022-07-05

The Joe Root‚ÄìJonny Bairstow juggernaut which wrecked havoc on the Indian bowlers yesterday, managed to deflate whatever spirits remained in the Indian camp on the final day, to register a 7-wicket victory while returning back unscathed only after stitching a 315-ball 269-run stand for the 4th wicket. A new era of Test cricket #ENGvIND pic.twitter.com/lLpAtG4fgR ‚Äî England Cricket (@englandcricket) July 5, 2022 While the Indian bowlers looked uncharacteristically clueless in their bid to find the answer to the near flawless display of English batsmenship, they not only had to surrender after being overwhelmed, but the Jasprit Bumrah-led side also were docked off two World Test Championship (WTC) points of the ongoing 2021-23 cycle, for maintaining a slow Over-rate. ICC WTC Points Table 2023 The development might well prove to be costly for the Indian Cricket team, as far as their hopes of making it through to their second successive WTC finals are concerned. As per Article 16.11.2 of the ICC World Test Championship playing conditions, a team is docked one point for each over short. Team India were found to be two Overs short after the rescheduled fifth Test match in Edgbaston today, and were resultantly penalised with two points. While the team has also been fined with 40% of their match fee for the same reason (20% for each Over short), they have now slipped down to the fourth position in the WTC points table, below Australia, South Africa, and Pakistan with 52.08 percentage points under their belt after 12 matches. ICC Test Championship points table 2022 to 2023 Team India would play a total of six more Test matches ‚Äì four versus Australia (home) and two against Bangladesh (away) in the WTC 2021-23 cycle. They would have to win all these Tests to make it through to the championship final. Click here to take a look at the updated ICC Test championship points table (2021-23).

The Yorkshire duo of Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root hammered the visiting bowlers as they put up 269 runs for the unbeaten fourth-wicket stand and helped England register their highest successful chase in Test cricket. England chased down 378 runs in 76.4 overs, which was also the highest successful chase against India in the longest format. Speaking at the post-match presentation, Bumrah said that even if you have three good days, it is enough and that's the beauty of Test cricket. \"We fell short with the bat yesterday and that is where we let the opposition in to let the match slip away from us. Ifs and buts can always be there. If you go back, if there was no rain in the first match, we could have won the series. But England played really well. We have drawn the series and both teams played very good cricket and it was a fair result,\" said Bumrah after India's seven-wicket loss. Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja scored a century each in India's first innings and Bumrah acknowledged the pair's efforts. The stand-in skipper also added that he enjoyed the challenge of captaincy and it was a great experience. \"Pant takes his chances. He and Jaddu got us back into the game with their counter-attack. We were ahead in the game. He takes his chances, backs himself, and I'm very happy for him. Dravid is always there to guide us and back us. We could have been a little straighter in our bowling lines and use the variable bounce. The captaincy future is not what I decide. I like the responsibility. It was a good challenge, a new challenge. It was an honour to lead the team and a great experience,\" added Bumrah.2‚É£3‚É£ wicketsBest bowling Figures (In Innings): 5‚É£/6‚É£4‚É£An average of 2‚É£2‚É£.4‚É£7‚É£#TeamIndia's Player of the Series is @Jaspritbumrah93 üëè üëè #ENGvIND pic.twitter.com/APkOhYC1tJ‚Äî BCCI (@BCCI) July 5, 2022 Bumrah was named as India's Player of the Series as the fast bowler finished the five-match Test series with 23 wickets.

Read full story","content":"BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - As if the seven-wicket loss against England was not bad enough, India were docked two World Test Championship (WTC) points for their slow over rate in the rearranged fifth test at Edgbaston. The tourists were found to be two overs behind the over rate which also led to a fine of 40% of the match fees, the governing International Cricket Council (ICC) said in a statement on Tuesday. The points penalty meant India dropped below Pakistan in the WTC rankings to the fourth spot, with Australia at the top followed by South Africa. The top two teams will reach the WTC summit clash. India lost to New Zealand in last year's final of the competition's inaugural edition. India held a 2-1 lead going into the Edgbaston test where England pulled off an epic chase to level the series. The tourists dominated the first three days of the see-saw contest and looked in the box seat with a handy lead of 132 on a pitch with variable bounce. They could not capitalise on it though, and England pulled off their highest successful chase with two sessions to spare. Makeshift captain Jasprit Bumrah blamed the loss on India's poor batting in the second innings when they were all out for 245. \"I think yesterday we fell short with the bat, and we had to come back with the ball,\" Bumrah said. \"That is the phase where we let the opposition in, and the momentum kept shifting away from us.\" Bumrah was put in charge of the side after regular skipper Rohit Sharma tested positive for COVID-19. That also meant India had to send Cheteshwar Pujara, who bats at number three, to partner Shubman Gill at the top of the order. \"They played better than us in the second innings and won the game,\" Bumrah said. \"So yeah, hard-fought series, but that's the ideal result, isn't it? Both teams played good cricket.\" (Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; editing by Clare Fallon)","pubDate":"2022-07-05 15:11:00","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/07/05/1648550.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my","country":["malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England cricket Tests 2022 results: England Test matches 2022 all match result","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-england-cricket-tests-2022-results-england-test-matches-2022-all-match-result/","keywords":["Cricket","England"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"England cricket Tests 2022 results: England have made amends to their form in Test cricket during the ongoing summer season.

England captain Ben Stokes has credited batters Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow for their individual centuries played a vital role in the team sealing a record-breaking 378-run chase against India in Birmingham today. Stokes, who talked about his job becoming easier due to heroic effort such as a match-winning 315-ball 269-run fourth-wicket partnership between Root and Bairstow, also acknowledged hard work put in by opening batters Alex Lees and Zac Crawley during a 107-run opening partnership yesterday. ‚ÄúWhen you have clarity like we have in the dressing room, it makes chasing totals like this easier. 378 would have been scary five weeks ago but now it‚Äôs all good,‚Äù Stokes told Sky Sports after England beat India by 7 wickets to draw level the five-match series 2-2 .

England‚Äôs refreshing approach to Test cricket has seen them turning the tables in the ongoing summer season. Having lost two and drawn three out of their first five Test matches in 2022, England have now won four on the trot since the arrival of McCullum. ‚ÄúWe are trying to rewrite how Test cricket is played in England. All our plans from the last four-five weeks is what we want to take ahead. Bowling on the top of off isn‚Äôt important, it is all about taking ten wickets. We know that we want to give some new life to Test cricket,‚Äù Stokes added. Set to host South Africa for a three-match Test series at the end of the English summer, it would be interesting to see how the same pans out for England.","pubDate":"2022-07-05 14:58:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs ENG, 5th Test: Virat Kohli trolled by England Cricket, Indian fans hit back - Check Here","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-vs-eng-5th-test-virat-kohli-trolled-by-england-cricket-indian-fans-hit-back-check-here-2481913.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Riding on twin century by Jonny Bairstow England won the fifth Test and levelled the series 2-2.","content":"Former India captain Virat Kohli was trolled by England Cricket Board's official Twitter handle after Team India's 7-wicket loss against the host in the fifth Test at the Edgbaston, Birmingham on Tuesday.

India were docked two points and fined 40% of their match fee for maintaining a slow overrate during their seven-wicket defeat to England in the Edgbaston Test. Match referee David Boon, who imposed the sanction on the visiting side, declared that Jasprit Bumrah and Co were two overs short. In accordance with Article 2.22 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel which relates to minimum over-rate offences, players are fined 20% of their match fee for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time. In addition, as per Article 16.11.2 of the ICC WTC playing conditions, a side is penalised one point for each over short. Consequently, two WTC points were deducted from India's points total. Stand-in India captain Bumrah pleaded guilty to the offence and accepted the proposed sanction, so there was no need for a formal hearing. This was the third time in the ongoing WTC cycle that India lost points due to a slow overrate. They lost two points in Nottingham and another point in Centurion, taking their tally of deducted points to five. The latest penalty saw India's Points Percentage drop down to 52.08, while Pakistan's 52.38. Pakistan, who are above India at present in the WTC table due to a superior percentage (42 points), still have fewer points than India (75 points). Australia and South Africa continue to lead the way with scores of 77.78 and 71.43 respectively. Pat Cummins and Co are yet to lose a Test in the WTC 2021-23 cycle and are the only side to be unbeaten. While India have lost four, Pakistan and the Proteas have lost two each. Incidentally, Australia missed making the final of the inaugural WTC final because of an overrate offence in the Boxing Day Test of 2020 against India. ùóòùóªùó¥ùóπùóÆùóªùó± ùó™ùóúùó°!! üôåHighest ever run chase by England in Test cricket.

Former England captain Root paid tribute to Bairstow, saying: ‚ÄúHe looks like he‚Äôs got a real clarity in how he wants to go about his cricket.

Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root combined for a record partnership in the 4th innings to register a historic win where both of them scored their centuries. Bairstow scored double centuries in the game. Edgbaston Racism cricket There have been constant efforts to remove racism from the game, but every now and then, some or other things happen that again highlight the importance of the issue. One such incident happened in the Birmingham test between England and India as well. Some of the Indian fans were racially abused by the Edgbaston crowd, and they went on Twitter to express the issue. They revealed that some racial comments were made on them by the crowd, and even after complaining the same to the stewards, no action was taken against them. England Cricket Board acknowledged the issue, and they also issued a statement on the same where they assured that they will look into the matter. ‚ÄúWe are very concerned to hear reports of racist abuse at today‚Äôs Test match. We are in contact with colleagues at Edgbaston who will investigate. There is no place for racism in cricket. Edgbaston has been working hard to create a safe and inclusive working environment,‚Äù ECB said in a statement. Barmy Army also condemned the racism incident that happened at the Edgbaston, and they showed their support to the Bharat Army group of Indian fans. ‚ÄúNeedless to say, we stand with our long-time friends of the Bharat Army and condemn strongly any racial abuse. We look forward to celebrating the joy of Test cricket with them again today no matter the result!,‚Äù Barmy Army tweeted.

The Indian cricket team have skittled England out for 284 and have fashioned a 132-run lead in the process. Prior to this game, there had been murmurs around how the Indian cricket team might struggle against the hosts‚Äô aggressive brand of cricket. On first-innings evidence, though, it couldn‚Äôt seem farther from the truth. At the end of day three, the Indian cricket team have a 257-run lead, meaning that even when they lose their last seven wickets for 120 runs, they have a healthy fourth-innings total of 378 to play with. Such a target, by the way, has never been chased by England in Test cricket. India, too, very rarely, allow opposition sides to hunt down more than 300 in the last innings. So, from many different standpoints, the game seems to be the Indian cricket team‚Äôs to lose. They obviously have to encounter England‚Äôs version of 'Bazball' but with Jasprit Bumrah , Mohammad Shami and Mohammed Siraj leading India‚Äôs charge, there is anticipation that they will get the job done. But then, things start going pear-shaped. The third ball Shami bowls is hacked away to the fence by Alex Lees . The boundary isn‚Äôt that important. It gets England four runs but the manner in which Lees marches down the track and swings with gay abandon, takes India aback. Zak Crawley , who has endured a wretched run in Test cricket since the start of 2021, has also grown in confidence at the other end. The drives that usually extracted edges are now sizzling off the middle of the bat through extra cover. You could even argue it takes the Indian cricket team close to 20 overs to recover. A change of ball, though, brings about a change of luck. Bumrah pitches a ball in the channel and gets it to deck back sharply, rattling Crawley‚Äôs off stump in the process. Post Tea, the Indian cricket team skipper continues weaving his magic, accounting for Ollie Pope with another excellent delivery. Joe Root then calls Lees through for a non-existent single and England, from being in control, are suddenly under pressure. The Indian cricket team, meanwhile, are grinning from ear to ear. Virat Kohli is celebrating as if there is no tomorrow. Bumrah‚Äôs tail is up. Shami is getting the ball to talk like he was always meant to. With England still requiring 269 runs to win, there are no doubts that India are the side in the ascendancy. Well, at least until Jonny Bairstow and Root take matters into their own hands. Prima facie, it would be very tempting to say that India have been outclassed by England. To an extent, they were at Edgbaston. From an Indian perspective, though, this was the third time they had not managed to defend a total in the fourth innings this year, despite seeming in control of the match. In Johannesburg, they had 240 to defend against South Africa. They had a world-class bowling attack at their disposal but floundered just when it mattered. The Proteas coasted to that target, scoring at more than 3.5 runs per over, with Dean Elgar starring. A game later, South Africa repeated the dose. Elgar wasn‚Äôt at the forefront, but Keegan Petersen was. The Proteas scored at 3.33 runs per over and comfortably chased down a 212-run target. The Indian cricket team also lost that series, despite surging into the lead in Centurion. At Edgbaston, something very similar happened. The Indian cricket team had 378 runs to defend but weren‚Äôt able to do so. England rattled along at just under 5 runs per over and put India under the sort of pressure they aren‚Äôt accustomed to. There are a few other damning patterns too. In all of these games, the Indian cricket team fashioned advantageous positions. On each occasion, though, they seemed afraid of grabbing the game by the scruff of its neck. In Cape Town, they allowed Petersen to dictate proceedings. In Johannesburg, they bombarded Elgar but South Africa still managed to score enough boundaries to keep themselves ahead. And in Birmingham, the Indian cricket team, for some reason, went into run-scoring mode even when England required more than 200 runs. Not only did they spread fields, they also used Ravindra Jadeja as a defensive option. The initial reaction could be to underplay it and suggest that Bumrah, who was captaining for the first time in Test cricket at Edgbaston, just missed a trick. However, this is an issue that has permeated Indian cricket, irrespective of who is in charge. For the record, they‚Äôve had three different captains in these games ( Kohli in Cape Town, KL Rahul in Johannesburg, and Bumrah at Edgbaston). So, the tactics are bound to have been dissimilar. The outcome, though, hasn‚Äôt been. Maybe then India are missing someone of Umesh Yadav‚Äôs ilk ‚Äì someone who can leak runs but someone who can break the game open. In the 21st century, Umesh has the ninth-best strike-rate (45) in the third and fourth innings of a Test match (minimum 50 wickets taken). When talking about victories, Umesh stands sixth (38.1) ‚Äì only behind Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj, Moeen Ali and Shami. Or, it could be a case of the Indian cricket team not being brave enough. They‚Äôve gotten themselves into situations where the game could‚Äôve been won. But by allowing the opposition an avenue back into the game, they‚Äôve almost always not made it count. They‚Äôve also been overeager at times, often gifting the opposition quick runs and turning over the momentum of the contest. The worrying bit, though, is that this hasn‚Äôt been a theme for large swathes of India‚Äôs cricketing history. Quite often, they‚Äôve been able to defend targets. They‚Äôve also been very tough to beat when they have runs on the board. That, however, is not a narrative they‚Äôve followed overseas in 2022. It could just be that they‚Äôve hit three stumbling blocks in succession. Or, it could be a much deeper malaise ‚Äì one where the mindset and the perceived lack of aggression become greater causes of concern. Whatever it is, it makes you question what‚Äôs up with the Indian cricket team and their fourth-innings bowling. At Edgbaston, they should never have let the game drift as much as they did. England played well but the Indian cricket team should never have been defeated so convincingly. They‚Äôve tried different captains but they‚Äôve had the same outcome. They‚Äôve auditioned it against different oppositions. Yet, have had the same outcome. Maybe then, it‚Äôs time to introspect and truly understand what might‚Äôve caused this. It won‚Äôt be easy, considering the Indian cricket team has, historically, not been bad at defending totals. But now that they are venturing into that territory, a quick solution seems the need of the hour. Else, the anticipation that surrounded their cricket at the end of day three at Edgbaston, will only morph into trepidation every time they have to defend a fourth-innings target against high-quality batting sides.
