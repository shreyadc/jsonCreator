FirstCricket Staff April 19th, 2023 2:23:18 IST Arjun Tendulkar celebrates the wicket of Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Sportzpics Australia all-rounder Cameron Green had been a revelation even before he made his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut for Mumbai Indians (MI). And on Tuesday, the platform was well set in Hyderabad for him to shine, and he surely impressed, with most of the damage being done with the bat. Having been acquired by MI for a whopping price tag of Rs 17.50, Green certainly came into the IPL with a lot of expectations. IPL 2023: Full coverage | Points table | Schedule | Results | Orange Cap | Purple Cap‚Äã And on Tuesday, it was not only about Green finally announcing his arrival on the big stage, but also justifying his price tag, and also giving a glimpse to the fans of what they could expect from the 23-year-old. Ummmmm, Cameron Green is the REAL DEAL! The Ashes is going to be one helluva series! ‚Äî Kevin Pietersenü¶è (@KP24) April 18, 2023 Green scored an unbeaten 64 while coming into bat at number three, and also finished with figures of 1/29 from four overs. It was certainly a performance to remember for Green, but he is just not getting carried away with the expectations. And there‚Äôs no reason to be. ‚ÄúI think first couple of games were a learning curve for me and our team. Bit of a sticky situation (when I walked out to bat). But glad the plans came off. I am a work in progress with my bowling at the death. Obviously, we can continue with the winning momentum,‚Äù said a confident Green at the post-match presentation ceremony. Not only Green, but Arjun Tendulkar too steals the limelight Cameron Green was not the only MI star who rose up to the big occasion. Arjun Tendulkar, son of cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar, finally made a mark in the IPL with his first-ever wicket in the cash-rich league. Arjun had been part of the MI setup in 2021 and 2022, but it is only this year that the 23-year-old is finally getting a chance to shine. A superb all-round performance by Mumbai Indians once again. Cameron Green impressed with both bat & ball. Ishan & Tilak‚Äôs batting is as good as it gets! The IPL is getting more interesting every day. Great going boys!üíô And finally a Tendulkar has an IPL wicket!üòõ #SRHvMI pic.twitter.com/e4MAFEZyjY ‚Äî Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) April 18, 2023 On Tuesday, Arjun was given with the responsibility of bowling the final over of the match, with SRH needing 20 runs off six balls. He began with a low full toss to Abdul Samad, that ended up as a dot ball, and the SRH batter was immediately run out the very next ball, with Hrithik Shokeen perfectly timing in a throw to Ishan Kishan, who whipped off the bails. Mayank Markande was the new batter in, and Markande was off the mark with a brace in the third ball of the over. SRH still needed 16 runs off the last three balls, and while it was certain by the end that MI would have the last laugh, Arjun delivered the final punch to the match in some fashion, to get rid of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and seal the match. Arjun unleashed a fuller ball to Bhuvneshwar, and Bhuvneshwar looked to go straight down the ground, but instead got an outside edge to Rohit Sharma at extra cover, who completed the catch. There‚Äôs still a long way to go in Arjun‚Äôs cricketing career, but to get off the mark with the ball in the IPL would certainly be a special feeling. ‚ÄúObviously it was great getting my first IPL wicket. I just had to focus on what was in hand, the plan and executing it. Our plan was just to bowl wide and get the long boundary into play, make the batsman hit it to the longer side. I love bowling, I am happy to bowl anytime the captain asks me to and just stick to the team plan and give my best,‚Äù said Arjun after the match. Lack of resistance from SRH batters SRH batters clearly found the going tough on Tuesday against MI, and much of their batting troubles were due to the inability of their batters to get off to good starts. #MumbaiIndians are on a rampage. @timdavid8 with two key catches as Klaasen and Mayank Agarwal depart in quick succession.

Agarwal looked set for a 50-plus score, and was almost like the central figure for SRH, even forging productive stands with Aiden Markram (22) and later Heinrich Klaasen (36), but lack of support from some of his other partners probably hurt SRH‚Äôs momentum going forward. Had the top order fired in full cylinders for SRH, the complexion of the game would have been slightly different, and maybe, that would have helped them get those 20 runs needed from the final over.

Sportzpics Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) skipper Aiden Markram admitted that his side were ‚Äònot at the best‚Äô against Mumbai Indians (MI) in their Indian Premier League (IPL) contest in Hyderabad on Tuesday. Sunrisers Hyderabad kept losing wickets at regular intervals as they failed to chase down a target of 193 against Mumbai Indians. The Hyderabad-based franchise were eventually restricted to 178, courtesy a clinical performance from MI‚Äôs bowlers. Most of their batters failed to get going. Mayank Agarwal (48) and Heinrich Klaasen (38) looked good, but were dismissed at crucial junctures, while Markram failed to convert a start into a big knock. ‚ÄúAll in all we were not at our best tonight. Credit to the boys for taking it deep. We could have done with conceding fewer runs towards the end. It (the surface) stayed pretty much the same throughout the night, on the slower side, not bad at all. Whenever we took pace off the ball did not come on to the bat,‚Äù said Markram at the post-match presentation ceremony. ‚ÄúWe made a call (to bowl first) before the toss and if the dew came in then we were in the game. There was a desperation to make things right from the previous season. Not too bummed, there are areas we can improve on and we will look to do that to give us a good chance to win the next game,‚Äù he added. Rohit Sharma, who has previously played for the now defunct-Deccan Chargers, briefly recalled his early days in the IPL. ‚ÄúI have got lot of memories here (in Hyderabad). I played three years here. Won a trophy as well. Love coming back here. To settle them (youngsters) in is important for us. We had a couple of guys who hadn‚Äôt played IPL before. We had to back them. They are coming into their own. I am enjoying what I am doing (with the bat),‚Äù said Rohit. ‚ÄúIt is a different role. I am trying to set the tempo. Glad to get some scores in the powerplay. I understand one of us has to bat big. We have a long batting line-up. We want these guys to come out and bat freely. We watched Tilak last season. We all know what he can. I love his approach. He doesn‚Äôt play the bowler, he plays the ball. We will see him play for a lot of teams,‚Äù he added. Rohit termed Arjun Tendulkar, who claimed his first wicket on Tuesday, as a confident bowler. ‚ÄúArjun has been a part of this team for three years. He understands what he wants to do. He is quite confident as well. He is clear in his plans. He is trying to swing the new ball and bowl yorkers at the death,‚Äù added Rohit. Cameron Green, the Player of the Match, was glad that the plans worked despite a ‚Äòsticky‚Äô situation. Green scored an unbeaten 64 and took a wicket during SRH‚Äôs reply. ‚ÄúI think first couple of games were a learning curve for me and our team. Bit of a sticky situation (when I walked out to bat).

They bowled well in patches,‚Äù said Karunaratne at the post-match press conference. ‚ÄúThe drawback was because Ireland has not played long in this format, their field settings and their bowling lines and lengths were not up to the mark.

The margin of victory was Sri Lanka‚Äôs largest in Test cricket, improving on the innings and 254-run win over Zimbabwe at Bulawayo in 2004. The match in fact ended in the final session of the third day with Ireland being bowled out for 143 and 168 in reply to Sri Lanka‚Äôs mammoth first innings total of 591-6 declared. The left-arm spin of Prabath Jayasuriya proved too much for the Irish batsmen to counter as they succumbed to him on ten occasions in both innings giving the bowler match figures of 10 for 108 to give him the Player of the Match award. Jayasuriya spun a web around the hapless Irish batsmen who had no answer to his wily spin finishing with career best innings figures of 7 for 52 in the first innings and following it up with 3 for 56 in the second. Apart from Jayasuriya, it was another left-arm bowler who caused misery to the Ireland batting. Seamer Vishwa Fernando achieved the initial breakthrough for Sri Lanka scalping Murray Commins and Captain Andrew Balbirnie in both innings to put Ireland on the back foot. After that it was a case of pure survival against the wiles of Jayasuriya and the off-breaks of Ramesh Mendis who was forced to play second fiddle as Jayasuriya took the centre stage with his prolific wicket-taking ability at Galle. Of the 43 wickets he has taken so far in his short Test career of six matches, 39 has come at Galle from four Tests. Sri Lanka didn‚Äôt take too long to capture the remaining three Irish wickets in the morning, wrapping up the innings in 37 minutes for the addition of 26 runs. That left Ireland trailing by a massive 448 runs in the first innings. Without any hesitation Sri Lanka enforced the follow-on, the first time they had done so since 2015. On that occasion too, the venue was Galle, and the opponents were West Indies who eventually lost the match by an innings and six runs following big hundreds from Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal and a ten-wicket haul by left-arm spinner Rangana Herath. Angelo Mathews was the captain. The morning session turned out to be another good one for Sri Lanka as they captured eight wickets for 67 runs with Ireland limping to lunch with half their side out for 41 and trailing by a massive 407 runs. But the afternoon saw some Irish grit as they lost only three wickets whilst adding 94 runs in the session largely due to a 60-run partnership off 129 balls for the sixth wicket between Harry Tector and Curtis Campher. Tector, a well-organised cricketer whom Ireland look to their future, put up a resolute performance with Campher (30) to stall the inevitable. In the first innings Tector scored 34 and added 70 for the third wicket with James McCollum. Playing spin and pace quite well and using the depth of the crease, Tector went onto score 42 priceless runs off 95 balls (4 fours) when his innings came to an unfortunate end. Tector had come to terms with the challenges in the middle when he attempted a quick run that was never there and slipped in mid-pitch, and failed to beat the return from Karunaratne from extra cover to wicket-keeper Sadeera Samarawickrama. Following Tector‚Äôs dismissal there was not much resistance from the tail as Sri Lanka wrapped up the Ireland second innings for 168, with Ramesh Mendis picking up four wickets to become the joint fastest Sri Lankan bowler to 50 Test wickets (11 Tests) with another off-spinner Dilruwan Perera who also achieved the landmark at Galle against Australia in 2016. Outstanding at forward short-leg was Nishan Madushka, a wicket-keeper/batsman who pulled off some astonishing catches in that position ‚Äì three in all, just when Ireland was settling into their batting. His performance reminded one of another former Sri Lankan stalwart Hashan Tillakaratne who also started off as a wicket-keeper and excelled in the position of a close-in fielder. The match turned out to be a one-way contest ever since Sri Lanka won the toss and piled up a score in excess of 500. With no proper first-class structure in place Ireland were left to learn the harsh lessons of Test cricket the hard way. Being only their fifth Test match since being elevated to Test ranks in 2017, it has been a whole new learning curve for the Irish. The second Test starts at the same venue on 24 April.","pubDate":"2023-04-18 19:11:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SRH vs MI: Arjun Tendulkar dismisses Bhuvneshwar Kumar to claim first-ever IPL wicket; Watch","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/srh-vs-mi-arjun-tendulkar-dismisses-bhuvneshwar-kumar-to-claim-first-ever-ipl-wicket-watch-12473962.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"SRH vs MI: Arjun Tendulkar dismisses Bhuvneshwar Kumar to claim first-ever IPL wicket; Watch","content":"Cricket SRH vs MI: Arjun Tendulkar dismisses Bhuvneshwar Kumar to claim first-ever IPL wicket; Watch Arjun, playing for Mumbai Indians, was tasked with the duty to defend 20 runs from the final over, with SRH looking to chase down a target of 193.

Green cracked an unbeaten 64 off 40 balls with six fours and two sixes as Mumbai Indians made 5-192. Harry Brook, who hit a maiden IPL century in his previous outing, looked in similar form as he opened with two sumptuous fours, but he was then surprised by a slower ball bouncer from Jason Behrendorff and dismissed for a seven-ball nine. With Behrendorff (2-37 off four) adding the wicket of Rahul Tripathi, Sunrisers Hyderabad were reduced to 2-25 in the fourth over. They never recovered and were bowled out off the penultimate ball for 178, 15 runs adrift. The final wicket was taken by Arjuna Tendulkar, son of the legendary Sachin, his first wicket in the IPL. The IPL is a huge event in its own right, but 60 days out from the first Test at Edgbaston every Anglo-Australian encounter is seen through an Ashes lens. Green's ability to cope with the stresses of being the most expensive Australian in the IPL, having been signed for $3.15m, augurs well for the pressure he will be under in England. The 23-year-old West Australian, who won a clutch of post-match awards, said: \"The first couple of games were a learning curve for me and the team but we've now won three in a row.\" Of his key role bowling at the death he added: \"It is a work in progress but you get better the more you get exposed to it.\" Green began slowly, assessing the pace of the pitch, then accelerated. He had good support from Ishan Kishan (38) and Tilak Varma (37). In a late cameo Tim David made 16 off 11 balls before being run out of the last delivery. After Behrendorff's early inroads Sunrisers rebuilt through Maynak Agarwal and skipper Aiden Markham (22), but the latter fell to Green's fourth ball as the all-rounder took a role with the ball, finishing with 1-29 off four overs. Indians ultimately fielded a quartet of Australians with Green, Behrendorff and David joined by Riley Meredith, who was introduced as an 'impact substitute'. He had an impact too, dismissing Agarwal (48 off 41) and Marco Jansen (13 off six) as he took 2-33 in his four overs. They were two of a quartet of fine catches taken on the long on boundary by David, which included Heinrich Klassen, who had threatened to transform the match with 36 off 16. David added a run-out to complete a fielding five-for. Meredith had been omitted from the initial XI despite Jofra Archer being unavailable for the fourth successive match. The quick's continued absence is a concern for England as the problem is his troublesome right elbow. Archer has twice had surgery on the elbow joint spending much of the last two years either injured or recuperating. England's medical team have been working closely with their Mumbai counterparts and it is understood Archer is working towards returning against Punjab Kings on April 22 or Gujarat Titans three days later. Archer's setback has dented confidence that he will be play a major role in the Ashes with his county, Sussex, indicating he is unlikely to play first-class cricket for them before the series starts. That would leave Archer going into the Ashes with just a series of four-over T20 spells behind him, that would seem inadequate preparation for five-day Tests. - with PA Sign up for our emails","pubDate":"2023-04-18 18:02:10","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-10386555/546724dcb2af0fbbc5d34ce8d44c10f531885c06-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SRH vs MI Live Score: Big Blow For SRH!

And on Tuesday, the platform was well set in Hyderabad for him to shine, and he surely impressed, with most of the damage being done with the bat. Having been acquired by MI for a whopping price tag of Rs 17.50, Green certainly came into the IPL with a lot of expectations.

Ummmmm, Cameron Green is the REAL DEAL! The Ashes is going to be one helluva series! ‚Äî Kevin Pietersenü¶è (@KP24) April 18, 2023 Green scored an unbeaten 64 while coming into bat at number three, and also finished with figures of 1/29 from four overs. It was certainly a performance to remember for Green, but he is just not getting carried away with the expectations. And there‚Äôs no reason to be. ‚ÄúI think first couple of games were a learning curve for me and our team. Bit of a sticky situation (when I walked out to bat). But glad the plans came off. I am a work in progress with my bowling at the death. Obviously, we can continue with the winning momentum,‚Äù said a confident Green at the post-match presentation ceremony. Not only Green, but Arjun Tendulkar too steals the limelight Cameron Green was not the only MI star who rose up to the big occasion. Arjun Tendulkar, son of cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar, finally made a mark in the IPL with his first-ever wicket in the cash-rich league. Arjun had been part of the MI setup in 2021 and 2022, but it is only this year that the 23-year-old is finally getting a chance to shine. A superb all-round performance by Mumbai Indians once again.

He began with a low full toss to Abdul Samad, that ended up as a dot ball, and the SRH batter was immediately run out the very next ball, with Hrithik Shokeen perfectly timing in a throw to Ishan Kishan, who whipped off the bails. Mayank Markande was the new batter in, and Markande was off the mark with a brace in the third ball of the over. SRH still needed 16 runs off the last three balls, and while it was certain by the end that MI would have the last laugh, Arjun delivered the final punch to the match in some fashion, to get rid of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and seal the match. Arjun unleashed a fuller ball to Bhuvneshwar, and Bhuvneshwar looked to go straight down the ground, but instead got an outside edge to Rohit Sharma at extra cover, who completed the catch. There‚Äôs still a long way to go in Arjun‚Äôs cricketing career, but to get off the mark with the ball in the IPL would certainly be a special feeling. ‚ÄúObviously it was great getting my first IPL wicket. I just had to focus on what was in hand, the plan and executing it. Our plan was just to bowl wide and get the long boundary into play, make the batsman hit it to the longer side. I love bowling, I am happy to bowl anytime the captain asks me to and just stick to the team plan and give my best,‚Äù said Arjun after the match. Lack of resistance from SRH batters SRH batters clearly found the going tough on Tuesday against MI, and much of their batting troubles were due to the inability of their batters to get off to good starts. #MumbaiIndians are on a rampage. @timdavid8 with two key catches as Klaasen and Mayank Agarwal depart in quick succession.

Agarwal looked set for a 50-plus score, and was almost like the central figure for SRH, even forging productive stands with Aiden Markram (22) and later Heinrich Klaasen (36), but lack of support from some of his other partners probably hurt SRH‚Äôs momentum going forward. Had the top order fired in full cylinders for SRH, the complexion of the game would have been slightly different, and maybe, that would have helped them get those 20 runs needed from the final over.

Sunrisers Hyderabad kept losing wickets at regular intervals as they failed to chase down a target of 193 against Mumbai Indians. The Hyderabad-based franchise were eventually restricted to 178, courtesy a clinical performance from MI‚Äôs bowlers. Most of their batters failed to get going. Mayank Agarwal (48) and Heinrich Klaasen (38) looked good, but were dismissed at crucial junctures, while Markram failed to convert a start into a big knock. ‚ÄúAll in all we were not at our best tonight. Credit to the boys for taking it deep. We could have done with conceding fewer runs towards the end. It (the surface) stayed pretty much the same throughout the night, on the slower side, not bad at all. Whenever we took pace off the ball did not come on to the bat,‚Äù said Markram at the post-match presentation ceremony. ‚ÄúWe made a call (to bowl first) before the toss and if the dew came in then we were in the game. There was a desperation to make things right from the previous season. Not too bummed, there are areas we can improve on and we will look to do that to give us a good chance to win the next game,‚Äù he added. Rohit Sharma, who has previously played for the now defunct-Deccan Chargers, briefly recalled his early days in the IPL. ‚ÄúI have got lot of memories here (in Hyderabad). I played three years here. Won a trophy as well. Love coming back here. To settle them (youngsters) in is important for us. We had a couple of guys who hadn‚Äôt played IPL before. We had to back them. They are coming into their own. I am enjoying what I am doing (with the bat),‚Äù said Rohit. ‚ÄúIt is a different role. I am trying to set the tempo. Glad to get some scores in the powerplay. I understand one of us has to bat big. We have a long batting line-up. We want these guys to come out and bat freely. We watched Tilak last season. We all know what he can. I love his approach. He doesn‚Äôt play the bowler, he plays the ball. We will see him play for a lot of teams,‚Äù he added. Rohit termed Arjun Tendulkar, who claimed his first wicket on Tuesday, as a confident bowler. ‚ÄúArjun has been a part of this team for three years. He understands what he wants to do. He is quite confident as well. He is clear in his plans. He is trying to swing the new ball and bowl yorkers at the death,‚Äù added Rohit.

The margin of victory was Sri Lanka‚Äôs largest in Test cricket, improving on the innings and 254-run win over Zimbabwe at Bulawayo in 2004. The match in fact ended in the final session of the third day with Ireland being bowled out for 143 and 168 in reply to Sri Lanka‚Äôs mammoth first innings total of 591-6 declared. The left-arm spin of Prabath Jayasuriya proved too much for the Irish batsmen to counter as they succumbed to him on ten occasions in both innings giving the bowler match figures of 10 for 108 to give him the Player of the Match award. Jayasuriya spun a web around the hapless Irish batsmen who had no answer to his wily spin finishing with career best innings figures of 7 for 52 in the first innings and following it up with 3 for 56 in the second. Apart from Jayasuriya, it was another left-arm bowler who caused misery to the Ireland batting. Seamer Vishwa Fernando achieved the initial breakthrough for Sri Lanka scalping Murray Commins and Captain Andrew Balbirnie in both innings to put Ireland on the back foot. After that it was a case of pure survival against the wiles of Jayasuriya and the off-breaks of Ramesh Mendis who was forced to play second fiddle as Jayasuriya took the centre stage with his prolific wicket-taking ability at Galle. Of the 43 wickets he has taken so far in his short Test career of six matches, 39 has come at Galle from four Tests. Sri Lanka didn‚Äôt take too long to capture the remaining three Irish wickets in the morning, wrapping up the innings in 37 minutes for the addition of 26 runs. That left Ireland trailing by a massive 448 runs in the first innings. Without any hesitation Sri Lanka enforced the follow-on, the first time they had done so since 2015. On that occasion too, the venue was Galle, and the opponents were West Indies who eventually lost the match by an innings and six runs following big hundreds from Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal and a ten-wicket haul by left-arm spinner Rangana Herath. Angelo Mathews was the captain. The morning session turned out to be another good one for Sri Lanka as they captured eight wickets for 67 runs with Ireland limping to lunch with half their side out for 41 and trailing by a massive 407 runs. But the afternoon saw some Irish grit as they lost only three wickets whilst adding 94 runs in the session largely due to a 60-run partnership off 129 balls for the sixth wicket between Harry Tector and Curtis Campher. Tector, a well-organised cricketer whom Ireland look to their future, put up a resolute performance with Campher (30) to stall the inevitable. In the first innings Tector scored 34 and added 70 for the third wicket with James McCollum. Playing spin and pace quite well and using the depth of the crease, Tector went onto score 42 priceless runs off 95 balls (4 fours) when his innings came to an unfortunate end. Tector had come to terms with the challenges in the middle when he attempted a quick run that was never there and slipped in mid-pitch, and failed to beat the return from Karunaratne from extra cover to wicket-keeper Sadeera Samarawickrama. Following Tector‚Äôs dismissal there was not much resistance from the tail as Sri Lanka wrapped up the Ireland second innings for 168, with Ramesh Mendis picking up four wickets to become the joint fastest Sri Lankan bowler to 50 Test wickets (11 Tests) with another off-spinner Dilruwan Perera who also achieved the landmark at Galle against Australia in 2016. Outstanding at forward short-leg was Nishan Madushka, a wicket-keeper/batsman who pulled off some astonishing catches in that position ‚Äì three in all, just when Ireland was settling into their batting. His performance reminded one of another former Sri Lankan stalwart Hashan Tillakaratne who also started off as a wicket-keeper and excelled in the position of a close-in fielder. The match turned out to be a one-way contest ever since Sri Lanka won the toss and piled up a score in excess of 500. With no proper first-class structure in place Ireland were left to learn the harsh lessons of Test cricket the hard way. Being only their fifth Test match since being elevated to Test ranks in 2017, it has been a whole new learning curve for the Irish. The second Test starts at the same venue on 24 April.","pubDate":"2023-04-18 19:11:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SRH vs MI: Arjun Tendulkar dismisses Bhuvneshwar Kumar to claim first-ever IPL wicket; Watch","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/srh-vs-mi-arjun-tendulkar-dismisses-bhuvneshwar-kumar-to-claim-first-ever-ipl-wicket-watch-12473962.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"SRH vs MI: Arjun Tendulkar dismisses Bhuvneshwar Kumar to claim first-ever IPL wicket; Watch","content":"Cricket SRH vs MI: Arjun Tendulkar dismisses Bhuvneshwar Kumar to claim first-ever IPL wicket; Watch Arjun, playing for Mumbai Indians, was tasked with the duty to defend 20 runs from the final over, with SRH looking to chase down a target of 193.

Abdul Samad was run-out off the second ball of the 20 th over to leave SRH nine down, and even after that, Arjun did not leave any room for improvement to the SRH tailenders.

Green cracked an unbeaten 64 off 40 balls with six fours and two sixes as Mumbai Indians made 5-192. Harry Brook, who hit a maiden IPL century in his previous outing, looked in similar form as he opened with two sumptuous fours, but he was then surprised by a slower ball bouncer from Jason Behrendorff and dismissed for a seven-ball nine. With Behrendorff (2-37 off four) adding the wicket of Rahul Tripathi, Sunrisers Hyderabad were reduced to 2-25 in the fourth over. They never recovered and were bowled out off the penultimate ball for 178, 15 runs adrift. The final wicket was taken by Arjuna Tendulkar, son of the legendary Sachin, his first wicket in the IPL. The IPL is a huge event in its own right, but 60 days out from the first Test at Edgbaston every Anglo-Australian encounter is seen through an Ashes lens. Green's ability to cope with the stresses of being the most expensive Australian in the IPL, having been signed for $3.15m, augurs well for the pressure he will be under in England. The 23-year-old West Australian, who won a clutch of post-match awards, said: \"The first couple of games were a learning curve for me and the team but we've now won three in a row.\" Of his key role bowling at the death he added: \"It is a work in progress but you get better the more you get exposed to it.\" Green began slowly, assessing the pace of the pitch, then accelerated. He had good support from Ishan Kishan (38) and Tilak Varma (37). In a late cameo Tim David made 16 off 11 balls before being run out of the last delivery. After Behrendorff's early inroads Sunrisers rebuilt through Maynak Agarwal and skipper Aiden Markham (22), but the latter fell to Green's fourth ball as the all-rounder took a role with the ball, finishing with 1-29 off four overs. Indians ultimately fielded a quartet of Australians with Green, Behrendorff and David joined by Riley Meredith, who was introduced as an 'impact substitute'. He had an impact too, dismissing Agarwal (48 off 41) and Marco Jansen (13 off six) as he took 2-33 in his four overs. They were two of a quartet of fine catches taken on the long on boundary by David, which included Heinrich Klassen, who had threatened to transform the match with 36 off 16. David added a run-out to complete a fielding five-for. Meredith had been omitted from the initial XI despite Jofra Archer being unavailable for the fourth successive match. The quick's continued absence is a concern for England as the problem is his troublesome right elbow. Archer has twice had surgery on the elbow joint spending much of the last two years either injured or recuperating. England's medical team have been working closely with their Mumbai counterparts and it is understood Archer is working towards returning against Punjab Kings on April 22 or Gujarat Titans three days later. Archer's setback has dented confidence that he will be play a major role in the Ashes with his county, Sussex, indicating he is unlikely to play first-class cricket for them before the series starts. That would leave Archer going into the Ashes with just a series of four-over T20 spells behind him, that would seem inadequate preparation for five-day Tests. - with PA Sign up for our emails","pubDate":"2023-04-18 18:02:10","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-10386555/546724dcb2af0fbbc5d34ce8d44c10f531885c06-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SRH vs MI Live Score: Big Blow For SRH!

Sportzpics Australia all-rounder Cameron Green had been a revelation even before he made his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut for Mumbai Indians (MI). And on Tuesday, the platform was well set in Hyderabad for him to shine, and he surely impressed, with most of the damage being done with the bat. Having been acquired by MI for a whopping price tag of Rs 17.50, Green certainly came into the IPL with a lot of expectations. IPL 2023: Full coverage | Points table | Schedule | Results | Orange Cap | Purple Cap‚Äã And on Tuesday, it was not only about Green finally announcing his arrival on the big stage, but also justifying his price tag, and also giving a glimpse to the fans of what they could expect from the 23-year-old. Ummmmm, Cameron Green is the REAL DEAL! The Ashes is going to be one helluva series! ‚Äî Kevin Pietersenü¶è (@KP24) April 18, 2023 Green scored an unbeaten 64 while coming into bat at number three, and also finished with figures of 1/29 from four overs. It was certainly a performance to remember for Green, but he is just not getting carried away with the expectations. And there‚Äôs no reason to be. ‚ÄúI think first couple of games were a learning curve for me and our team. Bit of a sticky situation (when I walked out to bat). But glad the plans came off. I am a work in progress with my bowling at the death. Obviously, we can continue with the winning momentum,‚Äù said a confident Green at the post-match presentation ceremony. Not only Green, but Arjun Tendulkar too steals the limelight Cameron Green was not the only MI star who rose up to the big occasion. Arjun Tendulkar, son of cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar, finally made a mark in the IPL with his first-ever wicket in the cash-rich league. Arjun had been part of the MI setup in 2021 and 2022, but it is only this year that the 23-year-old is finally getting a chance to shine. A superb all-round performance by Mumbai Indians once again. Cameron Green impressed with both bat & ball. Ishan & Tilak‚Äôs batting is as good as it gets! The IPL is getting more interesting every day. Great going boys!üíô And finally a Tendulkar has an IPL wicket!üòõ #SRHvMI pic.twitter.com/e4MAFEZyjY ‚Äî Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) April 18, 2023 On Tuesday, Arjun was given with the responsibility of bowling the final over of the match, with SRH needing 20 runs off six balls. He began with a low full toss to Abdul Samad, that ended up as a dot ball, and the SRH batter was immediately run out the very next ball, with Hrithik Shokeen perfectly timing in a throw to Ishan Kishan, who whipped off the bails. Mayank Markande was the new batter in, and Markande was off the mark with a brace in the third ball of the over. SRH still needed 16 runs off the last three balls, and while it was certain by the end that MI would have the last laugh, Arjun delivered the final punch to the match in some fashion, to get rid of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and seal the match. Arjun unleashed a fuller ball to Bhuvneshwar, and Bhuvneshwar looked to go straight down the ground, but instead got an outside edge to Rohit Sharma at extra cover, who completed the catch. There‚Äôs still a long way to go in Arjun‚Äôs cricketing career, but to get off the mark with the ball in the IPL would certainly be a special feeling. ‚ÄúObviously it was great getting my first IPL wicket. I just had to focus on what was in hand, the plan and executing it. Our plan was just to bowl wide and get the long boundary into play, make the batsman hit it to the longer side. I love bowling, I am happy to bowl anytime the captain asks me to and just stick to the team plan and give my best,‚Äù said Arjun after the match. Lack of resistance from SRH batters SRH batters clearly found the going tough on Tuesday against MI, and much of their batting troubles were due to the inability of their batters to get off to good starts. #MumbaiIndians are on a rampage. @timdavid8 with two key catches as Klaasen and Mayank Agarwal depart in quick succession.

Agarwal looked set for a 50-plus score, and was almost like the central figure for SRH, even forging productive stands with Aiden Markram (22) and later Heinrich Klaasen (36), but lack of support from some of his other partners probably hurt SRH‚Äôs momentum going forward. Had the top order fired in full cylinders for SRH, the complexion of the game would have been slightly different, and maybe, that would have helped them get those 20 runs needed from the final over.

Sportzpics Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) skipper Aiden Markram admitted that his side were ‚Äònot at the best‚Äô against Mumbai Indians (MI) in their Indian Premier League (IPL) contest in Hyderabad on Tuesday. Sunrisers Hyderabad kept losing wickets at regular intervals as they failed to chase down a target of 193 against Mumbai Indians. The Hyderabad-based franchise were eventually restricted to 178, courtesy a clinical performance from MI‚Äôs bowlers. Most of their batters failed to get going. Mayank Agarwal (48) and Heinrich Klaasen (38) looked good, but were dismissed at crucial junctures, while Markram failed to convert a start into a big knock. ‚ÄúAll in all we were not at our best tonight. Credit to the boys for taking it deep. We could have done with conceding fewer runs towards the end. It (the surface) stayed pretty much the same throughout the night, on the slower side, not bad at all. Whenever we took pace off the ball did not come on to the bat,‚Äù said Markram at the post-match presentation ceremony. ‚ÄúWe made a call (to bowl first) before the toss and if the dew came in then we were in the game. There was a desperation to make things right from the previous season. Not too bummed, there are areas we can improve on and we will look to do that to give us a good chance to win the next game,‚Äù he added. Rohit Sharma, who has previously played for the now defunct-Deccan Chargers, briefly recalled his early days in the IPL. ‚ÄúI have got lot of memories here (in Hyderabad). I played three years here. Won a trophy as well. Love coming back here. To settle them (youngsters) in is important for us. We had a couple of guys who hadn‚Äôt played IPL before. We had to back them. They are coming into their own. I am enjoying what I am doing (with the bat),‚Äù said Rohit. ‚ÄúIt is a different role. I am trying to set the tempo. Glad to get some scores in the powerplay. I understand one of us has to bat big. We have a long batting line-up. We want these guys to come out and bat freely. We watched Tilak last season. We all know what he can. I love his approach. He doesn‚Äôt play the bowler, he plays the ball. We will see him play for a lot of teams,‚Äù he added. Rohit termed Arjun Tendulkar, who claimed his first wicket on Tuesday, as a confident bowler. ‚ÄúArjun has been a part of this team for three years. He understands what he wants to do. He is quite confident as well. He is clear in his plans. He is trying to swing the new ball and bowl yorkers at the death,‚Äù added Rohit. Cameron Green, the Player of the Match, was glad that the plans worked despite a ‚Äòsticky‚Äô situation. Green scored an unbeaten 64 and took a wicket during SRH‚Äôs reply. ‚ÄúI think first couple of games were a learning curve for me and our team. Bit of a sticky situation (when I walked out to bat).

After that it was a case of pure survival against the wiles of Jayasuriya and the off-breaks of Ramesh Mendis who was forced to play second fiddle as Jayasuriya took the centre stage with his prolific wicket-taking ability at Galle. Of the 43 wickets he has taken so far in his short Test career of six matches, 39 has come at Galle from four Tests. Sri Lanka didn‚Äôt take too long to capture the remaining three Irish wickets in the morning, wrapping up the innings in 37 minutes for the addition of 26 runs. That left Ireland trailing by a massive 448 runs in the first innings. Without any hesitation Sri Lanka enforced the follow-on, the first time they had done so since 2015. On that occasion too, the venue was Galle, and the opponents were West Indies who eventually lost the match by an innings and six runs following big hundreds from Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal and a ten-wicket haul by left-arm spinner Rangana Herath. Angelo Mathews was the captain. The morning session turned out to be another good one for Sri Lanka as they captured eight wickets for 67 runs with Ireland limping to lunch with half their side out for 41 and trailing by a massive 407 runs. But the afternoon saw some Irish grit as they lost only three wickets whilst adding 94 runs in the session largely due to a 60-run partnership off 129 balls for the sixth wicket between Harry Tector and Curtis Campher. Tector, a well-organised cricketer whom Ireland look to their future, put up a resolute performance with Campher (30) to stall the inevitable. In the first innings Tector scored 34 and added 70 for the third wicket with James McCollum. Playing spin and pace quite well and using the depth of the crease, Tector went onto score 42 priceless runs off 95 balls (4 fours) when his innings came to an unfortunate end. Tector had come to terms with the challenges in the middle when he attempted a quick run that was never there and slipped in mid-pitch, and failed to beat the return from Karunaratne from extra cover to wicket-keeper Sadeera Samarawickrama. Following Tector‚Äôs dismissal there was not much resistance from the tail as Sri Lanka wrapped up the Ireland second innings for 168, with Ramesh Mendis picking up four wickets to become the joint fastest Sri Lankan bowler to 50 Test wickets (11 Tests) with another off-spinner Dilruwan Perera who also achieved the landmark at Galle against Australia in 2016. Outstanding at forward short-leg was Nishan Madushka, a wicket-keeper/batsman who pulled off some astonishing catches in that position ‚Äì three in all, just when Ireland was settling into their batting. His performance reminded one of another former Sri Lankan stalwart Hashan Tillakaratne who also started off as a wicket-keeper and excelled in the position of a close-in fielder. The match turned out to be a one-way contest ever since Sri Lanka won the toss and piled up a score in excess of 500. With no proper first-class structure in place Ireland were left to learn the harsh lessons of Test cricket the hard way. Being only their fifth Test match since being elevated to Test ranks in 2017, it has been a whole new learning curve for the Irish. The second Test starts at the same venue on 24 April.","pubDate":"2023-04-18 19:11:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SRH vs MI: Arjun Tendulkar dismisses Bhuvneshwar Kumar to claim first-ever IPL wicket; Watch","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/srh-vs-mi-arjun-tendulkar-dismisses-bhuvneshwar-kumar-to-claim-first-ever-ipl-wicket-watch-12473962.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"SRH vs MI: Arjun Tendulkar dismisses Bhuvneshwar Kumar to claim first-ever IPL wicket; Watch","content":"Cricket SRH vs MI: Arjun Tendulkar dismisses Bhuvneshwar Kumar to claim first-ever IPL wicket; Watch Arjun, playing for Mumbai Indians, was tasked with the duty to defend 20 runs from the final over, with SRH looking to chase down a target of 193.

Green cracked an unbeaten 64 off 40 balls with six fours and two sixes as Mumbai Indians made 5-192. Harry Brook, who hit a maiden IPL century in his previous outing, looked in similar form as he opened with two sumptuous fours, but he was then surprised by a slower ball bouncer from Jason Behrendorff and dismissed for a seven-ball nine. With Behrendorff (2-37 off four) adding the wicket of Rahul Tripathi, Sunrisers Hyderabad were reduced to 2-25 in the fourth over. They never recovered and were bowled out off the penultimate ball for 178, 15 runs adrift. The final wicket was taken by Arjuna Tendulkar, son of the legendary Sachin, his first wicket in the IPL. The IPL is a huge event in its own right, but 60 days out from the first Test at Edgbaston every Anglo-Australian encounter is seen through an Ashes lens. Green's ability to cope with the stresses of being the most expensive Australian in the IPL, having been signed for $3.15m, augurs well for the pressure he will be under in England. The 23-year-old West Australian, who won a clutch of post-match awards, said: \"The first couple of games were a learning curve for me and the team but we've now won three in a row.\" Of his key role bowling at the death he added: \"It is a work in progress but you get better the more you get exposed to it.\" Green began slowly, assessing the pace of the pitch, then accelerated. He had good support from Ishan Kishan (38) and Tilak Varma (37). In a late cameo Tim David made 16 off 11 balls before being run out of the last delivery. After Behrendorff's early inroads Sunrisers rebuilt through Maynak Agarwal and skipper Aiden Markham (22), but the latter fell to Green's fourth ball as the all-rounder took a role with the ball, finishing with 1-29 off four overs. Indians ultimately fielded a quartet of Australians with Green, Behrendorff and David joined by Riley Meredith, who was introduced as an 'impact substitute'. He had an impact too, dismissing Agarwal (48 off 41) and Marco Jansen (13 off six) as he took 2-33 in his four overs. They were two of a quartet of fine catches taken on the long on boundary by David, which included Heinrich Klassen, who had threatened to transform the match with 36 off 16. David added a run-out to complete a fielding five-for. Meredith had been omitted from the initial XI despite Jofra Archer being unavailable for the fourth successive match. The quick's continued absence is a concern for England as the problem is his troublesome right elbow. Archer has twice had surgery on the elbow joint spending much of the last two years either injured or recuperating. England's medical team have been working closely with their Mumbai counterparts and it is understood Archer is working towards returning against Punjab Kings on April 22 or Gujarat Titans three days later. Archer's setback has dented confidence that he will be play a major role in the Ashes with his county, Sussex, indicating he is unlikely to play first-class cricket for them before the series starts. That would leave Archer going into the Ashes with just a series of four-over T20 spells behind him, that would seem inadequate preparation for five-day Tests. - with PA Sign up for our emails","pubDate":"2023-04-18 18:02:10","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-10386555/546724dcb2af0fbbc5d34ce8d44c10f531885c06-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SRH vs MI Live Score: Big Blow For SRH!
