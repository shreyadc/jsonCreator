bowling great James Anderson enjoyed his battles against Indian stalwarts Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli over the course of his 21-year long career but he found bowling to the latter a tad tougher.Anderson, who made his Test debut in 2003, retired only last season to cap off a special career. The Lancastrian got success both against Tendulkar and Kohli, dismissing the Indian superstars nine and seven times respectively.\"I had some success early against Kohli the first time he came to England (2014).

He wanted you to know (that). He's very competitive and after that initial success it was pretty difficult to go up against him.\"With someone like Kohli he was a slightly different character to Sachin who was very mild-mannered, very calm at the crease and Virat was more expressive with his emotions and and wore his emotions on his sleeve and you could kind of see it with his captaincy when he celebrated wickets and stuff like that,\" added Anderson.

Traditionally, the surface at Leeds aids the pacers more than the spinners.\"India should look to play Kuldeep Yadav. Of course, Jadeja will bowl with him. So, two spinners with three seamers would be the kind of perfect match for this game,\" Harbhajan told PTI Videos on Monday.The turbanator termed the left-arm wrist spinner as a potential match-winner irrespective of the conditions.“Let’s see if conditions will change or favour the spinners. But even if it doesn’t, I think these are two capable bowlers who can take wickets on any wicket,” he said.Drawing on his own experience, Harbhajan recalled India's bold decision to field two spinners at Headingley in 2002, when he and Anil Kumble bagged 11 wickets between them on a green top.“That was a very unique decision at that point of time. The pitch was as green as we are standing on this grass... But the management decided we’ll go with two spinners and two fast bowlers and Sanjay Bangar will bowl as well.“We went with five best bowlers who can pick wickets. That’s what matters in the end. You have to back those bowlers who can pick wickets in any conditions or any kind of wicket”, he said.With Shardul Thakur scoring a century in the intra-squad warm-up and taking wickets, Harbhajan believes he holds the edge over Nitish Reddy for the fast bowling all-rounder's slot.“India needs a bowler who can bat a bit. India have got a batting till No. 7, and at No. 8, you need to see who can bowl and get those wickets for you and bat a bit. Not someone who bats and bowls a little bit.” “That’s where Shardul will have an edge on Nitish Reddy in my view. Nitish is a proper batsman who can definitely bowl. But we have not seen him bowling in the IPL much… \"Gautam (Gambhir) is there. He is a very capable coach. And I am sure he will take the right decision.” he added.Harbhajan also weighed in on the much-talked-about exclusion of Sarfaraz Khan from the Test squad.“It’s very unfortunate... I was a bit shocked not seeing his name in the squad. I’m sure he will come back strong. He has got that will to make a comeback…All I can say is, don’t be disheartened, you will get your due, if not today, then tomorrow…Look at Karun Nair.\"He scored 300 runs against England and then never got too many opportunities. Now he is back in England with the team,\" Harbhajan added. (This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

Traditionally, the surface at Leeds aids the pacers more than the spinners.\"India should look to play Kuldeep Yadav. Of course, Jadeja will bowl with him. So, two spinners with three seamers would be the kind of perfect match for this game,\" Harbhajan told PTI Videos on Monday.The turbanator termed the left-arm wrist spinner as a potential match-winner irrespective of the conditions.“Let’s see if conditions will change or favour the spinners. But even if it doesn’t, I think these are two capable bowlers who can take wickets on any wicket,” he said.Drawing on his own experience, Harbhajan recalled India's bold decision to field two spinners at Headingley in 2002, when he and Anil Kumble bagged 11 wickets between them on a green top.“That was a very unique decision at that point of time. The pitch was as green as we are standing on this grass... But the management decided we’ll go with two spinners and two fast bowlers and Sanjay Bangar will bowl as well.“We went with five best bowlers who can pick wickets. That’s what matters in the end. You have to back those bowlers who can pick wickets in any conditions or any kind of wicket”, he said.With Shardul Thakur scoring a century in the intra-squad warm-up and taking wickets, Harbhajan believes he holds the edge over Nitish Reddy for the fast bowling all-rounder's slot.“India needs a bowler who can bat a bit. India have got a batting till No. 7, and at No. 8, you need to see who can bowl and get those wickets for you and bat a bit. Not someone who bats and bowls a little bit.” “That’s where Shardul will have an edge on Nitish Reddy in my view. Nitish is a proper batsman who can definitely bowl. But we have not seen him bowling in the IPL much… \"Gautam (Gambhir) is there. He is a very capable coach. And I am sure he will take the right decision.” he added.Harbhajan also weighed in on the much-talked-about exclusion of Sarfaraz Khan from the Test squad.“It’s very unfortunate... I was a bit shocked not seeing his name in the squad. I’m sure he will come back strong. He has got that will to make a comeback…All I can say is, don’t be disheartened, you will get your due, if not today, then tomorrow…Look at Karun Nair.\"He scored 300 runs against England and then never got too many opportunities. Now he is back in England with the team,\" Harbhajan added. (This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

bowling great James Anderson enjoyed his battles against Indian stalwarts Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli over the course of his 21-year long career but he found bowling to the latter a tad tougher.Anderson, who made his Test debut in 2003, retired only last season to cap off a special career. The Lancastrian got success both against Tendulkar and Kohli, dismissing the Indian superstars nine and seven times respectively.\"I had some success early against Kohli the first time he came to England (2014). I really exploited, he had a weakness outside off stump, really exploited that and then the next time I played against him (in 2018) he'd obviously gone away and worked on that and it was like bowling at a different player,\" Anderson told talkSport.However, it is worth mentioning that Tendulkar and Kohli were at different stages of their careers when they faced the challenge from Anderson, who continues to play county cricket at 42.\"He'd (Kohli) really taken his game to a different level made it very difficult for not just me but for the bowlers in general and I think I got him out maybe four or five times the first series and then didn't get him out in the next series I played against him.\"Against Sachin for example I didn't feel like there was that sort of shift in dominance with Kohli, there was definitely a shift and yeah I found him a really difficult player to bowl at because he also had that sort of steely mindset.\" He referred to Tendulkar as a 'God like' figure while Kohli was an in your face character.\"Kohli wanted to get into a battle. He wanted you to know (that). He's very competitive and after that initial success it was pretty difficult to go up against him.\"With someone like Kohli he was a slightly different character to Sachin who was very mild-mannered, very calm at the crease and Virat was more expressive with his emotions and and wore his emotions on his sleeve and you could kind of see it with his captaincy when he celebrated wickets and stuff like that,\" added Anderson.
