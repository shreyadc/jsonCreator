FP Sports July 31, 2022 01:33:24 IST Mirabai Chanu won India's first gold medal of 2022 Commonwealth Games. Image: SonyLiv Birmingham: Mirabai Chanu was ahead of the rest of the pack even before she had stepped up to the mat in the Women's 49kg category of weightlifting on Saturday. She set a target of 80kg to start her snatch attempt - at least eight kilos clear of the rest. By the time she stepped up to make her first lift, the 2018 Games gold medallist had increased her aim to 84kg - no one had managed more than 72 kgs. With a best of 88kg in snatch, in her second lift, she had shattered the Commonwealth Games record, the Games record and equalled her National record in snatch. If she came in an overwhelming favourite for the gold, the snatch made clear why. It also made clear India were headed towards their first gold medal in Birmingham. Commonwealth Games: India schedule , Results , Medals tally In the end, Chanu posted a Games record 113kg in the Clean & Jerk as well and had the job done with the first lift. Eventually, her total of 201kg also proved to be a Games Record. The Tokyo Olympics silver medallist was expected to land the gold medal once again in CWG but the magnitude of win became the exciting part. The next best was Mauritius' Marie Hanitra Roilya Ranaivosoa who registered 172kg (76kg+96kg) - a gigantic 29kg behind. It was a day for the lifters as Sanket Sargar won India's first medal of the Games by clinching silver medal in the Men's 55kg category. And it could well have been gold for the 21-year-old as he finished just a kilo short of first-placed Mohamad Aniq of Malaysia. He managed a total lift of 248kg (113kg+135kg) to finish. It was a dramatic moment with Sargar injuring his right elbow while trying to lift 139kg in his second clean and jerk attempt. It is a massive moment for the Sangli, Maharashtra native who was managing a 'paan shop' with his father. Later, Gururaja Poojary , silver medallist in Gold Coast, finished third in Men's 61kg while going neck-and-neck with Canada's Youri Simard. It was a successful switch for the lifter to an Olympic weight category having competed in 56kg in 2018. Gururaja was required to lift 151kg in his third and final clean & jerk attempt to fend off the challenge of Simard. Late at night, Bindyarani Devi became the fourth Indian weightlifter to win a medal as the 23-year-old Manipuri lifter claimed a silver medal in the 55kg women's category. She also set the Games record in clean and jerk segment by lifting 116kgs while lifting 202kg in total. She also matched Mirabai Chanu's national record of 86kg in snatch. Disappointment for female paddlers India women's team, the defending champions, outclassed Guyana 3-0 in the group stage contest but were found out in the quarter-finals. Facing Malaysia, Manika Batra looked shaky in both her singles matches - winning one and losing another. National champion Sreeja Akula gave India a 2-1 lead but the Malaysian team roared back in dramatic fashion. Batra was trounced by 19-year-old leftie Karen Lyne and with tie on the line, an inexperienced Reeth Tennison couldn't keep her composure to lose the fifth game against Ying Ho. The men progressed to the quarters by beating Northern Ireland 3-0. Perfect start for Hussamuddin, Lovlina; Sanjeet crashes out 2018 bronze medallist Mohammad Hussamuddin progressed into the pre-quarterfinals of the men's featherweight (57kg) after beating Amzolele Dyeyi of South Africa 5-0 in a unanimous verdict. However, the Indian boxing contingent also suffered their first defeat on the day as heavyweight category boxer Sanjeet Kumar suffered a defeat at the hands of Samoa's Ato Plodzicki-Faoagali. Progressing by a similar margin was Lovlina Borgohain. She had dominated the news in the past week by her plea to have her coach with her even if it came at the cost of the other support staff members. She had no trouble beating New Zealand's Ariane Nicholson with all judges ruling in her favour. Hassamuddin will face Md Salim Hossain of Bangladesh in the next round for a place in the quarterfinals. Borgohain has Rosie Eccles of Wales in the quarter-final. Sanjeet, who missed the Tokyo Olympics after a surgery, lost by a split verdict to 2018 Gold Coast silver medallist Plodzicki-Faoagali. As per the final result, two judges favour 28-29 in favour of Sanjeet while two others favoured exactly the opposite in Samoan's favour. The decision went down to the Sri Lankan judge, who favoured the bout in Plodzicki-Faoagali favour after earlier carding a score of 28 each. Easy day for shuttlers Already through to the quarterfinals, defending champions India continued their rampaging run as they beat Australia in their final group A match of mixed team competition at the Commonwealth Games here. The Indians have taken an unassailable 3-0 lead over the Australians, who then won the women's doubles tie to restore some pride. India eventually took the match 4-1 after winning the mixed doubles tie. After blanking Pakistan 5-0 on the first day, India yet again were by far the better team on display on the second day as they outclassed Sri Lanka 5-0 first and then beat Australia to top the group on way to the quarterfinals. To justify the strength of the squad, India shuffled things around to face Sri Lanka with Ashwini Ponnappa and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy teaming up. Women's Hockey team beats Wales 3-1 Vandana Katariya scored a brace as the Indian women's hockey team defeated Wales 3-1 to record its second successive win in Pool A at the Commonwealth Games here. India scored all their three goals from penalty corners with Vandana finding the net twice, while Gurjit Kaur fired in a fierce drag-flick on Saturday. India will next play hosts England on August 2. Elsewhere across the Games, Nitendra Singh Rawat finished 12th in the men's marathon race. The 35-year-old Rawat clocked 2 hour 19 minutes and 22 seconds in the race won by Uganda's Victor Kiplangat (2:10:55). In squash, Joshna Chinappa and Saurav Ghosal made their experience count in progressing in the singles competitions. But it was curtains for 14-year-old Anahat Singh, Sunayna Kuruvilla and Abhay Singh. In swimming, Srihari Nataraj finished seventh in the 100m backstroke final with a timing of 54.31 seconds. South Africa's Pieter Coetze took the gold with a timing of 53.78 seconds ahead of England's Brodie Williams (53.91s) and Jamaica's Sky Simone- Lea Norris (54.06s). Srihari's timing was much slower than his personal best and national record of 53.77s. In lawn ball, India's Tania Choudhary suffered her third successive loss in women's singles competition of lawn bowl event at the ongoing Commonwealth Games here on Saturday. The 26-year-old Choudhary had suffered twin losses on the opening day of the competition against Dee Hoggan and Daphne Arthur-Almond of the Falkland Islands.

Dubbed ‘Mirabai Chanu 2.0’ clinches Commonwealth Games silver medal Struggling for a job and marred with family's financial crisis, Bindyarani turned to her idol Mirabai Chanu for help as the Tokyo Olympics silver winner gifted her expensive lifting shoes. FP Sports July 31, 2022 03:12:55 IST Bindyarani Devi in action during Commonwealth Games 2022 55kg women's weightlifting in Birmingham on Saturday. AP India's Bindyarani Devi became the fourth Indian weightlifter to win a medal on Day 2 of the Commonwealth Games as the 23-year-old Manipuri lifter claimed a silver medal in the 55kg women's category on late Saturday. She also set the Games record in the clean and jerk segment by lifting 116kgs while lifting 202kg in total. She also matched Mirabai Chanu's national record of 86kg in snatch. Who is Bindyarani Devi? Following the footsteps of Mirabai, Bindya always looked up to the Tokyo Olympic silver medallist as she trained at the same Sports Academy as Mirabai in Manipur. Born in 1999, Bindyarani rose to prominence in the weightlifting world with a World Championship gold medal in December 2021 in the clean and jerk segment of the 55kg category. On her way to the gold, she defeated Tokyo Olympic Test event champion Ham Eun-ji. The season, however, ended on a sour note when she lost out to Nigeria’s Adijat Olarinoye in the gold medal battle at the Commonwealth Championships in Tashkent. The loss came as a surprise as she won the tournament in the same category in Samoa in 2019. The defeat also exposed her weakness, as pointed out by national coach Vijay Sharma. “She is a bright talent and her gold medal at the World Championships shows that. Ahead of CWG, we tried to work on her weakness in snatch. We tried to make up for it as much as we can and she might set the national record as well but catch up to the Nigerian will be tough,” said Sharma right before the Olympics. Evidently, at the Commonwealth Championships, Bindya was close in the clean and jerk segment with a lift of 113kg, one less than Olarinoye. However, her best in snatch hadn’t been above 84kg while Olarinoye lifted a strong 90kg. The national record in 55kg snatch still remains with Mirabai, who lifted 86kg in the segment. Interestingly snatch has been a weakness of Mirabai as well and has been working on improving it with World Championship in Colombia later this year in mind. Mirabai Chanu comes to Bindya’s help Bindya, however, has been always a fan of Mirabai, who she likes to call Mira di and said the Tokyo star has been a guide to her career and gave her an expensive but essential gift. “Mira di has been very important to my success,” said Bindyarani last year after winning the silver medal. “She is always there to help me with my technique and training. When I was new at the camp, she also ensured I settle down easy. Di knew I didn’t have the money to buy the lifting shoes but she didn’t think twice before gifting me those shoes. She was always an inspiration and her down-to-earth behaviour made me her bigger fan.” However, the double medal success at the World Championships didn’t result in a job as the 23-year-old lifter said her family is in a dire need of it and is important to her Olympic ambitions “I hope to get a job soon because it’s important for my Olympic ambitions. I don’t really come from a rich family so getting a job is important now,” she said. “Winning the Olympic gold medal is what always drives me. After watching Mira di do the same at Olympics, I am more inspired to achieve it. “ At the Khelo India National Ranking tournament earlier this year in Dharamshala, Bindya also improved on her clean and jerk record by a kg to 115kg while lifting 199kg in total while confirming herself as the country’s best in the category ahead of the likes of Shrabani Das and Ananya Patil.

Her weakness in the snatch, however, was evident once again as Mirabai failed to go beyond her personal best but did post the Games and Commonwealth record by lifting 88kg in her second attempt.

As per the news agency PTI, KL Rahul was supposed to travel for the Zimbabwe series, but a resurfaced hamstring injury had left no other option for the BCCI, but to rule him out from the same.

FP Sports July 30, 2022 21:08:36 IST Sanket clinched the silver with an aggregate of 248 kg, that includes 113kg in snatch and 135 kg in clean and jerk. Image credit: IOA India’s Sanket Sargar opened the medals tally account for his country at the ongoing Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, clinching silver in the men’s 55kg weightlifting category final on Saturday. Sargar was gunning for gold in Birmingham, but eventually clinched silver despite sustaining an untimely injury. Sanket clinched the silver with an aggregate of 248 kg, that includes 113kg in snatch and 135 kg in clean and jerk. Sanket finished behind Aniq Kasdan of Malaysia, who finished with an aggregate of 249 kg. The 21-year-old revealed after the bout that he was a ‘little disappointed’ with the silver as he was hoping for gold. “I am sad because I wanted to stand for gold. I have been training to come here for gold for 4 years now. I trained myself in such a way that I had to secure gold. I am a little disappointed and a little happy that I got a medal but I am a lot sadder,” said Sanket. “This medal, with what India is going through, I would like to dedicate this medal to everyone who has fought for our freedom selflessly without caring about their lives. So, I would like to dedicate it to all those fighters,” he added. Sanket, who is the son of a paan shop owner , suffered an elbow injury while attempting to lift 139 kg in his second attempt. He braved the injury in his final attempt, but missed out on lifting 139 kg, only managing 135 kg, and eventually clinching gold. Sanket revealed that he’s still feeling a ‘lot of pain’ following the bout. “I heard a sound and it started paining. The first time it happened, I still had to lift and I did that again after the second and third time post that. I should have taken the risk because I wanted to get a medal so I should have taken the risk,” he continued. “There is a lot of pain, I can’t leave my hand loose and it's pulling from the inside,” Sanket said. Sanket revealed that he would have to undergo an x-ray. “I have to go to the medical team now and take an x-ray. Nothing happened to my leg but because of this it bent and I couldn’t do it like this. I am very disappointed. It was painful at that time but my body was warm so it didn’t feel much but I can feel it now.” The Nagpur-born athlete revealed how his coach encouraged him to go for the final lift despite the injury, saying: “Before the last life, sir asked whether I wanted to take it or not. I said I wanted to take it and not leave it because everything I have done for the last 4 years came down to that last lift. One step remained and I said I have to take it. Sir said that the pain might increase more and then even he encouraged me by saying that we have to do it because we are living for that only and that pumped me more.” Sanket went onto further reveal how he could have taken a risk during the final, but did not want to risk doing so. “Yes, I could have but that time I could do 113 but it was important to complete the lift so I didn’t want to risk that.” “I lifted 5 kgs more than this in my training. But all of a sudden a load came which even I couldn’t understand. My personal best is 143kg,” explained the youngster.

FP Sports July 30, 2022 21:00:33 IST India's Sanket Sargar in action during the 2022 Commonwealth Games men's 55kg weightlifting final. AP Sanket Mahadev Sargar became the first Indian to claim a medal at the ongoing Commonwealth Games in Birmingham as he grabbed a silver in weightlifitng on the second day of the quadrennial event. Sargar finished second in the men’s 55kg weightlifting final behind Malaysia’s Aniq Kasdan, who lifted a total of 249 kg in comparison to Sargar’s 248. Commonwealth Games: India schedule , Results , Medals tally The 21-year-old Indian lifter gave himself a bright start in the snatch category (one of the two composites of weightlifting) by lifting 113kg, which was six kg more than his 20-year-old Malaysian rival. However, Kasdan made a stronger return in the clean and jerk segment by lifting a decisive 142kg, seven more than Sargar, to claim gold. Kasdan started the event as favourite as he was the No 1 in the Commonwealth ranking after lifting the exact same weight of 249kg at the Commomnwealth Championships in Tashkent last year. Sargar did make an attempt to lift 143kg but injured himself in the process. Who is Sanket Mahadev Sargar? Sanket is a resident of Maharshtra’s Sangli, where his father Mahadev runs a ‘paan' shop and food stall while the lifter struggled to find a job. His childhood coach Mayur Sinhasane revealed that at a young age, Sanket used to wake early in the morning to help his father at his Paan store before going for training at the gym. “Sanket has sacrificed his entire childhood. From waking up 5:30am to making tea for customers to going to the gym later in the evening, he dreamt of only one thing,” Sinhasane told PTI. “He had only one dream and that was to bring laurels to the country in weightlifting and give a good life to his family. Now his dream is coming true.” Sinhasane further revealed that Sanket has been fulfilling his father's incomplete dream to be a weightlifter. The Sargar family, in fact, went through some tough times before Sanket was picked for the national team. “Sanket neither had a sponsor nor was financially well off before getting into TOPS. His father would take care of his sport by borrowing and we would take full care of his diet and exercise. “Sometimes his father could return money, sometimes not, but we never let it become a hindrance in Sanket’s training,” explained Sinhasane. “My father Nana Sinhasane trained him from 2013-2015 and I trained him from 2017 to 2021 with a target of the CWG. I was sure he would win a medal. We only have talented children from poor homes and he was exceptionally talented among them too,” he added. Sanket’s claim to fame was his national record lift of 139kg in the clean and jerk segment at the Khelo India University Games in 2020. In total he lifted 247kg (108kg in the snatch) to claim the gold medal at the competition. He rewrote his national record in February last year as he lifted 256kg (113kg in snatch +143kg in clean and jerk) at the Singapore Weightlifting International. After winning the CWG silver, Sanket's father said now he wants his son to win Olympic medal. \"I wanted to pursue weightlifting myself but due to financial problems my dream remained incomplete,” Mahadev told PTI. “Today all my struggles have paid off. All eyes are on the Paris Olympics now.” Sanket's sister Kajal has also followed in the footsteps of her brother by winning a gold medal in the women’s 40kg category at the Khelo India Youth Games this year.

Deux spectateurs sont morts dans l'explosion d'une grenade vendredi dans un stade où se déroulait un match de cricket à Kaboul, la capitale de l'Afghanistan, selon un nouveau bilan donné samedi par la police. Deux spectateurs ont été tués, dont « l'un est décédé sur les lieux (de l'explosion) et un autre a succombé plus tard à ses blessures », a déclaré à l'AFP le porte-parole de la police de Kaboul, Khalid Zadran. Ce dernier avait simplement indiqué vendredi qu'une « grenade à main a explosé lors de la Ligue Shpageeza de Cricket », dans le stade international de Kaboul, sans évoquer de victimes. Le responsable de la fédération afghane de cricket, Naseeb Khan, avait lui donné un bilan de quatre spectateurs blessés. Dans un communiqué publié vendredi, le coordonnateur humanitaire de l'ONU pour l'Afghanistan, Ramiz Alakbarov, présent au stade lors de l'explosion, avait dénoncé un « attentat atroce » et « la violence terrifiante et soudaine à laquelle la population afghane continue d'être exposée ». Depuis le retour au pouvoir des talibans en Afghanistan en août 2021, la violence dans le pays a chuté, mais le groupe jihadiste État islamique a commis plusieurs attentats à la bombe et attaques à l'arme à feu dans le pays ces derniers mois.

After skipper Harmanpreet Kaur slammed 52 off 34 balls and opener Shafali Verma chipped in with a 33-ball 48 for India to make 154-8, Renuka's magnificent opening burst took out Australia's top four. With Deepti Sharma (2-26) taking out Rachael Haynes, Australia were in deep trouble at 49-5 and needed 89 runs off the last ten overs. But Ashleigh stitched stands of 51 with Grace Harris (37 off 20 balls) and 47 with Alana King (18 not out) to be unbeaten at 52 off 35 balls, hitting nine boundaries under pressure to take Australia to a cracking victory on cricket's comeback in the multi-sport event.

This game is the series decider as the series is currently levelled at 1-1. The batters have enjoyed batting in the series so far, and there are some power hitters in both ranks. Rilee Rossouw proved his class in the last match, whereas England also have players like Jason Roy, Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow, etc. This game is expected to be a thriller. Southampton’s Rose Bowl or Ageas Bowl stadium serves as the home ground to the County Side Hampshire. This stadium has an in-built hotel in it, and the crowd capacity is around 25,000. The Ageas Bowl is one of the prettiest stadiums in England. The track at the Rose Bowl in Southampton has encouraged the batters in past, and it can play the same way in this match as well. There is an even bounce on track, and the batters will get the reward for their good shot playing. With the faster outfield, the ball races away to the boundary once placed in the gap. 6️⃣ of the best from the first two IT20s @LifebuoyUK Cleanest Hits 🏏 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 #ENGvSA 🇿🇦 #BishBashBosh ! 💥 pic.twitter.com/ywmZy3mpTn — England Cricket (@englandcricket) July 29, 2022 A total of 10 T20Is have been played at this ground, where the chasing teams have just won four games. The average 1st innings T20I score has been 170 runs, which suggests that it is a good batting track. The last T20I here was played between England and India earlier this month, where India scored 198 runs in the 1st innings. This is a batting-friendly ground, but the boundaries of this stadium are relatively bigger than the other venues, and the bowlers can take advantage of it. It has been seen that the white Kookaburra balls are swinging well in the initial overs, and this pitch can also assist the pacers in the initial overs. Looking at the trend of this series so far, we can expect another high-scoring encounter this time around. Both teams may opt to bat after winning the toss.","pubDate":"2022-07-30 14:30:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India T20 WC Squad: BCCI Selector says Dinesh Karthik now certainty for the T20 World Cup: CHECK OUT - InsideSport","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiwAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVzcG9ydC5pbi9pbmRpYS10MjAtd2Mtc3F1YWQtYmNjaS1zZWxlY3Rvci10by1pbnNpZGVzcG9ydC13aG8tY2FuLXN0b3AtZGluZXNoLWthcnRoaWstbm93LWhlLWlzLWNlcnRhaW50eS1ub3ctZm9yLXRoZS10MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLWluLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1mb2xsb3ctaW5kLXZzLXdpLWxpdmUtdXBkYXRlcy_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India T20 WC Squad: BCCI Selector says Dinesh Karthik now certainty for the T20 World Cup: CHECK OUT  InsideSportWatch: R Ashwin's exceptional gesture after fan asks Dinesh Karthik for selfie  Hindustan TimesKarthik strengthens his case for finisher's spot at 2022 T20 World Cup  ESPNcricinfoWatch: Reverse slash or edge?
