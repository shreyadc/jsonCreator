With the abundance of talent that this Indian team has, they have now segregated teams for different formats and different oppositions.

T he prolific all-rounder, who was unceremoniously dropped at the end of last year, has apparently given up on adding to his tally of 389 caps, an Irish record for any sport. “I had hoped to finish my Ireland career at the T20 World Cup in Australia,” O’Brien said. “But having not been picked since last year’s World Cup, I feel that the selectors and management are looking elsewhere. I’d like to thank all the coaches I’ve worked with, in particular Adi Birrell for giving me the opportunity to play international cricket in 2006, and Phil Simmons, for the eight very enjoyable and successful years we shared together with the national team. “A special mention too for all my youth coaches through the Railway Union and Leinster systems, especially Brian O’Rourke.” It was noticeable that the 38-year-old’s statement made no mention of Cricket Ireland who should have allowed their longest-serving player to depart on his own terms, and could surely still arrange a testimonial of some sort to say a proper goodbye. It’s said there is no room for sentimentality in sport but how much does Cricket Ireland owe to those two World Cup innings O’Brien played in Jamaica and Bangalore?While he will always be remembered for that stunning 113 against England in 2011 – still the fastest century in World Cup history – the 16 not out from 52 balls against Pakistan four years earlier in Kingston was probably of equal importance, if not greater. When his team-mates were struggling, O’Brien stood strong for more than an hour-and-a-half to help deliver the nervy three-wicket win that set Ireland on the road to playing Test match cricket. The man-of-the-match in that famous victory was his older brother. “To be able to share the field and dressing-room with Niall for 12 years is something I’m incredibly grateful for – they were amazing times,” O’Brien said. In all, he scored 9,048 international runs, including a highest score of 171 not out against Kenya in Nairobi, and the first Test century for Ireland, against Pakistan in 2018, plus 276 wickets with his under-rated medium pace, and 181 catches. In the pantheon of Irish cricketers, he will never be considered as classy as Ed Joyce, as successful as Eoin Morgan nor as relentless as Dermott Monteith, but given his breadth of work and longevity it’s hard to argue against O’Brien as being the greatest player to pull on the green shirt.

The best cricket-playing nations will be seen in action against Pakistan. These series have nothing to do with the forthcoming cricketing season that has already got under way. Following the Asia Cup starting in the UAE from August 27, England will be reaching on September 15 for a seven-match T20 series against Pakistan. We have never hosted any country for such a number of T20 matches in one go. England will tour Pakistan twice in the season -- the second time for the Test series. Besides England, New Zealand and the West Indies are also touring Pakistan this season but the next FTP will start after the World Test Championship’s final to be held in July 2023,” an ICC source told ‘The News’. Pakistan will also host two international limited-overs tri-series (T20 or ODI) during the forthcoming FTP. A well-placed source told ‘The News’ that the idea of these two limited-overs series is the brainchild of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Ramiz Raja. He has been advocating for such a series for months now. “The FTP will see Pakistan hosting two limited-overs series in a span of four years (2024-28). Two different sets of teams will be seen in action along with Pakistan in the doubleheader series. Say if South Africa and England would be there for the first, the next year will see Australia and Sri Lanka become part of the series. Though the dates and the year will be announced later, it is believed that the series are to be held in 2024 and 2026-27. The ICC is expected to give thumbs up within a week’s time. Hosting such a series is all the more important considering the modern needs and requirements. Such a series is expected to draw a better return, on both crowd and sponsorship fronts,” the source added. Pakistan has already been awarded hosting rights for the 2025 Champions Trophy. “We have already won the Champions Trophy’s rights and are well on course to get the Junior World Cup and a major women’s event hosting rights during the next six years. So the two tri-series hosted by Pakistan will also help the country take big strides in confirming its status as one of leading hosts of cricket events.” Pakistan is also expected to host around 29 Test matches during the four years of FTP starting from 2023-24. Some leading teams including England and Australia are expected to tour Pakistan again during these years. England are due to play the Test series in Pakistan at the start of 2023. “Pakistan are to play a three-Test match series against Australia and England while a two-Test match series has been finalised against other nations during the next FTP,” the source added.","pubDate":"2022-08-17 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Elgar sick of 'Bazball' talk ahead of England Tests","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/982917-elgar-sick-of-bazball-talk-ahead-of-england-tests","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ag AFPLONDON: South Africa captain Dean Elgar said on Tuesday he was fed up with discussing England’s new swashbuckling ‘Bazball’ approach to Test cricket on the eve of their series opener at Lord’s.England have won all four of their Tests under a new leadership pairing of...","content":"Ag AFP .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ LONDON: South Africa captain Dean Elgar said on Tuesday he was fed up with discussing England’s new swashbuckling ‘Bazball’ approach to Test cricket on the eve of their series opener at Lord’s. England have won all four of their Tests under a new leadership pairing of skipper Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum. McCullum’s nickname is behind a ‘Bazball’ tag that has become shorthand for an aggressive style of playing the five-day game. That 100 percent record includes a 3-0 series sweep over world champions New Zealand, with England hunting down challenging targets on each occasion. Stokes’s men then made light of a seemingly stiff target of 378 in the Covid-delayed fifth Test against India at Edgbaston, romping to victory by seven wickets. But South Africa -- top of the World Test Championship table -- will be a tough proposition for England in the three-match series starting on Wednesday. Opening batsman Elgar is confident the Proteas’ pace attack can cut high-flying England down to size. “With all due respect I am really not going to entertain that (Bazball) anymore,” Elgar said at Lord’s on Tuesday. “We have chatted about it long and hard. I just want to crack on with the cricket. I think the game deserves that respect and mud-slinging is now a thing of the past for me.” Elgar, who has overseen seven wins from nine matches since becoming South Africa’s permanent red-ball skipper, accepts there may be times when the tourists are on the defensive but he believes they have the resources to fight back. “I would like to think from a bowling point of view, our bowlers are big, tall, fast and strong buggers and we have ticked the boxes in regards to the spin department.” Elgar tried to put England’s run-chases into perspective by saying the conditions in those matches were “pretty nice” for batting. But he did not underestimate the scale of the tourists’ task. “It might be hard work for us but this is what we are here to do,” he said. “We are not here to play soft-natured cricket. We want it hard and really tough and hopefully the results go our way.” South Africa conceded a mammoth 672 runs during an innings defeat by the second-string England Lions at Canterbury last week but an unconcerned Elgar said he read nothing into the warm-up game. “If they come out playing like that in an official Test match and it goes pear-shaped, that will not look very good for England.” Stokes, who gave his pre-match press conference at Lord’s before Elgar, said he was happy to hear the South Africans talk about England’s new attacking approach. “The opposition seem to be doing a lot of talking about it (Bazball) at the moment -- we don’t really speak about it that much,” he said. “We don’t dive into it too much, but I’m happy for Dean and the South Africa team to say they’re not interested and then keep talking about it,” the all-rounder added. “We’ve got a style of play, they’ve got a style of play. At the end of the day it’s bat against ball and whoever plays best over a Test match is more than likely to win.” England have recalled fit-again wicketkeeper Ben Foakes for the first Test against South Africa at Lord´s starting on Wednesday. Ben Stokes, the England captain, announced the return of Surrey wicketkeeper Foakes to the XI during a media conference on Tuesday. Foakes is the only change from the team that defeated India in the postponed fifth Test at Edgbaston last month after missing the match following a case of coronavirus. That victory was England’s fourth win in as many Tests under their new leadership pair of Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum. Foakes reclaims the gloves from Kent’s Sam Billings. There is no place for Ollie Robinson, with the Sussex seamer unable to force his way into the side, which boasts a pace attack of James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Matthew Potts, supplemented by all-rounder Stokes. Robinson has not played for England since the final Test of the Ashes series in January.","pubDate":"2022-08-17 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Podcast: India’s greatest cricketing victories E08 - Dilip Doshi on beating England in 1981 at Wankhede","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/podcast/matchpoint-paradox-india-greatest-cricket-wins-victories-1981-test-dilip-doshi-ind-vs-england-wankhede-vijay-lokapally/article65771113.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Vijay Lokapally  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"In this episode of India’s Greatest Cricketing Victories, Vijay Lokapally caught up with Dilip Doshi about his five-wicket haul vs England in the 1981 Wankhede Test, parochialism in cricket and how far the game has come today.","content":"In 1981, India scripted a memorable 138-run victory over England at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai to take a 1-0 lead in the six-Test series.

In this episode of India’s Greatest Cricketing Victories, Sportstar’s Vijay Lokapally caught up with the veteran spinner about this match, his playing days, and how far the game has come in India since. Do listen in. E01 ft. CD Gopinath E02 ft. Farokh Engineer E03 ft. Karsan Ghavri E04 ft. Madan Lal E05 ft. Yajurvinder Singh E06 ft. Syed Kirmani E07 ft. Shivlal Yadav Vijay Lokapally: Thank you Dilip Bhai for agreeing to speak to The Hindu and the Sportstar. You would have had some association during your active playing days with The Hindu and Sportstar. We are one of the few magazines in the country. This interview is part of a series we are doing on some of India's greatest victories. Obviously, you will have your choice, like in your debut game at Chennai where you had taken eight wickets. That was a great performance. But we picked November 1981 match against England where India won by 138 runs. But to begin with, what are your memories of your debut? Although it was a drawn game, you did amazingly well. I have brought a list of batsmen you got: Graeme Wood, Kim Hughes, Graham, Yallop, Dav Whatmore (in both innings), Rodney Hogg, Alan Hurst, and Andrew Hilditch. So you got the best batsmen out. Dilip Doshi: Thank you. I would just say that it's the most wonderful memory really and I was thankful that I got a chance at last. I wanted to prove a point. That's the thing you know. Basically, you play because you want to play for your country and hopefully, you win games. That was the whole purpose. And of course, you love the game. As a child when you grow up, you dream of playing for your country and when it comes true it's a very, very impossible feeling to describe, except that I can say that it will never leave you. You know it always stays with you, the thrill. Vijay Lokapally: Yeah, and sir, this move to go to Bengal. Was it because in search of opportunity or the fact that maybe Bengal was a good team and you have had a regular chance to play there? Dilip Doshi: No, nothing like that in that sense. I was born in Rajkot. Saurashtra is, you can say, my birth state, the state of my roots for both my parents. But my father was doing his business in Calcutta in those days, so we lived there. So I was born in Rajkot but always lived my entire growing up life in Calcutta. Calcutta and Bengal always my, as I said, the Karma Bhoomi at that time you know. I had no choice and I have no regrets. I think after independence, Calcutta was arguably the best place to grow in because of the education, the Maidan, the art, and culture, and it was fantastic. Vijay Lokapally: Yeah, sir. Before we dive into your Test career just a word about the delayed entry to First-class cricket and international cricket. What would you attribute that to? Dilip Doshi: To be very honest there was a typical parochialism in our country then. I got an entry into my college team straight away. I did not play any school cricket of any significance except in Maidan in Calcutta. So, you're honing your skills against others. And I recall that without being immodest, we used to practically win every game then we played in, and I used to have figures at times like 8 for 2 runs and things like that. I did realise that I was able to play against good players and get wickets. So it instills confidence in you and you grow up street-smart, as you would call it. Then I went to St. Xavier's College, Calcutta, and I got my chance immediately. I proved a point because St. Xavier's College became the champions of the Calcutta University program year after year. When I was playing I used to be the highest wicket-taker. So it felt rewarding you know, but then I had to wait for years to play for Calcutta University simply because of parochialism. Even many of them considered me as a Gujarati playing in Bengal or living there. I mean that was only those few people. The people in Bengal knew that I was a home product. I personally felt that I was more Bengali in that way than anybody else. Because at the end of the day people did not think about India the way we do today in those days. And so I got a very late entry into university cricket. At the same time into Bengal cricket as well. But anyway, I have no regrets about that. To be honest, Vijay, when you’re playing like that you're honing your skills, your sharpening whatever you need to learn and you don't have to think about it. It's an automatic process. Today, looking back, you can say that you are learning, but when you're playing, you're not saying you're learning, you're simply playing and by being the experience into your cells, and you know that goes to teach you what do what to do, what not to do. Vijay Lokapally: Yeah, Dilip Bhai. I think that's very, very sporting of you. But just one question for the first Test match. Which one would you pick as the best wicket? Graeme Wood or Hughes, who was brilliant, a good player of spin, even Whatmore or Hilditch, the opener. Who should be your pick? Dilip Doshi: I think it's difficult to pinpoint a wicket. But let's say that the thrill of getting Graeme Wood on the first day on my first Test is like, as they say, opening a bottle of our leaves. The first one is most difficult to take out from a bottle of leaves. And once you take the first one out, it paves room for the others, as they say. So I thought that was not a bad start, you know. And I got a good spell the next morning. The butterflies had settled down. By the way Vijay, since you asked me, let me tell you a story about a renowned commentator from the north of India. In those days there was more Akashvani , and Doordarshan was there. Not much of prominence there. At least I could lay my hands on some of the tapes. But within my hearing distance there was this guy. After the toss was done and we were going out to the field, he said to one of the other members of the team, to Rajinder Singh Ghai, the left-arm spinner, a bowler of wonderful merit. But, he said to the other fellow that your chance will come as this old guy will go out in a Test or two. I don't want to mention his name and I gave him a piece of my mind. That's how crude or how parochial some people were, and I have no regrets. It made me more determined than I realised. Vijay Lokapally: That would have made you, really, you know, just to prove him wrong, right? Dilip Doshi: No, no. See, this is where I'm saying you are there. It's a bit like a golf game. You want to improve your own score, so you want to establish yourself as a player. He's going to contribute to the wellness of the team or the winning of the team. So you need to be at your calmest mind. If you get ruffled by these people, they have been successful and you pay a way for them. So you have to take a deep breath. I do believe in meditation and I have always done that since when I was a child. That helps me a lot to calm down and in a way to be very philosophical. You don’t forget them, but you forgive them and move on. Otherwise, you hold those grudges. Vijay Lokapally: True Dilip Bhai. Now coming down to that Test match at Bombay. With the iconic venue and great opposition, I mean they had some wonderful players. Dilip Doshi: That was arguably the best England team had come to India. Vijay Lokapally: What are your immediate memories? I'll ask you specific questions. When you think of that match, what strikes you? Dilip Doshi : Well, first of all, I felt that every series will start with my aim as a player to contribute to the team's victory, and you know that feeling was very important. And you know that we did not score many runs in the first innings. And when they batted, I recall they were 104 for one or something in that region. I had to request my captain to bowl me from the other end. Finally, he did accede to my request and I worked from the other end. I got a wonderful spell of 5 for 12. What helped me was my persistent inquiring line on the middle stump. So I believed in not giving batsmen any room on either side to play and bowling a tight line with a blind spot. This is the technical way of saying when a left-arm spinner bowls from close to the stumps round the wicket, he can create a line that creates a blind spot for the batsman either to play only straight or play against the spin. So I was happy that they played against the spin and the result was obvious that we were able to get them bowled out very quickly. We got a small lead and I thought it brought a lot of beliefs in our team that we can beat this team. Just for your knowledge, we had not beaten a good England team in India. We won some matches, but we lost the series and the only victory that we had against an England team of not so much of great merit was Tony Lewis' team in 1972-73 when they had some good players. Vijay Lokapally : Yeah, yeah it was not the strongest England team Dilip Doshi: To that respect, I felt that spell of mine paved the way for the series and what happened in the rest of the series is another story anyway. Vijay Lokapally: Sir, now I really want to know about bowling from that particular end you insisted. Dilip Doshi: It always works. I will tell you why. In every venue that you play there are some areas and some ends is not necessarily suits you, but it works better for certain kind of bowling. Not always in our times and I felt that it did work. Vijay Lokapally : Yeah, so which end was that? Dilip Doshi: That was then I asked for Tata's End. Vijay Lokapally: Sir, when you decided to bowl from a particular end what are the factors were there that prompted that you will be better off bowling from this end? Dilip Doshi : It's hard for me to recall every small detail now. But I had played at the Wankhede don't forget that. I play two home series there already. We beat Australia and we beat Pakistan in series. So I already had some experience by that time, and maybe that tilted this thought in the favour of bowling from that end. I cannot recall, to be very perfectly honest, every small detail, but I know that that's what happened, that happens with every bowler in the world. Vijay Lokapally: I was tracking down the scores. I saw from 131 for three they were all out for 161. You had Fletcher, Botham, Tavare and Emburey in a row. So what are your memories of these four wickets? Because actually these four wickets gave India the win. Dilip Doshi: Yes, absolutely. I was playing in county cricket for a long time. And I know Ian Botham was an outstanding cricketer and he had the ability to change the course of any game that in which he played. He's proven over the years that he could do that. I felt that Ian will try to hit me out of their attack. We are very dear friends and he's a great competitor. I would have loved them either to jump out to the crease or to play me against the line and they chose to play against the line many times and the result was in my favour. I beat them in flight and with a little bit of spin, so that did help. So you get on a roll you know that kind of a you get into that kind of a spell. That's why I tell you I think it was a 5 for 12 to be precise in about 8 to 10 overs. So you hold them in a vice-like grip. For me, the grip has to be vice-like. You hold them and suffocate them with the oxygen which is the runs. But it's not negative bowling, you are attacking. You have an attacking field because you got close in people who want to catch them. So then they have to decide either to defend and watch the game or to hit you out. So you know it's a strategy. Vijay Lokapally: And sir, here, if you see Tavare was a blocker. Fletcher, as you know, would adapt. Botham was an attacking batsman. Emburey, of course, was there. So, what kind of adjustment you have done to your bowling to bowl out these batsmen of different character? Dilip Doshi: Well, Tavare was a stickler. He played straight. He would not take any undo chances. But when you crowd a batsman with a few close in fielders, if I recall we had four close in fielders for them. And if you can imagine, there are four close in filters. Plus wicket-keeper five, plus the bowler six that gives only five players in equation on the outfield leaving huge gaps. The temptation for most of the people will be to play a few shots to get those fields out of the scatter because you know our total was low. We were in a way, defending a lot. But there was no way you can defend. Either you get them bowled out to get to get a start, or you allow them to settle down and take a first innings lead over you, which would have made the series entirely very different. So the strategy of attacking them with close in field and you know, testing them with the nerves worked out like that. And Fletcher, of course, was one of the best players of spin in his time because when he played against our spinners, also on turning pitches, he knew how to negotiate. See playing against a spinning ball is about negotiation. The ones and the twos and the force and the odd six. You cannot predetermine anything. You have to play according to the situation on the field placing in the board and that's where I felt that planning and that knowledge of these cricketers and where to bowl to them helped. Vijay Lokapally : Sir bowling to these established three batsmen and then when you run into the tailenders, say Emburey or Bob Willis, so do you need to change your strategies or you would stick to the same line and length? Dilip Doshi: Well, you know. We had stick to same line in length because they have to adjust the game, but you entice them a little more with the freedom to play one or two shots and in the process if they hit you one or two it doesn't matter to me. The aim was to get the first innings lead. And we could get that. And that's where we changed the course of the series. Vijay Lokapally: Yeah, and sir, am I right if I say you did not believe in buying your wickets, you wanted to earn your wickets? You never gave away easy runs whether Test match or ODIs. So what kind of mindset did you have whether, like you said, to throttle them or buy your wickets? Dilip Doshi: Well, I think buying the wickets is an old time term used to be when people threw the ball in the air or they tossed it up as they say and people would go for a slog and ended up playing 15-20 runs and throw over their wickets. For me, I think the game is all about the runs. But at the same time you need to get the batsmen out. So it's a balance. The balance is if you toss the ball, you cannot spin the ball so much because in tossing the ball, the process of tossing and spinning or two different things. You can propel a spinning ball when you spin the ball you actually propel it. You know, like you spin the top like a child, you have to actually do that to spin the top and so similarly to spin the ball, you do propel a spinning ball. If you try to toss a ball, you will not be able to impart enough spin. A spinning ball dips. I'm sorry to be technical, you asked me. Vijay Lokapally: No fine sir. Dilip Doshi: So a spinning ball dips, creating an illusion in the mind of the batsman that he's there. But he's short of that. So I believe that spinning the ball also requires giving it the air, but it is not the kind of air that tossing up. You cannot mix up of flighting a spinning ball and tossing a ball. Yeah, I felt that I was a flight of the ball by spinning it. It's a quick flight rather than toss the ball, which is much easier to play in my view. Vijay Lokapally: And sir, your friend Ian Botham got 9 wickets in the Test match. What did we say about that? Here you were a spinner and he was a medium fast bowler doing well. So was it an ideal pitch for both spinners and medium fast bowlers? Dilip Doshi: Actually, it was a wonderful cricket pitch. It was not a spinning pitch by any standards. I was lucky to be able to extract spin on any pitch and I know that on a good pitch you need to only spin this much to get the edge of the bat. That's why a tight line and length is so essential for getting effect of a turning ball. And Ian Botham is always in the game whether he's batting or bowling. He will find his way to get you out. Ian, as you can see, on any kind of pitch, can seam, or he could be quick, or he could bowl cutters. So he mixed his variations and he was handful. Vijay Lokapally: Yeah, and sir I mean the target. I mean India made just 227 from what I saw from the score, there was not a single half-century from any batsmen. The target was 241, but how could you bowl just one over? Kapil Dave and Madan Lal bowled 5 overs each and you had just one. I mean you had initiated the collapse in the first innings and getting to bowl just one over. Was it a disappointment? I'm not instigating you. Dilip Doshi: Well, of course, it was a disappointment. But sometimes what happens is if you get the result, the method of getting a result is forgotten. So I have no regrets about that. It just happened that I bowled only one over. Vijay Lokapally: Yeah yeah, so would you rate this one of your finest victories? I mean I got the fact that you did perform. You played a major part in it. Dilip Doshi: Well, I would say that my spell of 5 for 12 was the series decider. You can see it. I don't have to say it. Otherwise, they would have taken a lead over hours and it would have been a different game, series altogether. But you know that when a team wins, it's more important than anything else. Vijay Lokapally: Yeah, yeah. And sir, you were quick in going through your overs. Wasn't a tactic? Or was it your style that you had to get your overs done quickly because batsman hardly had any leaving time? Dilip Doshi: Well, generally speaking a spin bowler (I had a short run up - four steps and bowl) If you fortunately didn't go for runs, then you are back on your mark very quickly. Really, it's no point in wasting time. You get on with your plan. But in that series it didn't happen so because I was accused of bowling very, very long timed overs by the England media and the press because I was advised to take my time to finish the overs. It was recorded that some of the overs took as much as four to five minutes, which is why I was criticized by English press for that. But I was acting under the orders. Vijay Lokapally : Yeah, that’s not your natural style. Dilip Doshi : No, no, it deprived me of getting at the batsman sooner. I usually get to the batsman quickly. I remember the great Lance Gibbs. He used to finish his over in one minute 40 seconds. Vijay Lokapally: Oh my God! Dilip Doshi: Gibbs was relentlessly bowling at the batsman. I like that style. But there are times when you have to listen to the command of the captain, and you have to obey. It's a team game. Vijay Lokapally : Right. Sir, one for this generation because they don't know the importance of what it was bowling to the field or having your own field and bowling to it. So but did you learn over a period of time or it came to you naturally that you will set your field and or maybe you will set your field once you get into your rhythm or you would have a predetermined a set of field before you begin your spell? Dilip Doshi: Okay. Setting my own field, I learned playing in Maidan and developing your own game. If you go through a proper system or in my view whatever system you may want to call it the coach is advising what to do. The way I grew up that I had to decide where my field should be and it teaches you the way forward. And of course as a bowler if you know where you are bowling and where you would like the batsman to play you. So you have to visualise that that's the reason why I like the sentence of Sir Neville Cardus who said that “cricket is like outdoor chess. You put your soldiers or whatever it’s. I don't play chess, but I can understand that comparison, the analogy. So I feel that it's important to leave certain gaps where the batsman is tempted to play and that's what actually you want him to do. So field placing you learn by experience. But as a bowler, like most of the bowlers otherwise worth their salt, they would have a fixed field and you will adjust one or two players in the field according to the batsman coming in. Whether it's a more defensive field or a little more attacking will depend on the individual coming in and your strategy for him. Vijay Lokapally : Right and sir, what is it that one season of domestic cricket in India will not give you what you will get say one season of county cricket? Are there any salient points which you think have. You've played so many years and you've lived in England and you have played in India in Ranji Trophy. Dilip Doshi: Well, County cricket in the era in which I played and much before me was possibly the finest quality cricket any cricketer would hope to play because England had an extensive season and a very full programme. I was playing literally seven days a week. I started playing in the era when the wickets were uncovered. Right, so it could rain and you could still go out and play on a wet pitch where you'll have to adjust the game entirely as a batsman or as a bowler. And then the sun coming out and the wind drying the pitch. The game didn't get stopped because of rain. If it is raining, they didn't play, but when it stopped you could still play. So that made cricket in England very unique. That was the only high quality professional cricket possible in those days apart from the league cricket in Lancashire League and the Northern Leagues of England, where all of the great cricketers played, including Sir Garfield Sobers, many of our Indian cricketers from the past and the Australians. Now you playing against the best players in the world in county cricket. In those days, most of the international cricketers were playing in county cricket. Very few Indian players played. Australians played. South Africans who were not able to play Test cricket also played. So it was a learning place for everybody, including those great players. We're just two different conditions to play in day in, day out according to the demands of the game. And we were playing one day cricket as well. So, there was John players’ league of 40 overs. Benson & Hedges 55 overs, Gillette Cup of 60 overs each. So plenty of cricket and you were able to hone your game and your talent according to the demands. Vijay Lokapally: Yeah, sir last couple of questions. One is your views on T20 because cricket fans and writers of my generation feel you would have made a fabulous T20 player and do you agree? Would you have loved playing the T20? And your views on this format. Dilip Doshi: Vijay, I love playing cricket. T20 would make different demands on your game. You would expect to bowl 4 overs. And I would ideally, I would want to, take at least four weeks in four overs because the batsman going out after you, which is not a problem. On some days you accept that they will really go after you and they'll get the better of you. On some days you will get the better and you'll doing the game for your team. That's the philosophy with which you have to enter this kind of cricket. Of course, T20 has come to stay. It's a great form of entertainment. I would not agree that it is a proper form of cricket. But it still needs to be played to make a lot of families, youngsters, even the corporates today interested to bring the money and keep it financially healthy. But too much of it, in my view, is going to spoil the health of the game. It's like too much fast food without having the proper meals going to ruin your health. So, I think it's important to strike a balance. For me, First Class cricket and Test cricket are the prime forces of game. It is those games that bring you great players into the game. People will go to watch miles. T20 can give a club cricketer a decent chance. An average cricketer can be a hero for a season. And I don't blame him. But as I said to you, that he would not make a good First Class or Test player. He would disappoint you. Because the transformation is huge. So I would say that a balanced approach would be necessary. My only one advice to any youngster is that don't sacrifice technique or the longevity of the game for a very quick, short success. So even for short success, adjust your game without losing your roots. Roots of the game, the technique of the game as a bowler. If a bowler has to bowl wide deliveries continuously for the sake of the team. If you got control, you should be able to do that, but then you need to have the muscle memory to go back to your roots of bowling the proper length and line. You know what I'm saying? And for many youngsters building that muscle memory is very important and that can only be built by the proper game of cricket and that is First Class cricket. Vijay Lokapally: And sir, our girls are doing exceptionally well. Do you follow women's cricket and do you have to anything to say? Dilip Doshi: I see whenever it is possible. Whenever India is playing I look at the games and I feel very proud that our women's team have done exceedingly well. I was hoping they'll beat Australia, but I saw that they lost by mere nine runs. Vijay Lokapally: Yes , sir. Dilip Doshi: I I really feel proud. They've done wonderfully well. Yeah, and I'm sure that it will encourage many young girls to take up this great game. Vijay Lokapally: And sir, finally, before we let you go… In 1991, I was a Sharjah. I attended your book launch where Mr Gary Sobers was there to launch it and you were kind enough to give me an autographed book. Do you agree he's the greatest cricketer to have played the game? Dilip Doshi: I would not even discuss this with anybody. It's a given. I feel that two cricketers are truly God-sent Sir Donald Bradman and Sir Garfield Sobers. No statistics should be brought up to compare him with anybody. People do not know the quality of cricket he played. People do not know the opposition he played and people do not even realise with what authority he commanded the games. So, and he's a true thorough gentleman. God bless him. I mean I was very lucky to spend a few hours with him in London about a few weeks back. Wonderful man. And of course, he's the greatest. He's the Emperor of Cricket I would say. Vijay Lokapally : Thank you, thank you. Sir, and I forgot to ask you one thing. Just a word about the state of the Indian team. I mean there is such fabulous talent now and we can in fact have two teams playing in a tournament. So how do you look at the current Indian team? Dilip Doshi: I think we have a fantastic talent of fast bowling. I can say even some of the young talent, wonderful fast bowlers who can bowl quick, are not playing in the team, could play for many other countries. Well, that's a great asset to have. About batting and spin bowling I have two big question marks. Let's talk about the batting first. A lot of our batting is without technique. The reason why many people are getting leg before the wicket or getting bowled as often as they are getting is because of the footwork. I am not a batting coach, but as a bowler, I know enough about batting. So I can say that the batting technique, even at the highest level of Test cricket, has gone down considerably as opposed to our Indian batting a decade back. When if you look at the spin bowling, unfortunately on good pitches outside India we are still not as effective as we should be. Because I think this success on very helpful pitches has blinded us towards that. And we have not been able to develop the technique and the temperament required bowling relentlessly on batting pitches and the field placing that it requires. So it's a basic problem I see in Indian cricket and unless it is addressed we may lose our position as a top Test-playing nation. And as far as betting is concerned I have to ask you a question. This is a very different question. Look at all the great teams in the last 50 years. Watching the game, if not playing that long but understanding the game. All the top teams did they ever have any coaches is my question to you. Vijay Lokapally: Not really, I would have asked you this question. What kind of coaching would you need at the Test level? Dilip Doshi: Well, I don't need any coaching at the Test level otherwise how reached that level? My point is you need a fielding course. You need a trainer. You need the physio. And probably you need two masseurs to make sure that if you have stiffness and if your body requires a certain release, they can give you. So fitness training is very important. Fielding coach or fielding practice especially is very important. All these are aspects of the game that you cannot ignore. The bowling coach and batting coach in my personal books are redundant. But I would have my own manager in the team who is like an elder brother to the boys. They can talk about their personal or games to him and the person in charge has to be large-hearted enough and worldly enough to suit them. And if it happens to be a former cricketer and who can give them a tip or two so be it, but it's not essential to be a former cricketer. I remember we had Wing Commander Durani in Australia in 1981. He played such a wonderful role as a manager. I'm sure he was a decent enough club cricketer or maybe he played for services I don’t know. But he never ever told us anything about the game. He got on with his job as an elder brotherly person and kept us all in good humour and through various difficult situations on the tour we were able to sail through and still square a series. So it goes to show really you do not need a coach. This is my personal view. It may be old-fashioned. But the game is old fashion let me tell you that. You still have two bats side on and bowl side on. And whatever the greats of the game did, you still have to do that to be successful. You cannot change the basics. You can make some adjustments. So these are my personal views. I know they are not enforceable because the game has gone too far forward in a corporatised manner which I welcome. Because without enough money in the game, it will die down and India is a powerhouse. But as India and Indians we have a huge responsibility towards this great game and towards the world, cricket to ensure that we set a good example of keeping the First Class cricket alive with talent and that’s for the Test cricket. Vijay Lokapally: Sir, thank you. Your views will always remain valuable. As you said, maybe not be enforceable, but it can be kept in mind. Dilip Doshi: Thank you, I have to be honest to the game that has given me a lot. Vijay Lokapally: Yeah, you have also been very kind to us sir, and thank you for this interview. Dilip Doshi : Thank you very much for having me Vijay. Pleasure is all mine. Have great regard for your group.

Later, on Tuesday evening, former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar took to his social media handle, to express his displeasure and anger, not only at Stoinis, but also at the International Cricket Council (ICC) for not taking any action against the former. Shameful gesture by @MStoinis regarding bowling action of @MHasnainPak during #TheHundred2022 . How dare you do such things?? Ofcourse @ICC stays quiet about them. No player should be allowed to do such things if someone’s been cleared already. pic.twitter.com/5idGdBqcUf — Shoaib Akhtar (@shoaib100mph) August 16, 2022 For more Cricket-related news, click here.","pubDate":"2022-08-16 19:23:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ENG vs SA Dream11 Team Prediction: England vs South Africa Check Captain, Vice-Captain, and Probable Playing XIs for Wed","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/eng-vs-sa-dream11-team-prediction-england-vs-south-africa-check-captain-vice-captain-and-probable-playing-xis-for-wednesdays-test-series-eng-vs-sa-match-august-17-330-pm-ist-11064461.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"ENG vs SA Dream11 Team Prediction: England vs South Africa Check Captain, Vice-Captain, and Probable Playing XIs for Wed","content":"The cricketing action from South Africa’s tour of England shifts from T20Is to Tests.

After winning just one Test match in 17 attempts, England have turned the script in the last four Tests, winning each one more emphatically than the previous.

Skipper Dean Elgar has marshaled his troops well and has led from the front with the bat in hand as well. Batters Keegan Petersen and Aiden Markram will be responsible for leading the batting along with the skipper.Proteas' biggest concern will be the fitness of their ace pacer Kagiso Rabada.

Ben Stokes has been among them, England’s Test captain itching to rekindle the magic that lit up the first half of the summer through those four rip-roaring victories against New Zealand and India. To that end Stokes held a team meeting on Sunday when his players reconvened before the first Test against South Africa which starts on Wednesday; a refresher course intended to reaffirm the positive ethos that himself and the head coach, Brendon McCullum , are demanding. England’s ‘Bazball’ approach has got in South Africa’s heads, claims Ben Stokes Read more “It’s the last time I will ever write on a whiteboard,” he joked after their final training session on Tuesday. “I needed to ask how to spell ‘environment’.” Stokes may be unsure of the precise letters in the word but appears to have a firm grasp on its meaning. Players young and old are visibly relishing the new ethos of relaxed training sessions, aggressive play and selectorial loyalty under his leadership. Winning clearly helps here but their upbeat approach to each day and session has been an obvious point of difference from the angst of the previous regime’s final year. There have of course been sliding‑doors moments along the way, be it Colin de Grandhomme’s no-ball at Lord’s, dropped catches at Trent Bridge or New Zealand’s failure to review an lbw shout against Jamie Overton at Headingley just five runs into a score of 97 that made up one half of a match-defining seventh‑wicket stand of 241. England have also profited from the particularly celestial form of Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root, the pair making hay against what was a substandard batch of Dukes balls. But they have also wriggled out of some tight spots characterfully, such as shipping 553 against New Zealand at Trent Bridge or overcoming a first‑innings deficit of 132 against India at Edgbaston. Four targets they may previously have baulked at have also been vaporised, not that Stokes is too fussed about the end result. “Honestly, if we’d lost 4-0 I wouldn’t be sitting here changing the way I ask the lads to go out and play,” he said. The hope now, he said, was this filters down to the county game and energises the support base for both England and the longer format as a whole. Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson (left) are expected to lead England’s attack again at Lord’s. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images The question asked by many in response is how England will fare when they bat first and how sustainable this all is long term. After the diet of white-ball internationals and the Hundred comes a three-match series against South Africa, the leading side in the World Test Championship, and thus the latest examination. That said, a little extra patience may still be required. The recent heatwave has turned London’s parks and commons as beige as one of Richie Benaud’s jackets – Lord’s, lush green, has remained immune – but the forecast for day one is not too clever. Dean Elgar, a South Africa captain whose batting is likely to exhaust the synonyms for “gritty” over the next four weeks, is among the sceptics regarding “Bazball”. He said he is braced for passages of play when the numbers on the scoreboard spin like wheels of a fruit machine but, while insisting he was not criticising the efforts of New Zealand and India in the field, fancies his attack will serve as the antidote overall. “I would like to think from a bowling point of view, our bowlers are big, tall, fast and strong buggers and we have ticked the boxes in regards to the spin department,” he said.

Quick Guide Lord's teams Show England (confirmed): Alex Lees, Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes (c), Ben Foakes (wk), Jack Leach, Matt Potts, Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson. South Africa (possible): Dean Elgar (c), Sarel Erwee, Keegan Petersen, Aidan Markram, Rassie van der Dussen, Kyle Verryenne (wk), Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. Among them is the classy Kagiso Rabada, light on overs but expected to be fit after an ankle injury, similarly Lungi Ngidi and the pacy Anrich Nortje who also sat out the recent warmup against the Lions. If selected, the newcomer Marco Jansen offers a left-arm angle from a 6ft 7in frame – even if his required deployment at No 7 would look high – and they have two seasoned spinners to choose from in Keshav Maharaj and Simon Harmer. The former is likely to get the nod at Lord’s despite a mauling from the Lions but the latter – a proven expert on English surfaces – should feature at some stage. Stokes described England’s selection as “easy”, their only tweak coming via a return for Ben Foakes behind the stumps after missing Edgbaston with Covid-19. While Ollie Robinson appears sharp and incisive once more after early season fitness issues, Stokes and McCullum feel Stuart Broad’s interventions – such as the third-morning “team hat-trick” against New Zealand on this ground – outweigh his record of 15 wickets at 38 this summer. If Broad and Jimmy Anderson open the bowling in both innings they will have done so in 200 innings in Test cricket, while the former is also one wicket away from 100 Test victims at Lord’s. Both veterans will be keen to see if the latest Dukes balls to come out of the factory in Walthamstow hold up better than those used previously – the flip side being that if they are hardier than before, more questions may be asked of the batters. During a different time, a player such as Zak Crawley – averaging 17.75 so far this summer – would be deemed to be playing for his spot. But Stokes was having none of it, hailing the right-hander’s selfless approach and describing his 100-run opening stand with Alex Lees during the run chase at Edgbaston as his favourite passage of play to date. Such a response is pretty much the Stokes way these days. He may have retired from one-day internationals recently and decided the whiteboard is not for him but, when it comes to England’s approach to Test cricket, the captain’s mind is very much made up.","pubDate":"2022-08-16 18:48:38","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3f72e3767f862201d77749a01c15534796fc4f3/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a014a43a07df1a016e8c978970e693a3","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies vs New Zealand: WI vs NZ Head-to-Head record and venue record of Kensington Oval","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/west-indies-vs-new-zealand-wi-vs-nz-head-to-head-record-and-venue-record-of-kensington-oval-11065051.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"West Indies vs New Zealand: WI vs NZ Head-to-Head record and venue record of Kensington Oval","content":"The high-octane action from New Zealand’s tour of the West Indies shifts from the T20Is to the 50-over format.

The remarks came in the wake of rumours about former Indian captain and current Chennai Super Kings (CSK) skipper MS Dhoni mentoring Johannesburg Super Kings, a side owned by his franchise for the inaugural edition of Cricket South Africa (CSA) T20 League. A BCCI official said that the board will not allow its players to take part in any foreign cricket leagues. “We do not provide our players to any other cricket league abroad. We have a straight policy regarding this. Our Indian Premier League is itself a huge league and we cannot allow any of our players to attach themselves to any foreign league in any manner,” Shukla told ANI. South Africa and UAE Cricket board have announced their T20 League, set to start next year. With IPL franchises like Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders buying teams across these two leagues, it was expected that Indian players would also feature in these two leagues. But BCCI wants players to fulfil their commitments towards the board and IPL. Earlier in April, Cricket South Africa (CSA) and SuperSport TV announced the formation of a t20 competition featuring six private-owned franchises starting from January 2023 onwards. Later in July, the Emirates Cricket Board confirmed that the inaugural International League T20 (ILT20) League will be played between the window of January 6 to February 12, 2023. The six-team franchise-style League will be played over a 34-match schedule at world-renowned, world-class venues in UAE. The first event is scheduled to be played in the window of January 6 and February 12, 2023.","pubDate":"2022-08-16 18:43:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lord’s London pitch report 1st Test: Lord’s cricket ground ENG vs SA Test pitch report","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-lords-london-pitch-report-1st-test-lords-cricket-ground-eng-vs-sa-test-pitch-report/","keywords":["Cricket","Lord's Cricket Ground","South Africa tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lord’s London pitch report 1st Test: England take on the South African challenge in the first of three-match Test series at the Lord’s.

All set for tomorrow! 💪 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 #ENGvSA 🇿🇦 pic.twitter.com/Vo4km8nUNa — England Cricket (@englandcricket) August 16, 2022 Today’s pitch at Lord’s, London will have a significant tinge of grass, which is likely to assist the seamers, especially with the new ball. Despite hot weather conditions experienced by the city in the past few days, the first day and perhaps the rest of the match days as well, is likely to experience significant rainfall . Thus, the overcast conditions are likely to assist the bowlers throughout the match duration. However, as was the case during the previous match at this venue, batters have enjoyed their time in the middle even during the fourth innings. The average first innings score at Lord’s is 311, and the teams batting first have won more matches comparatively. Thus, all in all, the pitch is likely to be a balanced one, although with the pace bowlers likely to take the field with a slight advantage.","pubDate":"2022-08-16 18:31:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England vs South Africa 1st Test Live Telecast Channel name in India and UK: When and where to watch ENG vs SA Lord’s Test?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-england-vs-south-africa-1st-test-live-telecast-channel-name-in-india-and-uk-when-and-where-to-watch-eng-vs-sa-lords-test/","keywords":["Cricket","England","South Africa","South Africa tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"England vs South Africa 1st Test Live Telecast: The SportsRush presents before you the timing and live streaming details of 1st ENG vs SA Test.

Several players, including KL Rahul and Yuzvendra Chahal, made their India debuts in that tour.This time Rahul returns to Zimbabwe not only as a senior member of the team and a first-choice option at the top of the order, but is also the captain of this outfit with Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and other seniors headed to the Gulf for the Asia Cup.Rahul’s accompanied by Shikhar Dhawan, who was originally assigned to lead the Indian contingent in Zimbabwe, as well as several other first-team players such as Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav, Deepak Chahar among others.The tour, however, is a lot shorter this time around, with the Men in Blue scheduled to play just three ODIs as compared to the three ODIs and as many T20Is that was part of their itinerary six summers ago. Which means not many members of the 16-member squad will get an opportunity at Harare over the five-day period in which the three games will take place.And the one department that is especially crowded is the top order; Rahul and Dhawan are the first-choice openers anyway and will be expected to fulfil those roles in the first two games if India opt to play it safe and go for the kill with the aim of clinching the series early on.If experimentation is the name of the game for the Men in Blue, skipper Rahul might just end up shuffling down the order to either one-down or the No 4 slot, leaving Dhawan to open alongside either of Shubman Gill, Sanju Samson, Ruturaj Gaikwad or Ishan Kishan.Whether considered for the opener’s slot or lower down the order, the one individual who will have it tough getting game time in the upcoming series will be Kishan, who was in sparkling form in the home T20I series against South Africa right after the IPL but has tapered off since then.Kishan normally would be considered for the opener’s slot, given he batted at that position for Mumbai Indians throughout IPL 2022 as well as in each opportunity that he got with the Indian team since then.Also Read: ‘Shubman Gill looks more settled than Ishan Kishan’, says Maninder SinghThe Patna lad was in prime form during the South Africa T20Is, topping the run charts with 206 runs at an average of 41.20 with two half-centuries to his name, striking at 150. However, his form has declined sharply since then, starting with the Ireland tour where he underwhelmed in both games — collecting just 29 runs across two games. The same series in which Deepak Hooda proved handy both as an opener (47 not out off 29) as well as a No 3 option (104 off 57). Sanju Samson too pushed himself up the pecking order with a blazing 77 in the second game. And both Hooda and Samson will be competing with Kishan for slots in the upcoming series.Kishan’s form further declined in the England T20Is, where he was dropped from the XI after getting dismissed for 8 in the series opener, with fellow wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant filling in as Rohit’s opening partner. Despite being part of the squad, he wasn’t considered for the ODIs.Kishan's gradual slideThe southpaw had a similar experience in the Caribbean, where he ended up playing just one game throughout the tour comprising three ODIs and five T20Is, despite being part of both squads. This time it was Suryakumar Yadav partnering Rohit at the top, the former highlighting his skills as an opener after having impressed in various other positions.Kishan got an opportunity at the very end of the tour of the Caribbean and the United States, only after skipper Rohit decided to rest himself, and his dismissal for 11 in that game might have proved the tipping point as far as the patience of the team leadership and that of the selectors’ was concerned.India’s squad for the Asia Cup was announced soon after, Kishan’s name missing from the list. Quite the fall for an individual who had broken into the top 10 in the ICC T20 batting rankings not too long ago.“I feel that what selectors do is fair. They put a lot of thought while selecting players as to who should be given the opportunity and where. It is a positive for me because if I am not selected, I will work harder and score more runs. When selectors will have confidence in me, they will obviously keep me in the team,” Kishan said after India’s Asia Cup squad was announced.While unlikely to get game time at the Harare Sports Club that will host all the games in the Zimbabwe series, and relegated to having to watch the Asia Cup from the comfort of his home, Kishan will perhaps be hoping he remains in the selectors’ radar and somehow lands an opportunity in the home assignments after Asia Cup.India, after all, face Australia and South Africa at home, both T20I assignments, after the Asia Cup, and they will be hoping to add the finishing touches to their T20 World Cup plan in those games. Should he get picked yet again, those games could be a final opportunity for Kishan to retain his place in the squad before he gets axed for good.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Alongside the likes of Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, and Deepti Sharma, the 21-year-old Jemimah Rodrigues is slowly, but surely making a mark for herself yet again at the international stage for the Indian women’s Cricket team. The road, however, has not been smooth so far, as she faced one of the most challenging phases of her career, when she was not picked in the squad for the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup in New Zealand this year. Despite admitting to have faced a dearth of confidence and lack of self-belief post the selection snub, the 21-year-old did manage to pick herself up with a remarkable show in senior women’s league and then in India’s tour of Sri Lanka. The right-hander also nearly took the Indian team all the way to clinch the Gold medal in the recently concluded Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, where her performances against Barbados, England (semi-final), and Australia (final) were instrumental in the team winning the Silver medal. A happy-go-lucky woman, which one can ascertain by going through her social media handles, Rodrigues, yet again came up with a quirky and funny meme, which also features the likes of the Indian men’s team legends in Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. The 21-year-old included herself in the popular meme across the internet, in which Kohli and Dhoni are placed alongside each other in nearly front split positions, in their bid to place their foot behind the batting crease to save their wicket. Jemimah, who nearly pulled off something similar during the semi-final clash against England in CWG 2022, didn’t let go the opportunity to include herself in this ‘elite list’ of players to have successfully saved themselves from getting dismissed by stretching their feet to the maximum. She posted Dhoni’s, Kohli’s, and finally her picture juxtaposed vertically, while coming up with the caption – “Looks like I’m now part of Elite Company’.

The SLC has sent Letters of Demand (LOD) of LKR 2 billion (INR 43.4 crore approx) for \"loss of reputation\". The SLC administrators stated that the decision was taken after \"extensively deliberating\" on a \"false, derogatory and distorted statement\" made by Arjuna during a recent media interview. The Statement also mentioned that Arjuna “has spoken with malicious intent, damaging the goodwill and reputation of the SLC and have deliberately made public comments by making false and defamatory accusations against the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket.\" The 58-year-old Arjuna, who is the newly-appointed chairman of the National Sports Council led Sri Lanka in the 1996 edition of the World Cup. Sri Lanka won the title after defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan. He also led Sri Lanka in the 1997 Asia Cup, when the country lifted the trophy after defeating India in the final. It was Sri Lanka's 2nd Asia Cup title which came after a gap of 11 years after 1986. Under his captaincy, Sri Lanka secured their first ever historic Test victory on English soil against England which happened to be in 1998. In his career, Arjuna has scored 7456 runs in 269 ODIs with four centuries, 49 fifties and a high score of 131. He made his Test debut at the age of 18 in Sri Lanka's inaugural Test match and is his country's first cricketer to score a fifty in Test. In the 93 Test matches that he played during his career, he scored 5105 runs, with a high score of 135 including four hundreds and 38 half-centuries.","pubDate":"2022-08-16 17:18:40","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CSA T20 League: SRH names Port Elizabeth-based franchise ‘Sunrisers Eastern Cape’","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/csa-t20-league-srh-names-port-elizabeth-based-franchise-sunrisers-eastern-cape-11065381.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"CSA T20 League: SRH names Port Elizabeth-based franchise ‘Sunrisers Eastern Cape’","content":"The Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) on Tuesday announced the name of their CSA T20 League franchise, confirming the Port Elizabeth-based franchise’s identity as 'Sunrisers Eastern Cape'.SRH took to their official Instagram page to announce the name of the South African franchise.
