However, the bad news for the fans and the players is that the forecast for the second match doesn‚Äôt look promising either.The latest weather report suggests dark clouds over Bay Oval during the game time. There is a 90% chance of rain during the match, while the temperature on Sunday will hover in the range of 15-18 degrees Celsius with 80-85% humidity.But, there is still a slight chance of India vs New Zealand second T20I going ahead as the probability of precipitation is expected decrease in the evening.The match will begin at 7:30 PM local time (12 PM IST).Interestingly, the team batting first has won all T20I matches at the Bay Oval but with rain likely to reduce the overs, the toss-winning captain will most likely opt to bowl first.Squads:India: Shubman Gill, Ishan Kishan, Sanju Samson, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya(c), Rishabh Pant(w), Deepak Hooda, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Umran Malik, Washington Sundar, Mohammed Siraj, Shreyas Iyer, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshal PatelNew Zealand: Finn Allen, Devon Conway(w), Kane Williamson(c), Glenn Phillips, Daryl Mitchell, James Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Adam Milne, Lockie Ferguson, Blair Tickner, Michael Bracewell, Ish Sodhi.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

I don‚Äôt have to worry about T20s for another nine months,‚Äù said Starc.‚ÄúI spoke to George at length. It was a good conversation. Many different things were floated there.‚ÄúI still have ambitions to play T20 cricket for Australia but it is a long time to the next one and a lot of water to go under the bridge. So we will face that when we get to that.‚ÄùAfter his World Cup dumping, it was suggested that Starc had sabotaged his Twenty20 form by continually snubbing the Indian Premier League for the past seven years.Starc says maybe so, but refuses to apologise for making Test cricket his No.1 driving force.‚ÄúIt may have, but if I‚Äôd gone in there and having no break and playing 12 months of the year, what does that affect? Does that affect my body? Do I break down? Does it affect my red-ball cricket?,‚Äù said Starc.‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just sit there and go, ‚Äòhe should go to the IPL because he‚Äôd be a better T20 bowler.‚Äô‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the downside of that? Do I give away a format of the game because I‚Äôm playing 12 months of the year?‚ÄúIn my mind I don‚Äôt regret any of those decisions not to go.‚ÄùMitch Starc PollFor that reason there is a feeling Australian cricket has grossly underappreciated the quiet sacrifices Starc has made for his country, electing to preserve his body and mind for Test cricket rather than make easy money in the IPL.Despite being a lightning rod for criticism over the years for his performances in Test cricket, the truth is Starc has been Australia‚Äôs best Test bowler for the past 18 months and in the upcoming Test series against the West Indies he is on track to become the fastest Australian to 300 wickets after Dennis Lillee, Glenn McGrath, Warne and Mitchell Johnson.It‚Äôs understood Starc was ranked lower than Josh Hazlewood on this year‚Äôs Cricket Australia contract list, despite the fact he powered last summer‚Äôs Ashes triumph and was the preferred second quick alongside Pat Cummins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Australia currently has a headache on its hands with gun all-rounder Cameron Green intending to go to his first IPL in the midst of one of the most packed calendars Australian cricket has seen.Green pulled up sore from the first ODI against England and has returned to Perth to prepare for the first Test ‚Äì another reminder of the delicate management needed to ensure the prodigy does not burn out.Starc refused to comment on whether his IPL sacrifices had been underappreciated, but confirmed the decision to knock back at least one-two million dollars a year for the past seven years was made chiefly with Australian Test cricket as his No.1 priority.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not for me to say. It‚Äôs my decision. I feel like particularly last year, if I take my Test cricket from the past 12-18 months and how that‚Äôs benefited from the break that I‚Äôve had through IPL periods, that‚Äôs paid for itself I guess,‚Äù said Starc.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always been my decision and that is part of the reason that I do it, to give myself that break physically and mentally. And the other side of it is to see and spend time with my wife (Australian women‚Äôs captain Alyssa Healy) away from cricket.‚ÄùStarc said even without playing IPL it would be impossible for him to continue playing all three formats for Australia for the long-term.","pubDate":"2022-11-20 04:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ashwin defends Dravid‚Äôs absence from New Zealand tour; here‚Äôs what he said","link":"https://www.orissapost.com/ashwin-defends-dravids-absence-from-new-zealand-tour-heres-what-he-said/","keywords":["Sports","R Ashwin","Rahul Dravid"],"creator":["Post News Network"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi: Veteran India off-spinner R Ashwin has defended India head coach Rahul Dravid‚Äôs absence from the New Zealand tour, saying the support staff ‚Äúneeded a break‚Äù after putting in extensive work in preparation for the T20 World Cup.

Days after Dravid‚Äôs predecessor Ravi Shastri had questioned why an India coach would need a break when they get ‚Äútwo-three months‚Äù off during the IPL, Ashwin said that the coaching staff was physically and mentally burned out. Former India batter and current National Cricket Academy (NCA) head VVS Laxman is in charge of the Indian team in New Zealand in Dravid‚Äôs absence. ‚ÄúI will explain why Laxman has gone there with a completely different team because even that could be interpreted differently,‚Äù Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. ‚ÄúRahul Dravid and his team put in extensive hard work ahead of the T20 World Cup ‚Äì right from planning. Since I saw this from close quarters, I‚Äôm saying this. ‚ÄúThey had specific in-depth plans for each venue and each opposition. So they would have been under not only mental but also physical burnout, and everyone needed a break. ‚ÄúAs soon as the New Zealand series ends, we have the Bangladesh tour. That‚Äôs why we have a different coaching staff led by Laxman for this tour.‚Äù Dravid, one of India‚Äôs greatest batters, was given a rest after the T20 World Cup as Laxman became India‚Äôs stand-in coach for the tour of New Zealand, with Hardik Pandya taking over as captain for the T20I series. The arrangement didn‚Äôt go down well with Shastri, who was replaced by Dravid at the end of the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in breaks. I want to understand my team and players, and then be in control of that team. What do you need that many breaks for, to be honest? You get your two-three months of the IPL, that‚Äôs enough for you to rest as a coach,‚Äù Shastri had said. ‚ÄúBut other times, I think a coach should be hands-on, whoever he is.‚Äù India qualified for the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in Australia after winning four out of five group matches, but were humiliated by eventual champions England. Dravid had been also rested for a tour of Zimbabwe earlier this year. India‚Äôs ongoing tour of New Zealand comprises three T20Is and three ODIs. After that, India will be in Bangladesh for three ODIs and two Tests, and Dravid will be back for that tour.

SAINT, SINNER, SHOOSH: LOW BLOW FOR GALLENIn a major snub, old warhorse Paul Gallen has been relegated from main event status for his farewell fight against Justin Hodges on Wednesday night.It is a huge shock and could be considered disrespectful to the 41-year-old sporting warrior who has regularly dragged in big pay-per-view audiences for promoters No Limit and Foxtel‚Äôs Main Event.In fairness Gallen‚Äôs form has been on the decline for two years and the fight with Hodges, whom he fought not so long ago, lacks the appeal of some of his bigger shows.Age has finally caught up with one of Australia‚Äôs toughest ever sports stars.Instead the highly regarded world middleweight contender Michael Zerafa has been given the main billing on Wednesday night at Darling Harbour‚Äôs International convention centre.It marks an incredible turnaround for Zerafa, who infamously pulled out of his much-hyped grudge match against Tim Tszyu in July last year.So low were the Melburnians‚Äô stocks at the time, there was even talk he would never fight on television in Australia again.But with a new team and talk of a potential world title shot against Gennady Golovkin on the horizon, Zerafa risks it all against Sydney-based Italian Danilo Creati.It will be a huge night of boxing with another rugby league star on debut as Gallen calls it a day.As first reported by this column, France bound ex-Rooster Siua Sio Taukehio has been confirmed to make his boxing debut against former South Sydney, Cowboys and Storm enforcer Jaiman Lowe.Securing the Tongan international a fight had been a challenge for promoters due the timing around the rugby league world Cup.South Sydney Rabbitohs forward Daniel Suluka-Fifita will also make his professional boxing debut on the card. Suluka-Fifita has been training under the watchful eye legendary trainer of Johnny Lewis for the past eight weeks having started boxing training at Redfern PCYC as a 13 year-old.* * * * * SAINTFooty legend Ian Walsh came from the tiny country town of Eugowra that has been wiped out in the floods. Walsh‚Äôs daughter Donna still lives in the area. Donna is assisting in the huge recovery operation and has appealed to NRL clubs to help out. Not with money but with manpower. ‚ÄúEugowra put dad on the map as a rugby league player,‚Äù Donna said, ‚ÄúI know he‚Äôd want me to be reaching out to the game when the town is suffering like it is.‚Äù Donna has even organised for Dominos to supply free pizzas for the clean-up operation. All she needs now is some players. Donna can be contacted on 0409 743 682 if you‚Äôd like to help out.SINNERWe all love Victor Radley, even those who dislike the Roosters. He‚Äôs a great character and a tough old-school footy player. However there comes a time when we all need to grow up and walk away from a looming incident and/or violence, even when provoked. It‚Äôs time for him to start behaving like a professional athlete.SHOOSHWhich big-name NRL star is talking to a rival Sydney club about the possibility of him quitting his team for an immediate switch.

This is an empty bar at the MCG last Sunday night in the 14th over of the game. Their fans rarely drink at the cricket. It costs the caterers big time. If the Aussies were playing, they‚Äôd be lining up six-deep. THE POLITICIAN, HONEY KING PRAWNS AND NOT-SO-SECRET MEETINGNo other NRL club can leak sensitive information like the Canterbury Bulldogs.You‚Äôll remember last November Eels hooker Reed Mahoney was having a private dinner in the club‚Äôs Chinese restaurant with Gus Gould and Trent Barrett. Contract talks over honey king prawns and Mongolian lamb. A picture was sent straight to The Daily Telegraph.You‚Äôve got to wonder why they met in such a public space.Then there was the photo of Billy Kikau in a Bulldogs shirt at Belmore with Gus and Baz being leaked last year while he was still at the Penrith Panthers. Highly embarrassing for Kikau, who copped a hard time from his fans.An employee, who took a frame from security CCTV and circulated it on social media, was sacked.Then July this year. Cameron Ciraldo and his manager George Mimis had a secret lunch with Bulldogs sponsor Craig Laundy to discuss the coaching job. Footage was leaked straight to Channel 9. This week, same again. Hotel billionaire Arthur Laundy signed up for a new five-year sponsorship deal to match the length of Ciraldo‚Äôs coaching contract.It‚Äôs worth $1 million a year or $1.2 million if they make the finals.A good positive story about a rock-solid businessman who signed up when the club was at its lowest but is now committing long term.The plan was to make a major announcement this week to ensure Laundy got maximum exposure.Turns out Craig Laundy had photos taken on his phone at the official signing. He shared them with Gould, Ciraldo and other mates on Wednesday night. His pictures then hit social media.To be fully transparent, your columnist is writing this with a certain amount of disappointment.We were going to reveal the $5 million sponsorship deal two weeks ago. Chairman John Khoury and CEO Aaron Warburton asked us to hold off. We made an agreement. We would break the story this week before their official announcement.Craig Laundy, a former Liberal federal minister, is like all politicians. They leak like a sieve.The Daily Telegraph NRL Podcast ‚Äì PlaylistBOO & BALI A TRIBUTE TO FIFITARecently retired Sharks big man Andrew Fifita has found himself in a little bit of froth and bubble while holidaying in Bali.But before you jump to conclusions, the froth and bubble was courtesy of a barista who amazed the 2016 premiership hero, garnishing his brew with a recent tribute cartoon, done by Telegraph sports sketcher Boo Bailey.The copying process is a specialty of the house at Coffee Cartel and had a surprised Fifita joking: ‚ÄúI got squeezed out of the Sharks cap, but made it into this one.‚ÄùSYDNEY FC SIGN UP 11-YEAR-OLD TWINSSydney FC have signed their youngest ever players ‚Äì 11-year-old identical twin brothers.Jacob and Benjamin Zaidel have joined the club‚Äôs junior academy alongside some of the country‚Äôs most outstanding soccer prospects.It is an exciting story on the eve of the World Cup that local clubs are now following the lead of global giants in Europe and South America by recognising kids at such a young age.‚ÄúThey live and breathe the game,‚Äù says their dad Dani. ‚ÄúWho knows what the future holds ‚Äì as long as they keep enjoying it.‚ÄùInterestingly there are rules in the NRL that prevent clubs from signing players before they turn 15.The boys have been identified by Kelly Cross, Sydney FC‚Äôs youth technical director, who has a long and proud history of nurturing the best talent in Australian soccer.Kelly is a former head of football at Westfield Sports High who coached current Socceroos Aaron Mooy and Andrew Redmayne, as well as Harry Kewell, Alex Brosque and Jason Culina.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been monitoring Ben and Jacob for a period of time and it became clear that they were both equally talented,‚Äù Cross said.‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt tell them apart in terms of ability so it helped that they were wearing different coloured and numbered bibs so there were no problems identifying them.‚ÄúThey are only 11-years old but they are promising young players showing creative potential and it‚Äôs great to bring them into our environment.‚ÄúThey are great kids, bubbly and enthusiastic with a good attitude. They get on well with each other and their peers.‚ÄùThe boys‚Äô dad Dani could not be prouder.‚ÄúSydney FC start with Under 13‚Äôs at their academy,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúThe boys are going in a year early. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a year by year agreement that the parents sign.‚ÄúThey‚Äôve had a big advantage as twins kicking a football around the backyard from when they were tiny. They just love the game and are really excited about it.‚Äù‚ÄòROCKY‚Äô A GREAT MAN AND INNOVATORJournalism lost an all-time legend with the passing of Roy ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù Miller, a former editor of this newspaper and the most tragic St George Illawarra Dragons fan. The great man was 77.I learnt more from Rocky‚Äôs weekly Sunday Telegraph editorial meetings than I have from anyone in 46 years. He was a fanatical news chaser and innovator.Back in the 1980s, before anyone kept or thought of rugby league statistics, he sent copy boys to every game to do tackle counts. They became hugely popular in Monday‚Äôs papers.Our staff would all cheer for the Dragons each weekend knowing a victory would mean he‚Äôd be in a good mood for Tuesday morning conference. It could be miserable otherwise.As an editor, he was one of the great mentors. He gave me my start as a sports editor. I remember him playing an instrumental role in broadcaster Ray Hadley‚Äôs career in his early days. Hadley had just started the Continuous Call team on 2UE. He was up against the high-profile Hollywood and Zorba, a duo that won every footy ratings survey.Zorba used to joke: ‚ÄúRay could rob a bank without a balaclava and get away with it because no one knows who he is.‚ÄùHadley then made an appointment to meet Rocky. He needed to lift his profile and asked Miller if he could write a weekly column in The Sunday Telegraph sports section ‚Äì Hadley‚Äôs Hard Hits. He did it for free. He would soon become one of the major voices in league and regularly win the ratings.What I admired most was Rocky‚Äôs loyalty. He‚Äôd stick solid no matter what. Three weeks before his death he sent me a text about Dragons legend Craig Young, one of his all-time favourite players who was under siege as chairman for his controversial support of Brett Finch in a court reference.‚ÄúLook after him,‚Äù Rocky wrote. ‚ÄúHe made a mistake trying to help a mate (Finch‚Äôs father). Does not deserve to be crucified.‚ÄùTypical Rocky. Always looking after his beloved club ‚Ä¶ and his mates right to the end.* Rocky‚Äôs funeral is on Tuesday at 11am at St Aloysius church in Cronulla.","pubDate":"2022-11-19 23:52:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Income of Rs.3,730 crore..

Chasing 281 to level the series after Australia won the first match in Adelaide on Thursday, England appeared well on track as Sam Billings and James Vince shared a 122-run partnership for the fourth wicket. But once Vince was trapped lbw by stand-in Australian captain Josh Hazlewood for 60, the English imploded, losing 4-13 to virtually hand the Australians the match. On a tricky wicket at the SCG, Steve Smith continued the form he showed in Australia‚Äôs six-wicket win in Adelaide with a hard-fought 94 to help Australia to 280-8. The target always looked difficult on a surface that was playing slow with the occasional bad bounce. ‚ÄúIt looks easy to bat on when a partnership is going,‚Äù Hazlewood said of the surface. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre only a wicket away from causing a collapse on such a pitch. I was very happy with 280.‚Äù England got the worst possible start to the run chase when Jason Roy tickled Mitchell Starc‚Äôs second delivery down the leg side to keeper Alex Carey. Three balls later Starc got the key wicket of Dawid Malan with an almost unplayable ball that pitched on leg stump then swung back to take the top of off, leaving England staggering at two wickets for no runs. Phil Salt and Vince kept playing with the aggression that the England white-ball teams are renowned for, and took the score to 34 after five overs. But Salt tried one big shot too many, stepping away to try and smash Hazlewood over cover only to miss the ball and see it cannon into his stumps. Any hopes Australia may have had of crashing through the England batting lineup were dashed by Vince and Billings. The two mixed caution with aggression as they took the score to 156 before Vince was trapped by Hazlewood as he tried to hoist the Australian skipper over the square leg boundary. England captain Moeen Ali came in and smashed leg spinner Adam Zampa for a four and a six, then missed a top spinner and was bowled. At 168-5 after 28.3 overs, Australia were back in control and they tightened their grip one run later when Zampa bowled Billings for 71. England wickets kept tumbling as Starc (4-47), Hazlewood (2-33) and Zampa (4-45) wrapped up the English tail. ‚ÄúWe were in a good position with the bat but we lost wickets,‚Äù Ali said. ‚ÄúThe wicket actually got easier to bat on but we lost wickets-it‚Äôs just one of those things. ‚ÄúThey bowled well in that phase and the pressure got to us. If you lose wickets regularly, you‚Äôre not going to win many games.‚Äù Earlier, Smith‚Äôs 94 from 114 balls anchored the Australian innings after Hazlewood won the toss and decided to bat. Hazlewood was brought into the side for captain Pat Cummins, who was rested with an eye to the upcoming Test series against the West Indies. The pitch initially offered little help for the seamers but it deteriorated as the innings progressed. ‚Äì AFP","pubDate":"2022-11-19 16:42:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","country":["Kuwait"],"category":["sports"],"language":"arabic"},{"title":"Little by little perishing May Islands team: Kathikutty players who flipped!","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/little-by-little-perishing-may-islands-team-kathikutty-players-who-flipped/","keywords":["Sports","ACT XI","Australia","Cricket","NSW","online special","top order","Tour","West Indies"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"The West Indies team, which has gone to Australia for the 2-Test series, drew a match against New South Wales and Act XI in a 3-day warm-up match. The fact that the two Kathucuti players of the team turned the bowling of the May Islands team is the talk of the Australian cricket world. May [‚Ä¶]","content":"The West Indies team, which has gone to Australia for the 2-Test series, drew a match against New South Wales and Act XI in a 3-day warm-up match. The fact that the two Kathucuti players of the team turned the bowling of the May Islands team is the talk of the Australian cricket world. May Islands play 2 Test matches in December. The 1st Test will be played in Perth and the 2nd Test will be played in Adelaide. In the 3-day practice match held in Canberra, May Islands batted first and scored 424 runs for the loss of 9 wickets. New South Wales and the Oct-11 team, who continued to bowl, turned the bowling over and declared (!) 426/4 in 97 overs. In the 2nd innings, May Isles stumbled to 114/4 and the game was drawn. In this, the misery of the May Islands team is that the 24-year-old player named Blake Macdonald, the captain of the New South Wales and Act XI team, scored 177 runs off 265 balls with 15 fours and 5 sixes. Another player, Oliver Davies, only 22, scored 115 runs off 106 balls with 14 fours and 3 sixes, while Justin Aventano scored 54 runs. The fact that these 3 players are Kathucutti players who have not yet played first-class cricket is being talked about in Australia as the main point that indicates the weakness of the May Islands bowling. If non-first-class players like Kimar Roach, Jayden Seals, Aljarri Joseph and off-spinner Ruston Chase are turning the ball around, what will a batting line-up of Warner, Khawaja, Travis Head, Smith and Labuschenne do for the May Islands in Test cricket against Australia? The talk has arisen in Australia. The fact that the May Islands team, which had already failed to qualify for the T20 World Cup, was invited for the Test series is seen by the Australian media as a mockery and sarcasm. Kimar Roche scored 34 runs against this Kathucutti team and failed to lose a single wicket in 13 overs. Jayden Seals, the current leading fast bowler for the May Islands, bowled 14 overs and failed to take a wicket. Aljari Joseph scored 54 runs in 13 overs, while Raston Chase scored 117 runs in 23 overs and took only one wicket. If the leading bowlers of the May Islands do not take wickets, how can they take wickets against Australia? Australian batsmen are expected to break many records in this series. It really adds to the sadness and pain that the bowling of the Isles of May has degraded to what it is today. In the end, the current top bowlers of the May Islands, even Kathucutti batsmen could beat them or they could not even beat players who had not even played first-class cricket. This state of affairs suggests that the greatest art of the May Islands, cricket, has reached its final days. Just like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, cricket in the May Islands was developed by British colonialism as a great anti-colonial art and sport. It is hard to digest that today the art of cricket in the May Islands is slowly going downhill and dying unnoticed by the moneyed cricket world.","pubDate":"2022-11-19 16:39:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"AUS vs ENG: ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ü‡•á‡§∂‡§® ‡§™‡•â‡§≤‡§ø‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ë‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ! ‡§ú‡•ã‡§∂ ‡§π‡•á‡§ú‡§≤‡§µ‡•Å‡§° ‡§®‡•á ‡§¨‡§§‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§®","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/josh-hazlewood-replaces-pat-cummins-as-australia-captain-in-second-odi-against-england-2263055","keywords":null,"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"Josh Hazlewood On Pat Cummins: ‡§ë‡§∏‡•ç‚Äç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§à ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ (Australia Cricket team) ‡§ï‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™ ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à. ‡§á‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ë‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§®‡•á 12 ‡§Æ‡§π‡•Ä‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ï‡•ç‡§§ ‡§§‡§Ø ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§¶‡§∞‡§Ö‡§∏‡§≤, ‡§ê‡§∏‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§ë‡§∏‡•ç‚Äç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§à ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§Ü‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•á ‡§¶‡§ø‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§® ‡§™‡•à‡§ü ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∏ (Pat Cummnis) ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§ó‡§π ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§π‡§ï ‡§ï‡§™‡•ç‚Äç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ü‡§ú‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à. ‡§¨‡§π‡§∞‡§π‡§æ‡§≤, ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ë‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§´‡§ø‡§≤‡§π‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§∞‡§£‡§®‡•Ä‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à.

Surya, world No. 1 T20 batter, will square off against Phillips‚Äô New Zealand in the second game here at the Bay Oval, a ground where the Black caps dasher has fond memories of scoring a 46-ball hundred. ‚ÄúHe (Surya) is absolutely incredible. The things that he does I wouldn‚Äôt even dream of doing. I would love to try but we have very different games. The wrist strength that he‚Äôs got to be able to hit balls for six in extremely awkward areas is a talent you rarely see,‚Äù Phillips was quoted as saying in stuff.Co.Nz. Phillips also mentioned that the ‚Äúhigh risk-high reward game‚Äù that is played by him and Surya also keeps opposition in the game as they have the danger of getting out if some of those adventurous shots aren‚Äôt executed properly. ‚ÄúI have got my strengths and he has got his and we go about our jobs in different ways. And the way we both play presents opportunities for the opposition to get us out as well. It‚Äôs part of the risk and reward of middle order cricket in T20.‚Äù Surya has been world‚Äôs top run-getter in the 2022 calendar year with whopping 1040 runs at an average of 43 and a magnificent strike-rate of 186. Phillips is eighth in the ICC‚Äôs T20I batters‚Äô list and has scored 650 runs at a strike-rate of 158 plus. Phillips is fearing that on good batting tracks like Bay Oval (Mt Maunganui) and McLean Park (Napier), Surya‚Äôs strike-rate would soar even higher. ‚ÄúI could easily see (Surya‚Äôs) strike rate being even higher here than it was in Aussie, with the slightly smaller grounds and the pitches very similar, potentially a bit bouncier with a bit more grass on them.

The decision proved to be crucial, with Australia's stand-in skipper removing Vince in his first over back into the attack. If Vince's wicket got Australia's foot in the door, Adam Zampa (4-45 off nine) wrenched it wide open, effectively sealing the win by taking three wickets in the space of nine deliveries to gut England's middle order.Speaking after the match, Hazlewood explained how he'd been so preoccupied with the duties of captaining that he'd almost forgotten to bring himself into the attack.\"ÔªøI was looking around and thinking who's next to bowl and then I thought I'd better have a go,\" he said.\"It's good fun having the captaincy. I'll obviously hand it over to Pat again for the last game, but yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed it and the boys certainly helped me out from time to time.\"After Vince and Billings' stand had seen England reach 3-156 at one stage, it lost its last seven wickets for just 52 runs to be all out for 208.ÔªøStarc returned to the attack to clean up the tail following Hazlewood and Zampa's spree of wickets, and was named the Player of the Match for his efforts.The 72-run win gives Australia an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, with the series finale to be played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Tueday.For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here!","pubDate":"2022-11-19 11:37:53","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2022/11/467568/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs New Zealand: Men in Blue receive traditional welcome at Mt.

BCCI have already started inviting applications for the same, and Parthiv Patel has confirmed that he does not fit the criteria. The selection committee consisted of Chetan Sharma (North Zone), Harvinder Singh (Central Zone), Sunil Joshi (South Zone) and Debasish Mohanty (East Zone). This is one of the shortest spells for any selection committee, and they have been criticized for the lack of stability on the side and for not selecting a stable team for the tournaments. The defeat in the Asia Cup and T20 World Cup, along with the rushing of Jasprit Bumrah to international cricket are seen as the main reasons behind the sacking. Interestingly, the new selectors have been assigned the role of selecting a new captain for different formats as well. Parthiv Patel confirms he can‚Äôt apply for Indian national cricket team selector post Former Indian wicket-keeper Parthiv Patel has confirmed that he will not apply for the role of national selector as he does not fit the eligibility criteria. A fan asked Parthiv to apply for the role, but he clarified that he will not be applying this time, but it will be an honour for him if he gets the opportunity in the future. ‚ÄúThank you but I don‚Äôt fit the eligibility criteria for the post at the moment.

There are some probing questions and quicker the answers are sought, better it would be for Indian cricket.Is Bhuvneshwar going to be around for the T20 World Cup in 2024 with a sharp decline in his pace? Does he have enough time to work around his issues as he is not potent enough on good batting tracks? Not many T20Is are lined-up next year and he is largely becoming a single-format player, so where does it leave him?At this moment, all the answers seem to be in negative and hence a question arises whether playing the senior-most pacer would be akin to taking away an opportunity from a youngster to get into the groove.It is a double-edged sword that interim head coach VVS Laxman and captain Pandya will be facing.Not playing Bhuvneshwar when he is on the cusp of a personal milestone (4 more wickets for highest tally of 40 in a calendar year) might leave him demoralised.Most of his 36 wickets have come in bowler-friendly conditions and against lesser opponents. On slightly flatter wickets and against better batting attacks, Bhuvneshwar has come a cropper.But playing him will be a missed opportunity for the team management to check out on how the pair of Umran Malik and Mohammed Siraj would match up against the might of players like Finn Allen, Glenn Phillips and Devon Conway in pressure situations.Umran, India's fastest bowler by a distance, needs to be groomed. Pakistan has shown with Haris Rauf, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah as to what extreme pace can do.Ishan or Shubman, the choice of opener?The moment Rishabh Pant was named the vice-captain of the team for the T20I series, it was a given that he would be opening but whether Shubman Gill with his new found confidence in this format or the specialist Ishan Kishan will pair up is there to be seen.In case of Kishan, who has had troubles against genuine pace and swing is preferred, then there will be two left-handers at the top while Gill's presence will make it a left-right combination.The other factor would be the choice between KKR skipper Shreyas Iyer, not exactly a fast starter in T20Is and the dynamic Deepak Hooda, who can also bowl wicket-to-wicket tight off-breaks.To accommodate both Hooda and Shreyas, Kishan will then needed to be dropped from the playing XI. Sanju Samson and skipper Pandya are the two batters along with Suryakumar Yadav, who would play the role of enforcers as well as finishers.Chahal vs Phillips match-upGlenn Phillips, one of the most exciting T20 batters in recent times, will have a battle in hand when the wily Yuzvendra Chahal gets his first game in many moons after being inexplicably benched by regular head coach Rahul Dravid throughout the T20 World Cup.But the last completed T20I match at this ground witnessed Phillips score 108 off 51 balls with as many as eight sixes against a quality West Indies attack.With Ravichandran Ashwin's T20I career all but over, Washington Sundar will be getting a long run as a specialist off-spinner while Harshal Patel will also get game time to get back his rhythm which deserted him just before the World Cup. Arshdeep Singh as a left-arm seamer looks a sure-shot starter in next two games.Squads:India: Hardik Pandya (captain), Rishabh Pant (vc and wk), Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav, Sanju Samson, Shreyas Iyer, Ishan Kishan (wk), Deepak Hooda, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Washington Sundar, Harshal Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umran Malik, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh New Zealand: Kane Williamson (captain), Devon Conway, Finn Allen, Glenn Phillips, Devon Cinway, Daryl Mitchell, Adam Milne, Michael Bracewll, Ish Sodhi, Mitchell Santner, Lockie Ferguson, Tim Southee, Blair Tickner.Match Starts: 12 noon IST.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-19 08:41:29","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/11/2022_11$largeimg_337618957.jpg","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket legend calls out Aussie dugout sight","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/they-could-be-exposed-aussie-cricket-great-calls-out-interesting-sight-in-dugout/news-story/6f29c2e084a4022fef6f54b0ef98751d","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australian cricket great Ian Healy has questioned George Bailey‚Äôs influence within the team, after the chairman of selectors was spotted sitting with players in the dugout.","content":"Bailey, a former Aussie T20 captain who recently retired in 2020, was appointed the new selection chief in August 2021, taking over from Trevor Hohns‚Äô lengthy stint.Watch Australia v England. Every ODI live and ad-break free in play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >But former captain Ian Healy has questioned why someone like Bailey would be sitting among the players throughout the dismal T20 World Cup campaign and in Thursday night‚Äôs one dayer against England.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very interesting,‚Äù Healy said on his SEN show.‚ÄúGeorge Bailey can throw well, he can provide an extra coach around the traps ‚Ä¶ but he‚Äôs not an extra coach is he? He‚Äôs a selector.‚ÄúI think in-form players wouldn‚Äôt mind (having him next to them); I think down on form players would hate it and have to start acting.‚ÄúI think injured-type players carrying niggles small or maybe a little bit larger wouldn‚Äôt be keen to have the chairman of selectors so close.‚ÄúThe reserves in that dug out, are they acting?‚ÄúIf the acting isn‚Äôt good ‚Ä¶ they could be exposed. ‚ÄúThe current mood in that team might change ‚Ä¶ that might be creating stress with the selector so upfront and so close.‚ÄùHealy said given there were controversial calls made during the T20 World Cup campaign, where Australia missed out on the finals, he wasn‚Äôt sure how players would feel with Bailey sitting beside them.‚ÄúWe swapped (Mitchell) Starc for (Kane) Richardson at a time when we were after wickets. We kept Steve Smith out (of the T20 World Cup),‚Äù he said.‚ÄúWe let out of form players stay in that team in that T20 World Cup and that‚Äôs all while the chairman of selectors was in the dug out and very, very close to the personality of the squad.‚ÄúIf he asks you a question (players would go), ‚ÄòAll right, what have I got to tell him?‚ÄôBailey was filmed having a laugh with star duo Warner and Marnus Labuschagne during Thursday night‚Äôs game one victory over England.Fellow SEN panellist, and current Brisbane Lions captain, Dayne Zorko compared Bailey‚Äôs presence in the dug out to having his list manager on the interchange bench.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very strange ‚Äì especially if you‚Äôre a person on the fringe or not really getting a game,‚Äù he said on SEN.‚ÄúIt would be like our list manager sitting on the bench when I come off and I haven‚Äôt had a good patch. He‚Äôs just looking at me (and I say) ‚ÄòOh I can do better!‚Äô.‚ÄùThe Australian cricket team is reportedly struggling with an ‚Äúapparent divide‚Äù between current players and the nation‚Äôs greats.It was reported captain Pat Cummins has met with Adam Gilchrist this week to ‚Äúcool any potential tensions‚Äù since ex-coach Justin Langer was pushed out the door in February.","pubDate":"2022-11-19 08:24:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
