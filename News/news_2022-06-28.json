Es wird gejubelt und geflucht. Für den unwissenden Beobachter wirkt das Treiben an den Regnitzwiesen wie ein heilloses Chaos, ohne Anfang und Ende. Doch abseits des Feldes steht der Mann, der an diesem Tag Ordnung bringt.Udhay Kumar erklärt den Beobachtern unentwegt, wie dieser Sport funktioniert. Und macht das vielleicht gerade deshalb so gut, weil seine Wurzeln woanders liegen. Sein Sport war einst das Schwimmen. Über ein Familienmitglied entstand der Kontakt zum Erlanger Cricket-Verein. Seitdem fungiert er als dessen Sprachrohr.Popularität in Deutschland steigtDas Schlagballspiel wird in den letzten Jahren immer beliebter. Die Ursprünge liegen in England, doch durch den Commonwealth wird Cricket auf der ganzen Welt gespielt. Hierzulande sind die Regeln allerdings noch wenig bekannt. In Grundzügen lässt es sich so erklären: Auf einem Areal in der Mitte des Spielfeldes (Pitch) stehen jeweils drei Stümpfe, auf denen Spulen liegen. Das Team, das schlägt, muss diese vor dem werfenden Team, verteidigen.Je nachdem, wie gut der Schläger den Ball trifft, können Punkte erzielt werden. Gelingt es dem Gegner, die Spulen abzuwerfen oder den Ball direkt zu fangen, muss der Schlagmann das Feld verlassen. Passiert dies zehnmal, endet die Punktejagd und die Rollen werden getauscht. Vielleicht ist alles aber auch viel simpler. „Der Zusammenhalt macht den Reiz aus“, sagt Kumar. „Es ist wie eine Sprache, die alle sprechen.“Es ist eine Geschichte in vier Teilen, die sich am Wochenende bei den Bayerischen Meisterschaften im Cricket in Erlangen abspielt. Sie handelt von Menschen, die eine Leidenschaft teilen. Einen Sport, der uns fremd und vielen anderen so vertraut ist.Nachdem Luqman Mulakhel, pendelt aus Regensburg sein Lieblingsspiel im Kindergarten entdeckt hat, gibt es für ihn kein Zurück mehr. Kaum ein Tag vergeht, an dem er den Sport nicht ausübt. Was hierzulande der Fußball vollbringt, ist in Pakistan das Cricket. Sobald der Unterricht endet, wird gespielt – auf Straßen, auf Spielplätzen, auf Parkplätzen.Wie so viele der Kinder hat auch Mulakhel einen Traum. „Ich wollte Profispieler werden“, sagt er. Eine Lehrerin erzählt ihm damals: Du kannst es schaffen! „Ich habe alles versucht“, sagt Mulakhel. „Aber das Schicksal wollte nicht.“ Stattdessen führt es ihn vor zwei Jahren als Geflüchteten nach Deutschland.Seinen Sport wollte er nicht aufgeben, also schloss er sich einem Verein in Amberg an. Bei einem Freundschaftsspiel gegen Erlangen sind die Gegner beeindruckt von dem Mann, der so schnell werfen kann. Sie wollen ihn verpflichten. Und Mulakhel will die Chance nutzen. Mit zwei Erlanger Team-Kollegen wagt er sich zu einem Probetraining bei der deutschen Nationalmannschaft. Er überzeugt, aber fehlende Papiere lassen den Traum platzen. Aufgeben will er trotzdem nicht. Wer drei Jahre in Deutschland gelebt hat, darf auch ohne Pass in die Nationalmannschaft. Schon bald will er es erneut versuchen.Im Grunde hat Wasif Abbas-Shah drei Identitäten. Er ist Halb-Engländer, Halb-Pakistaner. Nach dem Brexit entschied er sich, die deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft anzunehmen. Und wenn es eine Sache gibt, die diese drei Identitäten aneinander bindet, dann das Cricket. „Das ist die Sache, die immer geblieben ist“, sagt Abbas-Shah. Das sah nicht immer so aus. Als er 1992 nach Deutschland kommt, verliert sich zunächst die Spur zum Sport seiner Kindheit. Dann folgen ein paar Zufälle, über seine Schwiegermutter erfährt er, dass Adidas einen Cricket-Coach für die Mitarbeitenden sucht. „Der Hunger war wieder da“, sagt Abbas-Shah.Irgendwann reicht ihm das Coaching alleine nicht mehr. Zuerst versucht er es mit einer Abteilung beim FSV Erlangen-Bruck, fühlt sich dort aber vernachlässigt. Also öffnet Abbas-Shah Google Earth, sucht dort nach Sportplätzen in der Umgebung, misst aus, hat am Ende vier Vorschläge übrig. Er entscheidet sich für die Regnitzwiesen und gründet 2013 den Erlanger Cricket-Club (ECC), der schon bald so viel Zulauf hat, dass zwei Teams eröffnet werden. Indien, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Großbritannien, Sri Lanka. Auch der ECC wird zu einer Mannschaft, in der vor allem die Menschen, die nach Deutschland gezogen sind, ein Stück ihrer Heimat suchen - und finden.Cricket in die SchulenDer Mann, der den Geflüchteten Luqman Mulakhel einst bei einem Freundschaftsspiel in Amberg entdeckte und nach Erlangen lotste, heißt Shahid Satti. In Pakistan lernte er das Spiel, in Belgien promovierte er, in Deutschland fand er schließlich seine Arbeit.Fragt man ihn, warum dieser Sport einen solchen Reiz ausübt, verweist er auf die Einfachheit: „Du kannst Cricket im Garten spielen“, sagt Satti, „alles was du brauchst, sind zwei Menschen mit einem Schläger und einen Ball.“ Satti, der auch als Vize-Präsident des Bayerischen Verbandes agiert, ist überzeugt davon, dass es gelingen wird, den Sport an deutsche Schulen zu bringen und damit bekannter zu machen. „In zehn Jahren wird Cricket in Deutschland ziemlich anders aussehen“, sagt er.In Erlangen hatten sie einen Traum: Dass beide Teams es ins Finale der Bayerischen Meisterschaften schaffen. Die Mannschaft, in der Wasif Abbas-Shah und Shahid Satti spielen, scheiterte im Viertelfinale. Das Team von Luqman Mulakhel musste sich im Finale geschlagen geben. Und doch: Verfolgt man die Geschichten der Spieler, kommt einem ein paradoxer Gedanke. Vielleicht ist Cricket der wahre Sport der Moderne. Der Sport einer globalisierten und individualisierten Welt, in der jeder seine eigene Geschichte mitbringt. Und am Ende arbeiten doch alle zusammen, um etwas zu erreichen.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-28 04:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"nordbayern","country":["germany"],"category":["sports"],"language":"german"},{"title":"IND vs IRE 2nd match T20I Dream11: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream 11, Probable Playing XI for India vs Ireland","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-ire-2nd-t20i-dream11-ipl-2022-fantasy-cricket-tips-dream-11-probable-playing-xi-for-india-vs-ireland-injury-update-match-no-2-pitch-2022-06-27-787865","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs IRE 2nd match T20I Dream11: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream 11, Probable Playing XI for India vs Ireland Match Details India vs Ireland","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-28 03:45:02","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka deny Indian women series sweep","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/sri-lanka-deny-indian-women-series-sweep-407666","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Dambulla, June 27 Skipper Chamari Athapaththu struck a counter-attacking 48-ball 80 as Sri Lanka outplayed India by seven wickets in the third and final T20I to avoid a whitewash here today.

Tillakaratne Dilshan (1889) is the highest run-scorer among the male cricketers from Sri Lanka. Chasing a modest 139 to avoid a clean sweep by the Indians, Sri Lanka's batting finally came good as the hosts hunted down the target with three overs to spare to claim a consolation win. India stuttered after opting to bat before skipper Harmanpreet Kaur's resilient 39 not out off 33 balls propped up their total to 138/5.

With Pandya stressing after the first match that India are firmly focusing on the road to Men`s T20 World Cup, to be hosted by Australia in October-November, they will be keen to test more players in the second T20I. With Umran Malik being handed a debut, he could be expected to continue in the eleven despite leaking 14 runs in the lone over he bowled. India may also have to make a forced change if Ruturaj Gaikwad , who did not open the batting on Sunday due to a calf niggle, doesn`t recover in time with just a day`s gap between the two T20Is. The visitors will be pleased by the economical spells bowled by Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Yuzvendra Chahal in restricting Ireland to 108/4 apart from Deepak Hooda shining as a makeshift opener and Pandya providing fireworks with the bat.

Ireland will be looking forward to posing a tough challenge and to square off the series. India won the previous rain-hit match by seven wickets. The match was reduced to 12 overs for each side.It will be important for Ishan Kishan to continue his fine form and provide India with a positive start. If Deepak Hooda gets another chance to open, the player will be looking forward to putting another strong performance to boost his chances of inclusion in the T20 World Cup squad. The next match will be crucial for Suryakumar Yadav who could not open his account. Making the number three or number four slot his own in T20Is would be SKY’s focus as he has consistency. It will also be interesting if Rahul Tripathi or Sanju Samson get a chance in the second match. Indian bowling was solid in the first match during the power play with pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar impressing with 1/16 in three overs. Spinner Yuzvendra Chahal also had figures of 1/11 in three overs. Other Indian bowlers managed a double-digit economy rate. It will be important for bowlers to not only take wickets, but also restrict Ireland’s run flow. Jammu and Kashmir pace sensation Umran Malik unfortunately was the most expensive bowler, conceding 14 runs in his over in the previous match.

The series opener at Bay Oval will be the first day-night test in New Zealand since 2018, when England were beaten by an innings and 49 runs at Eden Park. The test world champions will also host a two-match series against Sri Lanka in March, New Zealand Cricket said on Tuesday as it announced the 2022/23 home international schedule. The Black Caps are currently languishing in eighth place in the World Test Championship standings and will need strong performances on home soil if they are to have any chance of defending their title.

But the 35-year-old Dublin-born batter has been struggling with form and fitness issues this year. He was twice out for nought during the recent ODI series away to the Netherlands in Amstelveen and withdrew from the third match with a groin issue. England face India in a three-match T20 international series starting on July 7, while the T20 World Cup in Australia begins in October. If Morgan does indeed step down ahead of the 2023 50-over World Cup in India, vice-captain Jos Buttler would appear to be the favourite to replace him as England’s white-ball skipper. Morgan is England’s leading run-scorer of all time in ODI and T20 cricket with 6,957 and 2,458 runs respectively. His tally of 225 ODIs and 115 T20Is is also an England record. But he has made just two fifties from his past 28 international innings across the two white-ball formats. Prior to the Netherlands series he confessed to feeling his age and struggling to recover physically form matches, telling Sky Sports: “If I don’t think I am good enough or I don’t feel I am contributing to the team, then I will finish.” Morgan switched allegiance from his native Ireland in 2009, having forged an English county career with Middlesex. He was a pioneer in becoming an England white-ball specialist after calling time on a 16-Test career featuring two hundreds that ended in 2012 to concentrate on the shorter formats. A dynamic middle-order batter, Morgan was also a trailblazer in the English game with his then unusual ability to hit the ball to all parts of the ground. He succeeded Alastair Cook as England’s ODI captain on the eve of the 2015 World Cup in Australia, where the team suffered a humiliating first-round exit. Despite that reverse, Morgan remained in post and together with former England head coach Trevor Bayliss oversaw the side’s transformation into a major force in limited-overs cricket.","pubDate":"2022-06-28 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":".","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/969775-n-a","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Asad shines as Kings XI claim tape-ball cricket titleBy our correspondentKARACHI: Asad Shah played brilliantly as Kings XI defeated Omar Associates by 25 runs to win first-ever International Tape Ball Cricket League here at Eid Gaah Ground on Sunday night.Batting first, Kings XI scored 112 runs...","content":"Asad shines as Kings XI claim tape-ball cricket title .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ By our correspondent KARACHI: Asad Shah played brilliantly as Kings XI defeated Omar Associates by 25 runs to win first-ever International Tape Ball Cricket League (ITBCL) here at Eid Gaah Ground on Sunday night.

He wouldn’t have been able to sleep in at all, so would have been at breakfast at 6am. “I think he was a bit quiet (before the Test), really - and excited - but you could tell he was really nervous.” Australia cricketer Nathan Lyon (L) celebrates with his teammate Michael Hussey (R) during the second day against Sri Lanka at Galle on September 01, 2011. Photo: AFP Source: AFP Waiting down the other end behind the stumps in Galle was another senior member of the Australian XI, Brad Haddin. Speaking to foxsports.com.au , Haddin remembers that Lyon’s nervousness extended further than bowling on the world stage. “He was nervous coming into the group. He had limited experience and didn’t know a lot of the players,” Haddin recalls. “He was very, very quiet and nervous, not only about making his Test debut but introducing himself to everyone. He hadn’t met a lot of the players, it was the first time a lot of people had really seen him.” They were Lyon’s nerves, but he unwittingly shared them on that Sri Lanka tour with Hussey, who had taken a shine to the young spinner, who he buddied up with as part of a mentoring program. Hussey had been impressed with Lyon’s ability to spin and shape the ball, and even more so with his eagerness and attitude towards the game. But fielding at mid-on in Galle on day two, Hussey couldn’t be sure as to what would happen next. “You could see the attributes were there … so then it was just coming down to if he could handle the mental side of the game,” Hussey says. “I remember talking to him before his first ball and giving him a pat on the back and a big smile and saying ‘c’mon mate, you’ve waited your whole life for this, enjoy it’. It doesn’t matter what you’re saying to a bowler about to bowl his first ball, I don’t think anything is going in. “I was just trying to calm him down as much as I possibly could but I don’t think I was having any effect whatsoever.” Australia players Nathan Lyon (L) and Trent Copeland look from the balcony during the first day of their opening Test match against Sri Lanka at Galle. Source: AFP Haddin also had a word to Lyon before the day’s play, telling him to trust his stock delivery and keep things simple. Nonetheless, Haddin had no way of predicting the pandemonium that would follow. “We didn’t know him. We didn’t know what he could deliver. We hadn’t really seen much of him play,” Haddin says. “We had seen a bit of him in the nets and he had a really good stock ball but we didn’t know what to expect.” He adds: “I think looking back he was just looking to hit the wicket (with his first ball).” In a separate interview with ESPNCricinfo , Lyon said he was in “shock” at being named as Australia’s only spinner for the Test, and by the company he was now in. “I was pretty nervous just being around the likes of Ricky Ponting, Michael Hussey, Michael Clarke and these guys,” Lyon told the publication. “I was pretty pumped … to be told I was going to be the only spinner was a bit of a shock but it was pretty goddamn exciting to be honest. “I’d always dreamt of having that moment, always dreamt of being at the top of my mark in a Test match and seeing what I potentially could do.” ‘IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?’ In came Lyon. The ball fizzed out the top of his index finger and did far more than just hit the dusty Galle track. Nathan Lyon celebrates removing Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara with his first ball in Test cricket.

The ball flew from Sangakkara’s edge and Michael Clarke read the chance beautifully, moving low and to his left to pouch an exceptional one-handed slips catch. The rest is all a little bit of a blur. Lyon celebrated like any Test cricketer would, fist-pumping the air and embracing his teammates, but his first smile uncovered a down-to-earth figure almost embarrassed by his meteoric rise. “He was absolutely shocked. I think he was in disbelief, I think he honestly thought he was in a dream,” Hussey says. “It was a beautiful delivery. I remember watching it out of the hand and thinking ‘wow, that looks beautiful’, and it almost comes down in slow motion … ‘is this really happening?’ “Everyone was so excited for him but definitely disbelief from Lyno.” He adds: “It was an unbelievable start. I just remember running to him with such excitement and I think everyone did. I don’t think anyone could believe it.” Nathan Lyon (C) leaves the ground as captain Michael Clarke (R) and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin applaud the Test debutant. Source: AFP The then 23-year-old was an Adelaide Oval groundsperson a year before dismissing Sangakkara with his first ball in Test cricket. In January 2011 he played a T20 for South Australia, then in February he made his first class debut. Only four games would separate that Sheffield Shield match against Western Australia and his Test debut for Australia. Lyon’s promotion was heavily criticised, owing to his brief time spent at first class level, and the revolving door of Test spinners that created a level of selection distrust. Following Shane Warne’s retirement in 2007, and Lyon’s debut four-and-a-half years later, Australia fielded a total of 10 different specialist spinners. There were one-Test wonders Bryce McGain and Beau Casson, those who lasted slightly longer like Xavier Doherty and Nathan Hauritz, and those who were later reformed, like Steve Smith. Then there was Lyon, who, in a way, changed the course of Australian cricket with just one well-delivered stock ball to Sangakkara, a 134-Test great who retired with 12,400 runs at 57.40. Lyon is one of just 20 bowlers to take a wicket with his first ball in Test cricket, and the first for Australia in 117 years after Arthur Coningham in 1894. “In my head I thought, ‘oh no, that’s going to be short and wide’ but lucky enough that wasn’t the case,” Lyon told ESPNCricinfo . “All I tried to do was bowl my best ball. I honestly thought it was going to be hit for four in my memory, but luckily Kumar nicked one.” Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara runs between wickets as Australia's bowler Nathan Lyon watches on. Photo: AP Source: AP Haddin remembers the delivery differently, adding that Lyon’s status as an unknown in Test cricket also played into his hands. “It was good. It pitched where it needed to pitch and made Kumar make a decision off the stumps,” Haddin says. “It turned well and it was a perfect off spinner to start his Test career … he just bowled the perfect off-spinner first up. “He probably took advantage as well – Sangakkara wouldn’t have seen much of him. “You get a lot of footage these days and do a lot of analytics on players you play against but one thing Nathan had in his favour was they hadn’t seen much of him because he hadn’t played much cricket.” Lyon went on to claim 5-34 in his debut innings in Galle. His figures remain the fifth-best in the history of Test cricket for an Australian on debut when bowling in the first or second innings. “It’s been the best couple days of my life,” Lyon said at the time. “I could not breathe in the middle. I was just full of so much excitement. “The biggest highlight was just walking into the field as part of the Australian team.” THE TURNING POINT As perfectly fantastical as the moment was, it did not prove to be a happy-ever-after for Lyon. Given the selection carnage that preceded Lyon’s elevation, there was widespread apprehension despite his impressive start. That apprehension was arguably well-placed. Five difficult years of external doubt followed with Lyon impressing from time-to-time, but never truly cementing his place in Australia’s Test XI. His stunning 12-wicket haul against India at the Adelaide Oval in December 2014 seemingly vanquished all doubt, but the wolves were circling again when it was time to tour Sri Lanka in 2016. In that tour, Lyon was comprehensively outperformed by his spinning counterpart and Australia was dismantled. Despite being ranked as the world’s best Test team, Australia was brushed aside in three-consecutive heavy defeats, losing to Sri Lanka 3-0. The player-of-the-series was left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, who snared a whopping 28 wickets at 12.75, while striking every 31 balls. Lyon’s craft of right-arm orthodox is historically not as potent. Even so, his 16 wickets at 31.93 and strike rate of 57.7 was well below expectations in spin friendly conditions.

Photo: AP Source: AFP The 2016 trip to Sri Lanka was hoped to be the moment Lyon stepped up and won games of cricket off his own back for Australia in suitable conditions. In the end, it only strengthened the narrative that Lyon was a handy spinner for Australia, particularly on bouncy home tracks, but a legend in the making, he was not. Prior to that series, Lyon had taken 26 wickets at 49.11 in eight Tests in Asia. The 2016 series slightly improved those numbers, but not his reputation given the Herath masterclass. A lean home summer against South Africa followed with Lyon taking just six wickets at 57.66, but the off-spinner says that the wheels were already in motion for his resurgence. “It was a really good learning curve and that tour in 2016 - it wasn’t the tour that I planned in my head or anyone else as part of the Australian set up coming over here,” Lyon told reporters this week. “But it was a challenging tour and an opportunity for all of us to learn, and that was the best thing about it. We were able to learn and grow as cricketers and as people.” Lyon worked during that summer with mentors John Davison and Darren Berry with an eye in particular on improving away from home with a trip to India on the horizon. Since then, Lyon’s numbers in Asia have improved dramatically to 65 wickets at 26.44. That haul includes the 5-83 he took in the decisive moment of March’s tour of Pakistan, which was edging closer to a draw before Lyon claimed three final session wickets, including that of Babar Azam. GREAT’S BLUNT FIVE-WORD MESSAGE: ‘YOU BLOKES WILL STUFF UP’ Speaking to cricket.com.au, Lyon said that he also owes the transformation to an enlightening chat with Herath after the 2016 series. “I said, ‘What do you do that I don’t do?’ And he said, ‘I know that if I put the ball in one spot, you blokes will stuff up’. Those were his exact words,” Lyon told the publication. “That’s a pretty simple mindset. (What) I took out of it was, the secret to everyone’s success is if you can challenge their defence for long periods of time, you’ll be able to create chances. “That’s what (Herath) did extremely well. He challenged our defence for long periods of time, and he got the rewards.” Watch Australia’s Tour of Sri Lanka. Every T20, ODI and Test Match Live & On-Demand on Kayo. New to Kayo?

Photo: AFP Source: AFP Now, for the third time in 11 years, Lyon has arrived on the shores of Sri Lanka, where different stages of his career have had an uncanny way of starting, or ending. There’s a feeling that this series has Lyon’s name on it, armed with the experience of two previous tours, Herath’s advice, and a confidence boost after breaking his fourth innings duck in Pakistan. He’s also had in his corner former Sri Lanka opener and national coach Chandika Hathurusingha, who offered Lyon greater insights into “the subcontinent mindset”, he said. Asked if he expects Lyon to improve from his 2016 series, Hussey said: “I think so. “As a player every time you go to a country you just learn more and more each time you go. I think Usman Khawaja is a good example of that … he’s figured out a way to learn how to play spin in the subcontinent. “Nathan Lyon will be the same. Yes, he had a dream start in the first game … he would have taken a lot of learnings from last time he was in Sri Lanka. “Especially the type of character he is, he’s always trying to improve and take the learnings from different tours so I’d expect him to be a crucial member of this set-up in Sri Lanka in these conditions and I expect him to bowl well, every Test match and let’s hope that translates into wickets.” Haddin agrees, saying: “One thing we’ve seen with Nathan over a long period of time is his development. He started off his career not having great success in the subcontinent but that certainly changed in the last few years. “He trusts his craft now. He knows he’s a big player for Australia - we saw that in the Pakistan series … and Nathan’s found a way. He’s spoken to a lot of people who have done well over here, I know he spoke a lot to Herath and he’s always trying to get better. “That’s the one thing in his game now, he doesn’t just bowl well in Australia on bouncy wickets but he’s also developed his craft on subcontinent wickets.” Watch Australia’s Tour of Sri Lanka.

But when Freddie, who now co-hosts BBC1 motoring show Top Gear, was starting out in the game in the late Eighties and earlt Nineties he could see the class divide. He said: “I had my bat I’d bought myself for £21.50 and my Auntie Joan bought my pads from Hamley’s toy shop. “You turn up and you’re playing against all these private school kids who’ve got all the gear.

That makes it elitist.” And he is convinced the problem has got worse, not better, from when he was a child. Announcing the BBC1 documentary last year, he said: “Cricket is more elitist per head than rugby, rowing and the House of Lords. “We’ve got to do something to get young, working-class people playing our national summer sport again. “I really hope this series can demonstrate that with some time and coaching anyone can learn to love cricket and have the opportunities that came my way.” In Field Of Dreams, Freddie takes 11 lads from his home city of Preston and tries to convince them that cricket is a worthwhile venture they can succeed at. It is a “passion project” to give something back to the sport he loves and to help improve the kids’ life chances. He is not taking a fee for the show and is also stumping up £50,000 of his own cash towards the project. But it gets off to a shaky start, with father-of-four Freddie uncertain if the youngsters will even turn up. When they do, eventually, he compares the chaos of their initial training session to, “A f***ing zoo”. I got so much stick for playing cricket, bullied even, it was almost like Billy Elliot — except he had it easier being a ballet dancer. Freddie Flintoff He sticks with them, however, not least because many have not had the best starts in life. Among them are asylum seekers, youngsters with behavioural difficulties and rough sleepers. Freddie wanted to convince the wannabe team that he was not just backing them, but he was one of them, too. He said: “To begin with, the kids saw me as a bloke who’s played cricket, or works on Top Gear. “But when I told them about where I grew up, where we lived, the things I used to do and where I went to school, it was almost like it changed them. “I’ve seen programmes like this before on the telly, and people dip in and out, and they come on when the cameras are there, look good and leave. “But I wanted to get to know these kids, spend time and almost be mates with them.” After retiring from cricket 12 years ago due to a long line of injuries, Freddie went on to find fame and fortune on TV. He has always been known for his cheeky sense of humour and everyman image, which sometimes spilled over into drunken, and controversial antics. But it was part of an image that made him a natural choice for telly producers. He was snapped up as a team captain for Sky panel show A League Of Their Own He has also fronted reality challenge shows The Games and Don’t Rock The Boat and won the Australian version of I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! in 2015. We’ve got to do something to get young, working-class people playing our national summer sport again. Freddie Flintoff He has turned his hand to sports commentary, starred in musical Fat Friends and featured in adverts for everything from supermarkets to oversized menswear. He tamed his hellraising ways after marrying wife Rachael in 2005 and went on to quit booze and get fit enough to dabble in celebrity boxing for a while. With his more mature outlook, he has written five books about his life and appeared in documentaries where he has talked candidly about his battles with depression and bulimia. His profile perhaps reached new heights in 2019 when he was named co-host of the Top Gear reboot alongside Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris. Small wonder his company accounts show he earns over £1million a year and his business is worth almost £6m But he says his successes have often been driven by fear of failure — something he learned as a cricketer. He once said: “Whatever I do will never be enough. I look back on my cricket career and I can tell you all my failures, but not too many successes. “Some people might think that’s a bit weird, but that was the one thing that drove me to strive to get better. “I remember how I got out in every match. I can’t really tell you about the fours and sixes I’ve hit.” Although returning to play cricket in his home city for the documentary turned out to be a huge challenge for Freddie, it certainly has not put him off coming home.

Try 14-Days Free Now > England, after rain washed out the final morning’s session, took just 15.2 overs to score the remaining 113 runs they required to reach a target of 296 for a seven-wicket victory that followed a pair of five-wicket triumphs over the Test world champions at Lord’s and Trent Bridge. Jonny Bairstow made a blistering 71 not out on Monday — England’s second-quickest Test fifty of all time — and shared an unbroken stand of 111 with former captain Joe Root (86 not out). Bairstow’s innings followed a majestic 162 that revived England from the depths of 6/55 in their first innings. It was all a far cry from the timid play that had so often characterised England’s performances during a run of one win in 17 Tests prior to this series — which included a shambolic Ashes series defeat to Australia last summer. That rotten return led to Root’s resignation as captain after team director Ashley Giles and coach Chris Silverwood were sacked following the woeful Ashes series loss Down Under. McCullum, however, insisted he had not “done a great lot” while England were whitewashing New Zealand. “I am aggressive but I think Ben has got me covered,” McCullum told the BBC. “He is really pushing the envelope and sending a strong message that this is how the team will play.” Stokes added: “To walk away with a 3-0 series win against the best team in the world is a pretty special start. “When I took over this job it was about more than results — it was about changing the mindset of the lads towards Test cricket, having fun, enjoying representing your country. Then the results will look after themselves. “To say we’ve done it so quickly is unbelievable.” Ben Stokes is leading a revolution. (Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images) The rest of the cricket world was in awe of England’s turnaround. English sports writer Paul Newman tweeted: “Can’t quite believe what I have watched over the last three Tests. Stunning from England. Incredible, transformative approach to Test cricket. “Yes, there will be bumps in the road but they will keep on coming and it will never be dull. Bring on India.” Broadcaster Alison Mitchell called it an “incredible Test series for England” while former skipper Michael Vaughan said the new-found aggression could “inspire a new generation of Test match cricket fans” Vaughan also described Bairstow’s batting as on a “different planet”, after the middle order star belted 394 runs from 328 balls in the series. CricViz analyst Ben Jones tweeted: “Spanking the WTC winners 3-0, with three record bothering chases, all involving an element of chaotic comeback. The Ben Stokes & Brendon McCullum era might not get better than this — but that still leaves them plenty of room to party.” Highest strike rate for an individual batter in a Test series (minimum 300 runs): 121.32 - Shahid Afridi vs IND, 2006 120.12 - Jonny Bairstow vs NZ, 2022 109.39 - Clive Lloyd vs IND, 1974/75 109.01 - Ben Stokes vs RSA, 2015/16 108.14 - Virender Sehwag vs SL, 2009/10 #ENGvNZ — Nic Savage (@nic_savage1) June 27, 2022 New Zealand captain Kane Williamson, who missed the second Test with a bout of Covid-19, was left to rue a lack of top-order runs, including from his own bat. But despite having missed several New Zealand matches in the 12 months since leading the Black Caps to victory over India in the inaugural World Test Championship final because of a longstanding elbow injury, the 31-year-old star batsman had no thought of standing down as skipper. “I certainly love playing for this group and being their leader,” he said. “It has been an interesting time and challenging, but the appetite is still there from me. “It’s been an incredible series. In all three matches we had our opportunities and we were ahead of the game at times in each one but credit to England, they chose to counter-attack when they were under pressure and they did it well, especially in this match.” England will not have long to rest on their laurels, however, with the Covid-delayed final Test of last year’s series against India starting at Edgbaston on Friday.

[…]","content":"En Colombia no es muy reconocido pero en realidad el cricket es el segundo deporte más popular en el mundo, sólo detrás del fútbol. Se estima que tiene dos mil quinientos millones de fans, principalmente en Inglaterra, Australia, Pakistán y la India. ¿Por qué el cricket es tan popular? En este artículo te explicamos qué lo hace tan atractivo, para que puedas consultar los pronósticos deportivos actualizados en una casa de apuestas online . El cricket es un deporte muy antiguo. Los historiadores consideran que comenzó sólo como un juego entre niños en los campos y bosques del Reino Unido en el siglo XIII. Lanzaban bolas intentando golpearlas con la rama de un árbol o un pedazo de madera de los rediles de ovejas. Con el paso de los años, el cricket se volvió muy popular fuera de Gran Bretaña, en los territorios conquistados por su imperio en Asia, África y Norteamérica. La colonización fue un factor muy importante para la popularidad de este deporte. Fuera de Inglaterra, los países donde más se practica son la India, Pakistán, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh y Australia. Un motivo muy importante para la popularidad del cricket es que se trata de un juego muy sencillo de aprender y practicar. Para comenzar sólo se necesitan dos jugadores, un palo de madera como bat y una pelota. ¡Sólo eso! La simpleza de este juego despierta la creatividad de millones de fans para practicarlo en la calle, así es como han surgido los mejores jugadores del mundo. ¿De qué se trata el cricket? Se juega profesionalmente con dos equipos de 11 jugadores en un campo rectangular de unos 20 metros. Cada equipo tiene tres palos llamados wickets, que se colocan en el suelo en cada extremo del campo. Los equipos se turnan para lanzar y batear en entradas, una dinámica muy similar al béisbol. El objetivo es golpear la pelota para lograr cambiar de posición de bateo con un compañero del equipo y así anotar la mayor cantidad de carreras. La historia del cricket comenzó por lo menos hace 300 años, pero es un deporte que continúa en evolución y está creciendo en todo el mundo. Hasta ahora hay 104 países integrados al Consejo Internacional de Cricket, la organización mundial encargada de regular este deporte. Para entender mejor su función, podemos equipararlo con la FIFA para el fútbol. El mayor evento de este deporte es la Copa Mundial de Cricket, un torneo que se realiza cada cuatro años con diez equipos participantes. La última edición se realizó en 2019 y por primera vez lo ganó la selección de Inglaterra, en el Lord’s Cricket Ground de Londres. Los máximos ganadores de la Copa Mundial de Cricket son los australianos con cinco campeonatos, seguidos por la India con dos. La próxima edición se realizará entre octubre y noviembre de 2023 en ese país. La enorme popularidad del cricket lo ha llevado también a convertirse en un negocio muy lucrativo con ingresos de miles de millones de dólares. Por ejemplo, la Copa Mundial de Cricket del 2019 dejó ingresos por más de 350 millones de libras esterlinas. No sólo se trata de los partidos, el torneo involucró más de 500 mil reservas de hotel con 650 mil espectadores foráneos y 128 mil que viajaron desde otros países. A esto tenemos que sumar 4 mil 600 millones de fans que vieron el torneo vía streaming. Esta capacidad económica también permite la expansión a más países con miles de fans potenciales. Por ejemplo, hace unas semanas la Major League Cricket de Estados Unidos recaudó 120 millones de dólares de financiamiento para las temporadas de 2022 y 2023. Algunos de los inversionistas son prominentes empresarios y desarrolladores de Silicon Valley fans del cricket. Entonces, ¿por qué el cricket es tan popular?

Geib with the agency’s Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit in Hilo, Hawaii, and one of the team leaders puts it this way: “The desert locust is one of the largest insect genomes ever completed and it was all done from a single locust.”That one locust was provided by chemical ecologist Baldwyn Torto with the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi, Kenya. He and his team tracked down swarms of locusts, collecting specimens across Kenya until he had two parents that he was able to breed to produce an offspring of known pedigree.Locust swarms of a “titanic” nature have caused all sorts of devastation to food security in countries like Africa, according to media reports such as NPR, which reported on one as recently as 2020.Thank goodness not Utah: Kaplan said that given that there can be as many as 15 grasshoppers per square yard of land that are close relatives of the desert locust in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado and Nebraska, this story might have some interest. While not in Utah, the locusts are, however, related to the Mormon cricket — an insect that has its own history here.Brigham Young once famously opined that if you kill one of those Mormon crickets, two will show up to bury their fallen comrade.In the Comprehensive History of the Church, this was noted: “They came swarming from the foothills literally by millions, and descended upon the new made fields of grain. They devoured all before them as they came to it. Their appetites never abated. They were cutting and grinding all day and night, leaving the fields bare and brown behind them.” Related Lawmakers endorse bill tackling response to Mormon crickets, other pests What are Mormon crickets and why is Oregon trying to suppress them? Mormon crickets return Kaplan said the genome mapping is a tremendous breakthrough in better understanding how this solitary locust turns into what they call the “gregarious” form of the same insect.“When the right environmental conditions exist, they suddenly turn on this switch and they start turning into this voracious eater. Isn’t that wild?” Kaplan said.Just how big is this genome? “With the desert locust, we were dealing with a much larger genome in many fewer pieces — about 8.8 (gigabytes) in just 12 chromosomes. Next to the fruit fly, it’s like an 18-wheeler next to a compact car,” Geib said. “It was like sequencing a typical insect genome many, many times over. But with today’s advances in DNA sequencing technologies, we are now able to generate extremely accurate genomes of insects that previously would have been unapproachable.” Related Farmers stall the march of Mormon crickets Desert locust plagues are cyclic and have been recorded since the times of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt, as far back as 3200 B.C. In recent decades, there have been desert locust swarms in 1967-1969, 1986-1989 and, most recently, 2020-2022. They cause devastation in East Africa, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia, threatening food security in many countries.Their damage can be massive. A small swarm can eat as much food in a day as would feed 35,000 people; a swarm of historic proportions covering the area of New York City eats in one day the same amount as the population of New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Related A fourth wave of locusts is coming. It will be 8,000 times larger than the last one Drought as a concern: Mormon crickets can show up in times of drought, which Utah is experiencing in an extreme way.Bret Selman, a rancher in Box Elder County, spotted Mormon crickets this spring and was part of a multifamily effort to stomp them out.“A bunch of us got together and sprayed them. We are not seeing them now. I don’t know if the spring storms killed them or our spray effort,” he said.They treated about 30,000 acres. Between the pesticide treatment and the work of the seagulls (they ate quite a few) the pests were eradicated.","pubDate":"2022-06-27 20:09:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"deseret","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Marizanne Kapp delighted with career best effort for Proteas in England Test","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/proteas-women/marizanne-kapp-delighted-with-career-best-effort-for-proteas-in-england-test-5b363ce6-365f-4e66-ae4f-8b0b7ceb4b55","keywords":null,"creator":["Stuart Hess"],"video_url":null,"description":"Fifties don’t cut it in Test cricket and it wouldn’t have done the Proteas much good, given the state of play when Kapp joined skipper Sune Luus at the crease.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-27 19:00:00","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/8bbb30db-e8e2-5648-a18d-b159d7cdabf1&operation=CROP&offset=0x137&resize=4980x2800","source_id":"iol","country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"County cricket: Sam Curran earns maiden century as Surrey run riot – as it happened","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jun/27/surrey-v-kent-essex-v-hampshire-and-more-county-cricket-live","keywords":["County Championship Division One","County Championship Division Two","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Tanya Aldred at the Oval"],"video_url":null,"description":"Surrey declared on 673-7 after posting four centuries against Kent, the first time that has happened since 1947And feel free to mail Tanya, tweet @tjaldred or post BTLAt Hove, Wayne Madsen trudges away for 176 - Derby 356-6; and, just to the west, another overnight centurion, Chris Dent, follows, lbw to Tom Bailey for 110.

He leapt once, twice, rabble-roused his bat towards the dressing-room, kissed his helmet and grinned. There was time to smash 19 runs off one over from Jacob Duffy before he was bowled by George Linde for 126. Surrey eventually declared on 673 for seven, once Will Jacks had collected the fourth century of the innings – the first time that had happened since 1947. Curran then bowled 2022 run machine Ben Compton in the fourth over, but Kent rebuilt thanks to a half-century from Daniel Bell-Drummond. In a see-saw game at Chelmsford, Simon Harmer took eight for 46 – the best figures in the 2022 Championship - and then shovelled 61 to plonk Essex into a strong position. But it didn’t go all their way; Liam Dawson took seven for 38 before Felix Organ spanked Harmer for three sixes as Hampshire chased 299. Sussex ’s tricky season continued as Anuj Dal (146no) and Mark Watt jollied Derbyshire past 500 and onto a declaration. Sam Conners removed both openers but Tom Alsop and Mohammad Rizwan (54no) provided some stoicism. Rain made batting difficult at Wantage Road; while Lancashire still trail Gloucestershire , despite 94 from Keaton Jennings. Mark Stoneman was the only batter to thrive in Middlesex ’s reply to Nottinghamshir e’s 551-8 declared, which included a century for Lyndon James. Thirteen wickets fell at New Road as Glamorgan were skittled for 139, Joe Leach taking six for 44, before Worcestershire finished the day on 147 for six, a lead of 279.

Harmer (52) and Snater now crushing Hampshire’s dreams, Essex 206-8 , a lead of 281. Warwickshire’s Sibley and Davies are strapping in to follow Northamptonshire’s 451. Warwicks (who I’ve just noticed have dropped (pls tell me if I’m wrong) last year’s wunderkind Rob Yates), 21-0. And Lancs plough on: Jennings 87 not out; Bohannon 34 before being bowled by Payne. 5h ago 12.01 Watching Rory Burns standing at slip, hands in his pockets, hair in a bun. Is his time gone? Has BazBall ruled him out? Or is there space for a shifter and a nurdler in re-set England? And a huge high five to Chance to Shine today - just reward for their hard work.

Crazy insight into a world I had no idea about - the mad excesses and the panicking desperation. A real eye opener. 6h ago 11.32 Kent’s torture is about to recommence at The Oval. 6h ago 11.25 There was time for Shane Snater to wiggle nine runs off an over from Brad Wheal, before the rain drew by at Chelmsford. 6h ago 11.17 Worrying about that wiry grey hair?

The rain has stopped so it depends how good the drainage is. Rossington is out at Chelmsford (154-7); Sam Conners has already unpicked Sussex’s opening pair (27-2); Notts pass 500. And at Bristol, Keaton Jennings (63 off 76) has caught the express; Josh Bohannon (18 off 91) the jalopy.

Apologies to Anuj Dal whose 146 not out passed me by. Three wickets to Delray Rawlings and I sniff trouble for Sussex. Worcestershire are batting again at New Road and have lost Ed Pollock cheaply, caught off Hogan for five. Worry not though, Ed Barnard is in town. Worcs, 7-1, lead by 139. And despite the best efforts of Tim Murtagh, who dismissed Mullaney and Moores, Notts are 465-5. Tea-time declaration? 7h ago 09.58 And at Headingley, Jonny Bairstow takes England to a seven wicket win, with a six. You have to feel for Harry Brook - he hits a golden run, and YJB goes one better. 7h ago 09.53 Ahem, Glamorgan? All out 139. Joe Leach six for 44; Barnard, fresh from his century, two for 2. Only three scores in double figures - Ed Byrom’s 57 the standout. Worcestershire, implausibly, lead by 132, having been 63 for five. 8h ago 09.35 Big thanks to Rupert at Surrey CCC who brings Bon Bon Bum lollies to the press box, a Colombian delicacy. Mine is tangerine and somewhere in middle is some bubble gum - or maybe that’s the Kent line-up. Four slips await Worrall. 17-1. 8h ago 09.31 Round Division One: At Chelmsford, Adam Rossington has decided that defence is pointless. Three sixes later he is 32 not out. Essex 91-5, a lead of 166. Jennings and Bohannon have eased Lancs to 21-1 at Bristol. Kent’s best hope, Ben Compton, plays on against Sam Curran. Kent in the mire, 9 for one. Compton still eight runs short of a thousand runs. And miserable weather at Northampton has delayed the start till 3.10. 8h ago 09.16 Worrall finding some early spice with his first three balls.. 8h ago 09.05 Things continue to be spicy at Chelmsford , Essex now 59 for five. Walter and Pepper both dismissed for one. Organ three for 20; Dawson two for 17. The Essex lead is 134 which, the pitch suggests, is plenty. And a fourth hundred of Surrey’s innings, with Will Jacks joining the three-figures club with a four darting through the leg side - and that’s the DECLARATION! Surrey 673-7. Now then Kent. Will Jacks celebrates scoring a century for Surrey.

And after all that wait at Trent Bridge, Steven Mullaney falls in the first over, for 79. Lyndon James then strides to his second hundred of 2022.

The ground rises: 126 effortless runs off 75 balls. Right, elsewhere: 10h ago 07.08 And just before that happened, Will Jacks had skipped to the fifth Surrey half century of the innings - off 49 balls. In the corresponding game at Beckenham, where Surrey rattled up 671-9 declared, eight players made half centuries, but none made hundreds. Curran’s hundred came in his 120th first-class innings . Moving to see how much he meant to him, after all he has achieved and at such a young age. 10h ago 07.04 A first first-class hundred for Sam Curran! And he’s cock-a-hoop! Leaps for joy, once, twice, throws his bat (without letting go). Sheer delight and it is wonderful to see. Gets a huge round of applause and has the breath squeezed out of him by Will Jacks. Sixty-four balls, 12 fours, three sixes. And the rain starts to fall. Surrey 545-5. Sam Curran celebrates scoring a century for Surrey.

Read more 11h ago 06.29 Sunday's round-up Two superb centuries, by Surrey old and Surrey young, swept the Division One leaders past 400 and to maximum batting points. Hashim Amla, 39, had been averaging 21 this season but on a good pitch, against a weary and sometime wayward Kent bowling attack, form suddenly hit his veins, ball yomping back over the boundary, easy as you like. At the other end Ben Geddes, just 20 and in only his third Championship game, made his first Championship century. Both fell for 124, and were ushered off to standing ovations from an excellent crowd sprinkled liberally about The Oval and blissed out by June. Jamie Smith also raced to fifty, before being bowled in the last over of the day, and with Sam Curran coming on like a super sub, screaming to an unbeaten 26-ball fifty with a six off Jacob Duffy, things had progressed a quite a lick. They too play Baz-ball, who toil in the County Championship. It was a long day for Kent captain Jack Leaning, who had looked at the green-tinged pitch and plumped for a bowl. Things proceeded nearly as quickly at Northampton , where Emilio Gay and Josh Cobb jogged to rapid half centuries against the county champions; while Rob Keogh blasted 130 in quick-time. A late unbeaten 55 from Lewis McManus rubbed salt in the eye. At Chelmsford, four late wickets by Simon Harmer on a spin-friendly surface had Hampshire in a fix at 68 for six. Earlier in the day they had been cock-a-hoop to have Essex 105 for seven, until Shane Snater, fresh from an England mauling with the Netherlands, made a free-flowing 71. Derbyshire ’s Shan Masood became the first player to pass a thousand runs in 2022 during his 46 against Sussex , lbw to the returning Steven Finn, while Wayne Madsen finished unbeaten on 171. Haseeb Hameed picked up his second century of the season for Nottinghamshire , in the top of Division Two table clash against Middlesex , building a firm base for Lyndon James and Steven Mullney to put on 151 for the fourth wicket. Three wickets for left-armer Jack Morley gave Lancashire the upper hand against Gloucestershire at Bristol, despite a hundred from Chris Dent; and Ed Barnard saved the day for Worcestershire yet again, with a brilliant 131 against Glamorgan , picking up the debris from 63 for five. Joe Leach then took three for 21 to reduce Glamorgan to 32 for three. Updated at 06.33 EDT 11h ago 06.25 Will Jacks looking frisky.

As far as India are concerned, they will be playing their fourth T20I at this venue tomorrow. While India have played four T20Is against Ireland, one of them had come during the ICC World Twenty20 2009 in Nottingham. Ideally, India wouldn’t want to tinker with a winning combination in the second match but a suspected injury to opening batter Ruturaj Gaikwad might force them to make a change. Assuming that Gaikwad misses this match, the visiting team is likely to include one out of Sanju Samson or Rahul Tripathi. Ireland, on the other hand, might look at making a change or two in their bowling department. Considering how batter Harry Tector played in the first T20I at the same venue yesterday, the hosts would be hoping for him to put on display a similar performance.

Like, ‘drink’ drink? Why not?” arrived the hushed reply, quickly, conspiratorially, followed by, “But you didn't hear it from me.” Ah, yes, the Wimbledon Queue is back in all of its pre-pandemic glory, reappearing in a rather “nature is healing” manner, three years after its previous presence, giving people a way to wait in line to gain access to tickets — for a fee, of course — so they can attend matches at the grass-court Grand Slam tennis tournament that began Monday. “Such a cool place to be. You meet people you've never met. You make a weekend of it. And then there's the thrill of getting a seat at a court,\" said Graham Auld, a 29-year-old from Newcastle. “It's so worth it — the trip, the camping, the waiting, all of it. It's brilliant.” It is an event unto itself, a happening, with long-term devotees and first-timers alike, sharing a fondness for tennis and the camaraderie that comes with sharing a field-as-home for a night or more with friends or family or folks who had been total strangers. Auld, who said he works in the financial sector, had just gotten back to the park on Sunday evening, carrying two pizzas in red cardboard boxes, providing sustenance for himself and two pals after a game of cricket against other queue types they'd encountered. Auld's group got to the area at about 6 a.m. on Sunday, eight hours before the sanctioned start. The process: You find your place at the back of the line, receive a numbered “ticket” — which isn't really a ticket to get into the All England Club, but a card to prove where your spot is — set up a temporary residence, make use of the toilets and water dispensers and food trucks on site, and start biding the time until the stewards' wakeup call at 6 a.m. That's when tents and other belongings can be stored at a temporary office. At 7:30 a.m., the line begins moving, winding around the park, through an adjacent park and eventually to the ticket-buying window less than a half-mile (kilometer) away at the tournament grounds. This is unique among Grand Slam tournaments, and there are about 500 tickets available daily over the first 10 days for Centre Court — which on Monday featured matches involving six-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic and a pair of popular British players, two-time winner Andy Murray and reigning U.S. Open champ Emma Raducanu — another 500 or so each for No. 1 Court and No. 2 Court, and several thousand grounds passes, which allow access to all smaller courts and cost 27 pounds (about $33) on Day 1. The All England Club said Monday there were 431 tents at the park overnight and that 2,808 cards were distributed by 7 a.m. In possession of card No. 1 was Brent Pham, a 32-year-old property manager from Irvine, California, who showed up Friday at around 11 p.m. — far too early to get in the official Queue — and initially staked his claim to first-in-line status by waiting on the sidewalk outside Wimbledon Park. Eventually, he and others were told to move to another grass field for a temporary, unofficial, lower-case queue, until being allowed to get in the true Queue on Sunday. “Coming this early, I thought I would be No. 1, but there was still that bit of doubt whether I would be,” said Pham, who participated in the Queue for the second time and calls himself a big Serena Williams fan but was eager to watch Djokovic on Monday. “I like the fact that you can't just buy your way into the tournament, no matter the price. People who take the effort to wait get rewarded. That's a good system, in my opinion.” Wimbledon was canceled entirely in 2020 because of COVID-19, and when the competition returned a year ago with restrictions limiting crowd sizes, the Queue was scrapped. Full crowds were out in force Monday, as was the Queue. “The fact that we didn't have it last year really emphasized to everybody the significance and importance of it. It was hugely missed. The reason why the Queue is important is not because we think people enjoying queuing, particularly in the U.K. ... but it's really about accessibility,” All England Club CEO Sally Bolton said. \"It does also include lots of joy and excitement, and a festival atmosphere up in the park.\" That certainly was on display, from the bottles of Champagne and fine crystal glasses, to the cans of beer, to the emptying vodka bottles, to the man strumming a guitar for those who gathered 'round, to the impromptu games of soccer, volleyball and frisbee. Katie and Toby — two 21-year-old students at Cardiff University in Wales, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) away, who asked that their last names not be used — got to the park a little after 7 p.m. on Sunday, with a gray tent, two sleeping bags, an air mattress, a picnic and change of clothes. Toby was hoping to see three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka on Monday. And Katie? “Anyone,\" she said. “Absolutely anyone.” ___ More AP Wimbledon coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/wimbledon and https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports","pubDate":"2022-06-27 17:51:50","image_url":"https://kfor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/c6cc096a03bf4d62a6261dc00de7c53b.jpg?w=900","source_id":"kfor","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Eoin Morgan set to announce international retirement on Tuesday","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/international/eoin-morgan-set-to-announce-international-retirement-on-tuesday-180b36f9-5c57-4f03-814e-ee41088e18d1","keywords":null,"creator":["AFP"],"video_url":null,"description":"England’s World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan is set to retire from international cricket.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-27 17:11:07","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/f55d2470-8591-50cf-bb3c-c0424de66951&operation=CROP&offset=0x286&resize=1956x1100","source_id":"iol","country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka vs Australia 2022: Sri Lanka Cricket to pay tribute to Shane Warne during Galle Test - Watch","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/sri-lanka-vs-australia-2022-sri-lanka-cricket-to-pay-tribute-to-shane-warne-during-galle-test-watch-2478742.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"For Galle was the venue where the Australian great became the first bowler in test cricket history to take 500 wickets.","content":"Sri Lankans will stand to attention in a fitting salute to all-time cricketing great Australian spin wizard Shane Warne when the first Test between Sri Lanka and Australia gets underway on June 29 at the Galle International Stadium.

This writer had the privilege of having a word with the legend on that occasion when he visited the Moratuwa Cricket Stadium where several teenage cricketers were lined up in a guard of honour. He did voice that he was concerned about the welfare of Sri Lankans affected and as much saddened by the devastation of the Galle Stadium,\" SLC in a statement said. For Galle was the venue where the Australian great became the first bowler in test cricket history to take 500 wickets. Therein, this June 29 will surely evoke moving memories of Shane Warne, the unrelenting cricketing warrior in the middle who gave no quarter nor asked for any, but who proved to be a true friend to his adversaries off the field in time of distress. Indeed Warne, by his magnanimous act did signify that the game of cricket transcended beyond the boundaries of competition. It has been recognised by Sri Lanka Cricket by its decision to pay tribute to Warne posthumously by dedicating the Galle Test in memory of the great. Born Shane Keith Warne on September 13, 1969, the Australian went on to turn the art of spin bowling on its head by taking it to a new level. Among his most famous wicket-taking deliveries was the arm ball that stood him out. He claimed a record 708 Test wickets from 145 appearances and 293 ODI wickets from 194 games. Warne is also remembered as perhaps the most colourful personality the game has produced by his outgoing approach and his endearing chuckle and a big grin.","pubDate":"2022-06-27 17:02:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ben Stokes calls on aspiring Test players to match England’s aggressive approach","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/27/ben-stokes-calls-on-aspiring-test-players-to-match-englands-aggressive-approach","keywords":["England v New Zealand 2022","Ben Stokes","Jonny Bairstow","England cricket team","New Zealand cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Simon Burnton at Headingley"],"video_url":null,"description":"‘It’s the manner you play not necessarily your stats,’ says captainCaptain praises ‘special’ Bairstow after clean sweep of New ZealandBen Stokes watched as England buried New Zealand under a blizzard of boundaries to win the third Test and complete a series clean sweep before calling on professional players around the country to adopt the same hyper-aggressive approach if they have international ambitions of their own.“I knew that everyone would buy into this mentality that me and Brendon [McCullum] wanted out of this team but I didn’t think it would go this well,” Stokes said. “I think these last three games should have sent a message to people who aspire to play Test cricket for England over the next two or three years at least.

Root and Bairstow seal England’s Test series sweep against New Zealand Read more “I would say it’s the manner you play, whether that be with the ball or bat in your hand, not necessarily your stats. Because what we want to do is build on this, and it’s not just about this moment, it’s about the future as well.” By making a target of 296 look much more molehill than mountain at Headingley England became the first side ever to chase targets greater than 250 three times in a series. “If we were on the wrong side of results in these games, if they’d played out the same way but we’d lost, I’d have walked off a very happy captain with the way everyone’s applied themselves, the attitude they’ve given to every single day, every single session, every single hour of these three matches,” Stokes said. “I would like to think people watching know what they have to do to bang the door down and try to get in this team.” Jonny Bairstow scored an unbeaten 44-ball 71 as England’s first series under Stokes’s captaincy, and with McCullum as coach, ended with spectacular speed. Across the series the Yorkshireman scored 394 runs at a strike rate of 120 and an average of 78.8. “Jonny knows what he’s in the team to do now, and he knows how he wants to play,” Stokes said. Jonny Bairstow races to 71 not out to complete England’s run chase at Headingley.

For him to back up an amazing knock [in the second Test] at Trent Bridge with a performance in both innings this week was something very special.” Kane Williamson, the New Zealand captain, was left to wonder how his side went from having England 55 for six in their first innings, well on top and 274 ahead, to ending the game emphatically beaten. “In the last three matches we’ve found ourselves in positions of strength and perhaps ahead of the game, and there have been some incredible counterattacks which have come off in big ways for England,” he said. “This game in particular, where we had them 55 for six and then see the game swing so quickly in a matter of two sessions ... it was hard to stop. At times we’ve played worse and come away with better results, but credit to England and the way they put their mark on the moments that really mattered.” With Ben Foakes recovering from Covid, Sam Billings has been added to an otherwise unchanged England squad for the Test against India which starts at Edgbaston on Friday.","pubDate":"2022-06-27 16:45:00","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dbc10c3e314d737a25e99b8ad7cd9cb4e452ce3/572_0_3975_2385/master/3975.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a90766e584f097ae56d2e2b838f17b44","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
