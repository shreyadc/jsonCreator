After Australia's Commonwealth Games campaign climaxed with the gold medal in August, Lanning began an indefinite absence from cricket in order to recharge and focus on herself. Her break will span the whole of the WBBL season, which begins on Thursday, with the 30-year-old offering no guarantee of a top-level return. Lanning's absence comes after a hectic 12 months for the Australian national team. Since August last year, they have contested a multi-format series against India, the Ashes, the ODI World Cup, a T20I Tri-Series with Pakistan and Ireland, and the Commonwealth Games. Those international demands come on top of the players' domestic cricket commitments. Gardner has played more than 100 matches for Australia under Lanning's captaincy and said the long-term skipper's hiatus would not be the last of its kind. \"Over the next 10 years, there's going to be heaps more people that are going to pull out of tournaments because they just want to have a break, to reset and recharge,\" she told AAP. Sophie Molineux, Amanda-Jade Wellington and Hannah Darlington are among the high-profile players to have taken mental-health leave in recent years and Gardner said the captain's decision to do the same was a powerful one. \"It's a really good message to the wider community to speak up,\" she said. \"It also just sends a message to the public and to the community that we are human. \"Everyone expects us to be perfect all the time but realistically that's not how it is. People tend to forget that it does take a toll.\" Gardner said Lanning was going well when she last checked in and had been enjoying the chance to pursue other interests. \"If you don't have things outside of cricket that take up your time it can be quite tough,\" Gardner said. \"You don't really know who you are in the end. \"Cricket's great but you almost need to find who you are before you stop playing and she was brave enough to do that.\" Newly minted Australia coach Shelley Nitschke has yet to announce a replacement for Lanning, who is still a chance to return to the international set-up over the summer. Gardner said Lanning would leave a hole in the world-beating Australian team if she were to step away from the game for good. \"She's been really successful as an individual and as a captain for the Aussie side,\" Gardner said. \"If she wasn't to come back, she certainly would leave a strong legacy for the next person to try and follow.\" Lifeline 13 11 14 beyondblue 1300 22 4636","pubDate":"2022-10-11 00:13:33","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-8510091/8c061cc3499d9dc1c2362715867be49848ac7e23-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bastian Schweinsteiger sends message to Manchester United star","link":"https://www.unitedinfocus.com/cr7/bastian-schweinsteiger-sends-message-to-cristiano-ronaldo/","keywords":["CR7","Cristiano Ronaldo"],"creator":["Dan Coombs"],"video_url":null,"description":"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 700th club career goal at the weekend in Manchester United‚Äôs victory over Everton.

Ronaldo, 37, struck the winner for United at Goodison, his first Premier League strike of the season. The superstar has been widely applauded after reaching the milestone figure, which comes in addition to the 117 international goals he has scored. United‚Äôs players and staff all posed with Ronaldo to pay tribute to his achievement on Monday, paying recognition to the feat. Former Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger reached out to Ronaldo and urged him not to stop, with a message reading, ‚Äògo for more‚Äô. Ronaldo is relentless in his desire to score goals, and he certainly won‚Äôt be stopping soon, not with rival Lionel Messi close to him with 691 club goals of his own. Congratulations on your 700th club goal! üëèüèº Go for more! üëäüèº @Cristiano https://t.co/lGTVBJmogy There were more tributes to Ronaldo on his own Instagram page, in which he wrote, ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful number we‚Äôve achieved together! Thank you to all my teammates, coaches, clubs, family & friends and of course my fans. United we continue!‚Äù Former Olympic sprinter Yohan Blake applauded him on social media, along with his former Real Madrid teammate Marcelo, while there was also a message from his former club Sporting, where Ronaldo began his 700 goal haul.

Ramiz Raja, the PCB chairman, said at the time it was \"frustrating\" to see the Black Caps walking out of the tour by taking a unilateral approach and not sharing the security threat with Pakistan. England subsequently abandoned a short scheduled tour to Pakistan due to security concerns. However, England last month arrived for its first tour of Pakistan for the first time in 17 years, winning the seven-match Twenty20 series 4-3. England will also tour Pakistan in December for three test matches. \"New Zealand and Pakistan share a terrific history in international cricket and there is genuine respect between the two teams as well as the two boards,\" David White, New Zealand Cricket chief executive said in a statement. \"The recent tours from Australia and England have left us in no doubt regarding the quality of the Pakistan side across all formats, and the extent of the challenge that awaits us.\" Zakir Khan, PCB director international cricket, said that the ODIs against New Zealand will help Pakistan prepare for next year's Asia Cup and the World Cup, which is being held in India.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-10 19:33:04","image_url":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/no3lwjdu/devon-conway-of-the-black-caps-with-muhammad-rizwan-of-pakistan-photosport.jpg","source_id":"newstalkzb","country":["new zealand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2022: Full squads, schedule, format and everything else you need to know","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/syed-mushtaq-ali-trophy-2022-full-squads-schedule-format-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-11422501.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2022: Full squads, schedule, format and everything else you need to know","content":"India‚Äôs home season got underway with the limited-overs‚Äô series against Australia and South Africa and and in less than 24 hours, the limited-overs leg of the domestic season will also kick off with the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, BCCI‚Äôs premier domestic T20 competition.This year‚Äôs Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, the 15th edition overall, takes place a week after the conclusion of the first half of the 2022-23 Irani Cup, where Rest of India prevailed over 2019-20 Ranji Trophy winners Saurashtra.

The ‚ÄòDhoni Entertainment‚Äô will now , expand its film production business to three Southern Indian languages in Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam. While further details on the same are yet to be furnished, the decision might have to do with the stellar rise of quality South Indian cinema releases in the recent few years, or with Dhoni‚Äôs proximity and close relationship with Southern India, especially the state of Tamil Nadu. Apart from the aforementioned film production line, Dhoni is already spending ample time while looking after his organic farming and animal husbandry business with the cooperation of the Agriculture Department of Jharkhand. As per , Dhoni‚Äôs organic farm produces like strawberries, papaya, bananas, tomatoes, broccoli, cabbage and peas are not only being successfully sold in the Indian markets, but also exported to countries like the UAE, and other Gulf Countries.","pubDate":"2022-10-10 17:47:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pro Kabaddi 2022: Guman Singh, Jai Bhagwan shine as U Mumba defeat UP Yoddhas; Dabang Delhi overpower Gujarat Giants","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/pro-kabaddi-2022-guman-singh-jai-bhagwan-shine-as-u-mumba-defeat-up-yoddhas-dabang-delhi-overpower-gujarat-giants-11422671.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pro Kabaddi 2022: Guman Singh, Jai Bhagwan shine as U Mumba defeat UP Yoddhas; Dabang Delhi overpower Gujarat Giants","content":"Bengaluru: Raiders Guman Singh and Jai Bhagwan were the stars as U Mumba defeated UP Yoddhas 30-23 in match 10 of the Pro Kabaddi League Season 9 at the Shree Kanteerava Indoor Stadium here on Monday.Bhagwan picked up six points, while Guman scored five points in the match.Jai Bhagwan and Guman Singh chipped in with raids as U Mumba took a three-point lead at 5-2 in the seventh minute.While the #Mumboys registered their first points in a , the defending champs continued theirHere‚Äôs the points table so far!#vivoProKabaddi #MUMvUP #DELvGG pic.twitter.com/mRI41hqjSG‚Äî ProKabaddi (@ProKabaddi) October 10, 2022 The U Mumba defence, led by Surinder Singh, backed their raiders and helped the Mumbai team to keep forging ahead.

While Shelar filed his nomination papers on Monday, the last day of filing nominations for the October 20 election, along with a spree of political leaders across parties, the voters were left confused. While Shelar‚Äôs faction claimed to have formed an alliance with the former Sharad Pawar Group, the erstwhile Sharad Pawar Group rebranded itself as Mumbai Cricket Group and reaffirmed its stand of contesting the election with former India all-rounder and coach Sandeep Patil as the candidate for the president‚Äôs post. The candidature of Shelar - who was the president for two years from 2016 - and his alliance with Pawar was expected with the veteran leader and administrator having been nominated as a representative of a club owned by Shelar. According to a list released by Milind Narvekar, a close aide of former Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, besides Shelar, the Shelar-Pawar Group includes political leaders across parties. Besides Shelar, one of the influential leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), incumbent vice-president Amol Kale, an ally of Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, has again filed his papers for the same post. While Narvekar (erstwhile Shiv Sena) and Jitendra Awhad (former minister and a senior leader of Nationalist Congress Party) have submitted their nomination form for the apex council members‚Äô posts. Interestingly, Ajinkya Naik and Gaurav Payyade are the common names in the list for the Shelar-Pawar Group and the Mumbai Cricket Group. While the Mumbai cricket fraternity was abuzz with the possible pull-out of the erstwhile Pawar Group, Patil reassured the voters that he and his group will contest the election. ‚ÄúMe and my group will strive to close the widening communication gap between the association and the clubs.

Aaron Finch‚Äôs men enjoy the advantage of being the only winners of cricket‚Äôs shortest format to have a crack at defending the title on home territory since the T20 World Cup started in 2007. With a star-studded line-up spearheaded by David Warner, Pat Cummins and Glenn Maxwell, the Australians also boast all but one of the team that won the tournament last year in the UAE. Finch, who recently stood down as one-day skipper to focus on T20s, suggested they will be all guns blazing in defense of the trophy. ‚ÄúIf in doubt, be overly aggressive. That is how we want to play,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt times that is going to come with high risk and high reward. At times it comes with no reward. That is just a part of T20.‚Äù The tournament‚Äôs eighth edition begins on Sunday with Sri Lanka facing Namibia and UAE against Netherlands in a first qualifying round at Geelong, one of seven venues being used for the 45 matches. Games will also be held in Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, Perth and Sydney, with the final on November 13 under lights at the cavernous Melbourne Cricket Ground. The top nations join on October 22 when Australia open their defense against Kane Williamson‚Äôs New Zealand in Sydney ‚Äì a repeat of the 2021 final in Dubai where Mitchell Marsh‚Äôs unbeaten 77 powered them to an eight-wicket win and maiden crown. Blockbuster clash Despite a couple of key absences India and England are the favorites along with Australia. England face fast-improving Afghanistan in Perth for their opener on October 22 but will be missing star batsman Johnny Bairstow after he suffered a serious leg injury in a ‚Äúfreak accident‚Äù on the golf course. A blockbuster clash follows 24 hours later in Melbourne when India take on arch-rivals and 2009 champions Pakistan, with more than 90,000 fans expected. India suffered a huge blow last week when pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was ruled out of the World Cup with a back injury, further depleting the stocks of a side that has lacked steam in the final overs of the T20 format. All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is also absent with a knee problem. While Rohit Sharma‚Äôs side are ranked number one, they haven‚Äôt lifted the T20 trophy since 2007 and failed to reach the semi-finals last year. ‚ÄúAreas of concerns, we have to look at our bowling, what more options we can find in the powerplay, middle and death,‚Äù said swashbuckling opener Sharma, who along with run machine Virat Kohli will be key to their chances. ‚ÄúIt will be challenging and we need to find answers, still working towards that.‚Äù England threat World number two England are also a big threat for a first title since 2010 and beat Australia in a warm-up match on Sunday. They are in Australia on the back of a 4-3 triumph in Pakistan, a series in which captain Jos Buttler attended but played no part as he recovered from a calf injury. He is though fit for the World Cup and insisted not playing had its benefits. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned lots listening to the group and watching the way they go about things, watching without as much emotion as when you are involved and thinking about what you will do at certain times,‚Äù he told reporters. The West Indies are the only two-time champions ‚Äì in 2012 and 2016 ‚Äì but in a shock failed to automatically qualify for the Super 12 stage because they were outside the top-eight-ranked ICC teams at the time. It means they play the first round of the 16-nation tournament despite now being ranked seven. Nicholas Pooran captains an inexperienced side after Andre Russell was overlooked and a slew of veterans called time on their international careers. They are paired with Scotland, Ireland and Zimbabwe and kick off against the Scots on October 17. Recently crowned Asian champions Sri Lanka are in the same boat despite now being ranked eight and are grouped with Namibia, Netherlands and UAE in the preliminaries. The top two from each group join the Super 12 nations ‚Äì England, New Zealand, Australia and Afghanistan in Group 1; India, Pakistan, South Africa and Bangladesh in Group 2. ‚Äì AFP The post History beckons for title-holders Australia at Twenty 20 World Cup appeared first on Kuwait Times.","pubDate":"2022-10-10 15:32:40","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","country":["Kuwait"],"category":["sports"],"language":"arabic"},{"title":"India Vs South Africa 3rd ODI Delhi Weather Forecast, Pitch Report And Probable Playing11 - ICC CRICKET SCHEDULE","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljY2NyaWNrZXRzY2hlZHVsZS5jb20vaW5kaWEtdnMtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLTNyZC1vZGktZGVsaGktd2VhdGhlci1mb3JlY2FzdC1waXRjaC1yZXBvcnQtYW5kLXByb2JhYmxlLXBsYXlpbmcxMS_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India Vs South Africa 3rd ODI Delhi Weather Forecast, Pitch Report And Probable Playing11¬†¬†ICC CRICKET SCHEDULELIVE | IND vs SA 2nd ODI Score: Iyer Leads IND To 7 Wicket Win To Level Series 1-1¬†¬†India.comIndia v South Africa Third ODI Tips: Ominous India find their range¬†¬†Betting.betfairIndia vs South Africa, 3rd ODI: Probable XIs, pitch report, weather forecast, match prediction and live streaming details¬†¬†SportskeedaIND vs SA Match Prediction ‚Äì Who will win today‚Äôs match?¬†¬†CricTrackerView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-10 15:14:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Azeem Rafiq formally reprimanded by Cricket Discipline Committee for anti-Semitic slurs","link":"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/azeem-rafiq-formally-reprimanded-cricket-151324475.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-10 15:13:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Yorkshire&#039;s Rafiq, Gale reprimanded for historical social media posts","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/10/10/cricket-yorkshire039s-rafiq-gale-reprimanded-for-historical-social-media-posts","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - Former Yorkshire spinner Azeem Rafiq and ex-head coach Andrew Gale are among five players who have been reprimanded by England's Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) for historical social media posts, the country's cricket board (ECB) said.

Earlier this year, she led the Indian team to a successful 2022 Commonwealth Games (CWG) campaign, it might not have ended in the way India wanted to but they still managed to clinch the silver medal. After 's retirement, Kaur was made the full-time skipper of the Indian cricket team and it seems that she is relishing every challenge that is being thrown at her. India's skipper Harmanpreet Kaur riding high on her recent form has been awarded by the ICC. The International Cricket Council has felicitated Harmanpreet with the best player award for September and she has now become the first winner of the ICC Women's Player of the Month award. The Indian skipper had a great run against England in the three-match ODI series that they played. Kaur amassed a total of 221 runs across three matches. The Indian skipper averaged 221 and registered a strike rate of 103.27. She bettered her compatriot who scored a total of 181 runs with a decent average of 60.33. The race wasn't just restricted to Mandhana and Kaur, Nigar Sultana, the skipper of Bangladesh too was in the reckoning and lay her claim to Harmanpreet's throne. The month of September has been a memorable one, not only for Harmanpreet Kaur the player but for Harmanpreet Kaur the captain also. She led the Indian women's team to a 3-0 whitewash over Amy Jones's England which also happens to be India women's first series win in England since 1999. In the first ODI of the series, Kaur registered a scintillating 74* while chasing 228. She later followed it up with 143* off just 111 balls which also happens to be her second-highest ODI score.","pubDate":"2022-10-10 14:33:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
