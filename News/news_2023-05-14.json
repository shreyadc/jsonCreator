FirstCricket Staff May 14th, 2023 0:23:52 IST Punjab Kings opener Prabhsimran Singh raises his bat and helmet in celebration after completing his maiden IPL century. Sportzpics Prabhsimran Singh produced perhaps what could be the biggest knock of his career so far, smashing his maiden hundred in the Indian Premier League (IPL) that helped Punjab Kings (PBKS) defeat Delhi Capitals (DC) in New Delhi on Saturday. IPL 2023: Full coverage | Points table | Schedule | Results | Orange Cap | Purple Cap​ The PBKS opener stood tall even as the DC bowlers made early inroads after opting to bowl at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in the second match of the Saturday double-header. The 22-year-old was batting on 21 off 20 balls at the end of the powerplay after Ishant Sharma struck twice and Axar Patel removed Jitesh Sharma.

The opening batter shifted gears shortly after the halfway mark by smashing Mitchell Marsh for two consecutive sixes and a four in a 21-run 11th over, and would not slow down even after Curran departed in the 15th over. Relive that special 💯 moment here 🔽 #TATAIPL | #DCvPBKS https://t.co/eBGUL8gkVh pic.twitter.com/uWI2uW8vB8 — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) May 13, 2023 Prabhsimran, who had crossed the 50-run mark just once so far in his debut IPL season, would move to the 90s in quick time before bringing up the coveted three-figure mark with back-to-back boundaries off Khaleel Ahmed in the 18th over, taking 61 deliveries to get to the milestone. The knock, naturally had Cricket Twitter applauding him for his superlative effort. Here are select reactions to what is Punjab King’s first century of the season: Prabhsimran singh has been massively impressive this season 👏 — Irfan Pathan (@IrfanPathan) May 13, 2023 Such a coming of age knock that from Prabhsimran – Everyone knows he’s got them big boy shots – But the few overs of keeping quiet, rotating strike and partnership building in the middle – Fabulous ! #PBKSvDC — Jatin Sapru (@jatinsapru) May 13, 2023 It probably won’t be wrong to say that this is the best century of IPL 2023. Sensational knock By Prabhsimran Singh 👀👏👏👏👏 — ` Frustrated CSKian (@kurkureter) May 13, 2023 We have seen Prabhsimran Singh do well in fc cricket. But he needed that one defining innings in the IPL. Today he has done that on the big stage. He has the talent to play for India somewhere in the future. Or feels that way. — Bharath Ramaraj (@Fancricket12) May 13, 2023 It was the second ton in as many days in the IPL, with Suryakumar Yadav having struck an unbeaten 103 off 49 balls against the Gujarat Titans in Mumbai on Friday. Prabhsimran however, would depart shortly after bringing up his century as he would end up getting bowled by a low full toss from Mukesh Kumar that was almost a yorker, departing for a 65-ball 103. His contribution with the bat would help turn the tide in favour of Punjab, who ended up posting a competitive 167 on a tricky Delhi pitch. Left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar would then grab 4/30 as the Delhi Capitals crumbled like a house of cards after a solid 69-run opening stand between skipper David Warner and Phil Salt, getting restricted to 136/8 and bowing out of the playoffs race with their eighth defeat in 12 games.

China has won 283 Olympic gold medals, which is 273 more than India. China’s capital has hosted the Olympics twice: the Summer Games in 2008 and the India has hosted the Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games but hasn’t yet staged the Olympics—although there’s the promise of an Indian bid for 2036. “China has been successful on the tracks and fields of the world, India hasn’t,” Simon Chadwick, professor of sport and geopolitical economy at the SKEMA Business School in France, told The Associated Press. “India has underperformed.” Except in cricket. India’s overwhelming sporting suc cess has been the development of the Indian Premier League, the world’s richest and most dominant franchise cricket competition. And with that, India has created something China hasn’t been able to achieve: a domestic league that is lucrative as well as internationally successful. China’s big plans to become a soccer powerhouse started with billions of dollars being spent on famous players and coaches from around the world, generating global headlines for the Chinese Super League for a decade until an economic downturn and then the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything. Troubles in the property sector—particularly painful as more than half of the Chinese league’s top-tier teams were owned by real estate companies—put an end to hopes that the league would rival the biggest in the world. Instead, ambitions of the league being a launching pad for international success for China and its national team have been replaced by and the . Meanwhile the brand value of the India’s Twenty20 cricket tournament, established in 2008, grew to an estimated $8.4 billion in 2022. The IPL last year sold its five-year broadcasting rights for $6.02 billion, making it in terms of revenue per game, behind the NFL but above English soccer’s Premier League. “India is home to one of the most powerful sports properties in the world,” Chadwick said. “Which shows that the country has the resources and the expertise to successfully engage with sport.” Arunava Chaudhuri, a sports consultant and former All India Football Federation media manager, said that needs to extend beyond cricket. “The key is that India moves away from a one-sport country,” he said. “Success in badminton, wrestling, boxing has shown progress, but team sports are a different challenge.” Then there’s that talk of India bidding for the with Chaudhuri saying the city of Ahmedabad “is being prepared for that.” India’s Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur told the Times of India newspaper in December that the government would support an Olympic bid and it would be prepared in time for important IOC meetings in Mumbai, which are being held in October. “If India is putting in so much effort to promote sports, I can assure you that we will not only host the Olympics, we will host it in a big way,” Thakur told the newspaper. “This is the right time to host the Games. If India is making news in every sector from manufacturing to services, then why not in sports?” Indian states such as Gujarat, home to the 132,000-seat Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, and Odisha have taken the lead. Dubbed as ‘India’s Sporting Capital’, Odisha state has invested more than $250 million to build stadiums for field hockey, tennis, badminton and aquatics. The Odishan city of Bhubaneswar hosted the field hockey World Cup in January and was one of six soccer venues for the women’s Under-17 World Cup last October. “India is developing fast and might have an ambition to showcase its achievements through sports,” Ivanhoe Li, CEO of Beijing-based sports marketing company Fangze Sports, said. “Hosting a world-class event is not difficult but having great athletic performances might be a question.” The UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs declared in April that . It brought a lot of optimism in India, but China remains well established to pick up where it left off in 2020 sports. China’s sports industry was hit by three years of stringent Covid-19 policies and a series of strict lockdowns which only ended in December, forcing a 12-month postponement of the 2022 Asian Games and Beijing relinquishing hosting rights for soccer’s 2023 Asian Cup. That’s something the Chinese want to put in the past. The country is ready to get back into the business of sports and the government has projected that the value of the sports industry would reach around $725 billion by 2025, a rise from $434 billion in 2021. Li, the sports marketing expert, is optimistic about the future, fueled by a boom in the country after three years when hundreds of millions of people had to curb discretionary spending. “Chinese people have a lot of money in the bank and the sports industry is picking up at an unexpected speed,” Li told AP. “The government is encouraging consumption in all sectors and while people are cautious of spending on property and automobiles, they are spending more on food, travel, health and sports.” With a growing population, economy and political influence, India’s sports industry is making strides—but still has some way to go to come close to China.","pubDate":"2023-05-13 16:08:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"businessmirror","category":["sports"],"country":["philippines"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Date, Time, Venue, Head-To-Head, Pitch Report, Dream11 Prediction, Probable Playing 11 And Squads","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/date-time-venue-head-to-head-pitch-report-dream11-prediction-probable-playing-11-and-squads/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=date-time-venue-head-to-head-pitch-report-dream11-prediction-probable-playing-11-and-squads","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Chennai vs Kolkata Dream11 Team Prediction IPL 2023, Match 61: CSK vs KKR Top Picks, Fantasy Tips, Captain, Playing 11s Today’s Match, M.

The Bollywood actor and wicket keeper-batsman’s rapport is always making headlines at entertainment tabloids and portals. However, the crazy fandom seems to be divided when it comes to support for their favourite celebs. Recently a fan’s selfie video went viral where he mispronounced Urvashi’s name while joking with his friends. The reel might have been in good humour, but it seems to be not going down too well with the Agent actor. She took to her Instagram handle and reposted the video. Urvashi captioned her post as “STOP BUTCHERING MY LAST NAME WHICH IS SO PRECIOUS TO ME 😡 😡 😡 WORDS HAVE MEANING & SURNAMES HAVE POWER & BLESSINGS #IDontLikeIt #notfunny ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ #love #UrvashiRautela #UR1 #reels #reelsinstagram #reelkarofeelkaro #reel #reelsindia #actor #dance #girl #instagood #trending #India #instagram #india.” In the viral clip from the DC vs SRH IPL match, a fan was seen showing support for Rishabh Pant and saying that he won’t spare Urvashi Rautela amid their link-up rumors. The person was seen mispronouncing the actor’s name as ‘Ratola’ instead of Rautela. For the unversed, Rishabh is not a part of IPL 2023 as he is currently recovering from his injuries caused due to a road accident. He was soon rushed to the hospital after suffering several injuries including a knee ligament tear.

FirstCricket Staff May 14th, 2023 0:23:52 IST Punjab Kings opener Prabhsimran Singh raises his bat and helmet in celebration after completing his maiden IPL century. Sportzpics Prabhsimran Singh produced perhaps what could be the biggest knock of his career so far, smashing his maiden hundred in the Indian Premier League (IPL) that helped Punjab Kings (PBKS) defeat Delhi Capitals (DC) in New Delhi on Saturday. IPL 2023: Full coverage | Points table | Schedule | Results | Orange Cap | Purple Cap​ The PBKS opener stood tall even as the DC bowlers made early inroads after opting to bowl at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in the second match of the Saturday double-header. The 22-year-old was batting on 21 off 20 balls at the end of the powerplay after Ishant Sharma struck twice and Axar Patel removed Jitesh Sharma.

The opening batter shifted gears shortly after the halfway mark by smashing Mitchell Marsh for two consecutive sixes and a four in a 21-run 11th over, and would not slow down even after Curran departed in the 15th over. Relive that special 💯 moment here 🔽 #TATAIPL | #DCvPBKS https://t.co/eBGUL8gkVh pic.twitter.com/uWI2uW8vB8 — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) May 13, 2023 Prabhsimran, who had crossed the 50-run mark just once so far in his debut IPL season, would move to the 90s in quick time before bringing up the coveted three-figure mark with back-to-back boundaries off Khaleel Ahmed in the 18th over, taking 61 deliveries to get to the milestone. The knock, naturally had Cricket Twitter applauding him for his superlative effort. Here are select reactions to what is Punjab King’s first century of the season: Prabhsimran singh has been massively impressive this season 👏 — Irfan Pathan (@IrfanPathan) May 13, 2023 Such a coming of age knock that from Prabhsimran – Everyone knows he’s got them big boy shots – But the few overs of keeping quiet, rotating strike and partnership building in the middle – Fabulous ! #PBKSvDC — Jatin Sapru (@jatinsapru) May 13, 2023 It probably won’t be wrong to say that this is the best century of IPL 2023. Sensational knock By Prabhsimran Singh 👀👏👏👏👏 — ` Frustrated CSKian (@kurkureter) May 13, 2023 We have seen Prabhsimran Singh do well in fc cricket. But he needed that one defining innings in the IPL. Today he has done that on the big stage. He has the talent to play for India somewhere in the future. Or feels that way. — Bharath Ramaraj (@Fancricket12) May 13, 2023 It was the second ton in as many days in the IPL, with Suryakumar Yadav having struck an unbeaten 103 off 49 balls against the Gujarat Titans in Mumbai on Friday. Prabhsimran however, would depart shortly after bringing up his century as he would end up getting bowled by a low full toss from Mukesh Kumar that was almost a yorker, departing for a 65-ball 103. His contribution with the bat would help turn the tide in favour of Punjab, who ended up posting a competitive 167 on a tricky Delhi pitch. Left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar would then grab 4/30 as the Delhi Capitals crumbled like a house of cards after a solid 69-run opening stand between skipper David Warner and Phil Salt, getting restricted to 136/8 and bowing out of the playoffs race with their eighth defeat in 12 games.

China has won 283 Olympic gold medals, which is 273 more than India. China’s capital has hosted the Olympics twice: the Summer Games in 2008 and the India has hosted the Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games but hasn’t yet staged the Olympics—although there’s the promise of an Indian bid for 2036. “China has been successful on the tracks and fields of the world, India hasn’t,” Simon Chadwick, professor of sport and geopolitical economy at the SKEMA Business School in France, told The Associated Press. “India has underperformed.” Except in cricket. India’s overwhelming sporting suc cess has been the development of the Indian Premier League, the world’s richest and most dominant franchise cricket competition. And with that, India has created something China hasn’t been able to achieve: a domestic league that is lucrative as well as internationally successful. China’s big plans to become a soccer powerhouse started with billions of dollars being spent on famous players and coaches from around the world, generating global headlines for the Chinese Super League for a decade until an economic downturn and then the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything. Troubles in the property sector—particularly painful as more than half of the Chinese league’s top-tier teams were owned by real estate companies—put an end to hopes that the league would rival the biggest in the world. Instead, ambitions of the league being a launching pad for international success for China and its national team have been replaced by and the . Meanwhile the brand value of the India’s Twenty20 cricket tournament, established in 2008, grew to an estimated $8.4 billion in 2022. The IPL last year sold its five-year broadcasting rights for $6.02 billion, making it in terms of revenue per game, behind the NFL but above English soccer’s Premier League. “India is home to one of the most powerful sports properties in the world,” Chadwick said. “Which shows that the country has the resources and the expertise to successfully engage with sport.” Arunava Chaudhuri, a sports consultant and former All India Football Federation media manager, said that needs to extend beyond cricket. “The key is that India moves away from a one-sport country,” he said. “Success in badminton, wrestling, boxing has shown progress, but team sports are a different challenge.” Then there’s that talk of India bidding for the with Chaudhuri saying the city of Ahmedabad “is being prepared for that.” India’s Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur told the Times of India newspaper in December that the government would support an Olympic bid and it would be prepared in time for important IOC meetings in Mumbai, which are being held in October. “If India is putting in so much effort to promote sports, I can assure you that we will not only host the Olympics, we will host it in a big way,” Thakur told the newspaper. “This is the right time to host the Games. If India is making news in every sector from manufacturing to services, then why not in sports?” Indian states such as Gujarat, home to the 132,000-seat Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, and Odisha have taken the lead. Dubbed as ‘India’s Sporting Capital’, Odisha state has invested more than $250 million to build stadiums for field hockey, tennis, badminton and aquatics. The Odishan city of Bhubaneswar hosted the field hockey World Cup in January and was one of six soccer venues for the women’s Under-17 World Cup last October. “India is developing fast and might have an ambition to showcase its achievements through sports,” Ivanhoe Li, CEO of Beijing-based sports marketing company Fangze Sports, said. “Hosting a world-class event is not difficult but having great athletic performances might be a question.” The UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs declared in April that . It brought a lot of optimism in India, but China remains well established to pick up where it left off in 2020 sports. China’s sports industry was hit by three years of stringent Covid-19 policies and a series of strict lockdowns which only ended in December, forcing a 12-month postponement of the 2022 Asian Games and Beijing relinquishing hosting rights for soccer’s 2023 Asian Cup. That’s something the Chinese want to put in the past. The country is ready to get back into the business of sports and the government has projected that the value of the sports industry would reach around $725 billion by 2025, a rise from $434 billion in 2021. Li, the sports marketing expert, is optimistic about the future, fueled by a boom in the country after three years when hundreds of millions of people had to curb discretionary spending. “Chinese people have a lot of money in the bank and the sports industry is picking up at an unexpected speed,” Li told AP. “The government is encouraging consumption in all sectors and while people are cautious of spending on property and automobiles, they are spending more on food, travel, health and sports.” With a growing population, economy and political influence, India’s sports industry is making strides—but still has some way to go to come close to China.","pubDate":"2023-05-13 16:08:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"businessmirror","category":["sports"],"country":["philippines"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Date, Time, Venue, Head-To-Head, Pitch Report, Dream11 Prediction, Probable Playing 11 And Squads","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/date-time-venue-head-to-head-pitch-report-dream11-prediction-probable-playing-11-and-squads/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=date-time-venue-head-to-head-pitch-report-dream11-prediction-probable-playing-11-and-squads","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Chennai vs Kolkata Dream11 Team Prediction IPL 2023, Match 61: CSK vs KKR Top Picks, Fantasy Tips, Captain, Playing 11s Today’s Match, M.

The Bollywood actor and wicket keeper-batsman’s rapport is always making headlines at entertainment tabloids and portals. However, the crazy fandom seems to be divided when it comes to support for their favourite celebs. Recently a fan’s selfie video went viral where he mispronounced Urvashi’s name while joking with his friends. The reel might have been in good humour, but it seems to be not going down too well with the Agent actor. She took to her Instagram handle and reposted the video.

The person was seen mispronouncing the actor’s name as ‘Ratola’ instead of Rautela. For the unversed, Rishabh is not a part of IPL 2023 as he is currently recovering from his injuries caused due to a road accident. He was soon rushed to the hospital after suffering several injuries including a knee ligament tear.

FirstCricket Staff May 14th, 2023 0:23:52 IST Punjab Kings opener Prabhsimran Singh raises his bat and helmet in celebration after completing his maiden IPL century. Sportzpics Prabhsimran Singh produced perhaps what could be the biggest knock of his career so far, smashing his maiden hundred in the Indian Premier League (IPL) that helped Punjab Kings (PBKS) defeat Delhi Capitals (DC) in New Delhi on Saturday. IPL 2023: Full coverage | Points table | Schedule | Results | Orange Cap | Purple Cap​ The PBKS opener stood tall even as the DC bowlers made early inroads after opting to bowl at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in the second match of the Saturday double-header. The 22-year-old was batting on 21 off 20 balls at the end of the powerplay after Ishant Sharma struck twice and Axar Patel removed Jitesh Sharma.

The opening batter shifted gears shortly after the halfway mark by smashing Mitchell Marsh for two consecutive sixes and a four in a 21-run 11th over, and would not slow down even after Curran departed in the 15th over. Relive that special 💯 moment here 🔽 #TATAIPL | #DCvPBKS https://t.co/eBGUL8gkVh pic.twitter.com/uWI2uW8vB8 — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) May 13, 2023 Prabhsimran, who had crossed the 50-run mark just once so far in his debut IPL season, would move to the 90s in quick time before bringing up the coveted three-figure mark with back-to-back boundaries off Khaleel Ahmed in the 18th over, taking 61 deliveries to get to the milestone. The knock, naturally had Cricket Twitter applauding him for his superlative effort. Here are select reactions to what is Punjab King’s first century of the season: Prabhsimran singh has been massively impressive this season 👏 — Irfan Pathan (@IrfanPathan) May 13, 2023 Such a coming of age knock that from Prabhsimran – Everyone knows he’s got them big boy shots – But the few overs of keeping quiet, rotating strike and partnership building in the middle – Fabulous ! #PBKSvDC — Jatin Sapru (@jatinsapru) May 13, 2023 It probably won’t be wrong to say that this is the best century of IPL 2023. Sensational knock By Prabhsimran Singh 👀👏👏👏👏 — ` Frustrated CSKian (@kurkureter) May 13, 2023 We have seen Prabhsimran Singh do well in fc cricket. But he needed that one defining innings in the IPL. Today he has done that on the big stage. He has the talent to play for India somewhere in the future. Or feels that way. — Bharath Ramaraj (@Fancricket12) May 13, 2023 It was the second ton in as many days in the IPL, with Suryakumar Yadav having struck an unbeaten 103 off 49 balls against the Gujarat Titans in Mumbai on Friday. Prabhsimran however, would depart shortly after bringing up his century as he would end up getting bowled by a low full toss from Mukesh Kumar that was almost a yorker, departing for a 65-ball 103. His contribution with the bat would help turn the tide in favour of Punjab, who ended up posting a competitive 167 on a tricky Delhi pitch. Left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar would then grab 4/30 as the Delhi Capitals crumbled like a house of cards after a solid 69-run opening stand between skipper David Warner and Phil Salt, getting restricted to 136/8 and bowing out of the playoffs race with their eighth defeat in 12 games.

China has won 283 Olympic gold medals, which is 273 more than India. China’s capital has hosted the Olympics twice: the Summer Games in 2008 and the India has hosted the Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games but hasn’t yet staged the Olympics—although there’s the promise of an Indian bid for 2036. “China has been successful on the tracks and fields of the world, India hasn’t,” Simon Chadwick, professor of sport and geopolitical economy at the SKEMA Business School in France, told The Associated Press. “India has underperformed.” Except in cricket. India’s overwhelming sporting suc cess has been the development of the Indian Premier League, the world’s richest and most dominant franchise cricket competition. And with that, India has created something China hasn’t been able to achieve: a domestic league that is lucrative as well as internationally successful. China’s big plans to become a soccer powerhouse started with billions of dollars being spent on famous players and coaches from around the world, generating global headlines for the Chinese Super League for a decade until an economic downturn and then the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything. Troubles in the property sector—particularly painful as more than half of the Chinese league’s top-tier teams were owned by real estate companies—put an end to hopes that the league would rival the biggest in the world. Instead, ambitions of the league being a launching pad for international success for China and its national team have been replaced by and the . Meanwhile the brand value of the India’s Twenty20 cricket tournament, established in 2008, grew to an estimated $8.4 billion in 2022. The IPL last year sold its five-year broadcasting rights for $6.02 billion, making it in terms of revenue per game, behind the NFL but above English soccer’s Premier League. “India is home to one of the most powerful sports properties in the world,” Chadwick said. “Which shows that the country has the resources and the expertise to successfully engage with sport.” Arunava Chaudhuri, a sports consultant and former All India Football Federation media manager, said that needs to extend beyond cricket. “The key is that India moves away from a one-sport country,” he said. “Success in badminton, wrestling, boxing has shown progress, but team sports are a different challenge.” Then there’s that talk of India bidding for the with Chaudhuri saying the city of Ahmedabad “is being prepared for that.” India’s Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur told the Times of India newspaper in December that the government would support an Olympic bid and it would be prepared in time for important IOC meetings in Mumbai, which are being held in October. “If India is putting in so much effort to promote sports, I can assure you that we will not only host the Olympics, we will host it in a big way,” Thakur told the newspaper. “This is the right time to host the Games. If India is making news in every sector from manufacturing to services, then why not in sports?” Indian states such as Gujarat, home to the 132,000-seat Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, and Odisha have taken the lead. Dubbed as ‘India’s Sporting Capital’, Odisha state has invested more than $250 million to build stadiums for field hockey, tennis, badminton and aquatics. The Odishan city of Bhubaneswar hosted the field hockey World Cup in January and was one of six soccer venues for the women’s Under-17 World Cup last October. “India is developing fast and might have an ambition to showcase its achievements through sports,” Ivanhoe Li, CEO of Beijing-based sports marketing company Fangze Sports, said. “Hosting a world-class event is not difficult but having great athletic performances might be a question.” The UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs declared in April that . It brought a lot of optimism in India, but China remains well established to pick up where it left off in 2020 sports. China’s sports industry was hit by three years of stringent Covid-19 policies and a series of strict lockdowns which only ended in December, forcing a 12-month postponement of the 2022 Asian Games and Beijing relinquishing hosting rights for soccer’s 2023 Asian Cup. That’s something the Chinese want to put in the past. The country is ready to get back into the business of sports and the government has projected that the value of the sports industry would reach around $725 billion by 2025, a rise from $434 billion in 2021. Li, the sports marketing expert, is optimistic about the future, fueled by a boom in the country after three years when hundreds of millions of people had to curb discretionary spending. “Chinese people have a lot of money in the bank and the sports industry is picking up at an unexpected speed,” Li told AP. “The government is encouraging consumption in all sectors and while people are cautious of spending on property and automobiles, they are spending more on food, travel, health and sports.” With a growing population, economy and political influence, India’s sports industry is making strides—but still has some way to go to come close to China.","pubDate":"2023-05-13 16:08:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"businessmirror","category":["sports"],"country":["philippines"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Date, Time, Venue, Head-To-Head, Pitch Report, Dream11 Prediction, Probable Playing 11 And Squads","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/date-time-venue-head-to-head-pitch-report-dream11-prediction-probable-playing-11-and-squads/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=date-time-venue-head-to-head-pitch-report-dream11-prediction-probable-playing-11-and-squads","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Chennai vs Kolkata Dream11 Team Prediction IPL 2023, Match 61: CSK vs KKR Top Picks, Fantasy Tips, Captain, Playing 11s Today’s Match, M.

The Bollywood actor and wicket keeper-batsman’s rapport is always making headlines at entertainment tabloids and portals. However, the crazy fandom seems to be divided when it comes to support for their favourite celebs. Recently a fan’s selfie video went viral where he mispronounced Urvashi’s name while joking with his friends. The reel might have been in good humour, but it seems to be not going down too well with the Agent actor. She took to her Instagram handle and reposted the video. Urvashi captioned her post as “STOP BUTCHERING MY LAST NAME WHICH IS SO PRECIOUS TO ME 😡 😡 😡 WORDS HAVE MEANING & SURNAMES HAVE POWER & BLESSINGS #IDontLikeIt #notfunny ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ #love #UrvashiRautela #UR1 #reels #reelsinstagram #reelkarofeelkaro #reel #reelsindia #actor #dance #girl #instagood #trending #India #instagram #india.” In the viral clip from the DC vs SRH IPL match, a fan was seen showing support for Rishabh Pant and saying that he won’t spare Urvashi Rautela amid their link-up rumors. The person was seen mispronouncing the actor’s name as ‘Ratola’ instead of Rautela. For the unversed, Rishabh is not a part of IPL 2023 as he is currently recovering from his injuries caused due to a road accident. He was soon rushed to the hospital after suffering several injuries including a knee ligament tear.
