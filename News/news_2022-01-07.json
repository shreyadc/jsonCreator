The rain has been a continuous spoilsport in the 4th test on all three days so far. Australia declared their first innings for 416 runs, where Usman Khawaja scored a brilliant century. Steve Smith also scored an important knock of 67 runs. Stuart Broad took a five-wicket haul for the English side. The English top-order again fell like a pack of cards. Starc bowled out Hameed, whereas Boland took wickets of Joe Root and Zak Crawley in quick succession. Cameron Green then took the wicket of Dawid Malan. But then, Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow started to stabilize the side. Ashes 2021-22: Ben Stokes wicket However, the most dramatic moment of the game came on the 1st ball of the 31st over. Ben Stokes shouldered arms on Green’s delivery, but it nip back in. Umpire gave him out, but Ben Stokes was quick in reviewing it. Although the reviews surprised everyone, the ball took a deflection, but it was not from the pads of Ben Stokes. The ball hit the off-stump of Stokes, but the bails didn’t fall off. Ben Stokes was absolutely thrilled after the replays and the Australians were dejected.

Shane Warne said in commentary for Fox Cricket that he had “never seen anything quite like that”. “What‘s he given it out on? How bizarre was that?” Warne said. “Paul Reiffel was a bowler and he‘s seen it hit the stumps and said, ’you’re out’. “That‘s one of the most bizarre things I’ve seen given out, for the ball hitting the stumps and the bails didn’t come off ... I‘m sorry, I’m still in shock. I’m still not sure what we just saw.” England lose 3 for NOTHING before lunch | 01:07 Warne was also confused as to why the Australians appealed, with the only logical explanation being that the team thought Stokes hit it, although his bat was miles away from the ball. Adam Gilchrist said: “It was extraordinary to see the ball hit the stumps without the bails dropping off. “And then what transpired after that was mind boggling.” Gilchrist then revealed on Fox Cricket that the fourth umpire had spoken to the SCG groundstaff on Thursday night, instructing them to make the stumps’ base firmer. “We’ve been told the fourth official spoke with groundstaff here yesterday I think after play and said, the stumps are too loose, ‘can you please firm up the base?’ “They put some soil or mud in there to firm it up and stabilise the base of the stumps. They might have put some cement in there.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"Women’s Ashes: Players who contract Covid will not travel to ICC Women’s ODI World Cup 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-womens-ashes-players-who-contract-covid-will-not-travel-to-icc-womens-odi-world-cup-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","Australia vs England","ICC Women's ODI World Cup 2022","Womens Ashes"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"ICC Women’s ODI World Cup 2022: Players who will contract Covid in the Women’s Ashes won’t be allowed to travel to New Zealand.

Australia and England Women’s cricket teams are entering their busiest period of the season. The Women’s Ashes series is set to start from 20 January 2022, whereas the World Cup just starts after it. However, the threat of Covid is all over the place. The Big Bash League is heavily impacted by the virus, and the same can happen in the Women’s Ashes too. Australia’s Covid-19 patients are increasing day by day, and there are several restrictions in place. However, chief selector Shawn Flegler has said that the players will get Covid even with all the regulations in place. “The way that we’re looking at it is we have to be prepared that there’ll be players who will miss games,” Flegler said. “The strength that we do have is we’ve got a number of players that could come in and take the place of someone who does have COVID.” “We need to keep in mind England as well. Their focus is on the Ashes but also on defending the World Cup title.” There are new dates for the women’s #Ashes series… Only two weeks until it all starts! pic.twitter.com/zGyJlMTZur — 7Cricket (@7Cricket) January 6, 2022 ICC Women’s ODI World Cup 2022 participation Australian and English players have been warned that the players who will get Covid won’t be allowed to travel to New Zealand. There are strict travel restrictions in New Zealand, and there is a mandatory quarantine period. If any of the players contract Covid, they can’t be on the flight. “It’s going to be tough,” Fogler said on the player’s travel if they get Covid positive. “Our plans are still that we’ll go as a group straight after the Ashes. If things do change and we can get players over later, then we’ll look to do that.” “But as we’ve seen over the last few weeks with the BBL and other competitions, it can be very difficult.” “We’re trying to minimise that and control it as much as we can, but I think we’ve got to expect that something may happen.” The Women’s Ashes will start from 20 January 2022 with 3 T20Is, followed by a test and three ODIs.   The post Women’s Ashes: Players who contract Covid will not travel to ICC Women’s ODI World Cup 2022 appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-07 03:49:12","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Former opener Haynes appointed Windies lead selector","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/former-opener-haynes-appointed-windies-lead-selector/article38163053.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Reuters"],"video_url":null,"description":"The 65-year-old Barbadian will lead the selection panel until June 30, 2024, a period that includes two T20 World Cups, the 2023 Cricket World Cup and World Test Championship Final.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-07 03:21:06","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar"},{"title":"“Too friendly for my mine”: Shane Warne slams players for being “too-friendly” in Ashes 2021-22","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/too-friendly-for-my-mine-shane-warne-slams-players-for-being-too-friendly-in-ashes-2021-22/","keywords":["Cricket","Ashes 2021-22","Shane Warne","The Ashes"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ashes 2021-22: Shane Warne has blasted the Ashes players for being too friendly and believes the English team has not been aggressive.

England have been absolutely dejected in the Ashes 2021-22 so far. They have lost the Ashes in just 13 days of play of the first three tests. Even in the 4th test, they have been put to dust by the Australian side. Australia posted a commanding score in the first innings, whereas the Aussie bowlers have ripped apart England’s top-order. Usman Khawaja scored a brilliant century for Australia, whereas Boland has continued his form with the ball. There are still 24 points left in the WTC to grab for in the series. However, despite the poor performance of England, there has been a lot of friendly chat between English and Aussie players. Aussie legend Shane Warne has criticized the players on that aspect. Ashes 2021-22: Shane Warne blasts players for being “too friendly” While commentating for Fox Cricket, Shane Warne criticized this too-friendly behavior between the sides. He believes that the English side is lacking that competitive spirit. “The relationship between the two teams has been quite amicable, hasn’t it,” Adam Gilchrist said. “Too friendly for my mine,” Warne said to Gilchrist. “When I say too friendly, let me clarify that – I think the series is played in great spirit and we want to see that camaraderie, I think back to 2005 Ashes, the spirit between both sides was outstanding and the skill on display captured the imagination of all the public, everywhere around the world.” “We don’t need a big full on chat every morning where every player is talking to every player.” Seeeeeeeeed! Scott Boland bowls Zak Crawley with a peach! #Ashes pic.twitter.com/ydpK0ksYAx — cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) January 7, 2022 Warne said that it becomes tough to go aggressive on someone when you are friendly with them. According to Warne, the English side is lacking that killer instinct in their approach. “I don’t think England have been aggressive enough, I’d like them to get in the face of Australia a bit more and come out a bit harder,” Warne said. “When you’re friendly with someone it’s pretty hard when you’ve got the ball in your hand down the other end to think ‘Oh he’s not a bad bloke this bloke’.” “I wanted the batsmen to hate me, I wanted them to absolutely hate me and smash me out of the park because then I had an edge.”   The post “Too friendly for my mine”: Shane Warne slams players for being “too-friendly” in Ashes 2021-22 appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-07 03:07:08","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"England lose 3 for NOTHING before lunch","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/england-lose-3-for-nothing-before-lunch/video/4064f67103cab0e0f50e1162dc4db2c8","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: England have endured another tough session with the bat, losing 3-0 before the lunch break on Day 3, with Scott Boland again proving to be a headache for the visitors.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-07 03:04:09","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost"},{"title":"England lose 3 for NOTHING before lunch","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/england-lose-3-for-nothing-before-lunch/video/4064f67103cab0e0f50e1162dc4db2c8","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: England have endured another tough session with the bat, losing 3-0 before the lunch break on Day 3, with Scott Boland again proving to be a headache for the visitors.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-07 03:04:09","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"The Ashes: Scott Boland’s fairytale Test start continues at the SCG as bowler takes 2-0","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/the-ashes-scott-bolands-fairytale-test-start-continues-at-the-scg-as-bowler-takes-2-0--c-5216486","keywords":null,"creator":["Jordan McArdle"],"video_url":null,"description":"Scott Boland has continued his fairytale start to Test cricket with another remarkable bowling performance.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-07 02:46:37","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5216486/d6287edb23f5a6304deb20106d6584499eb8ee69-16x9-x946y87w1389h781.jpg","source_id":"perthnow"},{"title":"Australia vs England, 4th Ashes Test, Day 3 Live Score Updates: England Four Down, Australia In Cont.. - NDTVSports.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL3RoZS1hc2hlcy0yMDIxLTIyL2F1c3RyYWxpYS12cy1lbmdsYW5kLTR0aC1hc2hlcy10ZXN0LWRheS0zLWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtdXBkYXRlcy0yNjkzNjkw0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vdGhlLWFzaGVzLTIwMjEtMjIvYXVzdHJhbGlhLXZzLWVuZ2xhbmQtNHRoLWFzaGVzLXRlc3QtZGF5LTMtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLTI2OTM2OTAvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia vs England, 4th Ashes Test, Day 3 Live Score Updates: England Four Down, Australia In Cont..  NDTVSports.comBroad stands up, takes eighth Ashes five-for | Men's Ashes 2021-22  cricket.com.auBroad laments England's Ashes batting woes  Bega District NewsAshes 2021-22: Love It When Stuart Broad And I Are Against Each Other;

Jayden Seales is one of the most promising pacers of the West Indies. He made his test debut last year at the young age of 19 years. Seales has been decent with the red-ball so far with 16 wickets in four games. However, in terms of white-ball, he has just played three List-A games. If all goes right, he will make his ODI debut for West Indies against Ireland. Despite playing a very few List-A games, he has proved his class with the white-ball too. In the recent LPL, he was a part of the title-winning Jaffna Kings side. He was impressive in the tournament with 15 wickets and was the 2nd highest wicket-taker. In the tournament which was dominated by the spinners, Seales emerged as the best pacer of the tournament. Jayden Seales credits the mentorship of Wahab Riaz and Suranga Lakmal in LPL In a virtual press conference before the Ireland game, Seales has hailed the experience of playing in an overseas T20 league. He has credited the mentorship of Wahab Riaz and Suranga Lakmal in his improvement. “I hung around a lot with Suranga Lakmal and Wahab Riaz,” Seales said. “They would kind of mentor me in terms of my death bowling. I think that was the biggest struggle for me in the tournament, bowling my yorkers and things like that.” “Being around those guys gave me a bit more confidence in my death bowling and helped me throughout the tournament.” Young Jayden Seales tops the list for the youngest WI pacer to a maiden 5-wicket haul! #WIvPAK #MenInMaroon pic.twitter.com/OHjfs1g8sj — Windies Cricket (@windiescricket) August 15, 2021 Jayden Seales is also in the reserves list for England’s T20I series as well. He insists that he is under the pressure of performing well due to a quick rise in the pecking order. “I think I’ve been under pressure for the majority of the time in my career thus far, seeing as I’m a youngster and I’ve been performing,” Seales said. “Now the media and everyone will look at me [and say] he has to perform, or if he doesn’t perform, the talk might come up ‘he’s too young’.
