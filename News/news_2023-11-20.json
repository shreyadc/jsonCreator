A heavily pro-Indian crowd inside the 132,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium was silenced as Head combined with Marnus Labuschagne (58 not out ) in a 192-run partnership to chase down the target of 241. Australia was wobbling on 47-3 after seven overs but Head and Labuschagne dug in to help their country regain its status as the king of one-day international cricket, adding to its 50-over world titles in 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015. Head was dismissed off what proved to be the next-to-last ball of the match, caught in the deep while attempting to hit a title-clinching boundary. In came Glenn Maxwell and he ran two off his first ball, securing a victory that prompted fireworks above the world's largest cricket venue. The Indians won all 10 of their matches before the final and were seeking a third trophy in their fourth appearance in a title match that brought a country of 1.4 billion people to a virtual standstill. They were outplayed in every department by Australia, though, restricted to 240 all out on a slow pitch after losing the toss with only Virat Kohli (54) and Lokesh Rahul (66) making half-centuries. Head became only the seventh player to score a century in a men's World Cup final ‚Äì and third Australian after Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist ‚Äì and delivered a significant moment in India's innings when taking a diving catch running back from cover to remove captain Rohit Sharma (47). Head's ton saw him join an illustrious list, which also comprises West Indies' Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards, as well as Sri Lanka's Aravinda de Silva and Mahela Jayawardene. Ponting's 140 not out had also helped Australia beat India in the 2003 final. Jayawardene's century is the only one in a losing cause with India winning the 2011 final. Australia finished the 2023 tournament with a run of nine straight wins, after starting with back-to-back defeats to India and South Africa. India won the World Cup in 1983 and 2011.

Australia quietened the wild support from the 100 000-strong home crowd by dismissing their previously unbeaten opponents for 240 before Travis Head‚Äôs sensational century meant they romped to victory with seven overs to spare. After their bowlers expertly took advantage of a slow pitch, Australia were themselves reduced to 47-three as India hit back in an electric new-ball spell. But Head and Marnus Labuschagne calmly weathered the storm with a stand of 192 as Indian hope drifted away from the world‚Äôs largest cricket stadium. Head was caught for 132 from 120 balls with just two runs needed, but Glenn Maxwell flogged the winning runs a ball later while Labuschagne ended 58 not out from 110. The superb victory means Australia extend their record as the most successful side in 50-over World Cup history and now sit four titles clear of the rest of the pack.

A heavily pro-Indian crowd inside the 132,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium was silenced as Head combined with Marnus Labuschagne (58 not out ) in a 192-run partnership to chase down the target of 241. Australia was wobbling on 47-3 after seven overs but Head and Labuschagne dug in to help their country regain its status as the king of one-day international cricket, adding to its 50-over world titles in 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015. Head was dismissed off what proved to be the next-to-last ball of the match, caught in the deep while attempting to hit a title-clinching boundary. In came Glenn Maxwell and he ran two off his first ball, securing a victory that prompted fireworks above the world's largest cricket venue. The Indians won all 10 of their matches before the final and were seeking a third trophy in their fourth appearance in a title match that brought a country of 1.4 billion people to a virtual standstill. They were outplayed in every department by Australia, though, restricted to 240 all out on a slow pitch after losing the toss with only Virat Kohli (54) and Lokesh Rahul (66) making half-centuries. Head became only the seventh player to score a century in a men's World Cup final ‚Äì and third Australian after Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist ‚Äì and delivered a significant moment in India's innings when taking a diving catch running back from cover to remove captain Rohit Sharma (47). Head's ton saw him join an illustrious list, which also comprises West Indies' Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards, as well as Sri Lanka's Aravinda de Silva and Mahela Jayawardene. Ponting's 140 not out had also helped Australia beat India in the 2003 final. Jayawardene's century is the only one in a losing cause with India winning the 2011 final. Australia finished the 2023 tournament with a run of nine straight wins, after starting with back-to-back defeats to India and South Africa. India won the World Cup in 1983 and 2011.

A heavily partisan crowd inside the 132,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium was silenced as Head combined with Marnus Labuschagne (58 not out ) in a 192-run partnership to chase down the target of 241. #BREAKING : Host #India 's hope for winning the #CricketWorldCup Final at Modi Stadium is crushed after losing from #Australia , leaving 1.4 billion people feeling heartbroken. pic.twitter.com/LZIjkl2mQT ‚Äî South Asia Times (@SATimes_TV) November 19, 2023 Australia was wobbling on 47-3 after seven overs but Head and Labuschagne dug in to help their country regain its status as the king of one-day international cricket, adding to its 50-over world titles in 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015. Head was dismissed off what proved to be the next-to-last ball of the match, caught in the deep while attempting to hit a title-clinching boundary. In came Glenn Maxwell and he ran two off his first ball, securing a victory that prompted fireworks above the world‚Äôs largest cricket venue. The Indians won all 10 of their matches before the final and were seeking a third trophy in their fourth appearance in a title match that brought a country of 1.4 billion people to a virtual standstill. They were outplayed in every department by Australia, though, restricted to 240 all out on a slow pitch after losing the toss with only Virat Kohli (54) and Lokesh Rahul (66) making half-centuries. Head became only the seventh player to score a century in a men‚Äôs World Cup final ‚Äì and third Australian after Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist ‚Äì and delivered a significant moment in India‚Äôs innings when taking a diving catch running back from cover to remove captain Rohit Sharma (47). ‚ÄúWhat an amazing day, I‚Äôm just thrilled to be a part of it,‚Äù Head said afterward. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot better than sitting on the couch at home, I‚Äôm very lucky that everything went well and I was able to get back here.‚Äù Head had started the tournament sidelined by a broken left hand. ‚ÄúI was a little bit nervous, but Marnus played exceptional and it was just an amazing partnership. It‚Äôs nice to be a part of it, nice to play a role, and it‚Äôs going to be an amazing couple of days now,‚Äù Head said. ‚ÄúTo be able to do that on the big stage, in front of a big crowd, it‚Äôs pretty special and something that I‚Äôll be happy to look back on later in my life. It‚Äôs nice to be here and nice to contribute.‚Äù Head‚Äôs ton saw him join an illustrious list, which also comprises West Indies‚Äô Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards, as well as Sri Lanka‚Äôs Aravinda de Silva and Mahela Jayawardene.

Jayawardene‚Äôs century is the only one in a losing cause with India winning the 2011 final. Australia finished the 2023 tournament with a run of nine straight wins, after starting with back-to-back defeats to India and South Africa. India won the World Cup in 1983 and 2011.

Head scored a hundred, making 137 off 120, while Marnus Labuschagne remained unbeaten on 58 off 110, making sure he holds one end up while Head plays as the aggressor.

While India came into the final as favourites, winning all their ten matches in a row, Australia, on the other hand, lost their first two matches before winning nine matches in a row including the final to go emerge as the World Champions. The defeat was difficult to digest especially because India had dominated every other opposition on their way to the final including Australia who they beat in their very first game. However, at the final frontier they fell short. The result was a heartbreak not only for fans but also for the players with Mohammed Siraj seen crying inconsolably post Australia's victory.

Australia quietened the wild support from the 100 000-strong home crowd by dismissing their previously unbeaten opponents for 240 before Travis Head‚Äôs sensational century meant they romped to victory with seven overs to spare. After their bowlers expertly took advantage of a slow pitch, Australia were themselves reduced to 47-three as India hit back in an electric new-ball spell. But Head and Marnus Labuschagne calmly weathered the storm with a stand of 192 as Indian hope drifted away from the world‚Äôs largest cricket stadium. Head was caught for 132 from 120 balls with just two runs needed, but Glenn Maxwell flogged the winning runs a ball later while Labuschagne ended 58 not out from 110. The superb victory means Australia extend their record as the most successful side in 50-over World Cup history and now sit four titles clear of the rest of the pack. It also caps a six-month period in which they beat India to win the World Test Championship and retained the Ashes in England. India, meanwhile, were left crestfallen as their bid for a first white-ball title since 2011 ‚Äì an achievement which looked unstoppable as they made rampant progress through the semi-final and group stage ‚Äì fell at the final hurdle. Summarised scores: India 240 all out in 50 overs: (KL Rahul 66, Virat Kohli 54; Mitchell Starc 3-55). Australia 241-4 in 43 overs (Travis Head 13, Marnus Labuschagne 58).

Australia arrived in Ahmedabad as underdogs, with the home side boasting a perfect record of 10 wins en route to the final, a monster crowd of over 110,000 roaring them on and familiar conditions. They even had the tournament‚Äôs top-scorer in and leading wicket-taker in Mohammed Shami, but to stand tall in knockout cricket. Travis Head took the starring role with a brilliant 137, making light work of India‚Äôs under-powered 240 all out, as a six-wicket win made his country six-time champions. It also capped a great year for Australia across red and white-ball cricket, having also pipped India to the World Test Championship crown in June and retained the Ashes with a 2-2 draw on English soil. Reflecting on a stunning sequence of results for his side, Cummins said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy. This year will be a year we remember for a long, long time. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been awesome. We‚Äôve pretty much spent the whole Australian winter away playing overseas but we‚Äôve had a lot of success and this pips it all. Top of the mountain. We saved our best for last. ‚ÄúThe passion in India is unrivalled around the world. Every single person here was wearing that blue shirt and whatever the result we were never going to forget a day like today.‚Äù Cummins had a fine day at the office. He made the bold and inspired decision to send a power-packed Indian batting line-up in after winning the toss and then produced a superb, boundary-less 10-over spell that included the key wicket of player-of-the-tournament Virat Kohli. But he was happy to give Head his moment in the limelight, as well as sharing with some of the backroom boys who helped him reach the final after he suffered a broken left hand. He was not fit until their fifth match of the tournament and was not even in India when Australia lost their first two group games. ‚ÄúTrav does what he does. He‚Äôs really brave, he takes the game on, puts pressure on bowlers and to do it on the biggest stage showed huge character,‚Äù Cummins said. ‚ÄúIt was amazing. We couldn‚Äôt be happier for Trav, he‚Äôs a legend and we love him‚Ä¶ how fun is he to watch? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also on the unheralded few, the selectors that backed him in even when he had a broken hand and the medical team to get him back out there. It was a big risk that we took and it paid off.‚Äù Head was struggling to take in the scale of his achievement, with each of his four sixes and 15 fours stamping down the hopes of the hordes of over a billion Indians. He had earlier taken a cracking over-the-shoulder catch to remove India skipper in full flow. ‚ÄúNot in a million years (could I have imagined this)‚Ä¶ what an amazing day. I‚Äôm thrilled to be part of it,‚Äù he told Sky Sports. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot better than sitting on the couch at home (injured). I was very lucky to get back here. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt imagine getting a hundred, I couldn‚Äôt imagine holding on to that catch‚Ä¶ but you want to help your team-mates and contribute so to do that on a big stage in front of a full house, under all that pressure, is something I‚Äôll be able to look back on all my life.‚Äù Home skipper Rohit, who had dreamed of delivering his country‚Äôs first global trophy in 12 years amid stifling expectation, cut a hollow figure at the close. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt our day, we tried everything but it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe know that we were not good enough today but I‚Äôm really proud of how we‚Äôve played from game one. ‚ÄúWe kept losing wickets and couldn‚Äôt stitch up a big partnership, which is exactly what Australia did. Credit to Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne, they stitched a big partnership and put us completely out of the game.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-11-19 17:38:18","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/19/17/19-e350d4cb1e39401bbd0e961b1c190965.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","source_priority":290,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
