Jayawardena is the consultant coach of the national team and was flown in on Wednesday to share his expertise with the squad in a bid to make an impact on cricket’s biggest stage. Although only those present at the meeting were privy to the details, it was obvious that the former batting great was trying to motivate his players to bear greater responsibility in batting-friendly Indian conditions and, thus, help withstand the upcoming South African challenge. Jayawardena has played in two consecutive World Cup finals (2007 and 2011) and his wealth of experience as a player, skipper and coach will help Sri Lanka’s search for a winning start to the 13th edition of the World Cup. Sri Lanka will play South Africa in their opening game—the first of the nine first-round matches scheduled for the 1996 champions—at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi, a superb cricketing facility. Sri Lankan cricketers have understood how important the batter’s role is in this year’s World Cup where pitches and shorter boundaries are expected to help them. “The batters have a significant role to play here if we are to win matches and challenge the top teams competing at this year’s World Cup,” Mendis said, after sweating out in the nets. “If we can put up a score of 300-320, I think the bowlers can challenge them. Each batter has a job to do and if they can do that well, we will be better equipped to beat the South African side,” Mendis said, ruing the absence of Wanindu Hasaranga. Sri Lanka forfeited Hasaranga owing to injury and it’s a gap hard to fill. “If not, it won’t be easy for the bowlers to defend a total in these wickets. Bowlers will be greatly challenged in these conditions. What they should do is to do the basics, bowling at the right length and line”. Sri Lanka’s batting has been exposed every now and then. For instance, during the Asia Cup final Sri Lanka was blown off for 50 runs as India cruised to a 10-wicket win. But Mendis says the conditions in India are different to what they’ve been playing in the recent past. “Yes, we have struggled in Sri Lanka. Not only us but even India and Pakistan struggled in those slow-turning wickets. But on a good batting wicket in Lahore, we scored runs. The conditions here are similar to that of Pakistan and I am very much confident that our batters will flourish,” Mendis added. Despite his failure in the final, Mendis has been Sri Lanka’s best batter at the Asia Cup scoring 270 runs off six innings and playing a majestic innings against Afghanistan in the warm-up. The players were in the nets for about two hours to fine-tune areas that needed attention. Skipper Dasun Shanaka and Kusal Janith Perera, also under injury clouds, flexed their muscles at the nets. Mendis expects both players to make the playing XI along with spinner Maheesh Theekshana, who joined the team on Wednesday. Shanaka has an elbow injury while Perera has shoulder pain.“They have recovered and were training today. Hopefully, they will be fit to go on Saturday,” he said.

After a months long investigation, the MCC sent a letter to its members to confirm the had been punished. One was expelled from the club entirely, a second received a four-and-a-half year suspension while the third was suspended for 30 months for participating in “abusive, offensive or inappropriate behaviour or language”. “The actions of the three individuals in the Pavilion on the day in question fell well below the behaviour expected from our Members,” the MCC said in a statement. “The penalties set out above are the consequences of breaching the Club's Code of Conduct.” Following the Bairstow stumping, the entire Lord’s ground was furious but the behaviour of the members in the the Long Room to the changeroom was unprecedented. The usually civil MCC members have the unique privilege of rubbing shoulders with the players as they walk through the pavilion to the changerooms but were caught hissing and yelling “cheat” and “shame” when they exited the field for the lunch break. Opening batters Usman Khawaja and David Warner stopped in their tracks to point out some of the members shouting abuse to security. Speaking months after the incident, Khawaja said he had “The MCC is the most like oh ‘hear, hear’, they’ll clap you if you get a duck and they’ll clap you if you get a hundred they don’t care they’ll just clap,” Khawaja told The Late Show with Matty Johns’ Fletch and Hindy. “It kind of took us off guard because when we were coming in there these guys were like a pack of dogs you know ‘rar, rar, rar’. “Literally one of them was frothing at his mouth.” MCC chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown released a new set of protocols for members in the aftermath of the incident. The changes included expanding the roped off area where players walk through on their way in between the field and changerooms and stopping members from using the stairwell when players are making their way up or down. Cricket Australia immediately demanded a please explain after the incident and said it was “appreciative” of the punishments handed down. “We are appreciative of the support of the team by the MCC at the time and these subsequent sanctions,” a CA spokesperson said. “We trust this brings the matter to a close and there will be no repeat of the behaviour in future.”","pubDate":"2023-10-05 21:43:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"skynewsau","source_priority":13361,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a6df7e893127424e9eb72ba649ad97ea","title":"PAUL NEWMAN: The swathes of empty seats for England's World Cup opener in Ahmedabad was EMBARRASSING for cricket... it was the latest example of governing bodies failing to give any thought to paying spectators","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12598709/England-World-Cup-Ahmedabad-cricket.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PAUL NEWMAN: The Board of Control for Cricket in India are so rich and powerful because of their broadcasting billions that they rarely seem to give any thought to paying spectators.","content":"PAUL NEWMAN: The swathes of empty seats for England's World Cup opener in Ahmedabad was EMBARRASSING for cricket... it was the latest example of governing bodies failing to give any thought to paying spectators New Zealand hammered England in the opening game of the Cricket World Cup The match was at the Narendra Modi Stadium which has a capacity of 132,000 Despite a crowd of 47,000, the empty stands were embarrassing for cricket By Paul Newman for MailOnline Published: 12:19 EDT, 5 October 2023 | Updated: 17:34 EDT, 5 October 2023 e-mail 97 shares 32 View comments It was such a bad look. For cricket, for the beleaguered 50-over format and for a World Cup that should still be the biggest showcase event for the white-ball game. The empty stands at the vast Narendra Modi Stadium when England and New Zealand opened the 13th edition of a tournament that is threatened like never before from the march of the franchises were little short of an embarrassment. Yes, the biggest cricket ground in the world holds 132,000 and even a half decent crowd - like yesterday’s became if the ICC are right in claiming there were 47,000 spectators by the time New Zealand batted - would seem tiny in such a stadium. But casual TV spectators who tuned in yesterday morning at the promise of a significant event would have instead been given the impression of a sport, or at least a traditional limited-overs format, in serious decline. There are, of course, mitigating circumstances and they can be laid firmly at the door of the governing body who so often appear to abuse the privilege of representing the biggest and most cricket mad country in the world. The swathes of empty seats for England's World Cup opener against New Zealand at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad was embarrassing for cricket The mammoth ground has a capacity of 132,000 and therefore the 47,000 crowd looked tiny The Board of Control for Cricket in India are so rich and powerful because of their broadcasting billions that they rarely seem to give any thought to paying spectators. And Thursday's grand opening of a tournament that they, and not the ICC, have organised seemed to plumb their attitude to new depths. The venues and dates for World Cup matches have repeatedly changed over the last few months, making it hard enough for locals to plan their day at the cricket let alone the thousands of overseas supporters who would have been put off by the uncertainty. Tickets, meanwhile, only went on sale 41 days ago and they have been devilishly hard to get, as is India’s wont, with regular reports of the website crashing. The venues and dates for World Cup games have repeatedly changed over the last few months, making it hard enough for locals to plan their day at the cricket let alone the overseas fans New Zealand beat England after Rachin Ravindra (left) and Devon Conway (right) scored tons Those present in Ahmedabad say there has been little local effort at marketing the tournament and instead any visible cricketing promotion has instead been concentrated on the next Indian Premier League tournament that doesn’t start until late March. Most of all, it makes no sense for India not to feature in the opening game, as they did the last time the World Cup was staged in the country in 2011, even if the rematch of the classic 2019 final should have been enough to draw a big festival crowd. It is all very well the BCCI being indifferent to the point of arrogance towards crowds in their stadiums because they do not need the money. But full houses and atmosphere should be the lifeblood of any big sporting event. Instead, as has always seemed to be the case since I started covering England’s visits to India in 2008, fans wanting to be there for this tournament have been treated with little more than contempt.

After winning the gold medal in the 800m event, 50 minutes later she won the bronze medal with the women’s 400m relay team, a new Sri Lankan record. After winning this gold medal, Tharushi became the number one athlete in the 800m event according to the latest rankings of senior and junior Asian athletes released by the Asian Athletics Association yesterday. The association organizes at least three major athletic tournaments in Asia in a year, namely the Asian Games, Asian Senior Athletics Championship and Asian Junior (Under 20) Athletics Championship. Tharushi managed to win the gold medal in the 800m event in all three tournaments, and she became the first Asian player to achieve such a feat. Meanwhile, Olympic Committee General Secretary Maxwell de Silva said that in order to improve Tharushi’s ability at the international level, they will provide a foreign scholarship with the assistance of the National Olympic Committee and Former Olympic medalist S.L.B. Rosa. Accordingly, he said that in the future, Tharushi’s training will take place in America, but for that, she must complete her education in this country. Tharushi, a student of Walala A Ratnayake College, is going to sit for the General Certificate of Education Advanced level examination this year. The athletic events of the Asian Games, which are being held in Hangzhou, China, ended yesterday, and the Sri Lankan ended up by winning a gold medal, a silver medal and two bronze medals. At this year’s Games, 21 countries have won medals in athletics, of which Sri Lanka won eighth place. The first place went to China with 39 medals (19 gold, 11 silver and 9 bronze), followed by Bahrain (16) and India (29). Bahrain won 10 gold, 1 silver and 16 bronze medals, while India won 6 gold, 14 silver and 9 bronze medals. In addition to athletics, Sri Lanka also won the silver medal in women’s cricket, thus the total number of medals won at this year’s Games is 5. It is significant that in the history of the Asian Games, Sri Lanka won 5 or more medals after 21 years. Sri Lanka had last won 6 medals in 2002 as two gold, one silver and three bronze. Karate Meanwhile, Heshani Hettiarachchi, who joined the first round of the women’s singles karate event representing Sri Lanka yesterday, had to withdraw from the first round. Eight players participated in that competition, and Keshani who got 34.30 points finished last. There is only one more representation left for Sri Lanka in this Games, and that is Dineth Avihinsa, who will enter the competition in the Karate Committee’s 67 kg weight class. He will compete tomorrow (7). Wrestling Yesterday, Nethmi Ahimsa entered the competition field in the 53 kg freestyle event and lost to Kazakhstan player Zedneva Marina. Here, the Kazakhstani player got 5 points while Nethmi got 4 points. Medals Tally At the end of yesterday’s athletic events, China, who is in the lead in the medal table, had won 177 golds, Japan had won 40 golds in second place, South Korea had won 33 golds and India had won 21 golds. Sri Lanka, which won 5 medals, was ranked 25th on the list.","pubDate":"2023-10-05 19:40:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailynews","source_priority":375855,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"f6d34cbfc64ddc853c222bb3880dfd0e","title":"Bard manners: Why would Laurie Daley’s lips touch this poison chalice?","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/nrl/bard-manners-why-would-laurie-daley-s-lips-touch-this-poison-chalice-20231005-p5e9w6.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":["Sport / NRL"],"creator":["Andrew Webster"],"video_url":null,"description":"The former Blues coach is the last man standing for the NSWRL, but his return already feels like a Shakespearean tragedy in the making.","content":"Let’s defer to the words of former rugby league roundsman William Shakespeare to capture the plight of the NSWRL as it fumbles around in the dark searching for a State of Origin coach. But in these cases We still have judgement here, that we but teach Bloody instructions which, being taught, return To plague th’inventor. This even-handed justice Commends th’ingredience of our poisoned chalice To our own lips. Bang on, Billy. Nailed it again. Who indeed would want to drink from the infected schooner glass of the NSW coach? It seems Laurie Daley or Macbeth are the only viable high-powered options standing at the bar. Former Blues coach Laurie Daley was a bit of a rugby league nerd even in his playing days. Credit: SMH The thought of Daley potentially returning next year to “right the wrongs” that led to his sacking - and Brad Fittler ’s appointment - in 2017 provides a nice enough storyline. After conjuring a series victory against Queensland in 2014 with a manifestly inferior team, Daley lost three consecutive series, had his contract extended by NSWRL chief executive David Trodden , then had it ripped up by a board who knew change was needed. Back then, Daley was coaching against a team featuring players such as Billy Slater and Cameron Smith . If he returns, he’ll be duelling with them again, although this time as coaches. Daley wants to do whatever he can to help the Blues, such is the quality of the man. When Fittler approached him recently about joining his staff, Daley agreed without really knowing what Fittler had in mind. After six years of poring his heart and soul into the job with mixed success, Fittler walked away after being dumped squarely on his bottom by NSWRL powerbrokers. They wanted him to clean out his coaching staff, which he did. He wanted a two-year extension, but they wanted one year, to which he eventually agreed. Then they told him, out of nowhere, the job was being reduced to a part-time role for a reduced amount of money, so he walked. NSWRL chairman Paul Conlon has been jabbering for months about how poorly Fittler has been treated by the Sydney media following back-to-back series losses, accusing reporters of having an “agenda” against him. I suspect few have hurt Fittler more than the NSWRL, which had his back right up until the moment when it didn’t. The comical last line of last week’s media release announcing Fittler’s departure says it all: “The NSWRL board will now invite expressions of interest from coaches to be involved in the State of Origin program in 2024.” It might have to advertise on Seek.com given how many potential replacements have run for the hills. The edict about not picking club coaches has been abandoned, throwing open the door for the likes of Ricky Stuart , Craig Bellamy and Ivan Cleary . Yet none of them are prepared to take on the job, which is understandable because of the time and energy required of both roles. That leaves Daley as the last man standing. He recently extended his deal to co-host the Big Sports Breakfast on Sky Sports Radio for a further two years. The NRL stopped him from working as a consultant at Manly late last year because the network is owned by the TAB, a wagering operator. But Daley would be employed by the NSWRL and not the NRL. The question, though, is why would he want to do it? Why drink from the poisoned chalice that has spooked so many of his contemporaries? Coaching the Blues for the next few years, against the likes of Slater and Smith coaching the likes of Cameron Munster, Reece Walsh and Kalyn Ponga , already feels like a Shakespearean tragedy in the making. But Daley conjured miracles in 2014 and could do it again in this second coming. Now, that would be something to write about. Exactly how much did the NBL’s billionaire owner Larry Kestleman pay for retired Chicago Bulls star Scottie Pippen to preach the gospel of basketball in Australia last weekend? Reports a few weeks ago put the number as high as $1.2 million, a figure the NBL denies, but various sources, who did not want to be named because the matter is confidential, have confirmed it cost $700,000 to secure the six-time NBA champion as an official ambassador. Not bad for a handful of appearances over five days, including the AFL and NRL grand finals, while partying with former Bulls teammate Luc Longley . The NBL identified more than a year ago that it needed to think outside the square to promote its opening round on a weekend dominated by the big dances of the two major football codes. Wearing a shirt sporting the NBL logo, Pippen was interviewed before the AFL grand final and halftime in the NRL decider. Pippen and Longley courtside for the NBL season-opener between Melbourne United and South East Melbourne Phoenix. Credit: Getty Images “Two great events,” Pippen told Joel Caine in a podcast for SEN Radio. “If I had to pick one, I’d say the AFL. It was a little more exciting; something I felt I could’ve played if I had started playing it younger.” Pippen also did the obligatory spin around Sydney Harbour on a luxury yacht on Monday, sipping straight vodkas while pressing the flesh with select media and VIP guests. The idea to recruit Pippen was a resounding success: there was a 40 per cent increase in TV audience compared to last year and record crowd attendance. It’s a proactive step from a proactive league that wants to make the most of this country’s booming interest in basketball, aided by a steady flow of talent to the NBA via the NBL. Pippen will return in February to promote the league, although he might need to freshen up on its name. “It’s great to be hanging out in his country promoting the NBDL [sic],” he told Caine, who replied: “It’s OK. It’s day five.” When all else fails, there’s delusion. How else to explain Rugby Australia’s response to news that Wallabies coach Eddie Jones has been Zooming with the enemy? RA’s response to reports in this masthead about Jones speaking to Japanese rugby was to offer Roosters back-rower Angus Crichton a two-year deal before withdrawing it just days later following a backlash from the broader rugby community. The Roosters reject claims they need Crichton to depart because of salary-cap pressure, although he doesn’t seem to be a big part of their plans from next year. As for suggestions Joseph Suaalii might backflip on his mega-deal struck earlier this year, the Roosters would entertain the idea but retaining him at market value under the salary cap would be tricky because the bulk of his $5 million deal with rugby is covered in third-party agreements. Your humble columnist’s piece earlier in the week about athletes such as Broncos star Reece Walsh being unfairly targeted by young fans wielding mobile phone cameras prompted a range of reader responses — including some who thought I actually wanted him sanctioned for wearing Pit Viper sunglasses, which is wildly incorrect. Certainly, younger fans are feeling more emboldened than ever before to tell their football heroes what they think of them — or what their parents think. Last week, South Sydney fullback Latrell Mitchell was at Heffron Park when he approached a young fan who was watching from the sidelines. “I don’t want to shake your hand because Dad reckons you’re the reason we lose games,” the boy, who looked about six, told him. Kids these days.

It’s a big weekend for … the Wallabies, who need Portugal to beat Fiji by eight points or more to avoid being the first Australian side to bomb out of the Rugby World Cup in the pool stage. Maybe this has been Eddie’s genius plan all along. It’s an even bigger weekend for … the Australian cricket team, who start their ODI World Cup campaign on Sunday night against host nations India at the MA Chidambaram stadium in Chennai.

Rachin Ravindra (123 not out) and Devon Conway (152 not out) were the stars of the day for the Back Caps. In response to England’s 282/9, New Zealand crossed the target in merely 36.2 overs to make a great start to the tournament. New Zealand lost Will Young to a first-ball duck early on in their innings. However, this brought in Ravindra, who joined forces with Conway to light up the first Powerplay. The Black Caps hit 13 fours and two sixes in the first Powerplay. Both the sixes came from Ravindra’s bat, one against Mark Wood and the other against Moeen Ali. Having helped New Zealand to 81/1 in the first Powerplay, the duo didn’t relent and maintained the scoring rate closer to eight over the next few overs. They also achieved their personal landmarks of half-centuries in the 12th and 13th overs respectively. The scoring rate dropped a tad bit after the drinks break, but Conway and Ravindra got back into the groove soon after. Their unbeaten stand of 177 runs (at the 25-over mark) was already the highest partnership for two New Zealand batters in a Cricket World Cup encounter. They overtook the 168-run stand between Chris Harris and Lee Germon from 1996. The duo continued their unstoppable run after the midway mark. They reached their respective tons during their stand as well. This was Conway’s fifth and Ravindra’s maiden ODI hundred. As the duo closed in on the target, the England bowling lost its edge. They managed to overhaul the total in the 37th over. Earlier, England were restricted to 282/9 at the back of a brilliant 3/48 from Matt Henry and meaningful contributions from Mitchell Santner (2/37) and Glenn Phillips (2/17). During the England innings, the arrival of Jos Buttler in the 22nd over lifted the scoring rate. The England skipper took some time to get his eye in, and then went after the bowlers. His first boundary came against Ravindra, whom he carted over the rope in the 27th over. Thereafter, he kept his foot on the pedal and smashed two fours and two sixes in his innings. It seemed like the game was running away from New Zealand, but then Henry returned to get Buttler caught behind for 43. England kept up their attacking strategy, even as Joe Root and Liam Livingstone tried to go for their runs. However, incisive bowling from the Black Cap bowlers ensured that the batting side never ran away with the game. So Livingstone fell to Boult in the 39th over and Root was cleaned up by the golden arm of Glenn Phillips, when he misplayed a reverse sweep in the 42nd over. Despite regular breakthroughs from New Zealand bowlers in the final powerplay, England managed to reach 282 at the back of an unbeaten 30-run 10th wicket partnership between Adil Rashid and Mark Wood. This was the first-ever occasion that all the eleven batters in a side had reached double figures. When England walked out to bat Jonny Bairstow began their title defence in style, hitting a six off the very second ball of the game. He lifted a wayward Trent Boult delivery that drifted down the legside, into the stands. He unleashed an attacking range of shots to keep England closer to run a ball. His partner Dawid Malan, however, found the going tough against the Kiwi pacers. Malan eventually nicked one behind off Henry in the eighth over. Trying to keep up the scoring rate, the England batters kept going for their shots. This included an unconventional reverse scoop from Joe Root, which went behind the keeper’s head for a six. However, New Zealand managed to get a hold of things in the second powerplay. Bairstow (33) fell to Santner in the 13th over. On the other hand, Harry Brook (25) went for one shot too many in Ravindra’s first over, and gifted a catch in the deep midwicket region after having hit 4, 4, 6 off the last three deliveries. England’s scoring rate was further stifled after they lost Moeen to the off-spin of Phillips.

This was a perky start to the tournament on the field at least, a resourceful New Zealand side brushing off injuries to three key men and serving up the dish best served cold. After the barest of margins at Lord’s in 2019 came a hammering in the sequel, the stand-in captain, Tom Latham, marshalling an attack padded out with part-timers before Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra ransacked a target of 283 in only 36.2 overs. New Zealand crush England in World Cup opener after explosive run chase Read more Conway is an old hand in these parts, his unbeaten 121-ball 152 very much forged in the heat of his Indian Premier League experience. Ravindra made for a simply delightful story. Aged just 23 and thus the youngest player among two ageing sides, the Wellington left-hander’s 123 not out from 96 put his name up in lights in the country of his parents. All told it was some statement, neatly summed up by Conway registering New Zealand’s fastest World Cup century from 83 balls only to see it fall to his apprentice by one ball moments later. And it will probably have been welcomed by the officials in the ground after the scenes that were beamed around the world earlier in the day. Sure, we got Sachin Tendulkar escorting the trophy out to the middle before the toss at the Narendra Modi Stadium, his suit sharp and his hair remarkably luxuriant. The little master looks in excellent nick aged 50, as if he could simply buckle up those trademark old pads, pick up that railway sleeper of a bat and peel off another frictionless century. We also had the reassuringly familiar sounds of Ian Smith, Nasser Hussain and Ian Bishop to start with on commentary. Having deftly shepherded folks through that stomach-churning finale four years ago, the trio’s reunion in the box very much added to the rematch vibe that the International Cricket Council was so keen to riff on. But all this appeared to be occurring in a vacuum. No sport does an existential crisis quite like cricket and at a time when the 50-over format’s future is being debated – despite television rights having already been sold until the men’s ODI World Cup in 2031 – the sight of empty orange stands for the first ball was more fuel to the fire. Sachin Tendulkar carries the World Cup trophy on to the field before the match. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters There are, as always, a few caveats and mitigations. If the ICC is to be believed, this ended up as a record crowd for an opening match in a men’s 50-over World Cup; a final gate of more than 47,000 but in a 135,000-capacity stadium. The day-time temperatures were clearly a factor in those early optics, the handful who were present sticking to the shadier parts and the majority not arriving until the mercury had dropped. And for all the love of cricket in India, even factoring in the greater ubiquity created by the IPL’s rise, it was always wildly optimistic that a ground that holds more than Lord’s, Edgbaston, Headingley, Old Trafford and the Oval combined – the largest sporting arena outside of North Korea, no less – would be a good fit for these two teams. You also have to go back to 1996 for the last time the hosts did not start the tournament (England versus New Zealand in Ahmedabad, as it happens, with a good few in at the start that day). It was strange therefore that India were not deployed to light the touchpaper, with Rohit Sharma’s favourites not starting until Sunday’s encounter with Australia in Chennai. But even accepting the illusion of a regular crowd looking poor in a gargantuan stadium, it still wasn’t a great look and followed some questionable organisation. Though seemingly not exorbitant price-wise, tickets were not placed on sale until 25 August – only 41 days ago. And the fixtures themselves weren’t released until a month before that and have been tinkered with since, sowing further doubt in the minds of potential attendees. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The impression given here, accurate or otherwise, is of the Board of Control for Cricket in India not massively caring. Reports of spectators arriving on the day and being told they needed to travel to a hotel some 20 minutes away to collect tickets only added to this. The same cannot be said of England but they played nothing like defending champions. Jos Buttler brushed off that term, in fact, insisting his players wanted to attack this tournament. The upshot? A timid performance that was so brutally swept aside by the end it could easily come back to haunt them should net run-rate enter the equation. As for New Zealand, not for the first time they have entered a global tournament slightly unfancied and, going by first impressions, this is once again looking questionable.","pubDate":"2023-10-05 17:11:38","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9af350d76ee61a7acaece4e0f54f5e5a8288a66d/0_225_4401_2640/master/4401.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5a76ac1bc8603d23d3e26eee6cd4439c","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["india","canada","united kingdom","singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"6dd7bfd6f1402208b2dfbf0b462533a3","title":"Azharuddin barred from contesting HCA polls","link":"https://telanganatoday.com/azharuddin-barred-from-contesting-hca-polls","keywords":["Hyderabad","News","Sport","Top Section","Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA)","Mohd Azharuddin"],"creator":["IANS"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Supreme Court-appointed committee has disqualified former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin from contesting the ensuing elections to the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA).","content":"Home | Hyderabad | Azharuddin Barred From Contesting Hca Polls Azharuddin barred from contesting HCA polls The Supreme Court-appointed committee has disqualified former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin from contesting the ensuing elections to the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA). By IANS Published Date - 10:22 PM, Thu - 5 October 23 File photo Hyderabad: The Supreme Court-appointed committee has disqualified former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin from contesting the ensuing elections to the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA). Former Supreme Court judge Justice L. Nageswara Rao removed the former cricketer from the list of voters for HCA polls scheduled this month on the grounds of conflict of interest as he was president of the Deccan Blues Cricket Club while serving as the president of HCA till early this year. Nageswara Rao wrote to Azharuddin that he was removed from the voter list on the basis of the order passed by him on July 31, 2023. “According to the order dated 31-07-2023, all the executive committee members of clubs in which a person/his family members are involved in the management of multiple clubs have been disqualified to either vote/contest in the ensuing elections to the HCA for one term or a period of three years, whichever is greater. “As you are the President of Deccan Blue Cricket Club according to the information received by the Single Member Committee, you have been disqualified and not included in the voter’s list,” reads the letter. The letter mentions that on September 30, 2022, the supervisory committee appointed by the Supreme Court had asked Azharuddin to collect information relating to the details of all registered clubs which are members of the HCA. In the letter dated October 10, 2022 sent by Deccan Blues Cricket Club secretary P.R. Man Singh, Azharuddin was shown as president of the Deccan Blues Cricket Club. HCA elections are scheduled to be held on October 20. Electoral officer V.S. Sampath issued the notification on September 30 for the elections for the posts of president, vice-president, secretary, joint secretary, treasurer and councilor. The elections were supposed to be held in September 2022 but was postponed due to court cases. In February this year, the Supreme Court appointed Nageswara Rao as a single-member committee to manage HCA and facilitate the conduct of elections. In July, he debarred more than 57 clubs from participating or voting in the HCA elections for three years because of conflict of interest/owning multiple clubs. On August 7, he appointed former Chief Election Commissioner Sampath as the election officer. Azharuddin was elected HCA president in 2019 and his term ended with Nageswara Rao’s appointment by the Supreme Court. Azahruddin’s term saw infighting in the HCA and the warring groups approaching the Telangana High Court. The matter finally reached the Supreme Court, which constituted the one-member committed to clear the mess. Azharuddin had already announced that he will again contest for the post of HCA president.

During the match opening ceremony of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023, Coca-Cola India and ICC introduced National Flags made from post-consumer PET bottles. These PET bottles were recycled to produce yarn which was subsequently used for the flags. These flags will be used during the ‘national anthem ceremony’ before each match takes place in the stadiums. Heralding a new era of environmental responsibility, Coca-Cola India has enabled creation of national flags of the ten playing nations, and ten ICC unity flags. This makes Coca-Cola India the first company in the world to introduce recycled PET national flags in the sport of cricket, setting a precedent for future events. Approximately, 11,000 PET bottles were used for creating one national flag and approximately 2000 bottles were used to create an ICC Unity Flag. The flags are manufactured by GoRevise by Ganesha Ecoverse Limited which is engaged in manufacturing recycled yarn and garments. A dedicated team of 100 workers devoted 25 days and over 300 hours to bring these magnificent flags to life. Thums Up and Limca Sportz are the official beverage and sports drink partners for the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup India 2023. Coca-Cola India will undertake many activations during the World Cup, including online and offline fan and consumer engagements, to build awareness around waste management.

Jayawardena is the consultant coach of the national team and was flown in on Wednesday to share his expertise with the squad in a bid to make an impact on cricket’s biggest stage. Although only those present at the meeting were privy to the details, it was obvious that the former batting great was trying to motivate his players to bear greater responsibility in batting-friendly Indian conditions and, thus, help withstand the upcoming South African challenge. Jayawardena has played in two consecutive World Cup finals (2007 and 2011) and his wealth of experience as a player, skipper and coach will help Sri Lanka’s search for a winning start to the 13th edition of the World Cup. Sri Lanka will play South Africa in their opening game—the first of the nine first-round matches scheduled for the 1996 champions—at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi, a superb cricketing facility. Sri Lankan cricketers have understood how important the batter’s role is in this year’s World Cup where pitches and shorter boundaries are expected to help them. “The batters have a significant role to play here if we are to win matches and challenge the top teams competing at this year’s World Cup,” Mendis said, after sweating out in the nets. “If we can put up a score of 300-320, I think the bowlers can challenge them. Each batter has a job to do and if they can do that well, we will be better equipped to beat the South African side,” Mendis said, ruing the absence of Wanindu Hasaranga. Sri Lanka forfeited Hasaranga owing to injury and it’s a gap hard to fill. “If not, it won’t be easy for the bowlers to defend a total in these wickets. Bowlers will be greatly challenged in these conditions. What they should do is to do the basics, bowling at the right length and line”. Sri Lanka’s batting has been exposed every now and then. For instance, during the Asia Cup final Sri Lanka was blown off for 50 runs as India cruised to a 10-wicket win. But Mendis says the conditions in India are different to what they’ve been playing in the recent past. “Yes, we have struggled in Sri Lanka. Not only us but even India and Pakistan struggled in those slow-turning wickets. But on a good batting wicket in Lahore, we scored runs. The conditions here are similar to that of Pakistan and I am very much confident that our batters will flourish,” Mendis added. Despite his failure in the final, Mendis has been Sri Lanka’s best batter at the Asia Cup scoring 270 runs off six innings and playing a majestic innings against Afghanistan in the warm-up. The players were in the nets for about two hours to fine-tune areas that needed attention. Skipper Dasun Shanaka and Kusal Janith Perera, also under injury clouds, flexed their muscles at the nets. Mendis expects both players to make the playing XI along with spinner Maheesh Theekshana, who joined the team on Wednesday. Shanaka has an elbow injury while Perera has shoulder pain.“They have recovered and were training today. Hopefully, they will be fit to go on Saturday,” he said.

After a months long investigation, the MCC sent a letter to its members to confirm the had been punished. One was expelled from the club entirely, a second received a four-and-a-half year suspension while the third was suspended for 30 months for participating in “abusive, offensive or inappropriate behaviour or language”. “The actions of the three individuals in the Pavilion on the day in question fell well below the behaviour expected from our Members,” the MCC said in a statement. “The penalties set out above are the consequences of breaching the Club's Code of Conduct.” Following the Bairstow stumping, the entire Lord’s ground was furious but the behaviour of the members in the the Long Room to the changeroom was unprecedented. The usually civil MCC members have the unique privilege of rubbing shoulders with the players as they walk through the pavilion to the changerooms but were caught hissing and yelling “cheat” and “shame” when they exited the field for the lunch break. Opening batters Usman Khawaja and David Warner stopped in their tracks to point out some of the members shouting abuse to security. Speaking months after the incident, Khawaja said he had “The MCC is the most like oh ‘hear, hear’, they’ll clap you if you get a duck and they’ll clap you if you get a hundred they don’t care they’ll just clap,” Khawaja told The Late Show with Matty Johns’ Fletch and Hindy. “It kind of took us off guard because when we were coming in there these guys were like a pack of dogs you know ‘rar, rar, rar’. “Literally one of them was frothing at his mouth.” MCC chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown released a new set of protocols for members in the aftermath of the incident. The changes included expanding the roped off area where players walk through on their way in between the field and changerooms and stopping members from using the stairwell when players are making their way up or down. Cricket Australia immediately demanded a please explain after the incident and said it was “appreciative” of the punishments handed down. “We are appreciative of the support of the team by the MCC at the time and these subsequent sanctions,” a CA spokesperson said. “We trust this brings the matter to a close and there will be no repeat of the behaviour in future.”","pubDate":"2023-10-05 21:43:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"skynewsau","source_priority":13361,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a6df7e893127424e9eb72ba649ad97ea","title":"PAUL NEWMAN: The swathes of empty seats for England's World Cup opener in Ahmedabad was EMBARRASSING for cricket... it was the latest example of governing bodies failing to give any thought to paying spectators","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12598709/England-World-Cup-Ahmedabad-cricket.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PAUL NEWMAN: The Board of Control for Cricket in India are so rich and powerful because of their broadcasting billions that they rarely seem to give any thought to paying spectators.","content":"PAUL NEWMAN: The swathes of empty seats for England's World Cup opener in Ahmedabad was EMBARRASSING for cricket... it was the latest example of governing bodies failing to give any thought to paying spectators New Zealand hammered England in the opening game of the Cricket World Cup The match was at the Narendra Modi Stadium which has a capacity of 132,000 Despite a crowd of 47,000, the empty stands were embarrassing for cricket By Paul Newman for MailOnline Published: 12:19 EDT, 5 October 2023 | Updated: 17:34 EDT, 5 October 2023 e-mail 97 shares 32 View comments It was such a bad look. For cricket, for the beleaguered 50-over format and for a World Cup that should still be the biggest showcase event for the white-ball game. The empty stands at the vast Narendra Modi Stadium when England and New Zealand opened the 13th edition of a tournament that is threatened like never before from the march of the franchises were little short of an embarrassment. Yes, the biggest cricket ground in the world holds 132,000 and even a half decent crowd - like yesterday’s became if the ICC are right in claiming there were 47,000 spectators by the time New Zealand batted - would seem tiny in such a stadium. But casual TV spectators who tuned in yesterday morning at the promise of a significant event would have instead been given the impression of a sport, or at least a traditional limited-overs format, in serious decline. There are, of course, mitigating circumstances and they can be laid firmly at the door of the governing body who so often appear to abuse the privilege of representing the biggest and most cricket mad country in the world. The swathes of empty seats for England's World Cup opener against New Zealand at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad was embarrassing for cricket The mammoth ground has a capacity of 132,000 and therefore the 47,000 crowd looked tiny The Board of Control for Cricket in India are so rich and powerful because of their broadcasting billions that they rarely seem to give any thought to paying spectators. And Thursday's grand opening of a tournament that they, and not the ICC, have organised seemed to plumb their attitude to new depths. The venues and dates for World Cup matches have repeatedly changed over the last few months, making it hard enough for locals to plan their day at the cricket let alone the thousands of overseas supporters who would have been put off by the uncertainty. Tickets, meanwhile, only went on sale 41 days ago and they have been devilishly hard to get, as is India’s wont, with regular reports of the website crashing. The venues and dates for World Cup games have repeatedly changed over the last few months, making it hard enough for locals to plan their day at the cricket let alone the overseas fans New Zealand beat England after Rachin Ravindra (left) and Devon Conway (right) scored tons Those present in Ahmedabad say there has been little local effort at marketing the tournament and instead any visible cricketing promotion has instead been concentrated on the next Indian Premier League tournament that doesn’t start until late March. Most of all, it makes no sense for India not to feature in the opening game, as they did the last time the World Cup was staged in the country in 2011, even if the rematch of the classic 2019 final should have been enough to draw a big festival crowd. It is all very well the BCCI being indifferent to the point of arrogance towards crowds in their stadiums because they do not need the money. But full houses and atmosphere should be the lifeblood of any big sporting event. Instead, as has always seemed to be the case since I started covering England’s visits to India in 2008, fans wanting to be there for this tournament have been treated with little more than contempt.

After winning the gold medal in the 800m event, 50 minutes later she won the bronze medal with the women’s 400m relay team, a new Sri Lankan record. After winning this gold medal, Tharushi became the number one athlete in the 800m event according to the latest rankings of senior and junior Asian athletes released by the Asian Athletics Association yesterday. The association organizes at least three major athletic tournaments in Asia in a year, namely the Asian Games, Asian Senior Athletics Championship and Asian Junior (Under 20) Athletics Championship. Tharushi managed to win the gold medal in the 800m event in all three tournaments, and she became the first Asian player to achieve such a feat. Meanwhile, Olympic Committee General Secretary Maxwell de Silva said that in order to improve Tharushi’s ability at the international level, they will provide a foreign scholarship with the assistance of the National Olympic Committee and Former Olympic medalist S.L.B. Rosa. Accordingly, he said that in the future, Tharushi’s training will take place in America, but for that, she must complete her education in this country. Tharushi, a student of Walala A Ratnayake College, is going to sit for the General Certificate of Education Advanced level examination this year. The athletic events of the Asian Games, which are being held in Hangzhou, China, ended yesterday, and the Sri Lankan ended up by winning a gold medal, a silver medal and two bronze medals. At this year’s Games, 21 countries have won medals in athletics, of which Sri Lanka won eighth place. The first place went to China with 39 medals (19 gold, 11 silver and 9 bronze), followed by Bahrain (16) and India (29). Bahrain won 10 gold, 1 silver and 16 bronze medals, while India won 6 gold, 14 silver and 9 bronze medals. In addition to athletics, Sri Lanka also won the silver medal in women’s cricket, thus the total number of medals won at this year’s Games is 5. It is significant that in the history of the Asian Games, Sri Lanka won 5 or more medals after 21 years. Sri Lanka had last won 6 medals in 2002 as two gold, one silver and three bronze. Karate Meanwhile, Heshani Hettiarachchi, who joined the first round of the women’s singles karate event representing Sri Lanka yesterday, had to withdraw from the first round. Eight players participated in that competition, and Keshani who got 34.30 points finished last. There is only one more representation left for Sri Lanka in this Games, and that is Dineth Avihinsa, who will enter the competition in the Karate Committee’s 67 kg weight class. He will compete tomorrow (7). Wrestling Yesterday, Nethmi Ahimsa entered the competition field in the 53 kg freestyle event and lost to Kazakhstan player Zedneva Marina.

But in these cases We still have judgement here, that we but teach Bloody instructions which, being taught, return To plague th’inventor. This even-handed justice Commends th’ingredience of our poisoned chalice To our own lips. Bang on, Billy. Nailed it again. Who indeed would want to drink from the infected schooner glass of the NSW coach? It seems Laurie Daley or Macbeth are the only viable high-powered options standing at the bar. Former Blues coach Laurie Daley was a bit of a rugby league nerd even in his playing days. Credit: SMH The thought of Daley potentially returning next year to “right the wrongs” that led to his sacking - and Brad Fittler ’s appointment - in 2017 provides a nice enough storyline. After conjuring a series victory against Queensland in 2014 with a manifestly inferior team, Daley lost three consecutive series, had his contract extended by NSWRL chief executive David Trodden , then had it ripped up by a board who knew change was needed. Back then, Daley was coaching against a team featuring players such as Billy Slater and Cameron Smith . If he returns, he’ll be duelling with them again, although this time as coaches. Daley wants to do whatever he can to help the Blues, such is the quality of the man. When Fittler approached him recently about joining his staff, Daley agreed without really knowing what Fittler had in mind. After six years of poring his heart and soul into the job with mixed success, Fittler walked away after being dumped squarely on his bottom by NSWRL powerbrokers. They wanted him to clean out his coaching staff, which he did. He wanted a two-year extension, but they wanted one year, to which he eventually agreed. Then they told him, out of nowhere, the job was being reduced to a part-time role for a reduced amount of money, so he walked. NSWRL chairman Paul Conlon has been jabbering for months about how poorly Fittler has been treated by the Sydney media following back-to-back series losses, accusing reporters of having an “agenda” against him. I suspect few have hurt Fittler more than the NSWRL, which had his back right up until the moment when it didn’t. The comical last line of last week’s media release announcing Fittler’s departure says it all: “The NSWRL board will now invite expressions of interest from coaches to be involved in the State of Origin program in 2024.” It might have to advertise on Seek.com given how many potential replacements have run for the hills. The edict about not picking club coaches has been abandoned, throwing open the door for the likes of Ricky Stuart , Craig Bellamy and Ivan Cleary . Yet none of them are prepared to take on the job, which is understandable because of the time and energy required of both roles. That leaves Daley as the last man standing. He recently extended his deal to co-host the Big Sports Breakfast on Sky Sports Radio for a further two years. The NRL stopped him from working as a consultant at Manly late last year because the network is owned by the TAB, a wagering operator. But Daley would be employed by the NSWRL and not the NRL. The question, though, is why would he want to do it? Why drink from the poisoned chalice that has spooked so many of his contemporaries? Coaching the Blues for the next few years, against the likes of Slater and Smith coaching the likes of Cameron Munster, Reece Walsh and Kalyn Ponga , already feels like a Shakespearean tragedy in the making. But Daley conjured miracles in 2014 and could do it again in this second coming. Now, that would be something to write about. Exactly how much did the NBL’s billionaire owner Larry Kestleman pay for retired Chicago Bulls star Scottie Pippen to preach the gospel of basketball in Australia last weekend? Reports a few weeks ago put the number as high as $1.2 million, a figure the NBL denies, but various sources, who did not want to be named because the matter is confidential, have confirmed it cost $700,000 to secure the six-time NBA champion as an official ambassador. Not bad for a handful of appearances over five days, including the AFL and NRL grand finals, while partying with former Bulls teammate Luc Longley . The NBL identified more than a year ago that it needed to think outside the square to promote its opening round on a weekend dominated by the big dances of the two major football codes. Wearing a shirt sporting the NBL logo, Pippen was interviewed before the AFL grand final and halftime in the NRL decider. Pippen and Longley courtside for the NBL season-opener between Melbourne United and South East Melbourne Phoenix. Credit: Getty Images “Two great events,” Pippen told Joel Caine in a podcast for SEN Radio. “If I had to pick one, I’d say the AFL. It was a little more exciting; something I felt I could’ve played if I had started playing it younger.” Pippen also did the obligatory spin around Sydney Harbour on a luxury yacht on Monday, sipping straight vodkas while pressing the flesh with select media and VIP guests. The idea to recruit Pippen was a resounding success: there was a 40 per cent increase in TV audience compared to last year and record crowd attendance. It’s a proactive step from a proactive league that wants to make the most of this country’s booming interest in basketball, aided by a steady flow of talent to the NBA via the NBL. Pippen will return in February to promote the league, although he might need to freshen up on its name. “It’s great to be hanging out in his country promoting the NBDL [sic],” he told Caine, who replied: “It’s OK. It’s day five.” When all else fails, there’s delusion. How else to explain Rugby Australia’s response to news that Wallabies coach Eddie Jones has been Zooming with the enemy? RA’s response to reports in this masthead about Jones speaking to Japanese rugby was to offer Roosters back-rower Angus Crichton a two-year deal before withdrawing it just days later following a backlash from the broader rugby community. The Roosters reject claims they need Crichton to depart because of salary-cap pressure, although he doesn’t seem to be a big part of their plans from next year. As for suggestions Joseph Suaalii might backflip on his mega-deal struck earlier this year, the Roosters would entertain the idea but retaining him at market value under the salary cap would be tricky because the bulk of his $5 million deal with rugby is covered in third-party agreements. Your humble columnist’s piece earlier in the week about athletes such as Broncos star Reece Walsh being unfairly targeted by young fans wielding mobile phone cameras prompted a range of reader responses — including some who thought I actually wanted him sanctioned for wearing Pit Viper sunglasses, which is wildly incorrect. Certainly, younger fans are feeling more emboldened than ever before to tell their football heroes what they think of them — or what their parents think. Last week, South Sydney fullback Latrell Mitchell was at Heffron Park when he approached a young fan who was watching from the sidelines. “I don’t want to shake your hand because Dad reckons you’re the reason we lose games,” the boy, who looked about six, told him. Kids these days.

It’s a big weekend for … the Wallabies, who need Portugal to beat Fiji by eight points or more to avoid being the first Australian side to bomb out of the Rugby World Cup in the pool stage.

Rachin Ravindra (123 not out) and Devon Conway (152 not out) were the stars of the day for the Back Caps. In response to England’s 282/9, New Zealand crossed the target in merely 36.2 overs to make a great start to the tournament. New Zealand lost Will Young to a first-ball duck early on in their innings. However, this brought in Ravindra, who joined forces with Conway to light up the first Powerplay. The Black Caps hit 13 fours and two sixes in the first Powerplay. Both the sixes came from Ravindra’s bat, one against Mark Wood and the other against Moeen Ali. Having helped New Zealand to 81/1 in the first Powerplay, the duo didn’t relent and maintained the scoring rate closer to eight over the next few overs. They also achieved their personal landmarks of half-centuries in the 12th and 13th overs respectively. The scoring rate dropped a tad bit after the drinks break, but Conway and Ravindra got back into the groove soon after. Their unbeaten stand of 177 runs (at the 25-over mark) was already the highest partnership for two New Zealand batters in a Cricket World Cup encounter. They overtook the 168-run stand between Chris Harris and Lee Germon from 1996. The duo continued their unstoppable run after the midway mark. They reached their respective tons during their stand as well. This was Conway’s fifth and Ravindra’s maiden ODI hundred. As the duo closed in on the target, the England bowling lost its edge. They managed to overhaul the total in the 37th over. Earlier, England were restricted to 282/9 at the back of a brilliant 3/48 from Matt Henry and meaningful contributions from Mitchell Santner (2/37) and Glenn Phillips (2/17). During the England innings, the arrival of Jos Buttler in the 22nd over lifted the scoring rate. The England skipper took some time to get his eye in, and then went after the bowlers. His first boundary came against Ravindra, whom he carted over the rope in the 27th over. Thereafter, he kept his foot on the pedal and smashed two fours and two sixes in his innings. It seemed like the game was running away from New Zealand, but then Henry returned to get Buttler caught behind for 43. England kept up their attacking strategy, even as Joe Root and Liam Livingstone tried to go for their runs. However, incisive bowling from the Black Cap bowlers ensured that the batting side never ran away with the game. So Livingstone fell to Boult in the 39th over and Root was cleaned up by the golden arm of Glenn Phillips, when he misplayed a reverse sweep in the 42nd over. Despite regular breakthroughs from New Zealand bowlers in the final powerplay, England managed to reach 282 at the back of an unbeaten 30-run 10th wicket partnership between Adil Rashid and Mark Wood. This was the first-ever occasion that all the eleven batters in a side had reached double figures. When England walked out to bat Jonny Bairstow began their title defence in style, hitting a six off the very second ball of the game. He lifted a wayward Trent Boult delivery that drifted down the legside, into the stands. He unleashed an attacking range of shots to keep England closer to run a ball. His partner Dawid Malan, however, found the going tough against the Kiwi pacers. Malan eventually nicked one behind off Henry in the eighth over. Trying to keep up the scoring rate, the England batters kept going for their shots. This included an unconventional reverse scoop from Joe Root, which went behind the keeper’s head for a six. However, New Zealand managed to get a hold of things in the second powerplay. Bairstow (33) fell to Santner in the 13th over. On the other hand, Harry Brook (25) went for one shot too many in Ravindra’s first over, and gifted a catch in the deep midwicket region after having hit 4, 4, 6 off the last three deliveries. England’s scoring rate was further stifled after they lost Moeen to the off-spin of Phillips. Brief scores: England 282/9 in 50 overs (Joe Root 77, Jos Buttler 43; Matt Henry 3/48, Mitchell Santner 2/37) vs New Zealand 283/1 (Devon Conway 152, Rachin Ravindra 123; Sam Curran 1/47) win by 9 wickets.","pubDate":"2023-10-05 17:41:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"sambadenglish","source_priority":332200,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"00d5b1e651e0098e941ecd96a5f645d0","title":"Cricket World Cup’s empty stands and ticket turmoil fuel existential crisis | Ali Martin","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/oct/05/england-and-the-world-cup-make-timid-start-in-cavernous-stadium","keywords":["Cricket World Cup 2023","England cricket team","New Zealand cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Ali Martin"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand were spectacular, England were timid and even Tendulkar couldn’t stop tournament starting with a whimperThey say you never get a second chance to make a first impression and in that respect, both England and the Cricket World Cup’s organisers will hope theirs is not a lasting one.This was a perky start to the tournament on the field at least, a resourceful New Zealand side brushing off injuries to three key men and serving up the dish best served cold.

New Zealand crush England in World Cup opener after explosive run chase Read more Conway is an old hand in these parts, his unbeaten 121-ball 152 very much forged in the heat of his Indian Premier League experience. Ravindra made for a simply delightful story. Aged just 23 and thus the youngest player among two ageing sides, the Wellington left-hander’s 123 not out from 96 put his name up in lights in the country of his parents. All told it was some statement, neatly summed up by Conway registering New Zealand’s fastest World Cup century from 83 balls only to see it fall to his apprentice by one ball moments later. And it will probably have been welcomed by the officials in the ground after the scenes that were beamed around the world earlier in the day. Sure, we got Sachin Tendulkar escorting the trophy out to the middle before the toss at the Narendra Modi Stadium, his suit sharp and his hair remarkably luxuriant. The little master looks in excellent nick aged 50, as if he could simply buckle up those trademark old pads, pick up that railway sleeper of a bat and peel off another frictionless century. We also had the reassuringly familiar sounds of Ian Smith, Nasser Hussain and Ian Bishop to start with on commentary. Having deftly shepherded folks through that stomach-churning finale four years ago, the trio’s reunion in the box very much added to the rematch vibe that the International Cricket Council was so keen to riff on. But all this appeared to be occurring in a vacuum. No sport does an existential crisis quite like cricket and at a time when the 50-over format’s future is being debated – despite television rights having already been sold until the men’s ODI World Cup in 2031 – the sight of empty orange stands for the first ball was more fuel to the fire. Sachin Tendulkar carries the World Cup trophy on to the field before the match. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters There are, as always, a few caveats and mitigations. If the ICC is to be believed, this ended up as a record crowd for an opening match in a men’s 50-over World Cup; a final gate of more than 47,000 but in a 135,000-capacity stadium. The day-time temperatures were clearly a factor in those early optics, the handful who were present sticking to the shadier parts and the majority not arriving until the mercury had dropped. And for all the love of cricket in India, even factoring in the greater ubiquity created by the IPL’s rise, it was always wildly optimistic that a ground that holds more than Lord’s, Edgbaston, Headingley, Old Trafford and the Oval combined – the largest sporting arena outside of North Korea, no less – would be a good fit for these two teams. You also have to go back to 1996 for the last time the hosts did not start the tournament (England versus New Zealand in Ahmedabad, as it happens, with a good few in at the start that day). It was strange therefore that India were not deployed to light the touchpaper, with Rohit Sharma’s favourites not starting until Sunday’s encounter with Australia in Chennai. But even accepting the illusion of a regular crowd looking poor in a gargantuan stadium, it still wasn’t a great look and followed some questionable organisation. Though seemingly not exorbitant price-wise, tickets were not placed on sale until 25 August – only 41 days ago. And the fixtures themselves weren’t released until a month before that and have been tinkered with since, sowing further doubt in the minds of potential attendees. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The impression given here, accurate or otherwise, is of the Board of Control for Cricket in India not massively caring. Reports of spectators arriving on the day and being told they needed to travel to a hotel some 20 minutes away to collect tickets only added to this. The same cannot be said of England but they played nothing like defending champions. Jos Buttler brushed off that term, in fact, insisting his players wanted to attack this tournament. The upshot? A timid performance that was so brutally swept aside by the end it could easily come back to haunt them should net run-rate enter the equation. As for New Zealand, not for the first time they have entered a global tournament slightly unfancied and, going by first impressions, this is once again looking questionable.","pubDate":"2023-10-05 17:11:38","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9af350d76ee61a7acaece4e0f54f5e5a8288a66d/0_225_4401_2640/master/4401.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5a76ac1bc8603d23d3e26eee6cd4439c","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["india","canada","united kingdom","singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"6dd7bfd6f1402208b2dfbf0b462533a3","title":"Azharuddin barred from contesting HCA polls","link":"https://telanganatoday.com/azharuddin-barred-from-contesting-hca-polls","keywords":["Hyderabad","News","Sport","Top Section","Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA)","Mohd Azharuddin"],"creator":["IANS"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Supreme Court-appointed committee has disqualified former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin from contesting the ensuing elections to the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA).","content":"Home | Hyderabad | Azharuddin Barred From Contesting Hca Polls Azharuddin barred from contesting HCA polls The Supreme Court-appointed committee has disqualified former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin from contesting the ensuing elections to the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA). By IANS Published Date - 10:22 PM, Thu - 5 October 23 File photo Hyderabad: The Supreme Court-appointed committee has disqualified former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin from contesting the ensuing elections to the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA). Former Supreme Court judge Justice L. Nageswara Rao removed the former cricketer from the list of voters for HCA polls scheduled this month on the grounds of conflict of interest as he was president of the Deccan Blues Cricket Club while serving as the president of HCA till early this year. Nageswara Rao wrote to Azharuddin that he was removed from the voter list on the basis of the order passed by him on July 31, 2023. “According to the order dated 31-07-2023, all the executive committee members of clubs in which a person/his family members are involved in the management of multiple clubs have been disqualified to either vote/contest in the ensuing elections to the HCA for one term or a period of three years, whichever is greater. “As you are the President of Deccan Blue Cricket Club according to the information received by the Single Member Committee, you have been disqualified and not included in the voter’s list,” reads the letter. The letter mentions that on September 30, 2022, the supervisory committee appointed by the Supreme Court had asked Azharuddin to collect information relating to the details of all registered clubs which are members of the HCA. In the letter dated October 10, 2022 sent by Deccan Blues Cricket Club secretary P.R. Man Singh, Azharuddin was shown as president of the Deccan Blues Cricket Club. HCA elections are scheduled to be held on October 20. Electoral officer V.S. Sampath issued the notification on September 30 for the elections for the posts of president, vice-president, secretary, joint secretary, treasurer and councilor. The elections were supposed to be held in September 2022 but was postponed due to court cases. In February this year, the Supreme Court appointed Nageswara Rao as a single-member committee to manage HCA and facilitate the conduct of elections. In July, he debarred more than 57 clubs from participating or voting in the HCA elections for three years because of conflict of interest/owning multiple clubs. On August 7, he appointed former Chief Election Commissioner Sampath as the election officer. Azharuddin was elected HCA president in 2019 and his term ended with Nageswara Rao’s appointment by the Supreme Court. Azahruddin’s term saw infighting in the HCA and the warring groups approaching the Telangana High Court. The matter finally reached the Supreme Court, which constituted the one-member committed to clear the mess. Azharuddin had already announced that he will again contest for the post of HCA president.

During the match opening ceremony of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023, Coca-Cola India and ICC introduced National Flags made from post-consumer PET bottles. These PET bottles were recycled to produce yarn which was subsequently used for the flags. These flags will be used during the ‘national anthem ceremony’ before each match takes place in the stadiums. Heralding a new era of environmental responsibility, Coca-Cola India has enabled creation of national flags of the ten playing nations, and ten ICC unity flags. This makes Coca-Cola India the first company in the world to introduce recycled PET national flags in the sport of cricket, setting a precedent for future events. Approximately, 11,000 PET bottles were used for creating one national flag and approximately 2000 bottles were used to create an ICC Unity Flag. The flags are manufactured by GoRevise by Ganesha Ecoverse Limited which is engaged in manufacturing recycled yarn and garments. A dedicated team of 100 workers devoted 25 days and over 300 hours to bring these magnificent flags to life. Thums Up and Limca Sportz are the official beverage and sports drink partners for the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup India 2023.

Jayawardena is the consultant coach of the national team and was flown in on Wednesday to share his expertise with the squad in a bid to make an impact on cricket’s biggest stage. Although only those present at the meeting were privy to the details, it was obvious that the former batting great was trying to motivate his players to bear greater responsibility in batting-friendly Indian conditions and, thus, help withstand the upcoming South African challenge. Jayawardena has played in two consecutive World Cup finals (2007 and 2011) and his wealth of experience as a player, skipper and coach will help Sri Lanka’s search for a winning start to the 13th edition of the World Cup. Sri Lanka will play South Africa in their opening game—the first of the nine first-round matches scheduled for the 1996 champions—at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi, a superb cricketing facility. Sri Lankan cricketers have understood how important the batter’s role is in this year’s World Cup where pitches and shorter boundaries are expected to help them. “The batters have a significant role to play here if we are to win matches and challenge the top teams competing at this year’s World Cup,” Mendis said, after sweating out in the nets. “If we can put up a score of 300-320, I think the bowlers can challenge them. Each batter has a job to do and if they can do that well, we will be better equipped to beat the South African side,” Mendis said, ruing the absence of Wanindu Hasaranga. Sri Lanka forfeited Hasaranga owing to injury and it’s a gap hard to fill. “If not, it won’t be easy for the bowlers to defend a total in these wickets. Bowlers will be greatly challenged in these conditions. What they should do is to do the basics, bowling at the right length and line”. Sri Lanka’s batting has been exposed every now and then. For instance, during the Asia Cup final Sri Lanka was blown off for 50 runs as India cruised to a 10-wicket win. But Mendis says the conditions in India are different to what they’ve been playing in the recent past. “Yes, we have struggled in Sri Lanka. Not only us but even India and Pakistan struggled in those slow-turning wickets. But on a good batting wicket in Lahore, we scored runs. The conditions here are similar to that of Pakistan and I am very much confident that our batters will flourish,” Mendis added. Despite his failure in the final, Mendis has been Sri Lanka’s best batter at the Asia Cup scoring 270 runs off six innings and playing a majestic innings against Afghanistan in the warm-up. The players were in the nets for about two hours to fine-tune areas that needed attention. Skipper Dasun Shanaka and Kusal Janith Perera, also under injury clouds, flexed their muscles at the nets. Mendis expects both players to make the playing XI along with spinner Maheesh Theekshana, who joined the team on Wednesday. Shanaka has an elbow injury while Perera has shoulder pain.“They have recovered and were training today. Hopefully, they will be fit to go on Saturday,” he said.

After a months long investigation, the MCC sent a letter to its members to confirm the had been punished. One was expelled from the club entirely, a second received a four-and-a-half year suspension while the third was suspended for 30 months for participating in “abusive, offensive or inappropriate behaviour or language”. “The actions of the three individuals in the Pavilion on the day in question fell well below the behaviour expected from our Members,” the MCC said in a statement. “The penalties set out above are the consequences of breaching the Club's Code of Conduct.” Following the Bairstow stumping, the entire Lord’s ground was furious but the behaviour of the members in the the Long Room to the changeroom was unprecedented. The usually civil MCC members have the unique privilege of rubbing shoulders with the players as they walk through the pavilion to the changerooms but were caught hissing and yelling “cheat” and “shame” when they exited the field for the lunch break. Opening batters Usman Khawaja and David Warner stopped in their tracks to point out some of the members shouting abuse to security. Speaking months after the incident, Khawaja said he had “The MCC is the most like oh ‘hear, hear’, they’ll clap you if you get a duck and they’ll clap you if you get a hundred they don’t care they’ll just clap,” Khawaja told The Late Show with Matty Johns’ Fletch and Hindy. “It kind of took us off guard because when we were coming in there these guys were like a pack of dogs you know ‘rar, rar, rar’. “Literally one of them was frothing at his mouth.” MCC chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown released a new set of protocols for members in the aftermath of the incident. The changes included expanding the roped off area where players walk through on their way in between the field and changerooms and stopping members from using the stairwell when players are making their way up or down. Cricket Australia immediately demanded a please explain after the incident and said it was “appreciative” of the punishments handed down. “We are appreciative of the support of the team by the MCC at the time and these subsequent sanctions,” a CA spokesperson said. “We trust this brings the matter to a close and there will be no repeat of the behaviour in future.”","pubDate":"2023-10-05 21:43:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"skynewsau","source_priority":13361,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a6df7e893127424e9eb72ba649ad97ea","title":"PAUL NEWMAN: The swathes of empty seats for England's World Cup opener in Ahmedabad was EMBARRASSING for cricket... it was the latest example of governing bodies failing to give any thought to paying spectators","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12598709/England-World-Cup-Ahmedabad-cricket.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PAUL NEWMAN: The Board of Control for Cricket in India are so rich and powerful because of their broadcasting billions that they rarely seem to give any thought to paying spectators.","content":"PAUL NEWMAN: The swathes of empty seats for England's World Cup opener in Ahmedabad was EMBARRASSING for cricket... it was the latest example of governing bodies failing to give any thought to paying spectators New Zealand hammered England in the opening game of the Cricket World Cup The match was at the Narendra Modi Stadium which has a capacity of 132,000 Despite a crowd of 47,000, the empty stands were embarrassing for cricket By Paul Newman for MailOnline Published: 12:19 EDT, 5 October 2023 | Updated: 17:34 EDT, 5 October 2023 e-mail 97 shares 32 View comments It was such a bad look. For cricket, for the beleaguered 50-over format and for a World Cup that should still be the biggest showcase event for the white-ball game. The empty stands at the vast Narendra Modi Stadium when England and New Zealand opened the 13th edition of a tournament that is threatened like never before from the march of the franchises were little short of an embarrassment. Yes, the biggest cricket ground in the world holds 132,000 and even a half decent crowd - like yesterday’s became if the ICC are right in claiming there were 47,000 spectators by the time New Zealand batted - would seem tiny in such a stadium. But casual TV spectators who tuned in yesterday morning at the promise of a significant event would have instead been given the impression of a sport, or at least a traditional limited-overs format, in serious decline. There are, of course, mitigating circumstances and they can be laid firmly at the door of the governing body who so often appear to abuse the privilege of representing the biggest and most cricket mad country in the world. The swathes of empty seats for England's World Cup opener against New Zealand at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad was embarrassing for cricket The mammoth ground has a capacity of 132,000 and therefore the 47,000 crowd looked tiny The Board of Control for Cricket in India are so rich and powerful because of their broadcasting billions that they rarely seem to give any thought to paying spectators. And Thursday's grand opening of a tournament that they, and not the ICC, have organised seemed to plumb their attitude to new depths. The venues and dates for World Cup matches have repeatedly changed over the last few months, making it hard enough for locals to plan their day at the cricket let alone the thousands of overseas supporters who would have been put off by the uncertainty. Tickets, meanwhile, only went on sale 41 days ago and they have been devilishly hard to get, as is India’s wont, with regular reports of the website crashing. The venues and dates for World Cup games have repeatedly changed over the last few months, making it hard enough for locals to plan their day at the cricket let alone the overseas fans New Zealand beat England after Rachin Ravindra (left) and Devon Conway (right) scored tons Those present in Ahmedabad say there has been little local effort at marketing the tournament and instead any visible cricketing promotion has instead been concentrated on the next Indian Premier League tournament that doesn’t start until late March. Most of all, it makes no sense for India not to feature in the opening game, as they did the last time the World Cup was staged in the country in 2011, even if the rematch of the classic 2019 final should have been enough to draw a big festival crowd. It is all very well the BCCI being indifferent to the point of arrogance towards crowds in their stadiums because they do not need the money. But full houses and atmosphere should be the lifeblood of any big sporting event. Instead, as has always seemed to be the case since I started covering England’s visits to India in 2008, fans wanting to be there for this tournament have been treated with little more than contempt.

After winning the gold medal in the 800m event, 50 minutes later she won the bronze medal with the women’s 400m relay team, a new Sri Lankan record. After winning this gold medal, Tharushi became the number one athlete in the 800m event according to the latest rankings of senior and junior Asian athletes released by the Asian Athletics Association yesterday. The association organizes at least three major athletic tournaments in Asia in a year, namely the Asian Games, Asian Senior Athletics Championship and Asian Junior (Under 20) Athletics Championship. Tharushi managed to win the gold medal in the 800m event in all three tournaments, and she became the first Asian player to achieve such a feat. Meanwhile, Olympic Committee General Secretary Maxwell de Silva said that in order to improve Tharushi’s ability at the international level, they will provide a foreign scholarship with the assistance of the National Olympic Committee and Former Olympic medalist S.L.B. Rosa. Accordingly, he said that in the future, Tharushi’s training will take place in America, but for that, she must complete her education in this country. Tharushi, a student of Walala A Ratnayake College, is going to sit for the General Certificate of Education Advanced level examination this year. The athletic events of the Asian Games, which are being held in Hangzhou, China, ended yesterday, and the Sri Lankan ended up by winning a gold medal, a silver medal and two bronze medals. At this year’s Games, 21 countries have won medals in athletics, of which Sri Lanka won eighth place. The first place went to China with 39 medals (19 gold, 11 silver and 9 bronze), followed by Bahrain (16) and India (29). Bahrain won 10 gold, 1 silver and 16 bronze medals, while India won 6 gold, 14 silver and 9 bronze medals. In addition to athletics, Sri Lanka also won the silver medal in women’s cricket, thus the total number of medals won at this year’s Games is 5. It is significant that in the history of the Asian Games, Sri Lanka won 5 or more medals after 21 years. Sri Lanka had last won 6 medals in 2002 as two gold, one silver and three bronze. Karate Meanwhile, Heshani Hettiarachchi, who joined the first round of the women’s singles karate event representing Sri Lanka yesterday, had to withdraw from the first round. Eight players participated in that competition, and Keshani who got 34.30 points finished last. There is only one more representation left for Sri Lanka in this Games, and that is Dineth Avihinsa, who will enter the competition in the Karate Committee’s 67 kg weight class. He will compete tomorrow (7). Wrestling Yesterday, Nethmi Ahimsa entered the competition field in the 53 kg freestyle event and lost to Kazakhstan player Zedneva Marina. Here, the Kazakhstani player got 5 points while Nethmi got 4 points. Medals Tally At the end of yesterday’s athletic events, China, who is in the lead in the medal table, had won 177 golds, Japan had won 40 golds in second place, South Korea had won 33 golds and India had won 21 golds. Sri Lanka, which won 5 medals, was ranked 25th on the list.","pubDate":"2023-10-05 19:40:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailynews","source_priority":375855,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"f6d34cbfc64ddc853c222bb3880dfd0e","title":"Bard manners: Why would Laurie Daley’s lips touch this poison chalice?","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/nrl/bard-manners-why-would-laurie-daley-s-lips-touch-this-poison-chalice-20231005-p5e9w6.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":["Sport / NRL"],"creator":["Andrew Webster"],"video_url":null,"description":"The former Blues coach is the last man standing for the NSWRL, but his return already feels like a Shakespearean tragedy in the making.","content":"Let’s defer to the words of former rugby league roundsman William Shakespeare to capture the plight of the NSWRL as it fumbles around in the dark searching for a State of Origin coach. But in these cases We still have judgement here, that we but teach Bloody instructions which, being taught, return To plague th’inventor. This even-handed justice Commends th’ingredience of our poisoned chalice To our own lips. Bang on, Billy. Nailed it again. Who indeed would want to drink from the infected schooner glass of the NSW coach? It seems Laurie Daley or Macbeth are the only viable high-powered options standing at the bar. Former Blues coach Laurie Daley was a bit of a rugby league nerd even in his playing days. Credit: SMH The thought of Daley potentially returning next year to “right the wrongs” that led to his sacking - and Brad Fittler ’s appointment - in 2017 provides a nice enough storyline. After conjuring a series victory against Queensland in 2014 with a manifestly inferior team, Daley lost three consecutive series, had his contract extended by NSWRL chief executive David Trodden , then had it ripped up by a board who knew change was needed. Back then, Daley was coaching against a team featuring players such as Billy Slater and Cameron Smith . If he returns, he’ll be duelling with them again, although this time as coaches. Daley wants to do whatever he can to help the Blues, such is the quality of the man. When Fittler approached him recently about joining his staff, Daley agreed without really knowing what Fittler had in mind. After six years of poring his heart and soul into the job with mixed success, Fittler walked away after being dumped squarely on his bottom by NSWRL powerbrokers. They wanted him to clean out his coaching staff, which he did. He wanted a two-year extension, but they wanted one year, to which he eventually agreed. Then they told him, out of nowhere, the job was being reduced to a part-time role for a reduced amount of money, so he walked. NSWRL chairman Paul Conlon has been jabbering for months about how poorly Fittler has been treated by the Sydney media following back-to-back series losses, accusing reporters of having an “agenda” against him. I suspect few have hurt Fittler more than the NSWRL, which had his back right up until the moment when it didn’t. The comical last line of last week’s media release announcing Fittler’s departure says it all: “The NSWRL board will now invite expressions of interest from coaches to be involved in the State of Origin program in 2024.” It might have to advertise on Seek.com given how many potential replacements have run for the hills. The edict about not picking club coaches has been abandoned, throwing open the door for the likes of Ricky Stuart , Craig Bellamy and Ivan Cleary . Yet none of them are prepared to take on the job, which is understandable because of the time and energy required of both roles. That leaves Daley as the last man standing. He recently extended his deal to co-host the Big Sports Breakfast on Sky Sports Radio for a further two years. The NRL stopped him from working as a consultant at Manly late last year because the network is owned by the TAB, a wagering operator. But Daley would be employed by the NSWRL and not the NRL. The question, though, is why would he want to do it? Why drink from the poisoned chalice that has spooked so many of his contemporaries? Coaching the Blues for the next few years, against the likes of Slater and Smith coaching the likes of Cameron Munster, Reece Walsh and Kalyn Ponga , already feels like a Shakespearean tragedy in the making. But Daley conjured miracles in 2014 and could do it again in this second coming. Now, that would be something to write about. Exactly how much did the NBL’s billionaire owner Larry Kestleman pay for retired Chicago Bulls star Scottie Pippen to preach the gospel of basketball in Australia last weekend? Reports a few weeks ago put the number as high as $1.2 million, a figure the NBL denies, but various sources, who did not want to be named because the matter is confidential, have confirmed it cost $700,000 to secure the six-time NBA champion as an official ambassador. Not bad for a handful of appearances over five days, including the AFL and NRL grand finals, while partying with former Bulls teammate Luc Longley . The NBL identified more than a year ago that it needed to think outside the square to promote its opening round on a weekend dominated by the big dances of the two major football codes. Wearing a shirt sporting the NBL logo, Pippen was interviewed before the AFL grand final and halftime in the NRL decider. Pippen and Longley courtside for the NBL season-opener between Melbourne United and South East Melbourne Phoenix. Credit: Getty Images “Two great events,” Pippen told Joel Caine in a podcast for SEN Radio. “If I had to pick one, I’d say the AFL. It was a little more exciting; something I felt I could’ve played if I had started playing it younger.” Pippen also did the obligatory spin around Sydney Harbour on a luxury yacht on Monday, sipping straight vodkas while pressing the flesh with select media and VIP guests. The idea to recruit Pippen was a resounding success: there was a 40 per cent increase in TV audience compared to last year and record crowd attendance. It’s a proactive step from a proactive league that wants to make the most of this country’s booming interest in basketball, aided by a steady flow of talent to the NBA via the NBL. Pippen will return in February to promote the league, although he might need to freshen up on its name. “It’s great to be hanging out in his country promoting the NBDL [sic],” he told Caine, who replied: “It’s OK. It’s day five.” When all else fails, there’s delusion. How else to explain Rugby Australia’s response to news that Wallabies coach Eddie Jones has been Zooming with the enemy? RA’s response to reports in this masthead about Jones speaking to Japanese rugby was to offer Roosters back-rower Angus Crichton a two-year deal before withdrawing it just days later following a backlash from the broader rugby community. The Roosters reject claims they need Crichton to depart because of salary-cap pressure, although he doesn’t seem to be a big part of their plans from next year. As for suggestions Joseph Suaalii might backflip on his mega-deal struck earlier this year, the Roosters would entertain the idea but retaining him at market value under the salary cap would be tricky because the bulk of his $5 million deal with rugby is covered in third-party agreements. Your humble columnist’s piece earlier in the week about athletes such as Broncos star Reece Walsh being unfairly targeted by young fans wielding mobile phone cameras prompted a range of reader responses — including some who thought I actually wanted him sanctioned for wearing Pit Viper sunglasses, which is wildly incorrect. Certainly, younger fans are feeling more emboldened than ever before to tell their football heroes what they think of them — or what their parents think. Last week, South Sydney fullback Latrell Mitchell was at Heffron Park when he approached a young fan who was watching from the sidelines. “I don’t want to shake your hand because Dad reckons you’re the reason we lose games,” the boy, who looked about six, told him. Kids these days.

It’s a big weekend for … the Wallabies, who need Portugal to beat Fiji by eight points or more to avoid being the first Australian side to bomb out of the Rugby World Cup in the pool stage. Maybe this has been Eddie’s genius plan all along. It’s an even bigger weekend for … the Australian cricket team, who start their ODI World Cup campaign on Sunday night against host nations India at the MA Chidambaram stadium in Chennai.

Rachin Ravindra (123 not out) and Devon Conway (152 not out) were the stars of the day for the Back Caps. In response to England’s 282/9, New Zealand crossed the target in merely 36.2 overs to make a great start to the tournament. New Zealand lost Will Young to a first-ball duck early on in their innings. However, this brought in Ravindra, who joined forces with Conway to light up the first Powerplay. The Black Caps hit 13 fours and two sixes in the first Powerplay. Both the sixes came from Ravindra’s bat, one against Mark Wood and the other against Moeen Ali. Having helped New Zealand to 81/1 in the first Powerplay, the duo didn’t relent and maintained the scoring rate closer to eight over the next few overs. They also achieved their personal landmarks of half-centuries in the 12th and 13th overs respectively. The scoring rate dropped a tad bit after the drinks break, but Conway and Ravindra got back into the groove soon after. Their unbeaten stand of 177 runs (at the 25-over mark) was already the highest partnership for two New Zealand batters in a Cricket World Cup encounter. They overtook the 168-run stand between Chris Harris and Lee Germon from 1996. The duo continued their unstoppable run after the midway mark. They reached their respective tons during their stand as well. This was Conway’s fifth and Ravindra’s maiden ODI hundred. As the duo closed in on the target, the England bowling lost its edge. They managed to overhaul the total in the 37th over. Earlier, England were restricted to 282/9 at the back of a brilliant 3/48 from Matt Henry and meaningful contributions from Mitchell Santner (2/37) and Glenn Phillips (2/17). During the England innings, the arrival of Jos Buttler in the 22nd over lifted the scoring rate. The England skipper took some time to get his eye in, and then went after the bowlers. His first boundary came against Ravindra, whom he carted over the rope in the 27th over. Thereafter, he kept his foot on the pedal and smashed two fours and two sixes in his innings. It seemed like the game was running away from New Zealand, but then Henry returned to get Buttler caught behind for 43. England kept up their attacking strategy, even as Joe Root and Liam Livingstone tried to go for their runs. However, incisive bowling from the Black Cap bowlers ensured that the batting side never ran away with the game. So Livingstone fell to Boult in the 39th over and Root was cleaned up by the golden arm of Glenn Phillips, when he misplayed a reverse sweep in the 42nd over. Despite regular breakthroughs from New Zealand bowlers in the final powerplay, England managed to reach 282 at the back of an unbeaten 30-run 10th wicket partnership between Adil Rashid and Mark Wood. This was the first-ever occasion that all the eleven batters in a side had reached double figures. When England walked out to bat Jonny Bairstow began their title defence in style, hitting a six off the very second ball of the game. He lifted a wayward Trent Boult delivery that drifted down the legside, into the stands. He unleashed an attacking range of shots to keep England closer to run a ball. His partner Dawid Malan, however, found the going tough against the Kiwi pacers. Malan eventually nicked one behind off Henry in the eighth over. Trying to keep up the scoring rate, the England batters kept going for their shots. This included an unconventional reverse scoop from Joe Root, which went behind the keeper’s head for a six. However, New Zealand managed to get a hold of things in the second powerplay. Bairstow (33) fell to Santner in the 13th over. On the other hand, Harry Brook (25) went for one shot too many in Ravindra’s first over, and gifted a catch in the deep midwicket region after having hit 4, 4, 6 off the last three deliveries. England’s scoring rate was further stifled after they lost Moeen to the off-spin of Phillips. Brief scores: England 282/9 in 50 overs (Joe Root 77, Jos Buttler 43; Matt Henry 3/48, Mitchell Santner 2/37) vs New Zealand 283/1 (Devon Conway 152, Rachin Ravindra 123; Sam Curran 1/47) win by 9 wickets.","pubDate":"2023-10-05 17:41:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"sambadenglish","source_priority":332200,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"00d5b1e651e0098e941ecd96a5f645d0","title":"Cricket World Cup’s empty stands and ticket turmoil fuel existential crisis | Ali Martin","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/oct/05/england-and-the-world-cup-make-timid-start-in-cavernous-stadium","keywords":["Cricket World Cup 2023","England cricket team","New Zealand cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Ali Martin"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand were spectacular, England were timid and even Tendulkar couldn’t stop tournament starting with a whimperThey say you never get a second chance to make a first impression and in that respect, both England and the Cricket World Cup’s organisers will hope theirs is not a lasting one.This was a perky start to the tournament on the field at least, a resourceful New Zealand side brushing off injuries to three key men and serving up the dish best served cold.

This was a perky start to the tournament on the field at least, a resourceful New Zealand side brushing off injuries to three key men and serving up the dish best served cold. After the barest of margins at Lord’s in 2019 came a hammering in the sequel, the stand-in captain, Tom Latham, marshalling an attack padded out with part-timers before Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra ransacked a target of 283 in only 36.2 overs. New Zealand crush England in World Cup opener after explosive run chase Read more Conway is an old hand in these parts, his unbeaten 121-ball 152 very much forged in the heat of his Indian Premier League experience. Ravindra made for a simply delightful story. Aged just 23 and thus the youngest player among two ageing sides, the Wellington left-hander’s 123 not out from 96 put his name up in lights in the country of his parents. All told it was some statement, neatly summed up by Conway registering New Zealand’s fastest World Cup century from 83 balls only to see it fall to his apprentice by one ball moments later. And it will probably have been welcomed by the officials in the ground after the scenes that were beamed around the world earlier in the day. Sure, we got Sachin Tendulkar escorting the trophy out to the middle before the toss at the Narendra Modi Stadium, his suit sharp and his hair remarkably luxuriant. The little master looks in excellent nick aged 50, as if he could simply buckle up those trademark old pads, pick up that railway sleeper of a bat and peel off another frictionless century. We also had the reassuringly familiar sounds of Ian Smith, Nasser Hussain and Ian Bishop to start with on commentary. Having deftly shepherded folks through that stomach-churning finale four years ago, the trio’s reunion in the box very much added to the rematch vibe that the International Cricket Council was so keen to riff on. But all this appeared to be occurring in a vacuum. No sport does an existential crisis quite like cricket and at a time when the 50-over format’s future is being debated – despite television rights having already been sold until the men’s ODI World Cup in 2031 – the sight of empty orange stands for the first ball was more fuel to the fire.

If the ICC is to be believed, this ended up as a record crowd for an opening match in a men’s 50-over World Cup; a final gate of more than 47,000 but in a 135,000-capacity stadium. The day-time temperatures were clearly a factor in those early optics, the handful who were present sticking to the shadier parts and the majority not arriving until the mercury had dropped. And for all the love of cricket in India, even factoring in the greater ubiquity created by the IPL’s rise, it was always wildly optimistic that a ground that holds more than Lord’s, Edgbaston, Headingley, Old Trafford and the Oval combined – the largest sporting arena outside of North Korea, no less – would be a good fit for these two teams. You also have to go back to 1996 for the last time the hosts did not start the tournament (England versus New Zealand in Ahmedabad, as it happens, with a good few in at the start that day). It was strange therefore that India were not deployed to light the touchpaper, with Rohit Sharma’s favourites not starting until Sunday’s encounter with Australia in Chennai. But even accepting the illusion of a regular crowd looking poor in a gargantuan stadium, it still wasn’t a great look and followed some questionable organisation. Though seemingly not exorbitant price-wise, tickets were not placed on sale until 25 August – only 41 days ago. And the fixtures themselves weren’t released until a month before that and have been tinkered with since, sowing further doubt in the minds of potential attendees. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The impression given here, accurate or otherwise, is of the Board of Control for Cricket in India not massively caring. Reports of spectators arriving on the day and being told they needed to travel to a hotel some 20 minutes away to collect tickets only added to this. The same cannot be said of England but they played nothing like defending champions. Jos Buttler brushed off that term, in fact, insisting his players wanted to attack this tournament. The upshot? A timid performance that was so brutally swept aside by the end it could easily come back to haunt them should net run-rate enter the equation. As for New Zealand, not for the first time they have entered a global tournament slightly unfancied and, going by first impressions, this is once again looking questionable.","pubDate":"2023-10-05 17:11:38","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9af350d76ee61a7acaece4e0f54f5e5a8288a66d/0_225_4401_2640/master/4401.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5a76ac1bc8603d23d3e26eee6cd4439c","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["india","canada","united kingdom","singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"6dd7bfd6f1402208b2dfbf0b462533a3","title":"Azharuddin barred from contesting HCA polls","link":"https://telanganatoday.com/azharuddin-barred-from-contesting-hca-polls","keywords":["Hyderabad","News","Sport","Top Section","Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA)","Mohd Azharuddin"],"creator":["IANS"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Supreme Court-appointed committee has disqualified former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin from contesting the ensuing elections to the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA).","content":"Home | Hyderabad | Azharuddin Barred From Contesting Hca Polls Azharuddin barred from contesting HCA polls The Supreme Court-appointed committee has disqualified former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin from contesting the ensuing elections to the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA). By IANS Published Date - 10:22 PM, Thu - 5 October 23 File photo Hyderabad: The Supreme Court-appointed committee has disqualified former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin from contesting the ensuing elections to the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA). Former Supreme Court judge Justice L. Nageswara Rao removed the former cricketer from the list of voters for HCA polls scheduled this month on the grounds of conflict of interest as he was president of the Deccan Blues Cricket Club while serving as the president of HCA till early this year. Nageswara Rao wrote to Azharuddin that he was removed from the voter list on the basis of the order passed by him on July 31, 2023. “According to the order dated 31-07-2023, all the executive committee members of clubs in which a person/his family members are involved in the management of multiple clubs have been disqualified to either vote/contest in the ensuing elections to the HCA for one term or a period of three years, whichever is greater. “As you are the President of Deccan Blue Cricket Club according to the information received by the Single Member Committee, you have been disqualified and not included in the voter’s list,” reads the letter. The letter mentions that on September 30, 2022, the supervisory committee appointed by the Supreme Court had asked Azharuddin to collect information relating to the details of all registered clubs which are members of the HCA. In the letter dated October 10, 2022 sent by Deccan Blues Cricket Club secretary P.R. Man Singh, Azharuddin was shown as president of the Deccan Blues Cricket Club. HCA elections are scheduled to be held on October 20. Electoral officer V.S. Sampath issued the notification on September 30 for the elections for the posts of president, vice-president, secretary, joint secretary, treasurer and councilor. The elections were supposed to be held in September 2022 but was postponed due to court cases. In February this year, the Supreme Court appointed Nageswara Rao as a single-member committee to manage HCA and facilitate the conduct of elections. In July, he debarred more than 57 clubs from participating or voting in the HCA elections for three years because of conflict of interest/owning multiple clubs. On August 7, he appointed former Chief Election Commissioner Sampath as the election officer. Azharuddin was elected HCA president in 2019 and his term ended with Nageswara Rao’s appointment by the Supreme Court. Azahruddin’s term saw infighting in the HCA and the warring groups approaching the Telangana High Court. The matter finally reached the Supreme Court, which constituted the one-member committed to clear the mess. Azharuddin had already announced that he will again contest for the post of HCA president.

During the match opening ceremony of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023, Coca-Cola India and ICC introduced National Flags made from post-consumer PET bottles. These PET bottles were recycled to produce yarn which was subsequently used for the flags. These flags will be used during the ‘national anthem ceremony’ before each match takes place in the stadiums. Heralding a new era of environmental responsibility, Coca-Cola India has enabled creation of national flags of the ten playing nations, and ten ICC unity flags. This makes Coca-Cola India the first company in the world to introduce recycled PET national flags in the sport of cricket, setting a precedent for future events. Approximately, 11,000 PET bottles were used for creating one national flag and approximately 2000 bottles were used to create an ICC Unity Flag. The flags are manufactured by GoRevise by Ganesha Ecoverse Limited which is engaged in manufacturing recycled yarn and garments. A dedicated team of 100 workers devoted 25 days and over 300 hours to bring these magnificent flags to life. Thums Up and Limca Sportz are the official beverage and sports drink partners for the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup India 2023. Coca-Cola India will undertake many activations during the World Cup, including online and offline fan and consumer engagements, to build awareness around waste management. Arnab Roy, Vice President, Marketing, Coca-Cola India & Southwest Asia, “Coca Cola ahas a mission to support sustainability efforts as an integral part of all sporting events. Aligned with this mission, we take pride in unveiling national flags made with recycled PET at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 today. With these recycled national and ICC Unity flags we are dedicated to advancing the principles of a circular economy.” With sports being an integral part of both the organisation’s DNA and cricket being the biggest sporting in India, Coca-Cola India and ICC are committed to creating a sustainable sporting experience in this world cup.","pubDate":"2023-10-05 16:36:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehansindia","source_priority":58957,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
