Additionally, it raised quite a few eyebrows by overlooking names such as Prithvi Shaw and Sarfaraz Khan, who have been setting the domestic circuit on fire with one blazing knock after another.What also did not go unnoticed was the absence of two senior players across the white-ball squads for the New Zealand and Bangladesh tours ‚Äî Ravichandran Ashwin and Dinesh Karthik, both of whom have been getting regular game time in the ongoing T20 World Cup, and both having fought their way back after getting dropped from the white-ball setup.That perhaps is the selectors‚Äô way of sending a message for the veteran Tamil Nadu duo, that maybe the time has come for the team to look past them when it comes to the shorter formats, and they should focus on franchise and domestic cricket, or in Ashwin‚Äôs case, the Test format.Selection reviews feat Indian cricketers pic.twitter.com/rAkk7dpTfC‚Äî mon (@4sacinom) October 31, 2022 Ashwin remains indispensable in India‚Äôs Test plans and is a tried-and-tested match-winner in home conditions. And credit should also go to him for reinventing himself in the shorter formats. Not only did Ashwin work on his variations, practicing leg-breaks in the nets besides his carrom balls and the stock off-breaks, he had also improved himself as a batter in the limited-overs cricket, forcing the selectors to sit up and take notice and even pick him over a more established limited-overs bowler such as Yuzvendra Chahal.Karthik too made a dream comeback in 2022, setting the stage on fire for Royal Challengers Bangalore during the IPL and playing a key role in its run to the playoffs, which in turn led to a clamour for his selection in the Indian team in its build-up to the World Cup. And in the first T20I against South Africa on 9 June, Karthik made his first appearance in the blue jersey since the 2019 World Cup semi-final against New Zealand. The dream would later be complete with his name featuring in India‚Äôs squad for the T20 World Cup Down Under.üó£Ô∏è üó£Ô∏è Mr. @chetans1987, Chairman, All-India Senior Selection Committee speaks about how the workload management of the players is approached. #TeamIndia pic.twitter.com/RIYIHqslIN‚Äî BCCI (@BCCI) October 31, 2022Age, however, is not on their side and the pressure on an athlete increases drastically as the years go by when he or she goes past the 30-mark. Not everyone is able to maintain peak fitness and deliver on the field beyond 35 as Pakistan‚Äôs Misbah-ul-Haq did in the twilight of his career, or as the English pace duo of James Anderson and Stuart Broad are still doing with astonishing consistency.And the toll that the bygone years are taking on the senior players is visible ‚Äî as great a bowler he is and despite his exceptional game awareness, Ashwin becomes something of a liability on the field, and the batters have shown a preference for targeting the area where he is positioned to get an extra run or three. One would then have to make up for this shortcoming with extraordinary performances with the ball, but Ashwin‚Äôs numbers in T20Is in the last three months (6 wickets; ave: 47.33; eco: 7.28) don‚Äôt exactly make him an indispensable member of the side.Always great to have such fans in the stands‚Ä¶it excites us like nothing else ‚ô•Ô∏èüôèüèª https://t.co/e6lB6j97V2‚Äî DK (@DineshKarthik) October 27, 2022A similar trend can be seen with DK, who has only added to the pressure on himself with poor outings against Pakistan and South Africa and also injured himself while keeping against the Proteas which has thrown his participation in the crunch game against Bangladesh into doubt and has possibly reopened the door for Rishabh Pant.And given the sheer competition for wicketkeeping slots in Indian cricket at the moment, with the likes of Ishan Kishan and Sanju Samson also waiting in the wings besides Pant, it is always going to be tough for Karthik to stay relevant for too long.‚ÄúIt is not like that [the selectors are looking for other finishers]. The World Cup is going on and this is more about load management. We are focusing on who to rest and who to play. And the way he came to our side and the way he performed, he is always available to selectors but in the T20I games immediately after the World Cup, we are looking to try a different set of players.‚ÄúOtherwise, the doors are open for him and he‚Äôs a brilliant player,‚Äù chief selector and former seamer Chetan Sharma had said following the announcement of the squads, justifying the decision to overlook the senior duo.For now, Ashwin and Karthik will have to make the most of whatever opportunities they get in the remainder of the India‚Äôs campaign Down Under, and hope those performances at least keep them in the selectors‚Äô radar in the early months of 2023.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

This tournament has been pretty challenging,\" Dravid said while addressing reporters at the press conference on Tuesday. \"I thought he was superb -- maybe a lot of you were not there, but in the practice game against Australia with Mitchell Starc and Patrick Cummins. It was a pretty good attack, and I thought he batted superbly that day, to get 50 or 60. I'm not sure exactly how much. Quite a few,\" added Dravid in the same conference.The former India captain went on to add that Rahul is \"actually playing well\" and they are aware that Rahul is \"really well suited for these kinds of conditions, these kinds of pitches.\"\"So he's actually playing really well. Just hoping it all clicks together over the next three or four games, and yeah, we know his quality, we know his ability, and he's really well suited for these kinds of conditions, these kinds of pitches. He's got a good all-around game. He's got a very good strong back-foot game which is obviously very much required in these conditions.\"So yeah, we're pretty confident and happy with the way he's hitting it,\" Dravid said further.KL Rahul at the Adelaide indoor nets pic.twitter.com/1IvolLBiyb‚Äî Vikrant Gupta (@vikrantgupta73) November 1, 2022 Speaking of the conversations with Rahul, Dravid revealed that the team has not faltered in his confidence in him.\"It's hard to get into exact details of what conversations you have with your players, but rest assured, I think both in words and in action, I think over the last year he knows he has our support. He's known that.\"There's been a lot of clarity about what our side is going to be, what our squad is going to be coming into this tournament, and we haven't wavered from that for a very long time. Yes, because we play a lot of cricket, you might see a lot of different people playing in different situations, in different games. There have been a lot of injuries, including him. He's had phases where he's unfortunately been injured,\" the head coach said.T20 World Cup 2022: A call on DK will be taken closer to the game, says Rahul DravidIn India's previous match in the T20 World Cup 2022, which ended in a loss against South Africa, wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik walked off because of an injury, making way for Rishabh Pant to don the gloves. Dravid confirmed on Tuesday that Karthik was fine and the management would take a call to whether to play him or not closer to the game.\"He's pulled up pretty well today. It was unfortunate to have that spasm when he jumped to collect a bouncer. I think when he landed badly, he landed in a way that I think he just hurt his back a little bit. But with treatment this morning he's pulled up pretty well. He's come to training. So we'll be assessing it. \"We'll see how it goes, and we'll see how he pulls up tomorrow morning after a good practice session today. We'll put him through his paces and ensure that we've given him a good workout and then see how he pulls up tomorrow morning before making a final decision,\" added Dravid.Speaking of India's death bowling, Dravid says it was encouraging to see youngsters like Arshdeep Singh step up on occasion.\"Look, it's an area of our game that we've wanted to look to address, to look to get better at. Obviously, Bums [Jasprit Bumrah] was one of our guys who was penciled into bowl two of those overs. It was really heartening for us to see the way young Arshdeep Singh has developed over the last few months.\"If you were to ask me in November when I first took over and I had a list of bowlers in my mind, sure, Arshdeep was there, but he was -- certainly he hadn't had that kind of IPL. He had had one good IPL. But the way he's come along after that, he's come and forced his way into the side and done really well. So that's a fantastically heartening thing to see,\" India's head coach said further.India respect Bangladesh a lot, we believe they are a good team says DravidMeanwhile, Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan shocked everyone when he said if his side were to beat India, it would be an upset. Reacting to the same, Dravid said that this World Cup has shown that one cannot take any team lightly.\"I think we respect them a lot. I think they're a very good team. I think this format and this World Cup has really shown us that honestly, you can't take any team lightly. Ireland showed that against England. We've seen enough games in this competition,\" Dravid, who succeeded Ravi Shastri as head coach, said.\"I think the fact that it is already such a short format. 20 overs is such a short format of the game. The margins of victory and defeat sometimes even if they're 12 runs, or 15 runs, it's actually just two hits. It's two hits one way or the other, and actually, that's the game. So it is already a shortened sort of rushed, noisy format, but it's very difficult to sometimes say who's a clear favourite in some of these games. \"On top of that, I think these conditions. I think these conditions have actually leveled the playing field to a large extent because the boundaries are certainly bigger, and some of those big hits which you sometimes expect in the subcontinent to just go for six and you just know that I'll be able to make up those runs, later on, it's not happening that easily. People are getting out,\" explained Dravid.\"I think it's really been a fantastic tournament from that perspective. Apart from the weather, I think it's been a terrific tournament in terms of just the nature of the games. No, we certainly don't take Bangladesh lightly. Our preparation, our planning will be as meticulous as it was against South Africa at Perth. No different,\" said Dravid.Following their loss to South Africa on Sunday (Oct. 30), India have dropped to second place in the Group 2 table. A victory against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in the last two games will take them through to the semis.Touchdown Adelaide üìç #TeamIndia | #T20WorldCup pic.twitter.com/l6GalMP0TI‚Äî BCCI (@BCCI) October 31, 2022 India and Bangladesh are scheduled to face off against each other on Wednesday (Nov. 1) at Adelaide Oval.","pubDate":"2022-11-01 15:57:08","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/11/01/500x300_1318724-kl-rahul.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup 2022: Over 90,293 at Melbourne Cricket Ground unite for Indian National Anthem | WATCH VIDEO","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup-2022-over-90-293-at-melbourne-cricket-ground-unite-for-indian-national-anthem-watch-video-2022-11-01-820565","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"T20 World Cup 2022: It is a no-brainer that cricket is a religion in India and it unites the nation like nothing else does.

It was a fanfare when India clashed with Pakistan on October 23, 2022, at the mighty Melbourne Cricket Ground. The men in blue playing the boys in green is always a special occasion and somehow invokes a sense of pride & patriotism in cricket fans. Due to political conflicts, India doesn't play Pakistan that often except for ICC (International Cricket Council) ICC events and the Asia Cup. In the 2021 edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, Pakistan defeated India by a margin of 10 wickets, but this was payback time. All of us saw how emotional was when the Indian National Anthem ended. He could feel the pride, the euphoria, the joy of representing the country and leading his troops on the biggest stage of them all, the stage of the T20 World Cup. It was not only Rohit Sharma who was singing the national, anthem that day but it was also a crowd of over 90,000 people who joined him and shared the moment. Recently, a video has been doing the rounds of social media where Indian fans are singing the Indian National Anthem. Even if you watch it on your screens, it is almost given that it is enough to give you goosebumps. In one of the greatest T20 matches ever played, the Rohit Sharma-led team India etched ahead of arch-rivals Pakistan by a margin of 4 wickets as they settled scores with them. Former India captain played one blinder of an innings as he snatched victory from the jaws of defeat that left and his team flabbergasted. The Indian team is one of the strongest contenders to win the trophy and they now take on Bangladesh on November 2, 2022, at the Adelaide Oval.","pubDate":"2022-11-01 15:54:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup: Jos Buttler surpasses Eoin Morgan to become England's leading T20I run-scorer","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/t20-world-cup-jos-buttler-surpasses-eoin-morgan-to-become-englands-leading-t20i-run-scorer-11553391.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["Rachit Kanaujia"],"video_url":null,"description":"T20 World Cup: Jos Buttler surpasses Eoin Morgan to become England's leading T20I run-scorer","content":"England skipper Jos Buttler has become the highest-run scorer for his country in the T20I format. The batter accomplished this record during his side‚Äôs crucial Group 1, Super 12 match of the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup in Brisbane.In the match, Buttler struck a delightful 73 of 47 balls. After disappointing in two matches, England‚Äôs star played a vital knock and formed an 81-run stand for the first wicket with Alex Hales (52).He has overtaken former England captain Eoin Morgan. In 100 matches, Buttler has 2,468 runs at an average of 33.80. He has scored a century and 18 half-centuries in the format. His best score in T20Is is 101*.Morgan, who retired from international cricket in June this year, had scored 2,458 runs at an average of 28.58 in 107 innings in 115 matches. He scored 14 half-centuries in the format and the best individual score was 91.Other top England batters in T20I cricket are: Alex Hales (1,940), Dawid Malan (1,748), and Jason Roy (1,522).Buttler is now among the top 10 run-scorers in T20I cricket. The top five run scorers in format are: Indian star Virat Kohli (3,868), Indian skipper Rohit Sharma (3,809), New Zealand opener Martin Guptill (3,531), Pakistan skipper Babar Azam (3,239) and Irish opener Paul Stirling (3,144).With this win, England has climbed to the second spot in the points table with five points and two wins in four games. They have lost a match and a match was abandoned due to rains. New Zealand are still at the top with five points, with two wins in four matches. Just like England, they also have endured a loss and one of their matches was abandoned.Defending champions Australia have slipped down to the third position after England‚Äôs win. Though all three have five points each, a better net run rate has ensured that New Zealand and England are ahead.Electing to bat first, England posted 179/6 in their 20 overs. An 81-run stand for the first wicket between skipper Jos Buttler (73) and Alex Hales (52) proved to be instrumental in posting a competitive total on the board, even though Kiwis bowled better in death overs and put a halt to England‚Äôs momentum with some wickets.Lockie Ferguson was the lead bowler for the Kiwis, taking two wickets. Sodhi, Southee and Santner took a wicket each for the Kiwis.Chasing 180, Kiwis lost two early wickets for 28 runs, following which Kane Williamson (40) and Phillips (62) had a 91-run stand for the third wicket. But after breaking the stand, England managed to pull back the game slowly.Phillips‚Äô wicket in the 18th over shifted the tide completely in England‚Äôs favour with the New Zealand team required to make 45 runs in the last 15 balls. New Zealand finished at 159/6 and fell short by 20 runs.Pacers Sam Curran (2/26) and Chris Woakes (2/33) were impressive for England. Ben Stokes and Mark Wood also picked a wicket each.Buttler‚Äôs match-winning 73 earned him the ‚ÄòMan of the Match‚Äô award.Brief Scores: England: 179/6 in 20 overs (Jos Buttler 73, Alex Hales 52, Lockie Ferguson 2/45) vs New Zealand 159/6 (Glenn Phillips 62, Kane Williamson 40; Sam Curran 2-26).","pubDate":"2022-11-01 15:37:26","image_url":"https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/380x285/fixed/jpg/2022/11/Jos-Buttler-England-vs-New-Zealand-T20-World-Cup.jpg","source_id":"firstpost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Adelaide Oval dimensions: Adelaide Oval boundary length and ground size for international cricket","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-adelaide-oval-dimensions-adelaide-oval-boundary-length-and-ground-size-for-international-cricket/","keywords":["Cricket","Adelaide Oval","ICC T20 World Cup 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Cricketing action at the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 will move to South Australia‚Äôs capital city Adelaide on Wednesday, as the race towards semi-final qualification intensifies.

In its most basic form, powerplay is the term given to a set of overs which restricts fielders. During a powerplay in a T20 match in cricket, only two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle for the first six overs.

However, they are still not out of the tournament, and there are some permutations and combinations left for them. The defending champions Australia were one of the favourite teams to win in the tournament as they were playing in their home conditions, and they had almost a similar squad as last year. However, the defeat against New Zealand hampered their chances on the very first day. ALSO READ: Steve Smith ready to play against Afghanistan Australia‚Äôs NRR took a huge blow when New Zealand defeated them by 89 runs at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The match between Australia and England got abandoned due to rain. Let‚Äôs have a look at the possible chances of Australia in the T20 World Cup 2022. Is Australia out of T20 World Cup 2022 The Group 1 of the Super-12 stage of the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 has reached a very interesting stage. All three of Australia, New Zealand and England are tied at 5 points at the moment after playing 4 games each. The top 2 teams of the group will qualify for the semi-final of the tournament. Australia will face Afghanistan in their last match, whereas England and New Zealand will face Sri Lanka and Ireland, respectively. It is safe to say that all three of Australia, England and New Zealand are the favourites to win their respective matches. In that case, all the teams will be tied at 7 points, and the NRR will come into play. Australia‚Äôs (-0.304) NRR is quite less than that of New Zealand (+2.233) and England (+0.547). It will require almost a miraculous effort for the Australian team to qualify for the semi-final if all three of the teams win their remaining game. The realistic chance for the Australian team is to win their game against Afghanistan and pray that New Zealand or England can drop points in their respective matches.
