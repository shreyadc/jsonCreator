first series victory of 2025. The Blackcaps proved to be too good for the visitors, and now have much-needed momentum ahead of the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025.Series secured! An all round performance with the ball led by Will O'Rourke (3-31 from 6.2 overs) helps claim the Chemist Warehouse ODI series with a game to spare. Scorecard | https://t.co/Yebpn1QwRR üì≤ #NZvSL #CricketNation pic.twitter.com/gvDUu2OxTb‚Äî BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS) January 8, 2025It was a rain-affected fixture at th Seddon Park in Hamilton, as the home side produced a masterclass in batting bowling to seal a 113-run victory, leaving the visitors a lot of questions to answer ahead of the third and final ODI.Here's What The Two Captains Said During Post-Match Presentation CeremonyCharith Asalanka (Sri Lanka Captain):\"It's a par score on small grounds. We batted poorly in the powerplay which cost us the game. We are able to do it well in T20s but not in ODIs. We need to quickly find a way to get going. We would have done little better with the overcast conditions. I expected 2-3 early wickets in the powerplay but we couldn't do that. Credit goes to the New Zealand bowlers. Comeback is the key and we have to get up from here.\"Mitchell Santner (New Zealand Captain):\"Yeah I can't complaint to be honest. I think we opened up pretty well at the start. We lost wickets but we ended up with a great score. The bowlers stepped up for us so a good day overall. Yeah I think 255 was a very competitive total. We were targeting the 280 mark but they bowled really well in the death overs. They made it challenging for us to score in the fag end.\"\"Our bowlers bowled really well. The seamers enjoyed bowling in this surface. Bashing in on the wicket and they got their reward. Yeah for sure, the 3rd ODI is also very important because we have to keep in mind the conditions in Pakistan. We will have a few guys in our side those who will go to Pakistan.\"","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-01-08 13:28:12","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/01/08/7f42f21fde8054f533472e8a42e53a341736342004090901_original.jpg","source_id":"abplive","source_priority":7754,"source_name":"Abp News","source_url":"http://abplive.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/abplive.jpg","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"e011ae290aa623c684ca555d77dee155","title":"Afghanistan appoint Younis Khan as mentor for Champions Trophy","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/afghanistan-appoint-younis-khan-as-mentor-for-champions-trophy/articleshow/117057611.cms","keywords":null,"creator":["TOI Sports Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Pakistan skipper Younis Khan has been appointed as Afghanistan cricket team's mentor for the 2025 Champions Trophy, beginning February 19.

first series victory of 2025. The Blackcaps proved to be too good for the visitors, and now have much-needed momentum ahead of the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025.Series secured! An all round performance with the ball led by Will O'Rourke (3-31 from 6.2 overs) helps claim the Chemist Warehouse ODI series with a game to spare. Scorecard | https://t.co/Yebpn1QwRR üì≤ #NZvSL #CricketNation pic.twitter.com/gvDUu2OxTb‚Äî BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS) January 8, 2025It was a rain-affected fixture at th Seddon Park in Hamilton, as the home side produced a masterclass in batting bowling to seal a 113-run victory, leaving the visitors a lot of questions to answer ahead of the third and final ODI.Here's What The Two Captains Said During Post-Match Presentation CeremonyCharith Asalanka (Sri Lanka Captain):\"It's a par score on small grounds. We batted poorly in the powerplay which cost us the game. We are able to do it well in T20s but not in ODIs. We need to quickly find a way to get going. We would have done little better with the overcast conditions. I expected 2-3 early wickets in the powerplay but we couldn't do that. Credit goes to the New Zealand bowlers. Comeback is the key and we have to get up from here.\"Mitchell Santner (New Zealand Captain):\"Yeah I can't complaint to be honest. I think we opened up pretty well at the start. We lost wickets but we ended up with a great score. The bowlers stepped up for us so a good day overall. Yeah I think 255 was a very competitive total. We were targeting the 280 mark but they bowled really well in the death overs. They made it challenging for us to score in the fag end.\"\"Our bowlers bowled really well. The seamers enjoyed bowling in this surface. Bashing in on the wicket and they got their reward. Yeah for sure, the 3rd ODI is also very important because we have to keep in mind the conditions in Pakistan. We will have a few guys in our side those who will go to Pakistan.\"","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-01-08 13:28:12","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/01/08/7f42f21fde8054f533472e8a42e53a341736342004090901_original.jpg","source_id":"abplive","source_priority":7754,"source_name":"Abp News","source_url":"http://abplive.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/abplive.jpg","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"e011ae290aa623c684ca555d77dee155","title":"Afghanistan appoint Younis Khan as mentor for Champions Trophy","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/afghanistan-appoint-younis-khan-as-mentor-for-champions-trophy/articleshow/117057611.cms","keywords":null,"creator":["TOI Sports Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Pakistan skipper Younis Khan has been appointed as Afghanistan cricket team's mentor for the 2025 Champions Trophy, beginning February 19.

first series victory of 2025. The Blackcaps proved to be too good for the visitors, and now have much-needed momentum ahead of the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025.Series secured! An all round performance with the ball led by Will O'Rourke (3-31 from 6.2 overs) helps claim the Chemist Warehouse ODI series with a game to spare. Scorecard | https://t.co/Yebpn1QwRR üì≤ #NZvSL #CricketNation pic.twitter.com/gvDUu2OxTb‚Äî BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS) January 8, 2025It was a rain-affected fixture at th Seddon Park in Hamilton, as the home side produced a masterclass in batting bowling to seal a 113-run victory, leaving the visitors a lot of questions to answer ahead of the third and final ODI.Here's What The Two Captains Said During Post-Match Presentation CeremonyCharith Asalanka (Sri Lanka Captain):\"It's a par score on small grounds. We batted poorly in the powerplay which cost us the game. We are able to do it well in T20s but not in ODIs. We need to quickly find a way to get going. We would have done little better with the overcast conditions. I expected 2-3 early wickets in the powerplay but we couldn't do that. Credit goes to the New Zealand bowlers. Comeback is the key and we have to get up from here.\"Mitchell Santner (New Zealand Captain):\"Yeah I can't complaint to be honest. I think we opened up pretty well at the start. We lost wickets but we ended up with a great score. The bowlers stepped up for us so a good day overall. Yeah I think 255 was a very competitive total. We were targeting the 280 mark but they bowled really well in the death overs. They made it challenging for us to score in the fag end.\"\"Our bowlers bowled really well. The seamers enjoyed bowling in this surface. Bashing in on the wicket and they got their reward. Yeah for sure, the 3rd ODI is also very important because we have to keep in mind the conditions in Pakistan. We will have a few guys in our side those who will go to Pakistan.\"","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-01-08 13:28:12","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/01/08/7f42f21fde8054f533472e8a42e53a341736342004090901_original.jpg","source_id":"abplive","source_priority":7754,"source_name":"Abp News","source_url":"http://abplive.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/abplive.jpg","language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"e011ae290aa623c684ca555d77dee155","title":"Afghanistan appoint Younis Khan as mentor for Champions Trophy","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/afghanistan-appoint-younis-khan-as-mentor-for-champions-trophy/articleshow/117057611.cms","keywords":null,"creator":["TOI Sports Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Pakistan skipper Younis Khan has been appointed as Afghanistan cricket team's mentor for the 2025 Champions Trophy, beginning February 19.
