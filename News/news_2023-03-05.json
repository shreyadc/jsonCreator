Apart from Harmanpreet, Hayley Matthews and Amelia Kerr struck impressive 40s as MI posted a massive 207/5 on the board at the DY Patil Stadium on Saturday (March 4). The Giants came nowhere close, as they finished with 64, with Saika Ishaque bagging the first four-fer of the WPL. The Giants were also left worried as their captain Beth Mooney suffered an injury in the first over of the chase and retired hurt. Brief scores: Mumbai Indians Women 207/5 in 20 overs (Harmanpreet Kaur 65, Hayley Matthews 47, Amelia Kerr 45*; Sneh Rana 2-43) Gujarat Giants 64 in 15.1 overs (Dayalan Hemalatha 29*; Saika Ishaque 4-11, Nat Sciver-Brunt 2-5) 143 runs. Published on By West Indies threatened to turn the tables on South Africa by rolling them over for 116 on the third morning at SuperSport Park, but their own batters collapsed in similar spectacular fashion, chasing 247. Kagiso Rabada was chiefly responsible for that collapse, bagging 6 for 50 to dismiss them for 159 and seal South Africa’s victory inside three days on a track that offered variable bounce. Jermaine Blackwood’s thrilling counterattack – 79 off 93 balls – raised West Indies’ hopes, but Rabada found a little extra kick off the pitch to take him out and ensure the new era under captain Temba Bavuma and coach Shukri Conrad began with a victory in Centurion, where the South Africa women’s team that reached the T20 World Cup final five days ago was also in attendance. It was Roach who had set the scene for the day with his 11th five-for in Test cricket – and first away from home since 2017. He also surpassed Joel Garner’s tally of 259 to become West Indies’ fifth-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket. Just before lunch, Roach was warmly welcomed back by his team-mates, Jimmy Adams, West Indies’ director of cricket, and Brian Lara, the team mentor. However, the mood and tempo of the match changed quickly when Rabada struck either side of the lunch break. After having captain Kraigg Brathwaite caught down the leg side for a duck, he drew an outside edge from No. 3 Raymon Reifer. Tagenarine Chanderpaul kept playing and missing at full balls, but wasn’t particularly flustered against that length. It was the short ball that bothered him. He fell on his backside twice while trying to deal with them and then when he dared to hook a head-high bouncer from Marco Jansen, he could only top-edge it to midwicket for 10. Roston Chase misjudged an inswinger from Jansen and was castled after offering no shot. Then, when debutant Gerald Coetzee produced extra bounce to get rid of Kyle Mayers, West Indies were 33 for 5 in the 15th over. Blackwood came in and hoicked the seventh ball he faced, off Rabada, over square leg for four. He continued to regularly pump the ball over the top, running away to a 51-ball half-century. At the other end, Joshua Da Silva was more circumspect and contributed 17 to a 58-run sixth-wicket partnership before he fell to Rabada Blackwood, though, went after South Africa’s premier seamer and shanked him over his head for an imposing four. When Anrich Nortje shifted his angle to around the wicket, he ramped him over deep third for four. Jason Holder also operated at almost a run-a-ball in a 37-run seventh-wicket stand with Blackwood before Rabada had him nicking behind with a perfectly-pitched delivery. Though Rabada looked like wasn’t at his best earlier in the day, floating some balls in the lower 130-kph range, his seven-over spell post tea, in which he dismissed both Holder and Blackwood, was perhaps the most decisive passage of play. The day had started on a more promising note for West Indies. Roach struck with his first ball to cut Aiden Markram’s innings short at 47 off 58. He went wide of the crease, tricked Markram into playing for the inward angle from over the wicket but got it to straighten late off the seam and graze the outside edge. Marais Erasmus, the on-field umpire, didn’t rule Markram out initially, but he opted to walk back to the dressing room. In his next over, Roach went wide of the crease again, but this time he beat Jansen’s outside edge and hit the top of the off stump. Roach also helped snip the South African tail, but Coetzee’s spunky cameo (20 off 15 balls) pushed their lead closer to 250. Markram aside, Coetzee was the only South Africa batter to score more than 10 runs in their second innings. He then combined and Rabada, Jansen and Norje with the ball to compensate for their batting collapse and wrap the game up before drinks on the third afternoon. West Indies ( ) Published on By Canada Soccer has reached an interim funding agreement with its women’s national team players amid a dispute over equal pay.The deal reflects the men’s team’s terms with game-by-game incentives and results-based compensation. The women’s team had threatened to boycott a camp in April if demands over funding and pay inequality are not met.A final collective bargaining deal with both the men’s and women’s sides remains under negotiation. “Canada Soccer has announced that a deal in principle has been reached with the Women’s National Team Players on an interim funding agreement for 2022,” the Canada Soccer Association (CSA) said in a statement on Thursday. The women’s team’s last agreement with CSA expired in 2021. In February, Canada’s women called off a planned strike because of the governing body’s threats of legal action, but they protested during the recent SheBelieves Cup by wearing purple T-shirts with the phrase “enough is enough” before their matches. “This is about respect, this is about dignity, and this is about equalising the competitive environment in a world that is fundamentally unequal,” Canada Soccer’s general secretary Earl Cochrane said. “We have been consistent and public about the need to have fairness and equal pay be pillars of any new agreements with our players, and we are delivering on that today.” Earlier this week, Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis announced his resignation, a decision welcomed by the Canadian Soccer Players’ Association (CSPA) and Canadian Men’s National Soccer Team Players’ Association (CMNSTPA) as “one necessary step” in ensuring the future success of the national teams.In a joint statement, the CSPA and CMNSTPA asked Canada Soccer for “transparent and comprehensive access” to financial records in light of recent funding cuts. They also want immediate action from the governing body to address the unauthorised use of player images, as well as financial restraints imposed by CSA’s agreement with Canada Business Soccer.Canada’s men went on strike in June 2022 after accusing CSA of “disrespect” over World Cup prize money and have said they “wholeheartedly support” the women’s side. The CSA spent $11m (£6.72m) on the men’s programme in 2021 and $5.1m (£3.11m) on the women’s programme.The women’s players said the “disgusting” discrepancy between the programmes became apparent at last year’s men’s World Cup. They are looking for the same backing for this year’s Women’s World Cup as the men received before Qatar, where they competed in the tournament for the first time in 37 years.Canada’s women, who are sixth in the world rankings and won Olympic gold in 2021, are in Group B for the World Cup, which takes place from 20 July to 20 August in Australia and New Zealand. Published on By Left-arm spinner Yuri Koththigoda excelled with a match bag of nine wickets as Richmond beat D.S. Senanayake College by an innings and 43 runs in the Under 19 traditional cricket encounter which ended before tea at Dombagoda on Friday. Koththigoda teamed up with Maheesha de Silva to rattle D.S.

But Ashleigh Gardner was bowling not just to Yastika Bhatia. She was bowling herself into the history of women’s cricket, too. A quiet beginning it may have been for the Women’s Premier League at the D.Y. Patil Stadium in front of a big crowd on Saturday, but the storm was not far away. First, there were some lusty, aerial hits from the West Indian Hayley Matthews. Then came an array of shots all along the ground from Harmanpreet Kaur, all played with the kind of placement and timing you would not often get to see in this frenzied form of cricket. The knocks from Matthews (47, 31b, 3x4, 4x6), captain Harmanpreet (65, 30b, 14x4), and Amelia Kerr (45 not out, 24b, 6x4, 1x6) ensured that the maiden innings of the WPL was one to remember. But the match wasn’t. Chasing Mumbai Indians’ 207 for five, the Giants were never in the picture. Mumbai romped home by 143 runs. Even more worryingly for the Giants, their skipper and best batter Beth Mooney got injured and went back to the dressing room after facing just three balls. MI must be pleased with its effort with the ball. Significantly, For MI, Saika Ishaque, the uncapped left-arm spinner from Bengal, took four for 11. Earlier, it was indeed a fabulous show by the MI batters, after the early loss of Yastika. Matthews and Nat Sciver-Brunt (23) added 54 for the second wicket before the latter was sent back by Australian leg-spinner Georgia Wareham. That brought to the middle Harmanpreet, who looked determined to leave her mark on this special night. Her 89-run stand with Kerr was simply breathtaking. The finishing touch was provided by Issy Wong, who swung Sneh Rana over deep midwicket for a massive six.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 19:31:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Harmanpreet's stunning 65 powers Mumbai Indians to 207/5 in WPL opener","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wpl-2023-gujarat-giants-vs-mumbai-indians/article66581533.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Gujarat Giants were guilty of committing several errors in the field, including bowling plenty of deliveries on the leg side, after winning the toss and opting to field","content":"Captain Harmanpreet Kaur powered Mumbai Indians to an imposing 207/5 with a stunning half-century against Gujarat Giants as the inaugural Women's Premier League (WPL) got underway in front of a fairly packed crowd in Mumbai on Saturday. The opener was preceded by a glittering opening ceremony at the DY Patil Stadium. Kaur lit up the contest with a compelling knock of 65 off just 30 balls (14x4s), which floored the Gujarat Giants and wrote her name in the history books. The right-handed Kaur added a quickfire 89 runs for the fourth wicket with Amelia Kerr, with the New Zealand batter making a rapid 45 not out from just 24 balls with six fours and a six. Mumbai Indians scored 62 runs from the last 30 balls of their innings to record a total in excess of 200 in the very first innings of the tournament. Gujarat Giants were guilty of committing several errors in the field, including bowling plenty of deliveries on the leg side, after winning the toss and opting to field. Kaur, who began with consecutive fours off Sneh Rana in the 11th over, got two more fours off Georgia Wareham in the 12th and gave a similar treatment to Annabel Sutherland in the next over. However, it was in the 15th over when Kaur truly showcased her class, hammering the young left-arm seamer Monica Patel for four consecutive fours to collect 21 runs from the over, which was the most expensive of the innings. Despite losing an early wicket in the form of Yastika Bhatia (1), Mumbai Indians remained aggressive with the bat, with West Indies' Hayley Matthews providing the initial fireworks during her 54-run stand for the second wicket with Nat Sciver-Brunt (23) to lay a strong platform. Both Nat Sciver-Brunt and Matthews pounced upon any opportunity to score, which they got in abundance from the Gujarat bowlers who were wayward with their lines. While the right-handed Sciver-Brunt fell for an 18-ball 23, including five fours, it was Matthews who led the scoring in the initial stages of the game. Matthews, who began with a six and a four off Mansi Joshi in the second over, took on Annabel Sutherland as she hit a couple of sixes off the right-arm Australian bowler in the eighth over. The 54-run second-wicket stand was finally broken by Georgia Wareham in the ninth over, who got Sciver-Brunt caught at mid-on by Sneh Rana. Soon, Matthews' charge towards the first-ever WPL half-century was ended by Gardner, brought into the attack to control the run-flow by Gujarat captain Beth Mooney after the strategic break. After being punished for a four past point, Gardner provided the third breakthrough when she got one to spin sharply into the right-handed Matthews. The batter missed connecting with the ball which dismantled her stumps. The right-handed Caribbean batter Matthews fell for a 31-ball 47, studded with four sixes and three fours. India's Tanuja Kanwar provided Gujarat Giants with their first breakthrough in the third over, with Yastika Bhatia — who struggled to get off the blocks — hitting one straight into the hands of Georgia Wareham at point.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 16:56:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Resurgent Australia seek to

The 21-year-old, who was 58 when day four began, looked to be batting on a different pitch as he was unperturbed by the MP pacers who were running through RoI’s middle-order at the other end. With a gentle breeze blowing across the ground on an overcast day, Avesh Khan and Ankit Kushwah utilised the conditions to reduce RoI to 122 for five. The bowlers stuck to a tight line and restricted RoI to 246 in the second innings. However, Jaiswal got RoI back on track with an innings of character and skill, his decisive footwork and attractive shot-making standing out. He started with consecutive boundaries in the third-man region off Kushwah before putting his head down as wickets began to fall at the other end. Jaiswal quickly moved from 89 to 101 off just four deliveries, hitting off-spinner Saransh Jain for three boundaries in an over. After sweeping to the square-leg fence, he whipped the ball off the backfoot past wide long-on and followed it up with a late cut to take him to his second century of the match. RoI finished at 246 in its second innings. Skipper Himanshu Mantri was unbeaten on 51 as the hosts ended the day at 81 for two.

Smriti is delighted that she is leading Royal Challengers Bangalore, a franchise that has such a strong tradition and a large, royal fan base. The franchise spent ₹3.4 crore to ensure her services. She was the first player to go under the hammer. She ended up as the WPL’s costliest player. She said her price tag put no added pressure on her. “RCB’s men’s team has an amazing legacy,” Smriti said. “I am happy to lead this wonderful team.” RCB has indeed been able to put together one of the strongest sides in the WPL, that too after spending a quarter of its purse on Smriti. “We had been preparing for the auctions even before the date was announced,” explained Prathmesh Mishra, chairman of RCB and chief commercial officer, Diageo India. “Our team was working behind the scenes and we had identified the top 100 players. I would say we got 95, if not 99, percent of the players we wanted. We got the captain (that we wanted). That was the most important part of that strategy,” he said. On Sunday, we will find out how RCB translates its undoubted strength on paper to the ground, at the Brabourne Stadium, as it takes on Delhi Capitals. In the day’s other match, UP Warriorz will meet Gujarat Giants at the DY Patil stadium, Navi Mumbai.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 15:25:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WPL 2023: कौन है यह महिला क्रिकेटर, जिसे रातों रात WPL से कर दिया गया बाहर","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/cricket-news/west-indies-batter-deandra-dottin-exposes-bcci-controversy-hits-wpl-2023/articleshow/98415612.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WPL 2023: वीमेंस प्रीमियर लीग 2023 के शुरुआत हो चुकी है लेकिन इसके साथ ही एक बड़ा विवाद भी खड़ा हो चुका है। दरअसल गुजरात जाइंट्स की शामिल वेस्टइंडीज की ऑलराउंडर डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को मैच से दिन पहले चोटिल बताकर टूर्नामेंट से बाहर कर दिया गया है। हालांकि डिएंड्रा डॉटिन ने चोट से इंकार किया है।","content":"वीमेंस प्रीमियर लीग 2023 की शुरुआत हो चुकी है। सीजन का पहला मैच गुजरात जायंट्स और मुंबई इंडियंस के बीच खेला जा रहा है। सीजन के शुरुआती मैच से पहले एक बेहतरीन रंगारंग ओपनिंग सेरेमनी हुआ आयोजन हुआ, जिसमें कियारा आडवाणी, कृति सेनन और एपी ढिल्लोंन जैसे कलाकारों ने अपनी परफॉर्मेंस दी। हालांकि मैच से पहले एक बड़ा बवाल खड़ा हो चुका है। दरअसल गुजरात जायंट्स की टीम ने वेस्टइंडीज की धाकड़ ऑलराउंडर डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को लेकर एक जानकारी दी कि वह टूर्नामेंट से बाहर हो चुकी हैं। हालांकि फ्रेंचाइजी के इसके पीछे का कारण चोट बताया है लेकिन मामला कुछ और नजर आ रहा है। दरअसल डिएंड्रा डॉटिन ने सोशल मीडिया पर ट्वीट कर जानकारी दी है कि वह पूरी तरह से ठीक हैं। उन्होंने ट्वीट कर लिखा, 'मेरे पास जो संदेश आ रहे हैं उसके लिए शुक्रिया, लेकिन सच्चाई ये है कि मैं भूत से उबर रही हूं।' इंस्टाग्राम स्टोरी पर उन्होंने कुछ ऐसा लिखा जिसकी वजह से मामला सीधा नजर नहीं आ रहा है। बता दें कि गुजरात जायंट्स की टीम ने WPL की नीलामी में डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को 60 लाख में खरीदा था। ऐसे में मीडिया रिपोर्ट की मानें तो डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को किसी और वजह से ही गुजरात ने टीम से बाहर किया है, जिससे ऐसा लग रहा है कि चोट को सिर्फ बहाना गया है। वहीं गुजरात की टीम ने डिएंड्रा डॉटिन की किम ग्राथ को अपने खेमे में शामिल किया है। फ्रेंचाइजी ने इसकी जानकारी ट्वीट कर दी है। वहीं डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को लेकर अब सवाल यह उठने लगा है कि आखिरी मैच से एक दिन पहले वेस्टइंडीज की इस धाकड़ ऑलराउंडर को क्यों बाहर किया गया। हालांकि फ्रेंचाइजी के इस फैसले और सवाल का जवाब तो अभी फिलहाल वही दे सकते हैं। WPL 2023 के पहले सीजन के पहले मैच में गुजरात जायंट्स की कप्तान बेथ मूनी ने टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी का फैसला किया है। हरमनप्रीत की अगुवाई वाली टीम पहले बल्लेबाजी के लिए मैदान पर उतरेगी। वहीं इस मैच से पहले एक शानदार ओपनिंग सेरेमनी का आयोजन किया गया जिसमें कियारा आडवाणी, कृति सेनन और एपी ढिल्लोंन जैसे कलाकारों ने अपनी शानदार प्रस्तुति पेश की।","pubDate":"2023-03-04 14:50:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Harmanpreet leads rout of Gujarat Giants in WPL opener","link":"http://island.lk/harmanpreet-leads-rout-of-gujarat-giants-in-wpl-opener/","keywords":["Sports","Featured"],"creator":["Priyan"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai Indians skipper Harmanpreet Kaur set the tone for the maiden edition of the Women’s Premier League with a blistering 30-ball 65, which included 14 boundaries, as her side defeated Gujarat Giants by a comprehensive 143-run margin.

Apart from Harmanpreet, Hayley Matthews and Amelia Kerr struck impressive 40s as MI posted a massive 207/5 on the board at the DY Patil Stadium on Saturday (March 4). The Giants came nowhere close, as they finished with 64, with Saika Ishaque bagging the first four-fer of the WPL. The Giants were also left worried as their captain Beth Mooney suffered an injury in the first over of the chase and retired hurt. Brief scores: Mumbai Indians Women 207/5 in 20 overs (Harmanpreet Kaur 65, Hayley Matthews 47, Amelia Kerr 45*; Sneh Rana 2-43) Gujarat Giants 64 in 15.1 overs (Dayalan Hemalatha 29*; Saika Ishaque 4-11, Nat Sciver-Brunt 2-5) 143 runs. Published on By West Indies threatened to turn the tables on South Africa by rolling them over for 116 on the third morning at SuperSport Park, but their own batters collapsed in similar spectacular fashion, chasing 247. Kagiso Rabada was chiefly responsible for that collapse, bagging 6 for 50 to dismiss them for 159 and seal South Africa’s victory inside three days on a track that offered variable bounce. Jermaine Blackwood’s thrilling counterattack – 79 off 93 balls – raised West Indies’ hopes, but Rabada found a little extra kick off the pitch to take him out and ensure the new era under captain Temba Bavuma and coach Shukri Conrad began with a victory in Centurion, where the South Africa women’s team that reached the T20 World Cup final five days ago was also in attendance. It was Roach who had set the scene for the day with his 11th five-for in Test cricket – and first away from home since 2017. He also surpassed Joel Garner’s tally of 259 to become West Indies’ fifth-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket. Just before lunch, Roach was warmly welcomed back by his team-mates, Jimmy Adams, West Indies’ director of cricket, and Brian Lara, the team mentor. However, the mood and tempo of the match changed quickly when Rabada struck either side of the lunch break. After having captain Kraigg Brathwaite caught down the leg side for a duck, he drew an outside edge from No. 3 Raymon Reifer. Tagenarine Chanderpaul kept playing and missing at full balls, but wasn’t particularly flustered against that length. It was the short ball that bothered him. He fell on his backside twice while trying to deal with them and then when he dared to hook a head-high bouncer from Marco Jansen, he could only top-edge it to midwicket for 10. Roston Chase misjudged an inswinger from Jansen and was castled after offering no shot. Then, when debutant Gerald Coetzee produced extra bounce to get rid of Kyle Mayers, West Indies were 33 for 5 in the 15th over. Blackwood came in and hoicked the seventh ball he faced, off Rabada, over square leg for four. He continued to regularly pump the ball over the top, running away to a 51-ball half-century. At the other end, Joshua Da Silva was more circumspect and contributed 17 to a 58-run sixth-wicket partnership before he fell to Rabada Blackwood, though, went after South Africa’s premier seamer and shanked him over his head for an imposing four. When Anrich Nortje shifted his angle to around the wicket, he ramped him over deep third for four. Jason Holder also operated at almost a run-a-ball in a 37-run seventh-wicket stand with Blackwood before Rabada had him nicking behind with a perfectly-pitched delivery. Though Rabada looked like wasn’t at his best earlier in the day, floating some balls in the lower 130-kph range, his seven-over spell post tea, in which he dismissed both Holder and Blackwood, was perhaps the most decisive passage of play. The day had started on a more promising note for West Indies. Roach struck with his first ball to cut Aiden Markram’s innings short at 47 off 58. He went wide of the crease, tricked Markram into playing for the inward angle from over the wicket but got it to straighten late off the seam and graze the outside edge. Marais Erasmus, the on-field umpire, didn’t rule Markram out initially, but he opted to walk back to the dressing room. In his next over, Roach went wide of the crease again, but this time he beat Jansen’s outside edge and hit the top of the off stump. Roach also helped snip the South African tail, but Coetzee’s spunky cameo (20 off 15 balls) pushed their lead closer to 250. Markram aside, Coetzee was the only South Africa batter to score more than 10 runs in their second innings. He then combined and Rabada, Jansen and Norje with the ball to compensate for their batting collapse and wrap the game up before drinks on the third afternoon. West Indies ( ) Published on By Canada Soccer has reached an interim funding agreement with its women’s national team players amid a dispute over equal pay.The deal reflects the men’s team’s terms with game-by-game incentives and results-based compensation. The women’s team had threatened to boycott a camp in April if demands over funding and pay inequality are not met.A final collective bargaining deal with both the men’s and women’s sides remains under negotiation. “Canada Soccer has announced that a deal in principle has been reached with the Women’s National Team Players on an interim funding agreement for 2022,” the Canada Soccer Association (CSA) said in a statement on Thursday. The women’s team’s last agreement with CSA expired in 2021. In February, Canada’s women called off a planned strike because of the governing body’s threats of legal action, but they protested during the recent SheBelieves Cup by wearing purple T-shirts with the phrase “enough is enough” before their matches. “This is about respect, this is about dignity, and this is about equalising the competitive environment in a world that is fundamentally unequal,” Canada Soccer’s general secretary Earl Cochrane said. “We have been consistent and public about the need to have fairness and equal pay be pillars of any new agreements with our players, and we are delivering on that today.” Earlier this week, Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis announced his resignation, a decision welcomed by the Canadian Soccer Players’ Association (CSPA) and Canadian Men’s National Soccer Team Players’ Association (CMNSTPA) as “one necessary step” in ensuring the future success of the national teams.In a joint statement, the CSPA and CMNSTPA asked Canada Soccer for “transparent and comprehensive access” to financial records in light of recent funding cuts. They also want immediate action from the governing body to address the unauthorised use of player images, as well as financial restraints imposed by CSA’s agreement with Canada Business Soccer.Canada’s men went on strike in June 2022 after accusing CSA of “disrespect” over World Cup prize money and have said they “wholeheartedly support” the women’s side. The CSA spent $11m (£6.72m) on the men’s programme in 2021 and $5.1m (£3.11m) on the women’s programme.The women’s players said the “disgusting” discrepancy between the programmes became apparent at last year’s men’s World Cup. They are looking for the same backing for this year’s Women’s World Cup as the men received before Qatar, where they competed in the tournament for the first time in 37 years.Canada’s women, who are sixth in the world rankings and won Olympic gold in 2021, are in Group B for the World Cup, which takes place from 20 July to 20 August in Australia and New Zealand.

But Ashleigh Gardner was bowling not just to Yastika Bhatia. She was bowling herself into the history of women’s cricket, too. A quiet beginning it may have been for the Women’s Premier League at the D.Y. Patil Stadium in front of a big crowd on Saturday, but the storm was not far away. First, there were some lusty, aerial hits from the West Indian Hayley Matthews. Then came an array of shots all along the ground from Harmanpreet Kaur, all played with the kind of placement and timing you would not often get to see in this frenzied form of cricket. The knocks from Matthews (47, 31b, 3x4, 4x6), captain Harmanpreet (65, 30b, 14x4), and Amelia Kerr (45 not out, 24b, 6x4, 1x6) ensured that the maiden innings of the WPL was one to remember. But the match wasn’t. Chasing Mumbai Indians’ 207 for five, the Giants were never in the picture. Mumbai romped home by 143 runs. Even more worryingly for the Giants, their skipper and best batter Beth Mooney got injured and went back to the dressing room after facing just three balls. MI must be pleased with its effort with the ball. Significantly, For MI, Saika Ishaque, the uncapped left-arm spinner from Bengal, took four for 11. Earlier, it was indeed a fabulous show by the MI batters, after the early loss of Yastika. Matthews and Nat Sciver-Brunt (23) added 54 for the second wicket before the latter was sent back by Australian leg-spinner Georgia Wareham. That brought to the middle Harmanpreet, who looked determined to leave her mark on this special night. Her 89-run stand with Kerr was simply breathtaking. The finishing touch was provided by Issy Wong, who swung Sneh Rana over deep midwicket for a massive six.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 19:31:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Harmanpreet's stunning 65 powers Mumbai Indians to 207/5 in WPL opener","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wpl-2023-gujarat-giants-vs-mumbai-indians/article66581533.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Gujarat Giants were guilty of committing several errors in the field, including bowling plenty of deliveries on the leg side, after winning the toss and opting to field","content":"Captain Harmanpreet Kaur powered Mumbai Indians to an imposing 207/5 with a stunning half-century against Gujarat Giants as the inaugural Women's Premier League (WPL) got underway in front of a fairly packed crowd in Mumbai on Saturday. The opener was preceded by a glittering opening ceremony at the DY Patil Stadium. Kaur lit up the contest with a compelling knock of 65 off just 30 balls (14x4s), which floored the Gujarat Giants and wrote her name in the history books. The right-handed Kaur added a quickfire 89 runs for the fourth wicket with Amelia Kerr, with the New Zealand batter making a rapid 45 not out from just 24 balls with six fours and a six. Mumbai Indians scored 62 runs from the last 30 balls of their innings to record a total in excess of 200 in the very first innings of the tournament. Gujarat Giants were guilty of committing several errors in the field, including bowling plenty of deliveries on the leg side, after winning the toss and opting to field. Kaur, who began with consecutive fours off Sneh Rana in the 11th over, got two more fours off Georgia Wareham in the 12th and gave a similar treatment to Annabel Sutherland in the next over. However, it was in the 15th over when Kaur truly showcased her class, hammering the young left-arm seamer Monica Patel for four consecutive fours to collect 21 runs from the over, which was the most expensive of the innings. Despite losing an early wicket in the form of Yastika Bhatia (1), Mumbai Indians remained aggressive with the bat, with West Indies' Hayley Matthews providing the initial fireworks during her 54-run stand for the second wicket with Nat Sciver-Brunt (23) to lay a strong platform. Both Nat Sciver-Brunt and Matthews pounced upon any opportunity to score, which they got in abundance from the Gujarat bowlers who were wayward with their lines. While the right-handed Sciver-Brunt fell for an 18-ball 23, including five fours, it was Matthews who led the scoring in the initial stages of the game. Matthews, who began with a six and a four off Mansi Joshi in the second over, took on Annabel Sutherland as she hit a couple of sixes off the right-arm Australian bowler in the eighth over. The 54-run second-wicket stand was finally broken by Georgia Wareham in the ninth over, who got Sciver-Brunt caught at mid-on by Sneh Rana. Soon, Matthews' charge towards the first-ever WPL half-century was ended by Gardner, brought into the attack to control the run-flow by Gujarat captain Beth Mooney after the strategic break. After being punished for a four past point, Gardner provided the third breakthrough when she got one to spin sharply into the right-handed Matthews. The batter missed connecting with the ball which dismantled her stumps. The right-handed Caribbean batter Matthews fell for a 31-ball 47, studded with four sixes and three fours. India's Tanuja Kanwar provided Gujarat Giants with their first breakthrough in the third over, with Yastika Bhatia — who struggled to get off the blocks — hitting one straight into the hands of Georgia Wareham at point.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 16:56:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Resurgent Australia seek to

Shane Warne, batting icon Sachin Tendulkar penned a heartfelt note, recalling his \"great friend\" against whom he fought many memorable battles on the pitch. Considered the greatest spinner of all-time, Warne died on this day last year after suffering a cardiac arrest during a vacation in Thailand. Taking to social media, Tendulkar recalled the times that he spent with Warne and also shared a picture where the two could be seen in conversation. \"We have had some memorable battles on the field & shared equally memorable moments off it. I miss you not only as a great cricketer but also as a great friend. I am sure you are making heaven a more charming place than it ever was with your sense of humour and charisma, Warnie!\" Tendulkar wrote on Twitter on Saturday. The two faced off in 29 international matches with Warne getting the better of Tendulkar four times. Warne claimed over 1000 wickets in his illustrious international career with 709 victims coming in Test cricket, while Tendulkar has scored 34357 runs, including 100 centuries across the three formats. The former Australian spinner also captained Rajasthan Royals to title triumph in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League in 2008.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 15:45:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jaiswal’s second century puts RoI on victory path","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/irani-cup-yashasvi-jaiswal-himanshu-mantri/article66580272.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The 21-year-old, who was 58 when day four began, looked to be batting on a different pitch as he was unperturbed by the MP pacers who were running through RoI’s middle-order at the other end","content":"At a venue best known for Sachin Tendulkar’s historic double hundred in ODIs — the first in 50-over cricket — another Mumbai batter Yashasvi Jaiswal etched his name in the record books in the longer format of the game on Saturday. On day four of the Irani Cup at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium, Jaiswal — who had made 213 in the first innings on day one — scored 144 (157b, 16x4, 3x6) in the second to help Rest of India (RoI) set a daunting target of 437 for Madhya Pradesh. With 357 runs, Jaiswal now holds the record for most runs in an Irani Cup match. The 21-year-old, who was 58 when day four began, looked to be batting on a different pitch as he was unperturbed by the MP pacers who were running through RoI’s middle-order at the other end. With a gentle breeze blowing across the ground on an overcast day, Avesh Khan and Ankit Kushwah utilised the conditions to reduce RoI to 122 for five. The bowlers stuck to a tight line and restricted RoI to 246 in the second innings. However, Jaiswal got RoI back on track with an innings of character and skill, his decisive footwork and attractive shot-making standing out. He started with consecutive boundaries in the third-man region off Kushwah before putting his head down as wickets began to fall at the other end. Jaiswal quickly moved from 89 to 101 off just four deliveries, hitting off-spinner Saransh Jain for three boundaries in an over. After sweeping to the square-leg fence, he whipped the ball off the backfoot past wide long-on and followed it up with a late cut to take him to his second century of the match. RoI finished at 246 in its second innings. Skipper Himanshu Mantri was unbeaten on 51 as the hosts ended the day at 81 for two. After taking a 190-run first innings lead, RoI will feel it has one hand on the cup. The scores: Rest of India — 1st innings: 484. Madhya Pradesh — 1st innings: 294.

Smriti is delighted that she is leading Royal Challengers Bangalore, a franchise that has such a strong tradition and a large, royal fan base. The franchise spent ₹3.4 crore to ensure her services. She was the first player to go under the hammer. She ended up as the WPL’s costliest player. She said her price tag put no added pressure on her. “RCB’s men’s team has an amazing legacy,” Smriti said. “I am happy to lead this wonderful team.” RCB has indeed been able to put together one of the strongest sides in the WPL, that too after spending a quarter of its purse on Smriti. “We had been preparing for the auctions even before the date was announced,” explained Prathmesh Mishra, chairman of RCB and chief commercial officer, Diageo India. “Our team was working behind the scenes and we had identified the top 100 players. I would say we got 95, if not 99, percent of the players we wanted. We got the captain (that we wanted). That was the most important part of that strategy,” he said. On Sunday, we will find out how RCB translates its undoubted strength on paper to the ground, at the Brabourne Stadium, as it takes on Delhi Capitals. In the day’s other match, UP Warriorz will meet Gujarat Giants at the DY Patil stadium, Navi Mumbai.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 15:25:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WPL 2023: कौन है यह महिला क्रिकेटर, जिसे रातों रात WPL से कर दिया गया बाहर","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/cricket-news/west-indies-batter-deandra-dottin-exposes-bcci-controversy-hits-wpl-2023/articleshow/98415612.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WPL 2023: वीमेंस प्रीमियर लीग 2023 के शुरुआत हो चुकी है लेकिन इसके साथ ही एक बड़ा विवाद भी खड़ा हो चुका है। दरअसल गुजरात जाइंट्स की शामिल वेस्टइंडीज की ऑलराउंडर डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को मैच से दिन पहले चोटिल बताकर टूर्नामेंट से बाहर कर दिया गया है। हालांकि डिएंड्रा डॉटिन ने चोट से इंकार किया है।","content":"वीमेंस प्रीमियर लीग 2023 की शुरुआत हो चुकी है। सीजन का पहला मैच गुजरात जायंट्स और मुंबई इंडियंस के बीच खेला जा रहा है। सीजन के शुरुआती मैच से पहले एक बेहतरीन रंगारंग ओपनिंग सेरेमनी हुआ आयोजन हुआ, जिसमें कियारा आडवाणी, कृति सेनन और एपी ढिल्लोंन जैसे कलाकारों ने अपनी परफॉर्मेंस दी। हालांकि मैच से पहले एक बड़ा बवाल खड़ा हो चुका है। दरअसल गुजरात जायंट्स की टीम ने वेस्टइंडीज की धाकड़ ऑलराउंडर डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को लेकर एक जानकारी दी कि वह टूर्नामेंट से बाहर हो चुकी हैं। हालांकि फ्रेंचाइजी के इसके पीछे का कारण चोट बताया है लेकिन मामला कुछ और नजर आ रहा है। दरअसल डिएंड्रा डॉटिन ने सोशल मीडिया पर ट्वीट कर जानकारी दी है कि वह पूरी तरह से ठीक हैं। उन्होंने ट्वीट कर लिखा, 'मेरे पास जो संदेश आ रहे हैं उसके लिए शुक्रिया, लेकिन सच्चाई ये है कि मैं भूत से उबर रही हूं।' इंस्टाग्राम स्टोरी पर उन्होंने कुछ ऐसा लिखा जिसकी वजह से मामला सीधा नजर नहीं आ रहा है। बता दें कि गुजरात जायंट्स की टीम ने WPL की नीलामी में डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को 60 लाख में खरीदा था। ऐसे में मीडिया रिपोर्ट की मानें तो डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को किसी और वजह से ही गुजरात ने टीम से बाहर किया है, जिससे ऐसा लग रहा है कि चोट को सिर्फ बहाना गया है। वहीं गुजरात की टीम ने डिएंड्रा डॉटिन की किम ग्राथ को अपने खेमे में शामिल किया है। फ्रेंचाइजी ने इसकी जानकारी ट्वीट कर दी है। वहीं डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को लेकर अब सवाल यह उठने लगा है कि आखिरी मैच से एक दिन पहले वेस्टइंडीज की इस धाकड़ ऑलराउंडर को क्यों बाहर किया गया। हालांकि फ्रेंचाइजी के इस फैसले और सवाल का जवाब तो अभी फिलहाल वही दे सकते हैं। WPL 2023 के पहले सीजन के पहले मैच में गुजरात जायंट्स की कप्तान बेथ मूनी ने टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी का फैसला किया है। हरमनप्रीत की अगुवाई वाली टीम पहले बल्लेबाजी के लिए मैदान पर उतरेगी। वहीं इस मैच से पहले एक शानदार ओपनिंग सेरेमनी का आयोजन किया गया जिसमें कियारा आडवाणी, कृति सेनन और एपी ढिल्लोंन जैसे कलाकारों ने अपनी शानदार प्रस्तुति पेश की।","pubDate":"2023-03-04 14:50:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Harmanpreet leads rout of Gujarat Giants in WPL opener","link":"http://island.lk/harmanpreet-leads-rout-of-gujarat-giants-in-wpl-opener/","keywords":["Sports","Featured"],"creator":["Priyan"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai Indians skipper Harmanpreet Kaur set the tone for the maiden edition of the Women’s Premier League with a blistering 30-ball 65, which included 14 boundaries, as her side defeated Gujarat Giants by a comprehensive 143-run margin.

Apart from Harmanpreet, Hayley Matthews and Amelia Kerr struck impressive 40s as MI posted a massive 207/5 on the board at the DY Patil Stadium on Saturday (March 4). The Giants came nowhere close, as they finished with 64, with Saika Ishaque bagging the first four-fer of the WPL. The Giants were also left worried as their captain Beth Mooney suffered an injury in the first over of the chase and retired hurt. Brief scores: Mumbai Indians Women 207/5 in 20 overs (Harmanpreet Kaur 65, Hayley Matthews 47, Amelia Kerr 45*; Sneh Rana 2-43) Gujarat Giants 64 in 15.1 overs (Dayalan Hemalatha 29*; Saika Ishaque 4-11, Nat Sciver-Brunt 2-5) 143 runs. Published on By West Indies threatened to turn the tables on South Africa by rolling them over for 116 on the third morning at SuperSport Park, but their own batters collapsed in similar spectacular fashion, chasing 247. Kagiso Rabada was chiefly responsible for that collapse, bagging 6 for 50 to dismiss them for 159 and seal South Africa’s victory inside three days on a track that offered variable bounce. Jermaine Blackwood’s thrilling counterattack – 79 off 93 balls – raised West Indies’ hopes, but Rabada found a little extra kick off the pitch to take him out and ensure the new era under captain Temba Bavuma and coach Shukri Conrad began with a victory in Centurion, where the South Africa women’s team that reached the T20 World Cup final five days ago was also in attendance. It was Roach who had set the scene for the day with his 11th five-for in Test cricket – and first away from home since 2017. He also surpassed Joel Garner’s tally of 259 to become West Indies’ fifth-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket. Just before lunch, Roach was warmly welcomed back by his team-mates, Jimmy Adams, West Indies’ director of cricket, and Brian Lara, the team mentor. However, the mood and tempo of the match changed quickly when Rabada struck either side of the lunch break. After having captain Kraigg Brathwaite caught down the leg side for a duck, he drew an outside edge from No. 3 Raymon Reifer. Tagenarine Chanderpaul kept playing and missing at full balls, but wasn’t particularly flustered against that length. It was the short ball that bothered him. He fell on his backside twice while trying to deal with them and then when he dared to hook a head-high bouncer from Marco Jansen, he could only top-edge it to midwicket for 10. Roston Chase misjudged an inswinger from Jansen and was castled after offering no shot. Then, when debutant Gerald Coetzee produced extra bounce to get rid of Kyle Mayers, West Indies were 33 for 5 in the 15th over. Blackwood came in and hoicked the seventh ball he faced, off Rabada, over square leg for four. He continued to regularly pump the ball over the top, running away to a 51-ball half-century. At the other end, Joshua Da Silva was more circumspect and contributed 17 to a 58-run sixth-wicket partnership before he fell to Rabada Blackwood, though, went after South Africa’s premier seamer and shanked him over his head for an imposing four. When Anrich Nortje shifted his angle to around the wicket, he ramped him over deep third for four. Jason Holder also operated at almost a run-a-ball in a 37-run seventh-wicket stand with Blackwood before Rabada had him nicking behind with a perfectly-pitched delivery. Though Rabada looked like wasn’t at his best earlier in the day, floating some balls in the lower 130-kph range, his seven-over spell post tea, in which he dismissed both Holder and Blackwood, was perhaps the most decisive passage of play. The day had started on a more promising note for West Indies. Roach struck with his first ball to cut Aiden Markram’s innings short at 47 off 58. He went wide of the crease, tricked Markram into playing for the inward angle from over the wicket but got it to straighten late off the seam and graze the outside edge. Marais Erasmus, the on-field umpire, didn’t rule Markram out initially, but he opted to walk back to the dressing room. In his next over, Roach went wide of the crease again, but this time he beat Jansen’s outside edge and hit the top of the off stump. Roach also helped snip the South African tail, but Coetzee’s spunky cameo (20 off 15 balls) pushed their lead closer to 250. Markram aside, Coetzee was the only South Africa batter to score more than 10 runs in their second innings. He then combined and Rabada, Jansen and Norje with the ball to compensate for their batting collapse and wrap the game up before drinks on the third afternoon. West Indies ( ) Published on By Canada Soccer has reached an interim funding agreement with its women’s national team players amid a dispute over equal pay.The deal reflects the men’s team’s terms with game-by-game incentives and results-based compensation. The women’s team had threatened to boycott a camp in April if demands over funding and pay inequality are not met.A final collective bargaining deal with both the men’s and women’s sides remains under negotiation. “Canada Soccer has announced that a deal in principle has been reached with the Women’s National Team Players on an interim funding agreement for 2022,” the Canada Soccer Association (CSA) said in a statement on Thursday. The women’s team’s last agreement with CSA expired in 2021. In February, Canada’s women called off a planned strike because of the governing body’s threats of legal action, but they protested during the recent SheBelieves Cup by wearing purple T-shirts with the phrase “enough is enough” before their matches. “This is about respect, this is about dignity, and this is about equalising the competitive environment in a world that is fundamentally unequal,” Canada Soccer’s general secretary Earl Cochrane said. “We have been consistent and public about the need to have fairness and equal pay be pillars of any new agreements with our players, and we are delivering on that today.” Earlier this week, Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis announced his resignation, a decision welcomed by the Canadian Soccer Players’ Association (CSPA) and Canadian Men’s National Soccer Team Players’ Association (CMNSTPA) as “one necessary step” in ensuring the future success of the national teams.In a joint statement, the CSPA and CMNSTPA asked Canada Soccer for “transparent and comprehensive access” to financial records in light of recent funding cuts. They also want immediate action from the governing body to address the unauthorised use of player images, as well as financial restraints imposed by CSA’s agreement with Canada Business Soccer.Canada’s men went on strike in June 2022 after accusing CSA of “disrespect” over World Cup prize money and have said they “wholeheartedly support” the women’s side. The CSA spent $11m (£6.72m) on the men’s programme in 2021 and $5.1m (£3.11m) on the women’s programme.The women’s players said the “disgusting” discrepancy between the programmes became apparent at last year’s men’s World Cup. They are looking for the same backing for this year’s Women’s World Cup as the men received before Qatar, where they competed in the tournament for the first time in 37 years.Canada’s women, who are sixth in the world rankings and won Olympic gold in 2021, are in Group B for the World Cup, which takes place from 20 July to 20 August in Australia and New Zealand.

But Ashleigh Gardner was bowling not just to Yastika Bhatia. She was bowling herself into the history of women’s cricket, too. A quiet beginning it may have been for the Women’s Premier League at the D.Y. Patil Stadium in front of a big crowd on Saturday, but the storm was not far away. First, there were some lusty, aerial hits from the West Indian Hayley Matthews. Then came an array of shots all along the ground from Harmanpreet Kaur, all played with the kind of placement and timing you would not often get to see in this frenzied form of cricket. The knocks from Matthews (47, 31b, 3x4, 4x6), captain Harmanpreet (65, 30b, 14x4), and Amelia Kerr (45 not out, 24b, 6x4, 1x6) ensured that the maiden innings of the WPL was one to remember. But the match wasn’t. Chasing Mumbai Indians’ 207 for five, the Giants were never in the picture. Mumbai romped home by 143 runs. Even more worryingly for the Giants, their skipper and best batter Beth Mooney got injured and went back to the dressing room after facing just three balls. MI must be pleased with its effort with the ball. Significantly, For MI, Saika Ishaque, the uncapped left-arm spinner from Bengal, took four for 11. Earlier, it was indeed a fabulous show by the MI batters, after the early loss of Yastika. Matthews and Nat Sciver-Brunt (23) added 54 for the second wicket before the latter was sent back by Australian leg-spinner Georgia Wareham. That brought to the middle Harmanpreet, who looked determined to leave her mark on this special night. Her 89-run stand with Kerr was simply breathtaking. The finishing touch was provided by Issy Wong, who swung Sneh Rana over deep midwicket for a massive six.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 19:31:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Harmanpreet's stunning 65 powers Mumbai Indians to 207/5 in WPL opener","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wpl-2023-gujarat-giants-vs-mumbai-indians/article66581533.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Gujarat Giants were guilty of committing several errors in the field, including bowling plenty of deliveries on the leg side, after winning the toss and opting to field","content":"Captain Harmanpreet Kaur powered Mumbai Indians to an imposing 207/5 with a stunning half-century against Gujarat Giants as the inaugural Women's Premier League (WPL) got underway in front of a fairly packed crowd in Mumbai on Saturday. The opener was preceded by a glittering opening ceremony at the DY Patil Stadium. Kaur lit up the contest with a compelling knock of 65 off just 30 balls (14x4s), which floored the Gujarat Giants and wrote her name in the history books. The right-handed Kaur added a quickfire 89 runs for the fourth wicket with Amelia Kerr, with the New Zealand batter making a rapid 45 not out from just 24 balls with six fours and a six. Mumbai Indians scored 62 runs from the last 30 balls of their innings to record a total in excess of 200 in the very first innings of the tournament. Gujarat Giants were guilty of committing several errors in the field, including bowling plenty of deliveries on the leg side, after winning the toss and opting to field. Kaur, who began with consecutive fours off Sneh Rana in the 11th over, got two more fours off Georgia Wareham in the 12th and gave a similar treatment to Annabel Sutherland in the next over. However, it was in the 15th over when Kaur truly showcased her class, hammering the young left-arm seamer Monica Patel for four consecutive fours to collect 21 runs from the over, which was the most expensive of the innings. Despite losing an early wicket in the form of Yastika Bhatia (1), Mumbai Indians remained aggressive with the bat, with West Indies' Hayley Matthews providing the initial fireworks during her 54-run stand for the second wicket with Nat Sciver-Brunt (23) to lay a strong platform. Both Nat Sciver-Brunt and Matthews pounced upon any opportunity to score, which they got in abundance from the Gujarat bowlers who were wayward with their lines. While the right-handed Sciver-Brunt fell for an 18-ball 23, including five fours, it was Matthews who led the scoring in the initial stages of the game. Matthews, who began with a six and a four off Mansi Joshi in the second over, took on Annabel Sutherland as she hit a couple of sixes off the right-arm Australian bowler in the eighth over. The 54-run second-wicket stand was finally broken by Georgia Wareham in the ninth over, who got Sciver-Brunt caught at mid-on by Sneh Rana. Soon, Matthews' charge towards the first-ever WPL half-century was ended by Gardner, brought into the attack to control the run-flow by Gujarat captain Beth Mooney after the strategic break. After being punished for a four past point, Gardner provided the third breakthrough when she got one to spin sharply into the right-handed Matthews. The batter missed connecting with the ball which dismantled her stumps. The right-handed Caribbean batter Matthews fell for a 31-ball 47, studded with four sixes and three fours. India's Tanuja Kanwar provided Gujarat Giants with their first breakthrough in the third over, with Yastika Bhatia — who struggled to get off the blocks — hitting one straight into the hands of Georgia Wareham at point.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 16:56:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Resurgent Australia seek to

की की टीम ने टॉस जीतकर पहले बल्लेबाजी का फैसला किया लेकिन टीम की शुरुआत भयानक रही। ओपनर बल्लेबाज फखर जमां अपना खाता भी नहीं खोल पाए कि उन्हें पवेलियन वापस लौटना पड़ा। हालांकि इसके बाद मिर्जा ताहिर बेग और अब्दुल्ला शफीक ने पारी को संभाल लिया और तेजी से रन बनाने की शुरुआत कर दी। इस बीच लाहौर ने पांचवें ओवर में 50 रन का आंकड़ा पर लिया। मुल्तान के गेंदबाज काफी मुश्किल में दिख रहे थे क्योंकि दोनों तरफ से मार पड़ रही थी लेकिन इसी बीच मुल्तान के कप्तान मोहम्मद रिजवान ने एक ऐसी चमत्कारिक कैच लपका जिसके कारण लाहौर के रन गति पर ब्रेक लग गया। दरअसल पारी का पांचवां ओवर करने आए इशानुल्लाह ने अपनी छठी गेंद पर ताहिर बेग को बाउंसर मारने का प्रयास किया। ताहिर बेग इससे पहले कि कुछ कर पाते गेंद बल्ले के ऊपरी किनारा लेते हुए हवा उछल गई। हालांकि रिजवान जहां खड़े थे वहां से गेंद काफी दूर थी लेकिन चीते की फूर्ति दिखाते हुए उन्होंने हवा में तैरकर कैच को अपने दस्ताने में समा लिया। इस तरह ताहिर बेग 10 रन पर 17 रन बनाकर पवेलियन वापस लौटेने को मजबूर हो गए। हालांकि लाहौर ने 50 रन के स्कोर पर ताहिर के बेग के रूप में अपना दूसरा विकेट गंवा दिया था लेकिन इसके बाद शफीक के साथ मिलकर सैम बिलिंग्स ने पारी को संभाल लिया। शफीक ने 35 गेंद में 48 रनों की पारी खेली जिसमें उन्होंने 6 चौके और 1 छक्का भी लगाया। इसके अलावा 35 गेंद में 54 रन बनाए जिसमें 6 चौके और 2 छक्के भी शामिल हैं। इन दोनों के साथ लाहौर के लिए डेविड वासी ने 15 और सिकंदर रजा ने 14 रनों की पारी खेली। इस तरह लाहौर कलंदर्स की टीम ने निर्धारित 20 ओवर के खेल में 9 विकेट के नुकसान पर 180 रनों का स्कोर खड़ा किया।","pubDate":"2023-03-04

आईपीएल यानी वीमेंस प्रीमियर लीग इतिहास का पहला अर्धशतक भारतीय कप्तान हरमनप्रीत कौर के बल्ले से निकला। मुंबई इंडियंस की अगुवाई करते हुए इस राइट हैंड बैटर ने गुजरात टाइटंस की बोलिंग लाइन-अप की धज्जियां उड़ा दी। हरमन ने सिर्फ 22 गेंद में फिफ्टी ठोकी। आउट होने से पहले उन्होंने 30 गेंद में 65 रन की ताबड़तोड़ पारी खेली। चौथे नंबर पर आकर हरमन ने 216.66 की स्ट्राइक रेट से 14 चौके लगाए। गुजरात टाइटंस की कप्तान बेथ मूनी ने 15वें ओवर की जिम्मेदारी भारतीय पेसर मोनिका पटेल को सौंपी थी। इस लेफ्ट आर्म मीडियम पेसर की जमकर धुनाई हो गई। पहली बॉल पर एमिलिया कर ने चौका मारा और स्ट्राइक हरमनप्रीत कौर को सौंपी। इसके बाद हरमन ने लगातार चार चौके लगाकर मुंबई का स्कोर 145/3 पहुंचा दिया। 30 गेंद में 68 रन की साझेदारी भी हो गई। महिला आईपीएल का आगाज इतना तूफानी होगा किसी ने नहीं सोचा था। टॉस गंवाकर पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए मुंबई ने पांच विकेट खोकर स्कोरबोर्ड पर 207 रन खड़े कर दिए। हरमनप्रीत कौर के अलावा ओपनर हेली मैथ्यूज ने 31 गेंद में 47 रन की तेज पारी खेली। नताली स्कीवर ने 18 गेंद में 23 रन बनाए। एमिलिया कर 24 बॉल में 45 रन बनाकर नाबाद लौटीं। पूजा वस्त्राकर ने भी 8 बॉल में 15 रन की शानदार कैमियो पारी खेली। गुजरात की ओर से स्नेह राणा को सर्वाधिक 2 विकेट मिले, लेकिन सबसे ज्यादा पिटाई भी उन्हीं की हुई। बीते महीने खत्म हुए टी-20 महिला वर्ल्ड कप के सेमीफाइनल में भारत को ऑस्ट्रेलिया के हाथें करीबी हार मिली थी। तब हरमनप्रीत कौर बढ़िया बैटिंग कर रही थी, लेकिन पिच पर बैट अटकने की वजह से वह बदकिस्मत रहीं और रनआउट हो गईं। आज ऐसी कोई गलती उन्होंने नहीं की। सारे क्रिकेटिंग शॉट्स खेले। गैप्स का बेहतरीन इस्तेमाल किया।","pubDate":"2023-03-04

Shane Warne, batting icon Sachin Tendulkar penned a heartfelt note, recalling his \"great friend\" against whom he fought many memorable battles on the pitch. Considered the greatest spinner of all-time, Warne died on this day last year after suffering a cardiac arrest during a vacation in Thailand. Taking to social media, Tendulkar recalled the times that he spent with Warne and also shared a picture where the two could be seen in conversation. \"We have had some memorable battles on the field & shared equally memorable moments off it. I miss you not only as a great cricketer but also as a great friend. I am sure you are making heaven a more charming place than it ever was with your sense of humour and charisma, Warnie!\" Tendulkar wrote on Twitter on Saturday. The two faced off in 29 international matches with Warne getting the better of Tendulkar four times. Warne claimed over 1000 wickets in his illustrious international career with 709 victims coming in Test cricket, while Tendulkar has scored 34357 runs, including 100 centuries across the three formats. The former Australian spinner also captained Rajasthan Royals to title triumph in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League in 2008.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 15:45:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jaiswal’s second century puts RoI on victory path","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/irani-cup-yashasvi-jaiswal-himanshu-mantri/article66580272.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The 21-year-old, who was 58 when day four began, looked to be batting on a different pitch as he was unperturbed by the MP pacers who were running through RoI’s middle-order at the other end","content":"At a venue best known for Sachin Tendulkar’s historic double hundred in ODIs — the first in 50-over cricket — another Mumbai batter Yashasvi Jaiswal etched his name in the record books in the longer format of the game on Saturday. On day four of the Irani Cup at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium, Jaiswal — who had made 213 in the first innings on day one — scored 144 (157b, 16x4, 3x6) in the second to help Rest of India (RoI) set a daunting target of 437 for Madhya Pradesh. With 357 runs, Jaiswal now holds the record for most runs in an Irani Cup match. The 21-year-old, who was 58 when day four began, looked to be batting on a different pitch as he was unperturbed by the MP pacers who were running through RoI’s middle-order at the other end. With a gentle breeze blowing across the ground on an overcast day, Avesh Khan and Ankit Kushwah utilised the conditions to reduce RoI to 122 for five. The bowlers stuck to a tight line and restricted RoI to 246 in the second innings. However, Jaiswal got RoI back on track with an innings of character and skill, his decisive footwork and attractive shot-making standing out. He started with consecutive boundaries in the third-man region off Kushwah before putting his head down as wickets began to fall at the other end. Jaiswal quickly moved from 89 to 101 off just four deliveries, hitting off-spinner Saransh Jain for three boundaries in an over. After sweeping to the square-leg fence, he whipped the ball off the backfoot past wide long-on and followed it up with a late cut to take him to his second century of the match. RoI finished at 246 in its second innings. Skipper Himanshu Mantri was unbeaten on 51 as the hosts ended the day at 81 for two. After taking a 190-run first innings lead, RoI will feel it has one hand on the cup. The scores: Rest of India — 1st innings: 484. Madhya Pradesh — 1st innings: 294.

Smriti is delighted that she is leading Royal Challengers Bangalore, a franchise that has such a strong tradition and a large, royal fan base. The franchise spent ₹3.4 crore to ensure her services. She was the first player to go under the hammer. She ended up as the WPL’s costliest player. She said her price tag put no added pressure on her. “RCB’s men’s team has an amazing legacy,” Smriti said. “I am happy to lead this wonderful team.” RCB has indeed been able to put together one of the strongest sides in the WPL, that too after spending a quarter of its purse on Smriti. “We had been preparing for the auctions even before the date was announced,” explained Prathmesh Mishra, chairman of RCB and chief commercial officer, Diageo India. “Our team was working behind the scenes and we had identified the top 100 players. I would say we got 95, if not 99, percent of the players we wanted. We got the captain (that we wanted). That was the most important part of that strategy,” he said. On Sunday, we will find out how RCB translates its undoubted strength on paper to the ground, at the Brabourne Stadium, as it takes on Delhi Capitals. In the day’s other match, UP Warriorz will meet Gujarat Giants at the DY Patil stadium, Navi Mumbai.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 15:25:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WPL 2023: कौन है यह महिला क्रिकेटर, जिसे रातों रात WPL से कर दिया गया बाहर","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/cricket-news/west-indies-batter-deandra-dottin-exposes-bcci-controversy-hits-wpl-2023/articleshow/98415612.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WPL 2023: वीमेंस प्रीमियर लीग 2023 के शुरुआत हो चुकी है लेकिन इसके साथ ही एक बड़ा विवाद भी खड़ा हो चुका है। दरअसल गुजरात जाइंट्स की शामिल वेस्टइंडीज की ऑलराउंडर डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को मैच से दिन पहले चोटिल बताकर टूर्नामेंट से बाहर कर दिया गया है। हालांकि डिएंड्रा डॉटिन ने चोट से इंकार किया है।","content":"वीमेंस प्रीमियर लीग 2023 की शुरुआत हो चुकी है। सीजन का पहला मैच गुजरात जायंट्स और मुंबई इंडियंस के बीच खेला जा रहा है। सीजन के शुरुआती मैच से पहले एक बेहतरीन रंगारंग ओपनिंग सेरेमनी हुआ आयोजन हुआ, जिसमें कियारा आडवाणी, कृति सेनन और एपी ढिल्लोंन जैसे कलाकारों ने अपनी परफॉर्मेंस दी। हालांकि मैच से पहले एक बड़ा बवाल खड़ा हो चुका है। दरअसल गुजरात जायंट्स की टीम ने वेस्टइंडीज की धाकड़ ऑलराउंडर डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को लेकर एक जानकारी दी कि वह टूर्नामेंट से बाहर हो चुकी हैं। हालांकि फ्रेंचाइजी के इसके पीछे का कारण चोट बताया है लेकिन मामला कुछ और नजर आ रहा है। दरअसल डिएंड्रा डॉटिन ने सोशल मीडिया पर ट्वीट कर जानकारी दी है कि वह पूरी तरह से ठीक हैं। उन्होंने ट्वीट कर लिखा, 'मेरे पास जो संदेश आ रहे हैं उसके लिए शुक्रिया, लेकिन सच्चाई ये है कि मैं भूत से उबर रही हूं।' इंस्टाग्राम स्टोरी पर उन्होंने कुछ ऐसा लिखा जिसकी वजह से मामला सीधा नजर नहीं आ रहा है। बता दें कि गुजरात जायंट्स की टीम ने WPL की नीलामी में डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को 60 लाख में खरीदा था। ऐसे में मीडिया रिपोर्ट की मानें तो डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को किसी और वजह से ही गुजरात ने टीम से बाहर किया है, जिससे ऐसा लग रहा है कि चोट को सिर्फ बहाना गया है। वहीं गुजरात की टीम ने डिएंड्रा डॉटिन की किम ग्राथ को अपने खेमे में शामिल किया है। फ्रेंचाइजी ने इसकी जानकारी ट्वीट कर दी है। वहीं डिएंड्रा डॉटिन को लेकर अब सवाल यह उठने लगा है कि आखिरी मैच से एक दिन पहले वेस्टइंडीज की इस धाकड़ ऑलराउंडर को क्यों बाहर किया गया। हालांकि फ्रेंचाइजी के इस फैसले और सवाल का जवाब तो अभी फिलहाल वही दे सकते हैं। WPL 2023 के पहले सीजन के पहले मैच में गुजरात जायंट्स की कप्तान बेथ मूनी ने टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी का फैसला किया है। हरमनप्रीत की अगुवाई वाली टीम पहले बल्लेबाजी के लिए मैदान पर उतरेगी। वहीं इस मैच से पहले एक शानदार ओपनिंग सेरेमनी का आयोजन किया गया जिसमें कियारा आडवाणी, कृति सेनन और एपी ढिल्लोंन जैसे कलाकारों ने अपनी शानदार प्रस्तुति पेश की।","pubDate":"2023-03-04 14:50:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"}]}
