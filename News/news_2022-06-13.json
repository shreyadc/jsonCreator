The South African cricket team is touring India and playing in the five-match T20 series. South Africa leads the series 2-0.

Shreyas Iyer (40), Ishant Kishan (34) and Dinesh Karthik (30) were the top scorers. South Africa chased down the target of 149 runs to win. The team stumbled, losing three wickets for 29 runs. Pauma and Heinrich Klaassen, however, formed a partnership of 64 runs. Klaassen formed a partnership with Miller for 51 runs. He was out for 81 off 46 balls.

The home team now trails NZ's 1st innings score of 553 by just 80 runs. This is some batting display by England who were written off this test match after a monstrous batting display by the Kiwis on the first two days of the test. Root, currently the world's most in-form batter in test cricket, was still there at stumps on 163 not out to give England hope of coming out of the first innings with an unlikely lead. While Root is used to compiling centuries — this was his fourth in his last five test matches and the 27th of his career — Pope reached three figures for just the second time in four years in the England team and the first at home. Pope's 145 beat his previous best score, the 135 not out against South Africa in January 2020, and justified the decision of England's new leadership to promote him to No. 3 for this international summer. Alex Lees (67) and Ben Stokes (46) chipped in with significant knocks and Ben Foakes was with Root on 24 not out at the close, with England trailing by 80. If Root can continue the good work he's been doing along, and Ben Foakes gets going, we may have a result on our hands come day 5. England is currently leading the series 1-0.","pubDate":"2022-06-12 18:34:59","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England and Joe Root reward fans’ optimism with riotous display of batting | Jonathan Liew","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jun/12/england-and-root-reward-fans-optimism-with-riotous-batting","keywords":["England cricket team","New Zealand cricket team","Cricket","Sport","England v New Zealand 2022","Joe Root","Brendon McCullum"],"creator":["Jonathan Liew at Trent Bridge"],"video_url":null,"description":"England set about chasing New Zealand’s first innings with an abandon not seen from them for several years in TestsTickets for this Test went on sale last September, and so the vast majority of fans at Trent Bridge on Sunday will have reserved their seats months in advance.

Really, you have to admire the leap of faith involved there. Batting collapses. Erratic weather. Covid postponements. For much of the last few years, buying a ticket to watch England play Test cricket has been an act of the purest optimism: the sporting equivalent of playing the lottery. Whatever the good people of the east Midlands thought they might see when they entered their credit card details last winter, it probably wasn’t this. Ollie Pope nailing down the No 3 spot with a glorious century. Ben Stokes lawlessly clouting some of the world’s best fast bowlers. England blazing 383 runs at more than four an over and wrestling back control of a match that 24 hours earlier had seemed like a lost cause. Which was why, whatever the final result, it was a quietly seismic day in the evolution of this side. England’s blitz may not save them the match, or even the series. But the shift in tone and tempo from the dying days of the Joe Root era was clear and stunning: not so much a red-ball reset as a red‑ball rejoicing. On a breezy and tumultuous day in Nottingham, England finally rediscovered their sense of fun. Pope and Root centuries light up England’s reply against New Zealand Read more Nobody was having a better time than Root himself. The temptation will simply be to file his 28th Test century away with all the others: the latest entry in an infinite scroll of excellence. But there was something different about this innings, a madness to his method. You could see it in the way he bounded down the steps long before the tea interval was over, just desperate to get back out there. You could see it in the way he celebrated reaching three figures: not smiling but convulsing with laughter, like a man who had just heard the world’s funniest joke. Then there were the shots: the audacious top-edged slog sweep off Tim Southee, the numerous sashays down the pitch, a genuinely ridiculous on-drive played to a ball pitched around a foot outside off-stump. It was his fastest Test century, a riotous mickey-take of an innings, laced with all the freedom and frivolity we associated with him in his younger, pre-captaincy days. Never again will he endure a sleepless night over some insoluble selection dilemma. Never again will he have to front up at the end of another crushing series defeat to insist his team showed “lots of character”. Already he looks a different player because of it. For the last five years, Root scored runs because he had to. Here, he looked like a man scoring runs because he could. Frequently Root has made Test batting look easy. But rarely has he made it look this enjoyable. Of course, this was a gorgeous featherbed of a surface, the same surface upon which New Zealand had so comfortably plundered 553. But go back through the history of this side and a favourable pitch has rarely been a guarantee of very much at all. There are few sides in world cricket more adept at getting bowled out for 250 on a 450 pitch: Sydney and Adelaide on the last two Ashes tours, Old Trafford in 2019, Visakhapatnam and Centurion in 2016. Joe Root walks off at the end of play 163 not out. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Since Trevor Bayliss took over as coach in 2015 – generally regarded as the start of English cricket’s Vibes Era – there have been nine occasions when their openers have walked out facing a first-innings total of 400 or more. Only once previously (against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi) did they manage to get even within 100. So yes, easy runs. But even easy runs have often been beyond England in recent years. And what was notable here was the rate of England’s run-making as much as the volume: a refusal to dig in and sit on a 1-0 lead, a masterclass in playing the conditions and not the scoreboard, a desire not simply to survive but to win. Pope and Alex Lees showed early intent despite both essentially playing for their places. Stokes barely allowed himself a sighter before thwacking the ball to all parts. Even Ben Foakes looked busy and purposeful in the final session. There are perhaps parallels here with the Lord’s Test of 2015, when Stokes and Root batted England to a famous fifth-day victory over Brendon McCullum’s New Zealand despite conceding 523 in their first innings. It was a victory that felt like an epiphany, a reminder that after a joyless and toxic couple of years, English cricket could still be worthy of our love. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Hardly anybody remembers that England went on to lose the next Test and draw the series 1-1. What people remember is the abandon, the ambition, the novel sensation of feeling something about this stupid team again. Now Stokes and McCullum are in cahoots, and here was perhaps the clearest articulation yet of their vision. As stumps were drawn and the last of the spectators filed out of Trent Bridge, merrily singing their Ollie Pope songs, you could tell they weren’t really bothered about the flatness of the pitch, or the future of the 18-county model, or the internal governance of the England and Wales Cricket Board. Instead they looked like people who had bought a lottery ticket and just hit the jackpot.","pubDate":"2022-06-12 18:34:07","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41cfb62eb8d62ffa5eafebc0f29076cd0a5cd311/362_322_4350_2610/master/4350.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b5d3aa5cbce8cf466a37a65046f629b","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Klaasen fifty puts S Africa 2-0 ahead against India","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/06/13/cricket-klaasen-fifty-puts-s-africa-2-0-ahead-against-india","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Heinrich Klaasen capitalised on his chance selection to smash 81 off 46 balls as South Africa beat India by four wickets in the second Twenty20 International for a 2-0 series lead in Cuttack on Sunday.

The big call at the start of their alliance as captain and head coach came at the top of the order. Root was restored to his favourite position at No 4, while Pope was asked to slot in one place above, despite having never having done so previously in first-class cricket and after a winter of technical confusion. Many an onlooker wondered whether England’s new-found mantra of positivity was trying a bit too hard. These are early days in the new regime, of course, and the combination of a flat pitch and a snooker table outfield at Trent Bridge must also be kept in mind. Nevertheless, with England responding to New Zealand’s 553 all out by reaching 473 for five at the close, and the bulk of these runs coming through Pope’s 145 and a similarly sparkling 163 not out from the relentless Root, the reshuffle has some early breathing space. England v New Zealand: second Test, day three – live! Read more Stokes certainly seemed emboldened by all this when he entered the fray after tea at 344 for four. New Zealand were still 219 runs ahead and had finally struck back through the excellence of Trent Boult, bouncing out Pope the ball after pad malfunction and teasing a glove behind off Jonny Bairstow for eight. Initially aback by Stokes ransacking a 33-ball 46 that had Trent Bridge rocking, the tourists knew a chance was coming and suddenly they were celebrating once more. Though Stokes rather gifted Michael Bracewell a maiden Test wicket on debut attempting a third six off the off-spinner, the cool head of Root was still out there. The former captain had already brought up his 27th Test century - coming from 116 balls, also his quickest to date – and from 405 for five in the 95th over, he resumed last week’s match-winning alliance with Ben Foakes. The pair rode out the last hour under lights with relative assuredness for an unbroken stand of 68, even if Foakes was afforded one life on nine when Will Young grassed a swirling catch in the deep. The wicketkeeper will start day four on 24, even if the bulk of New Zealand’s overnight discussions will centre around Root and a player who, after that 115 not out at Lord’s, they last removed some 278 runs ago. Ollie Pope acknowledges the crowd after losing his wicket for 145. Photograph: Steve Bond/PPAUK/Shutterstock Pope had earlier played beautifully for what was his second Test century in his 25th appearance and a first since the start of the pandemic, his proficiency either side of the wicket well-suited to the conditions in Nottingham. Gone was the player who signed off from a grim Ashes series with a reverse Rory Burns - bowled around his legs by Pat Cummins in Hobart - and in his place the batter they so greatly admire at Surrey. Having resumed first thing on his overnight 51 - a staging post that benefited from a life on 37 - Pope met the challenge of New Zealand’s four-pronged pace attack by leaving well, picking the gaps and unfurling some crisp cover drives. By 1.53pm he was raising his bat to all corners after a clipped two into the leg-side off Matt Henry took him to three figures. The 24-year-old’s relief was palpable; so, too, the delight of his teammates, with Root sprinting a good 40 yards to deliver a warm embrace. Root, one half of a 187-run stand with Pope, was simply at his celestial best once more. He flirted with disaster a couple of times, admittedly, seeing a misjudged cut on 27 tipped over the bar by Tim Southee and a slog sweep on 52 off the same man somehow land safe. But otherwise it was vintage Root, his cover drives fit to grace the walls of the Louvre and his guides past backward point so dreamily effortless. It meant that for the second time in the day, at 3.33pm, New Zealand were applauding an opponent’s efforts. With the second new ball just moments away, Root saw an inside edge off Daryl Mitchell’s medium pace just evade the stumps to turn 99 into 103. His 13th Test score north of 150 was at least secured in more convincing fashion when, 25 minutes from stumps, he clipped Southee through mid-wicket for four. Like their English equivalents during the previous two days, it was hard work for the touring bowlers. Boult was typically waspish for his three for 89 but both Southee and Kyle Jamieson offered little threat, with the latter also aborting his 17th over due to pain in his lower back. Henry beat the bat but went at nearly five an over and his occasional deployment as an enforcer highlighted the absence of Neil Wagner’s flat-pitch heft. Henry did at least produce the one wicket during the first two sessions and, given the way things panned out thereafter, it may nag away at Alex Lees a touch. Not that the Durham opener didn’t advance his nascent England career. Resuming on 34, already his highest Test score in his ninth innings, Lees drove the third ball of the morning through extra cover for four and continued this positivity en route to 67 from 125 balls. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Lees eventually perished playing away from his body - Mitchell atoning for his drops at first slip the previous evening - but the left-hander’s graph is going in the right direction. As with the smoke that might have met Pope’s century, Stokes and McCullum will hope his sense of belonging in the Test arena tracks this upward curve.","pubDate":"2022-06-12 18:09:25","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f787f6afec2ddceba3241795a8bc3a5ef949066/342_172_5007_3004/master/5007.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e351e3e89fa100d2e11496e772e8882b","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Joe Root scores century as England rack up the runs on day three to eat into New Zealand's lead in second Test - Sky Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5za3lzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvbmV3cy8xMjEyMy8xMjYzMjczMC9qb2Utcm9vdC1zY29yZXMtY2VudHVyeS1hcy1lbmdsYW5kLXJhY2stdXAtdGhlLXJ1bnMtb24tZGF5LXRocmVlLXRvLWVhdC1pbnRvLW5ldy16ZWFsYW5kcy1sZWFkLWluLXNlY29uZC10ZXN00gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Joe Root scores century as England rack up the runs on day three to eat into New Zealand's lead in second Test  Sky SportsEngland fight back against New Zealand: second Test, day three – as it happened  The GuardianRuns Galore On Day 2 | Highlights | England v New Zealand- Day 2 | 2nd LV= Insurance Test 2022  England & Wales Cricket BoardEngland v New Zealand highlights: Mitchell's 190 puts New Zealand in control  BBCPope and Root centuries light up England’s reply against New Zealand  The GuardianView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-12 17:53:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs South Africa 2nd T20I Highlights: Heinrich Klaasen 81 Powers South Africa To 4-Wicket Win vs India - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2luZGlhLXZzLXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYS0yMDIyL2luZGlhLXZzLXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYS0ybmQtdDIwaS0yMDIyLWluZC12cy1zYS1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMzA2MDYxONIBgQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pbmRpYS12cy1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtMjAyMi9pbmRpYS12cy1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtMm5kLXQyMGktMjAyMi1pbmQtdnMtc2EtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLTMwNjA2MTgvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs South Africa 2nd T20I Highlights: Heinrich Klaasen 81 Powers South Africa To 4-Wicket Win vs India  NDTV SportsIND vs SA 2nd T20 Highlights: Klaasen, Miller star as South Africa defeat India by 4 wickets, go 2-0 up in series  The Indian ExpressIndia vs South Africa 2nd T20 Highlights: Heinrich Klaasen's 81 outplays hosts  Hindustan TimesAakash Chopra provides simple fix for Indian bowling: Give Yuzvendra Chahal his full quota of overs  India TodayWatch: Yuzvendra Chahal Castles Temba Bavuma, Sends Back The Proteas Captain For 35  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-12 17:19:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ben Stokes net worth: How tall is Ben Stokes?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ben-stokes-net-worth-how-tall-is-ben-stokes/","keywords":["Cricket","Ben Stokes","England","New Zealand tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ben Stokes net worth: The England skipper fell just four runs shy of an aggressive half-century during 2nd Test match versus New Zealand.

On ‘Day 3’ of the ongoing second Test match between England and New Zealand at the Trent Bridge in Nottingham, England’s newly inducted Test skipper Ben Stokes entertained the crowd with a stroke-filled innings of 46 off mere 33 deliveries, to further lessen New Zealand’s massive first innings lead. The day couldn’t have started on a better note for England, as Joe Root, smashing back-to-back centuries paired up with young Ollie Pope (145), who hit his first Test ton at home, to stitch together a massive 187-run partnership for the third wicket. The duo managed to bat the entire morning and afternoon sessions, to deny the Kiwi quicks a massive inroad into the match, after having posted 553/10 in their first innings. At the time of writing, England had posted 422/5 on the scoreboard across 100 Overs, with Root (132*) going strong as ever alongside Ben Foakes (9*), and a 131 run deficit yet to be erased. Ben Stokes last two innings are basically how a drunk uncle dances at your wedding. — Jarrod Kimber (@ajarrodkimber) June 12, 2022 As per various reports, the England all-format all-rounder had a net worth of $10 million as of the year 2021, which roughly gets translated to INR 75 Crore. The above approximate figure also includes an annual contract worth around $1.8 million (or nearly INR 8.75 Crore) with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). As per yet another report, Stokes’ net worth has grown by about 40% in the last three years, which includes the lucrative deals from the IPL, and various brand endorsements.

During the third ODI of the ongoing Pakistan’s tour of West Indies in Multan, individual half-centuries by vice-captain Shadab Khan (86) and opening batter Imam-ul-Haq (62) have powered Pakistan to 269/9 in 48 overs . Haq , who was part of a partnership milestone alongside captain Babar Azam (1) in the second ODI at the same venue, became only the second batter to score seven 50+ consecutive scores in ODIs on the back of his 14th half-century in the format. Shadab, on the other hand, scored his fourth ODI half-century making the most of a batting promotion at No. 7. Coming in to bat in the 25th over, Shadab registered a career-best knock hitting four fours and three sixes at a strike rate of 110.25. Needing 14 runs off six balls to complete a maiden international century, the 23-year old player was dismissed on the first ball of the last over. Having played multiple impact-generating innings in Pakistan Super League 2022, Shadab replicated the same form at the highest level today. As mentioned above, readers must note that Shadab currently holds an additional responsibility in the form of being Azam’s deputy in white-ball cricket. It was less than a year ago that PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) had promoted Shadab to this role in ODIs and T20Is.

According to a Cricbuzz report, with the value per match crossing the Rs. 100-crore mark, the overall value of the media rights has touched Rs. 41,000 crore as of now, with two parties, whose names are yet to be known, not willing to give up on the digital rights of the mega event. “At Rs. 54.5 crore per match, the value of the television rights have gone up to RS. 22,345 crore while at Rs. 46 crore per match, the digital bid has gone up to Rs. 18,860 crore. The combined value of the of rights so far is Rs. 41,205 crore,” said the report. “Having crossed the Rs. 100 crore barrier, the overall value has shot up to Rs. 41000 crore at this stage, given that the number of games in the 2023-27 cycle will be a minimum of 410. That is Rs. 5000 crore more than the overall base price of the full rights package. The base price for all packages was around Rs 90 crore,” further said the report. The report further mentioned that there is a strong chance for digital rights value to come very close to the price of the television rights. “That is a major development and the overall price is expected to breach the glass ceiling. As is well known, the base price for the TV was fixed at Rs. 49 crore and for digital it is INR 33 crore. So far, the digital is believed to have gone past Rs. 46 crore while the bidding value for the TV remains at Rs. 54.5 crore,” added the report. Apart from packages A and B, which are television and digital groupings for the Indian broadcast region, there are two more packages in fray as well – like package C, which has 18-game non-exclusive special matches (base price of Rs. 11 crore) and package D, which is rest of the world rights (base price of Rs. 3 crore). The report also said that with Sunday’s auction proceedings to pause at 6pm, the IPL media rights auction will carry forward to Monday as well, as per the rules set by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). It added that the bidders are making full use of the 30-minute gap present between every bid. Star India were the current holders of the IPL rights for 2017-22 cycle, with a winning bid of Rs. 16,347.50 crore for both TV and digital in September 2017. Previously, Sony Pictures Network won the IPL TV media rights for a period of 10 years during the inception of the tournament with a bid of Rs. 8200 crore.

After taking on cricket as part of its $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox in 2019, Disney is expected to be one of three bidders in the auction, along with Reliance Industries and Sony Group Corp. The multi-year rights package is expected to fetch somewhere between $6 billion and $8 billion, with the winner of the auction expected to be picked in the coming days. The IPL ’s two-month tournament is usually held in April and May. In a surprise, Amazon dropped out of the running late last week, according to multiple press reports. The tech giant has not been afraid to shell out hefty sums to carry the NFL, European soccer and other live sports, but it has also faced a choppier operating environment of late and a cratering share price. Related Story International Insider: Disney France Woes; 42's Splash; Banff Incoming; 'Lady Of Heaven' Saga With Amazon out the picture, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance is widely tipped to be in pole position for the cricketing mega package. Reliance has reportedly been preparing for the auction for months, hiring top executives since last year to deliver the win and oversee coverage if victorious. One of Reliance’s major subsidiaries is Network 18, the mass media conglomerate that operates Viacom 18 and History TV 18 with Viacom and A+E Networks respectively, and the outfit will be keen to wrestle back some of the Indian viewer market share from Disney by securing the lucrative package. Sony’s interest has been galvanized by its recent merger deal between its India subsidiary and Zee Entertainment, which will create a newly fortified local player. A person familiar with Disney’s strategic thinking heading into the negotiations told Deadline the company was not inclined to get carried away, given its many other priorities in funding streaming and the rest of its global operations. Yet cricket has been an important driver of the company’s steady subscription gains, especially given the distribution setup for Disney+. In India and some other territories, the service is offered as a low-cost add-on to Hotstar, which was the former Fox property established several years ago in the region. More than one-third of the nearly 138 million subscriptions to Disney+ are on Disney+Hotstar, which has resulted in lower average revenue per subscriber compared to that of streaming rivals. Many Wall Street analysts say the billions required to keep cricket could be better invested in areas with better prospects for higher returns. “Ultimately we think a disciplined approach to these rights makes sense, even if Disney loses the IP,” Morgan Stanley media analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a recent note to clients. “It will likely put downward pressure on Disney+Hotstar subs and maybe put Disney’s fiscal 2024 guidance at risk, but the profit potential out of India is minimal in most scenarios and we do not see this materially impacting long-term earnings power.” CEO Bob Chapek has not been afraid to wave the yellow caution flag when asked about his view of the bidding. “While certainly, it’s an important component” of the company’s streaming offering, he said on an earnings call last February, “the local content that we’re developing really will mitigate the impact of this if we were not to win the auction on IPL.” The company last year began ramping up local-language original production around the world, putting dozens of film and TV titles in the pipeline. One looming question is whether Disney would be forced to lower its projections for 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. Thus far, the company has reiterated that guidance as well as its forecast of profitability in streaming by that same point.

Y Carlos Sainz quedó afuera por problemas en su caja. Por infobae.com Ferrari busca recuperar los títulos de Pilotos y Constructores en la Fórmula 1 . Este año su auto, la F1-75, demostró su potencial con los dos triunfos de Charles Leclerc , quien llegó a liderar el certamen. Pero en las últimas carreras la Scuderia de Maranello viene cometiendo errores que se sumaron a las fallas mecánicas del Gran Premio de Azerbaiyán , en el que venció Max Verstappen (Red Bull) y se alejó en la punta del torneo . Leclerc consiguió la pole positions en el circuito callejero de Bakú y esperó recuperarse con el objetivo de ganar y volver a la cima del campeonato. Pero desde la largada se complicó ya que fue superado por Sergio Pérez (Red Bull) antes de llegar a la primera curva. Luego el monegasco buscó no perderle pisada a Checo, que comandó las acciones en el inicio hasta que en el noveno giro, Carlos Sainz , el otro ferrarista, tuvo un problema en la caja de cambios en su coche y quedó parado en la calle de escape de la curva 4. Se produjo el ingreso del auto de seguridad virtual y Leclerc ingresó en la vuelta 10 a hacer su primera parada, pero perdió tiempo ya que no pudieron sacar el cricket (5 segundos la detención) . Fue una falla que no debe pasar en un equipo de la Máxima y menos en uno del nivel de Ferrari. El monegasco quedó tercero detrás de los corredores de Red Bull. El abandono de Carlos Sainz por fallas en la caja de cambios Aunque en la vuelta 21 se produjo otro golpe de escena ya que salió humo del motor de combustión del auto de Leclerc y su falla lo dejó afuera de carrera . Verstappen pasó a comandar la competencia delante de Checo Pérez. Fue la tercera carrera en la que el monegasco perdió un triunfo, ya sea por problemas en su auto y errores en la estrategia de su equipo. “La falla fue de repente. Estoy muy desilusionado, aunque pasé por problemas más difíciles en mi carrera. Pero el campeonato es largo”, afirmó Charles en su primera intervención con los medios en los boxes. “Fue muy frustrante y fue un día negativo para todo el equipo. Es muy difícil tomar ritmo para mí en este campeonato. Pero tenemos que estar unidos como equipo y esperemos que no vuelva a pasar”, afirmó Sainz. Ferrari se fue de Azerbaiyán sin poder sumar ni siquiera un punto. Leclerc quedó tercero en el campeonato a 34 puntos de Verstappen y por tercera vez seguida perdió un posible triunfo ya sea por fallas propias o del equipo. La falla en el motor de combustión de Leclerc En España desertó por un problema en el en el turbo y el MGU-H, que es el sistema que aprovecha los gases del motor para generar energía eléctrica. Su deserción le costó la punta del campeonato que desde ese momento pasó a manos de Verstappen . En Mónaco lideró, pero su escuadra lo llamó antes de lo esperado a los boxes para poner gomas 17° para poner gomas intermedias para lluvia. Perdió el liderazgo de la carrera. Pero lo peor pasó en el giro 22 cuando lo hicieron entrar otra vez, aunque en el mismo momento que estaba Sainz. El desconcierto en Ferrari fue total y Charles pegó un grito ensordecedor: “¡Mierda, mierda! ¿Por qué hicieron esto?” Este domingo Leclerc sumó otra frustración y con el agravante de haber partido por tercera vez al hilo desde la pole positions. Ferrari deberá repasar por qué el motor del monegasco dijo basta y qué ocurrió en la transmisión del coche de Sainz. Si el team italiano quiere recuperar sus laureles, tendrá que hacer lo posible para evitar que se repita estos problemas. Hace unos días, su actual jefe, Mattia Binotto , dijo que “ el objetivo de su equipo era volver a ser competitivos, pero no ganar por el título …” La Rossa no consigue un título de Pilotos desde 2007 con Kimi Räikkönen y desde 2008 no lo hace en el de Constructores.","pubDate":"2022-06-12 15:35:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"lapatilla","country":["venezuela"],"category":["sports"],"language":"spanish"},{"title":"North West Cricket Results 11/06/2022","link":"https://highlandradio.com/2022/06/12/north-west-cricket-results-11-06-2022/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["highlandsport"],"video_url":null,"description":"It wasn’t all doom and gloom on Saturday and despite the day’s play being washed out in the IPT20 Festival at Bready, supporters did get to enjoy some quality action in the Long’s SuperValu League programme.

Game of the day was undoubtedly at the Holm where despite both sides missing two players each on Interprovincial duty, Newbuildings clung on to beat the hosts with the last pair of batsmen at the wicket. The win took Newbuildings to the top of the group, replacing Burndennett, who slipped from first to fourth with defeat at Coleraine. In Group A, Brigade moved into second place after a facile win at Strabane, the visitors winning by 8 wickets with 4 overs in the bank.

During the third ODI of the ongoing West Indies’ tour of Pakistan in Multan, bizarre weather conditions have resulted in reducing the length of the contest to 48 overs per side. Hence, after multiple delays, Pakistan batter Khushdil Shah and spinner Shadab Khan have resumed the innings to bring up a 50-run sixth-wicket partnership. With over 10 overs still remaining, the onus remains on these two to steer Pakistan to a respectable total in this dead-rubber. Pakistan captain Babar Azam (1) winning the toss and electing to bat not only witnessed his team struggling but the 27-year old player himself registered a rare low score in ODIs. It was right after the 33rd over that players returned to their respective dressing rooms due to a dust storm at the Multan Cricket Stadium. In what is a common phenomenon in the summer season in Multan due to the presence of sand dunes in the nearby areas, it kept players off the players for quite some time. Even when umpires and players looked to resume play twice, things didn’t materialize because of repeated rounds of dust storms. In the general run of things, such a dust storm is mostly followed by a brief spell of rain. It’s pretty murky out there!

During the third and final ODI of West Indies’ tour of Pakistan at the Multan Cricket Stadium, West Indies skipper and wicket-keeper batter Nicholas Pooran surprisingly impressed one and all with the ball in hand, to open up his wickets tally in international Cricket. After an excellent 85-run stand for the first wicket between Fakhar Zaman (35 off 48) and Imam-ul-Haq (62 off 68), which also saw the latter smashing his 7th consecutive half-century in ODIs, it was Pooran who drew first blood by getting rid of the dangerous Fakhar during the 17th Over. After scalping his first-ever wicket in the format, the 26-year-old then struck twice in his 6th Over, to remove the in-form Imam and a delivery later, Mohammad Haris at the score of naught. Finally, in his next Over, he also got rid of Pakistan’s star wicket-keeper batter Mohammad Rizwan (11 off 21) to pick his maiden four-wicket haul in ODIs. He eventually ended up with his bowling figures of 10-0-48-4. Former West Indian legendary pacer Ian Bishop took to his social media handle to hilariously compare Pooran to the legendary Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, after getting seemingly impressed with his off-spin bowling, and returning with his career best figures in the 50-Over format.

Shorter ball, wide of off, that one stays low as well. Shreyas Iyer leaves it alone. Wide called! 10.2 overs (1 Run) Shorter ball, darting it on the pads. Hardik Pandya flicks it towards short fine leg for a single. 10.1 overs (0 Run) A fuller ball, spinning in, down leg. Hardik Pandya looks to sweep but he misses and gets hit on his back pad. A huge appeal for LBW, but the umpire says no! Temba Bavuma opts for a review! No bat involved there, confirms UltraEdge. Ball Tracking indicates that was missing the wickets. The on-field decision stands. South Africa lose a review.","pubDate":"2022-06-12 14:48:09","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637906618809603141.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Proud to Witness Evolution of Cricket, IPL Generates More Revenue Than English Premier League: Sourav Ganguly","link":"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/sports/proud-to-witness-evolutioncricket-ipl-generates-more-revenue-than-english-premier-league-sourav-ganguly_16495261.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sourav Ganguly is elated to witness the growth of cricket and said it will continue to evolve in the coming years.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-12 14:39:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"moneycontrol","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan Star Becomes Only Second Batter To Achieve Huge Feat In ODIs","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/pakistan-star-imam-ul-haq-becomes-only-second-batter-to-achieve-huge-feat-in-odis-3060863","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan cricket team's Imam-ul-Haq is closing in on a huge ODI record","content":"Imam-ul-Haq continued his rich vein of form as he scored his seventh successive scores of fifty or more during the third Pakistan-West Indies ODI in Multan on Sunday. In reaching the 50-run mark, Imam became only the second cricketer to score more than six straight half-centuries in ODIs. However, Pakistan cricket team captain Babar Azam , who had scored his sixth successive half-century, fell for just 1 and missed out on a record. Pakistan have already sealed the three-ODI series after winning the first two ODIs. Imam, who was out for 62 in the third ODI, had scores of 56, 103, 106, 89, 65 and 72 in the earlier matches. Imam has now surpassed Mark Waugh , Gordon Greenidge , Andrew Jones, Mohammad Yusuf, Chris Gayle , Shai Hope , Paul Stirling , Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson in the elite list of batters with 6 straight 50-plus scores in ODIs. Pakistan batting legend Javed Miandad holds the record for the most consecutive 50-plus scores in ODIs. He had 9 straight score of 50-plus in the year 1987. A post shared by Pakistan Cricket (@therealpcb) Pakistan's captain won the toss and chose to bat in the third and final day-night international against the West Indies in Multan on Sunday. Pakistan, who have an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series, handed an ODI debut to 23-year-old fast bowler Shahnawaz Dahani , who came into the side in place of Haris Rauf . Hasan Ali returned to the side, giving fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi a rest. West Indies made three changes, as they left out Alzarri Joseph , Anderson Phillip and Brandon King to bring in Keacy Carty , Jayden Seales and Keemo Paul . Pakistan won the first match by five wickets and the second by 120 runs -- both in Multan.

During the third and final ODI of West Indies’ tour of Pakistan at the Multan Cricket Stadium, Pakistan’s Southpaw opener Imam-ul-Haq has notched up his third consecutive half-century of the series, and his 14 th overall, after his skipper Babar Azam won the Toss and elected to bat first. The half-century moment arrived during the 18 th Over of the innings, after Pakistan got off to an excellent start with an 85-run opening stand for the first wicket between Imam-ul-Haq and Fakhar Zaman. With a single at the long-on region, Imam also brought up against his name, a rare record in the One day International format of the game. With his knock of 62 off 68 deliveries today, the 26-year-old left-hander has now smashed a total of seven consecutive half-centuries in the ODIs – the second highest streak for any batter in the world in the format till date. Imam, with six consecutive fifties before today, had held on to the joint-second spot in the consecutive ODI fifties list, with the likes of his fellow team mate Babar Azam , along with Gordon Greenidge (WI), Yousuf Youhana (PAK), Kane Williamson (NZ), Shai Hope (WI) and six other batters in the list as well. Former Pakistan batter Javed Miandad is presently at the top of the list with a total of nine consecutive fifties under his belt, all of which were scored in the year 1987. Imam-ul-Haq continues his exceptional run with a 7th consecutive 50+ score in ODIs. There’s proving your doubters wrong and then there’s making them question all of their life’s choices.

He says that he is trying to stay as fit as possible, and he is trying to give full intensity in the game. Adds that the wicket looked difficult to bat on in the previous game, but India scored over 200 and they were taken aback, but they knew the pitch is good for batting and the batters did a phenomenal job. However, there are still areas to improve. Mentions that they will try to do the same thing, only tweak a few things as a team. Rishabh Pant the captain of India says that they would have bowled first as well, as they have not played here, but it does matter. Adds that the track looks nice and they want to put a score on the board. They said they did not really do anything wrong in the first game, it was only about executions. Informs they are playing the same team. Temba Bavuma the skipper of South Africa says that they will bowl first as they don't know how the wicket will play. Mentions that it was easier to bat second in the last game, they can chase anything with smaller boundaries. Informs that they two forced changes. Quinton de Kock has a hamstring injury, so Heinrich Klaasen comes in, Reeza Hendricks is in for Tristan Stubbs as well. India (Unchanged Playing XI) - Ishan Kishan, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (C/WK), Hardik Pandya, Dinesh Karthik, Axar Patel, Harshal Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Avesh Khan, Yuzvendra Chahal.

TOSS - South Africa have won the toss and they have elected to BOWL first! PITCH REPORT - Deep Dasgupta is near the pitch. He says that the pitch is the center of the ground, so equal dimensions on both sides The pitch has a fair bit of grass, and a few cracks, so it means not much for the seamers or even for the spinners. Mentions that the wicket is a bit two-paced and also there are fewer chances of dew playing a factor in this game. Informs that the par score is around 160 to 170, the pitch looks tacky but 160 should be good enough.","pubDate":"2022-06-12 13:05:47","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637906557389392696.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Pope leads England fightback in second test","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/06/12/cricket-pope-leads-england-fightback-in-second-test","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"NOTTINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Ollie Pope was closing in on his second test century and opener Alex Lees hit his maiden fifty as England reached 195-2 at lunch on the third day of the second test against New Zealand on Sunday.

Whitefoord believes Naylor, who scored 144no against Carlton the previous week, is a star in the making, even comparing his young team-mate to big-hitting Scotland batter George Munsey . Munsey returned to the Corstorphine ranks from international duty but was not needed to bat as Naylor dominated the innings with a 36-ball 72no including fourteen boundaries. Whitefoord said: “Liam has been particularly brilliant – his knock at Carlton was the best I’ve seen in club cricket and the way he went about his business today was great to watch. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anybody hit the ball as cleanly as he does – he’s certainly giving George a run for his money on that front. I can’t wait to see how far he goes in the future.” Of his own performance, the bowler added: “I was just glad to contribute but the whole team has been playing at such a high standard and it’s great to be a part of it.” Heriot’s continue to lead the way after their win over Carlton at Goldenacre where skipper Lloyd Brown’s 53no guided the home team to their 157 target. Grange have moved into third place, Chris Greaves’ 128 powering them to 342-7 against Forfarshire who were then dismissed for 130 at Portgower Place. Akarshan Arora claimed 6-38 in Watsonians’ 91-run victory over Arbroath at Myreside while Stewarts Melville had a 14-run D/L success against Falkland at Inverleith. Western Premier champions Clydesdale slipped to their second defeat of the campaign as Ayr’s revival continued at Titwood. In a match punctuated by frequent rain breaks, the home side never recovered from the loss of two early wickets and were skittled for 93, Matthew Baines claiming 3-7, before the visitors lost just one wicket in cruising to a revised target of 80. Moneeb Iqbal’s brilliant 110 helped Uddingston to a 112-run win at Kelburne, Dumfries prevailed by 7 runs against West of Scotland while Ferguslie eased to victory over Langside.
