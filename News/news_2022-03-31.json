The Rocket landed a final-frame knockout blow on Class of 1992 rival Mark Williams for a classic 10-9 win in Llandudno that sets up a Tour Championship semi-final against Neil Robertson. ITV4Ronnie O’Sullivan beat Mark Williams in a thrilling clash to reach the Tour Championship semi-final[/caption] ITV4Williams gave as good as he got but was edged in an instant classic[/caption] The heavyweight snooker pair slugged away at each other all day at the Venue Cymru but it was six-time world champion O’Sullivan, 46, that put his rival on the canvas. And one of the best matches of the season was lapped up by Liverpool MMA lightweight Pimblett, 27, fresh from his recent big win over Rodrigo Vargas at the O2 Arena.  In a contest that had everything there was even a ‘Fart-gate’ incident in frame 16 as O’Sullivan accused referee Leo Scullion of breaking wind next to him.  But the six-time world champion, who will return to world No1 after this event, is still in the hunt for a second title in this tournament reserved for the eight best-performing players of the campaign.

Mark’s long potting was incredible all match, he didn’t miss one.  “I was struggling in that area and that puts a lot of pressure on the rest of your game. Neil Robertson will have to go some to beat that in the semi-final. “It’s hard to judge your performances, but I didn’t want to go home tomorrow. Even if I had lost I might have stayed, done some runs and had some food.”  For Williams there was more but familiar disappointment. He has not beaten O’Sullivan in a two-session match for 22 years, and only once in any ranking event over 20 seasons. ITV4UFC star Paddy Pimblett was in attendance[/caption] Williams said: “It was a great match to be involved in – but Ronnie must really hate me. He always plays like that every time we go up against each other.  “I maybe should have won that one, but not getting over the line… perhaps that is why I never get to beat him.” It was a 49th career meeting between players in their 30th season on tour, and the packed crowd gave the pair a huge ovation.  And it wasn’t long before players with 107 professional titles between them started to turn on the style. After warming up with a 56, the Rocket rattled in efforts of 84 and a tournament-high 131 to lead 3-1.   Despite another ton from the Essex pro, Williams dug in and breaks of 58, 52 and 92 saw him claw back to 4-3 adrift.  Most read in Other Sports PAYING THE PRICE Price will take to oche with broken hand but charity boxing match delayed MIC DROP British commentary duo SACKED for calling figure skater 'b**** from Canada' READY TO JOE Watch darts stars Anderson and Cullen go head to head in angry oche bust-up OH BUOY University Boat Race - Oxford vs Cambridge: TV channel, live stream, start time WHIZZ KIDS London to host first ever E-Scooter Grand Prix with races reaching up to 100kmh SELBY VS MURPHY Selby lands bumper £500k payday after securing FOURTH world title FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS – BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS But O’Sullivan finished the session two clear after a run of 89 – and the star turns traded centuries and big breaks like heavyweight boxers in the evening to leave the score 7-5 to the world No2.

During the sixth match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League) at Dr DY Patil Cricket Stadium in Mumbai, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) skipper Faf du Plessis had won the Toss and elected to field first. The KKR batters got off to a poor start having lost three of its top batters after the end of the Powerplay with 44 runs on the board. But there was no stopping their batters despite the vulnerable situation, as they kept going for the aggressive strokeplay despite wickets falling at regular intervals. Courtesy of some mindless slogging from some of its batters, they eventually found themselves reeling at 101/ 9 in mere 14.3 Overs. A 27-run partnership between Umesh Yadav (18 off 12) and Varun Chakaravarthy (10 off 16) for the final wicket meant that KKR huffed and puffed towards the score of 128 in 18.5 Overs. Pacer Harshal Patel (4-2-11-2) and leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga (4-0-20-4) were the pick of the bowlers for the RCB, with the former bowling the rarest of the rare two consecutive maidens in the IPL and the T20 format. In reply, du Plessis’ men got off to an even worse start than their rivals, having lost 3 wickets during the Powerplay with only 36 runs on the board, credit to some brilliant bowling by the fast-bowling duo of Umesh Yadav (4-0-16-2) and Tim Southee (4-0-20-3). The overseas all-rounder duo of David Willey (18 off 28) and Sherfane Rutherford (28 off 40) then took the burden upon themselves to rescue the drowning ship, but arguably it was a lovely little innings by Shahbaz Ahmed (27 off 20) that blew life into the chase. Result of IPL match yesterday The shift in momentum took place during the 13th Over when Iyer decided to bring Andre Russell (2.2-0-36-0) back into the attack. Shahbaz smashed a couple of sixes off him during the Over, to provide momentum to the chase, with the experienced Dinesh Karthik yet to arrive at the crease. Having finished the remarkable spells of his fast-bowling duo of Umesh Yadav (4-0-16-2) and Tim Southee (4-0-20-3) by the end of 18th Over, Iyer opted to go with Venkatesh Iyer ahead of Russell during the 19th, with 17 runs still needed of the final two Overs. Venkatesh then conceded 10 runs to, bring the equation down to 7 required off 6. Devoid of any other option, Iyer had to revert back to a possibly injury-ravaged Russell, who was in quite some discomfort while bowling his second Over earlier. It ultimately took only two deliveries for Karthik (14* off 7) to finish off the proceedings, as RCB won their first match of the season by 3 wickets. This is what the #IPL is all about!

Playing only his fourth match in the biggest T20 tournament across the globe, Hasaranga had the opportunity of guiding his team to victory with the bat but he was dismissed after scoring a boundary. It was in his attempt to hit consecutive boundaries off Tim Southee that Hasaranga had to return to the pavilion with RCB still needing 18 runs off 13 balls to seal a 129-run chase at the Dr DY Patil Cricket Academy. “Crucial situation, I got only four and got out.

Continuing to dent the opposition, Hasaranga put an end to Kolkata’s experiment of promoting all-rounder Sunil Narine (12) in the batting order. Additionally, the leg-spinner deceived Sheldon Jackson (0) by bowling an unplayable googly in the same over.

You don’t think? Queue here for an argument. You want trophies? How about two Ashes series wins, likely two World Cups and a series win over India, followed up by the newly cast Benaud-Qadir trophy? Australian captain Meg Lanning on the rampage. Credit: Getty Images You want figures? Try these: between them, Australia’s men and women have by my reckoning played 43 matches in three formats since October for 32 wins, five draws, three defeats and three no-results. You might argue that including the women’s team makes it artificial. I’d say that it makes it even more real. Yes, Australia have had unbeaten summers, but that was across two formats at most and one gender. Yes, they’ve won greater prizes, but not so many at once. Yes, it’s hard to compare apples with oranges, so let’s put some meat on those bones and turn this into a victory feast. Let’s take the men’s team first. That’s merely the chronological order, not merit. Pat Cummins leads the way. Credit: AP They were coming off two years of too little cricket and a shock home series defeat by India last summer. They were dealing with the vagaries of COVID-19. They lost a captain and a coach along the way, but found a leader. They were unfancied in the Twenty20 World Cup, but won it. They thrashed England in the Ashes. OK, England were and are feeble. They’ve won just one of their past 17 Test matches. But mystique alone puts a premium on Ashes wins. If you want to add nuance, the fall guys in landmark victories often are below par. Take two famous Australian triumphs for instance. England in 1948 were war-weakened and the West Indies in 1995 past their use-by date. But it would be impossible even for Duckworth-Lewis to calibrate the scales perfectly, so face value it must be. Incidentally, it suits Australia fine for England to think that their No.1 problem is Joe Root, the one man who actually stands up for them. Met with that mindset, Australia could pencil in the 2023 Ashes now, except that under Pat Cummins they would not be so presumptuous. Shaheen Afridi and David Warner shakes hands after Afridi dismisses Warner. Credit: AP Against England, Australia were irresistible. In Pakistan, as dictated by conditions, they were dogged. They beat Pakistan at their own game. Even two of their three drawn Tests this summer went down to the wire. They all furthered the narrative. To emphasise, in Test cricket a draw is a result. If you don’t believe that, you don’t believe in Test cricket and the whole wide sweep of its canvas. Most of all, Australia did all this with smiles on their faces. Here was the real revolution. Here was historical antithesis. Here’s the clincher to the argument. When Shaheen Afridi bowled David Warner with a beauty in Lahore, and offered his hand to shake, and Warner accepted it, I rubbed my eyes so hard it was a wonder a genie didn’t appear. I’m sure I wasn’t alone. If anything, the women’s efforts have been even more wondrous. Just as they were about to exploit the memorable moment of their Twenty20 World Cup win before an 80,000-strong crowd on the MCG two years ago, the COVID-19 shutters came down. Since, they have been a band of wandering minstrels, playing everywhere but home. Beth Mooney takes a catch as Australia and England play to a tense draw at Manuka Oval. Credit: Getty This summer, they’ve had to roll with the punches: the pandemic, the frustration of washouts, program changes at short notice, injury disruptions. Roll they have. Their Test matches against India and England both were drawn, but the England game waxed and waned until the end as only Test cricket can. It was perhaps the best women’s Test match yet. They’re few enough to remember. Rod Marsh and Shane Warne. Credit: Getty Images If once you might have sneered at the quality of the opposition; it won’t do now. Here’s the thing. Australia were the first country to take women’s cricket as seriously as men’s, giving them a head start. Now the rest of the world is chasing in earnest and it shows in the standard of play. Women’s cricket has depth at last, but Australia bestride it still. Their own golden generation is easing into their 30s, but a vibrant new generation is already being unleashed. Besides, captain Meg Lanning is having a Midas and Indian summer. With two weeks to go, she’s even leading The Age ’s AFLW tipping. There’s a pall to all this, of course. It’s the untimely deaths of Rod Marsh and Shane Warne, forced again to the forefront of all minds on Wednesday night. It wouldn’t do to trivialise either. But as I knew them, neither would want anything more now than another good cricket match, another trophy for Australia and another celebration. And let’s face it, now they’re in a position of influence with the true Powers That Be. So c’mon Warnie, c’mon Bacchus. One for the road, please?

You don’t think? Queue here for an argument. You want trophies? How about two Ashes series wins, likely two World Cups and a series win over India, followed up by the newly cast Benaud-Qadir trophy? Australian captain Meg Lanning on the rampage. Credit: Getty Images You want figures? Try these: between them, Australia’s men and women have by my reckoning played 43 matches in three formats since October for 32 wins, five draws, three defeats and three no-results. You might argue that including the women’s team makes it artificial. I’d say that it makes it even more real. Yes, Australia have had unbeaten summers, but that was across two formats at most and one gender. Yes, they’ve won greater prizes, but not so many at once. Yes, it’s hard to compare apples with oranges, so let’s put some meat on those bones and turn this into a victory feast. Let’s take the men’s team first. That’s merely the chronological order, not merit. Pat Cummins leads the way. Credit: AP They were coming off two years of too little cricket and a shock home series defeat by India last summer. They were dealing with the vagaries of COVID-19. They lost a captain and a coach along the way, but found a leader. They were unfancied in the Twenty20 World Cup, but won it. They thrashed England in the Ashes. OK, England were and are feeble. They’ve won just one of their past 17 Test matches. But mystique alone puts a premium on Ashes wins. If you want to add nuance, the fall guys in landmark victories often are below par. Take two famous Australian triumphs for instance. England in 1948 were war-weakened and the West Indies in 1995 past their use-by date. But it would be impossible even for Duckworth-Lewis to calibrate the scales perfectly, so face value it must be. Incidentally, it suits Australia fine for England to think that their No.1 problem is Joe Root, the one man who actually stands up for them. Met with that mindset, Australia could pencil in the 2023 Ashes now, except that under Pat Cummins they would not be so presumptuous. Shaheen Afridi and David Warner shakes hands after Afridi dismisses Warner. Credit: AP Against England, Australia were irresistible. In Pakistan, as dictated by conditions, they were dogged. They beat Pakistan at their own game. Even two of their three drawn Tests this summer went down to the wire. They all furthered the narrative. To emphasise, in Test cricket a draw is a result. If you don’t believe that, you don’t believe in Test cricket and the whole wide sweep of its canvas. Most of all, Australia did all this with smiles on their faces. Here was the real revolution. Here was historical antithesis. Here’s the clincher to the argument. When Shaheen Afridi bowled David Warner with a beauty in Lahore, and offered his hand to shake, and Warner accepted it, I rubbed my eyes so hard it was a wonder a genie didn’t appear. I’m sure I wasn’t alone. If anything, the women’s efforts have been even more wondrous. Just as they were about to exploit the memorable moment of their Twenty20 World Cup win before an 80,000-strong crowd on the MCG two years ago, the COVID-19 shutters came down. Since, they have been a band of wandering minstrels, playing everywhere but home. Beth Mooney takes a catch as Australia and England play to a tense draw at Manuka Oval. Credit: Getty This summer, they’ve had to roll with the punches: the pandemic, the frustration of washouts, program changes at short notice, injury disruptions. Roll they have. Their Test matches against India and England both were drawn, but the England game waxed and waned until the end as only Test cricket can. It was perhaps the best women’s Test match yet. They’re few enough to remember. Rod Marsh and Shane Warne. Credit: Getty Images If once you might have sneered at the quality of the opposition; it won’t do now. Here’s the thing. Australia were the first country to take women’s cricket as seriously as men’s, giving them a head start. Now the rest of the world is chasing in earnest and it shows in the standard of play. Women’s cricket has depth at last, but Australia bestride it still. Their own golden generation is easing into their 30s, but a vibrant new generation is already being unleashed. Besides, captain Meg Lanning is having a Midas and Indian summer. With two weeks to go, she’s even leading The Age ’s AFLW tipping. There’s a pall to all this, of course. It’s the untimely deaths of Rod Marsh and Shane Warne, forced again to the forefront of all minds on Wednesday night. It wouldn’t do to trivialise either. But as I knew them, neither would want anything more now than another good cricket match, another trophy for Australia and another celebration. And let’s face it, now they’re in a position of influence with the true Powers That Be. So c’mon Warnie, c’mon Bacchus. One for the road, please?

The Sune Luus-led side wrapped up their league stage with a second-placed finish. They won five of their league stage fixtures, losing one with another gae getting washed out as they stitched together 11 points. In their previous fixture, South Africa defeated India by three wickets. Meanwhile, England reached the semifinals in dramatic finish. The Heather Knight-led side began with three defeats and then followed it up by winning their remaining four games on the trot. During the league stage, England bagged eight points in seven games and defeated Bangladesh by 100 runs in their last league game. (LIVE SCORECARD) The 2022 Women's World Cup has been an exciting watch and the tournament now is nearing its completion. In the second semi-final, South Africa Women will take on England Women in a repeat of the semi-final from the 2017 edition of the tournament. South Africa certainly have been the surprise package of the tournament and apart from a couple of stutters on the way, they have been the only team to have kept pace with the mighty Aussies. Laura Wolvaardt leads the charts in most runs scored in the tournament and she has been simply sensational. The likes of Marizanne Kapp and Shabnim Ismail too have done well with the ball and they will look to take the confidence from the thrilling win against India in the final group game into this clash and make it through to the final. England seemed down and out midway through the tournament but they have come roaring back in the final few games to make the knockouts and even when they aren't at their best, they have the edge in the big games. They lost to South Africa in the group stages in an exciting match which went down to the wire but they did defeat their opponents in the semi-final in 2017. Natalie Sciver and Sophie Ecclestone have been the standout performers for them but more players have started ticking at the right moment. So, will South Africa Women be able to avenge their loss from four years ago? Or will England Women make it through to yet another final?","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/p6ddtd0o_marizanne-kapp-vs-england-afp_625x300_14_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SA-W vs ENG-W Dream11 Team Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Hints: Captain, Probable Playing 11s, Team News; Injury Updates For Today’s SA-W vs ENG-W ODI World Cup Semi-final Match at Hagley Oval, Christchurch 6:30 AM IST March 31","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/sa-w-vs-eng-w-dream11-team-prediction-fantasy-cricket-hints-captain-probable-playing-11s-team-news-injury-updates-for-today-s-sa-w-vs-eng-w-odi-world-cup-semi-final-match-at-hagley-oval-christchurch-630-am-ist-march-31-2449234.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa Women vs England Women Dream11 Team Prediction South Africa Women vs England Women ICC Women's World Cup ODI- Check My Dream11 Team, Best players list of SA-W vs ENG-W, South Africa Women Dream11 Team Player List, England women Dream11 Team Player List, Dream11 Guru Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Playing Tips.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-30 18:10:00","full_description":"South Africa women will take on England women in the 2nd semi-final match of the ICC Women's World Cup 2022.

During the sixth match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kolkata Knight Riders in Navi Mumbai, Kolkata Knight Riders wicket-keeper batter Sheldon Jackson put on display an incredible fielding effort to pick a crucial wicket at a crucial time. It all happened on the second delivery of the 18th over when Royal Challengers Bangalore all-rounder Sherfane Rutherford inside-edged a Tim Southee delivery towards the right of Jackson. Keeping to a left-handed batter, Jackson was already an extra step towards his left due to the angle. Realizing a catching opportunity at the right time, Jackson’s agile movements allowed him to grab an outstanding one-handed diving catch at the Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy tonight. Coming in to bat at No. 5 in the fifth over of a 129-run chase, Rutherford departed after scoring a responsible 28 (40) with the help of a four and six each. Known for his big-hitting skills, Rutherford curbed his instincts of playing the big shots as the situation demanded him to play with caution especially after the top-order’s failure. Jackson, 35, had collected numerous accolades for his stumping dismissal against Chennai Super Kings on Saturday. Despite failing with the bat earlier tonight, Jackson contributed on the field once again on the back of grabbing four catches. Playing in place of Shivam Mavi, Tim Southee (4-0-20-3) was the pick of the bowlers for his team. While Southee’s new-ball partner Umesh Yadav also picked a couple of wickets in a testing spell, Knight Riders ended up on the losing side as RCB registered a last-over finish.

Dropped from the national team over fitness issues, Rajapaksa now wants to have a conversation with a supremely-fit Virat Kohli, who he calls 'Cristiano Ronaldo of cricket'. Being part of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the 30-year-old Lankan can have that opportunity to meet the former India skipper and hopefully turn the tide having endured a dramatic start to the year 2022. The 30-year-old announced his international retirement this January and withdrew it a week later on the insistence of authorities. However, he still missed the plane to India due to the same fitness issues, last month. Rajapaksa is sure that the two-month-long stint with Punjab Kings would benefit his game immensely and take his fitness to the next level. ''IPL is the best league in the world and with every teammate of yours you get to learn a lot about the game, so I am loving picking the brains of Shikhar Dhawan. I get along very well with Mayank Agarwal as we played U-19 together,'' Rajapaksa told PTI in an interview. ''Outside of the team, Virat Kohli is always someone I could speak to and get some fitness advice. He's at another different level when it comes to fitness. ''To me, he is the Cristiano Ronaldo of cricket for sure. With the work he puts in you can see the results. You can compare him to anyone when it comes to fitness or even skills-wise. He plays so hard and you can learn a lot by talking to him,'' he said. On the 'fitness versus skills' debate, Rajapaksa has a clear view. ''As a player you need your fitness but it could be different from person to person. For me, of course, skill comes first. And then the fitness, but if you are not fit enough you definitely can't perform. ''I'm working hard on my fitness. Whenever I get a free day I hit the gym early in the morning. That there are some fitness requirements to represent the country and with fitness, my international career would be longer. ''I'm hoping to play for the next three to four years at least and do the best for the country because after my resignation I had to withdraw it back because I had a couple of conversations with the technical committee and the Sports Minister as well. They wanted me to reconsider my retirement and I decided to withdraw it,'' he said. Rajapaksa feels he is now doing ''all the right things'' as he looks to extend his international career by at least three to four years. He scored a match-winning 43 off 22 balls against RCB on his IPL debut on Sunday. With Jonny Bairstow yet to join the squad, the soft-spoken Sri Lankan wants to make the most of the opportunities that come his way throughout 14 games. Rajapaksa is a big believer in God and his belief in God grew stronger with the way he made his Sri Lanka debut in 2020, nine years after he started playing first-class cricket. With the senior players refusing to travel to Pakistan, Rajapaksa got his big break and since then he has played five ODIs and 18 T20 Internationals in a roller-coaster career. ''It's all about timing for me. I think God's timing is the best and that Pakistan tour changed my career. I am pretty sure that I would have never been called to play for the country if it was not for the withdrawal of senior players. The last two years have been extraordinary for me. ''I had to wait almost nine to 10 years till I got my first opportunity and playing so many years of first-class cricket has only helped me in international cricket,'' said Rajapaksa, who has impressed of late with his power-hitting. He likes to call himself a ''skill and touch'' batter who just focuses on timing the ball. At the relentless insistence of his friends back home, he has taken up yoga which he is getting to experience at Punjab Kings. ''I never knew the importance of yoga but it has helped me relax my mind and I have added it to my routine. As I said I am a big believer in God. I appreciate everything that comes my way and have worked hard to achieve whatever I have in my career.'' Talking about the Punjab Kings unit, the Sri Lankan feels the team has a 'proper squad' full of power-hitters who can take the franchise to its IPL maiden title.","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lowest run defended in IPL: List of lowest scores defended in IPL history","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-lowest-run-defended-in-ipl-list-of-lowest-scores-defended-in-ipl-history/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","KKR","RCB","Indian Premier League","Kolkata Knight riders","Royal Challengers Bangalore"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lowest run defended in IPL: Dr DY Patil Cricket Academy is in line to witness a low-scoring thriller tonight.

Kolkata Knight Riders new-ball bowlers Umesh Yadav and Tim Southee running through Royal Challengers Bangalore’s top-order has provided early signs of a low-scoring thriller at the Dr DY Patil Cricket Academy tonight. As was the case in the tournament opener, Yadav drew first blood as Bangalore batter Anuj Rawat (0) edged a short delivery to wicket-keeper Sheldon Jackson. Rawat’s opening partner and captain Faf du Plessis (5) was the next batter to be dismissed as Southee created instant impact. Picked ahead of Shivam Mavi for this match, the experienced New Zealander justified the team management’s decision of giving him a chance with the new ball. Former RCB captain Virat Kohli (12) was the second batter to edge a Yadav delivery to Jackson as the bowler picked his second wicket off just the seventh delivery. Chasing a 129-run target, Royal Challengers were reduced to 17/3 in the third over to find themselves in deep trouble. Overseas pair of David Willey and Sherfane Rutherford have since provided some stability to their innings but pressure still remains in what could end up as cliffhanger of a finish on Wednesday. Earlier, it was du Plessis who invited Knight Riders in to bat first as his bowlers bundled out the opposition for 128 in 18.5 overs. With bowling figures of 4-0-20-4, Hasaranga was the pick of the bowlers for Bangalore tonight. In what was an all-round bowling display, Indian fast bowling pair of Akash Deep and Harshal Patel picked three and two wickets each.

RCB have pointed ex-South Africa skipper Faf du Plessis as Kohli's successor. RCB are without their star batsman de Villiers, who retired from all forms of cricket at the end of last year's IPL. Kohli and de Villiers were RCB teammates for 11 long years. They shared several highs and lows together that only strengthened their bond over the years. \"Everyone knows about Faf du Plessis coming in as captain. I think the most exciting thing for me is Virat not being captain and releasing a bit of the pressure, really just going out there and freeing up. I am expecting a very big season from Virat. I am thinking 600+ runs from him this year,\" de Villiers said in an interview with VUSport Official. With 6,324 runs in 208 matches, Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the IPL and the only batsman to have scored 6,000 or more runs in the tournament. He has scored five centuries and 42 fifties. \"I don't know what to expect (from RCB) but I expect some individuals to really rise in this IPL from the RCB setup,\" added de Villiers in the same interview. While RCB have reached the IPL twice, they have not won the coveted trophy yet. RCB's last final came in 2016 under Kohli's captaincy, where they lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH). Meanwhile, Kohli recently said that if RCB go on to win the IPL this season or in the coming ones, he'll be very emotional about de Villiers. \"I was thinking about him the other day that if we manage to win the title in the coming seasons, this one, next one, whatever it is. I would be very emotional thinking about him first, rather than you know what I would experience after such hard work of so many years. I would actually think how much it would still mean to him, watching from home. He's a special human being, he's touched everyone's lives here, we can all vouch for that, he's been amazing. I don't think there's one person who can say AB has not contributed to my life some way or the other,\" Kohli said in a video posted by RCB. De Villiers finished his IPL career with 4,697 runs in 157 innings at an average of 38.82 and strike rate of 154.10. He also is the second leading run-scorer for RCB after Kohli. When de Villiers announced his retirement last year, Kohli had put up an emotional post for the Proteas player.\"You've given everything to RCB and I know that in my heart.
