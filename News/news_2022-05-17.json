It has been a horrible few months.\"These are the times you grab your family, friends and cherish every day.\"While Clarke and Symonds had a falling out later in their careers, the former Australian skipper chose to focus on the great friendship they struck when they first became teammates - a friendship that sparked out of vastly different upbringings.\"The laughing joke in our team was complete city boy me, complete country boy him and yet we built an amazing connection,\" he said.\"We did things I never thought I would experience and wasn't comfortable doing but with him, [he] made me comfortable.\"Clarke spoke on the pair's outdoor adventures, including how Symonds made him step out of his \"comfort zone\" during a road trip from Sydney to Brisbane.\"I remember we did a Winnebago trip from Sydney to drive to Brisbane and flew up north to Esmeralda,\" Clarke added.\"We had two weeks.

But when you go through so many of those feelings, you've got to keep remembering the good times.\"While they grew close in their early years together in the Australian side, incidents over the years saw the Clarke-Symonds relationship fall apart.Clarke, who was Australia's stand-in captain during a one-day series against Bangladesh in Darwin in 2008, was part of the disciplinary meeting that elected to send Symonds home for missing a team meeting.In the months prior to Symonds' death, he revealed how he was sent into \"rage\" and threw a drink at Clarke after being labelled selfish during a tour in the West Indies.\"I threw a drink on him. He didn't tell me to go to bed, he said something else but I threw a drink on him and what he said to me put me into a rage,\" Symonds said on Fox Sports' Cricket Legends.\"What he said to me was nowhere near accurate and that immediate point is where he lost me and I lost him.\"Our friendship was destroyed in that moment.\"He'd said to me, not in these words, but he'd suggested I was a selfish player and a selfish person.

When Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) would lock horns against Mumbai Indians (MI) at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday, eyes would yet again be on their top-order to provide them a decent enough start with their skipper Kane Williamson having had a torrid season with the bat. In what is a must-win match for them today, the onus would be on their in-form batters in opener Abhishek Sharma, and Rahul Tripathi to play to the best of their abilities with their playoffs qualification hanging by the thinnest of threads. Tripathi, who comes in to bat at number 3, had played some decent knocks at the position, which helped SRH notch-up five back-to-back wins in the ongoing season, after suffering two defeats in the initial matches. So far, across 12 innings, the 31-year-old has amassed 317 runs at an average of 35.22, with the help of a couple of half-centuries. He is the third-highest run-scorer for SRH this season. Ahead of his side’s clash against MI, Rahul Tripathi, during an interaction with SRH, revealed how the likes of Indian legendary cricketers like MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli have motivated him in his IPL years, and how he even tries to copy them in front of the mirror. Highly impressed by the match finishing abilities of MS Dhoni and the work ethics of Virat Kohli, Tripathi exclaimed that watching the duo has only motivated and pushed him to work in the right direction in his Cricketing journey so far. “When I see Dhoni bhai, the way he finishes games, and the work ethics of Virat Kohli, that’s really kept motivating me and pushing me. I’d like to have those work ethics, or follow them, and like sometimes copy them in front of the mirror,” Rahul revealed. The Ranchi-born right-hander, in fact, played his maiden IPL season for the now-defunct Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS) in 2017 under MS Dhoni, and ended up as their second highest-run getter (391 runs across 14 innings), just behind Steve Smith (472 runs across 15 innings). He then went on to play for RR (2018 and 2019), KKR (2020 and 2021), and SRH (2022). Intense on the field.

My job as a city boy was to organise the city trip, the start in Sydney and where we were going to stop along the way to Brissy and then he organised the back half from Brisbane up to Esmeralda. “Talk about out of your comfort zone, we were fishing for Barra on these banks where there were crocs everywhere and again, no way would I ever do that on my own but with him he just made you feel so comfortable. Some amazing memories.” Clarke paid tribute to his former teammate. Source: News Corp Australia While Symonds was regarded as one of Australia’s finest all-rounders, Clarke said he was “probably my favourite batsman to bat with” and “probably the most athletic cricketer” he played with. “We just had a really good connection,” Clarke added. “Some of the things we both enjoyed about batting [were] running between the wickets or even how competitive we were at fielding at training to try and improve our fielding, brought the best out of me. “Very fortunate to have spent so much time with him on and off the field, to have played with him, probably the most athletic cricketer I played with. Absolute freak of an athlete — speed, power, watching him dive and take a catch, a great fielder as well.” Clarke and Symonds had their differences. Source: News Limited It has been a particularly tough few months for Australian cricket, with Shane Warne and Rod Marsh passing away in March and Symonds’ death the latest blow. The recent tragedies — along with the death of Phillip Hughes in 2014 — had Clarke emphasising the need to “remember all the good times” in the face of so much sadness. “A lot of amazing memories and again, I said that about Warney not too long ago, in times like these and even Hughesy now, you still think about them everyday but I think that is the key — to remember all those good times and celebrate those,” he said. “Yeah, there are days, feelings and moments that are extremely sad and it’s hard to believe, of all things a car accident as well, so hard to comprehend. But when you go through so many of those feelings, you’ve got to keep remembering the good times.” Michael Clarke, Shane Warne and Andrew Symonds.

The 41-year-old initially took to social media to pay tribute to his former teammate, posting a photo on Instagram of himself and Symonds holding the late Warne on their shoulders. The photo, which was taken following Australia’s Ashes victory in January, 2007, was simply accompanied by the word: “Devastated”. In a second photo later posted over the weekend, Clarke wrote: “Opposites attract... I loved nothing more than walking out to play for our country together”. The two have spoken previously about their falling out, with Symonds opening up about his fractured relationship with Clarke on The Brett Lee Podcast only last month. While not wanting to go into too much detail out of “respect” for Clarke, Symonds said that jealousy may have contributed to the breakdown of their relationship after a lucrative IPL offer. Cricket world mourns the passing of Roy | 03:17 “We became close. When he (Clarke) came into the side I used to bat with him a lot,” Symonds told Lee. “So when he came into the side I really looked after him. That built a bond. “Matthew Hayden said to me — when the IPL started, I got a pretty penny to go and play in the IPL — he identified it as there was a bit of jealousy that potentially came into the relationship (with Clarke) there. “Money does funny things. It’s a good thing but it can be a poison and I reckon it may have poisoned our relationship. “I’ve got enough respect for him to probably not go into detail about what was said. “My friendship with him is no longer and I’m comfortable with that, but I’m not gonna sit here and start slinging mud.” Vale Andrew Symonds | 05:27 Then there was the infamous incident when Symonds was sent home from a one-day series against Bangladesh in Darwin in 2008 after skipping a team meeting to go fishing. Clarke was vice-captain at the time and wrote in his autobiography that Symonds needed to be disciplined to emphasise the importance of adopting a team-first mentality. “Some former teammates will take his side, and feed his conviction that I let him down and put ambition ahead of mateship,” Clarke wrote in My Story . “I would say that he let me down too – that if he had understood mateship as a two-way street, he would have seen that I had to do what was right for the whole team.” NRL greats pay tribute to Symonds | 02:39 Clarke also wrote that the breakdown of their relationship could have also been linked to the all-rounder’s aspirations to become Australian captain. “During the West Indies trip [in 2008], Symmo has said something that surprises me: that he would like, one day, to be considered for the Australian captaincy,” Clarke wrote. “That is the first I knew of it, but I can understand. He has great leadership qualities and a cricket brain as good as anyone’s. I sense that the issue is driving a bit of a wedge between him and me. “From Symmo’s point of view, his knockabout mate, his drinking and fishing buddy, is being groomed for the captaincy and getting all the royal treatment from the hierarchy, whereas he is being dealt a rough hand. We’re soul brothers, and it doesn’t seem fair to him that I am the golden boy while he is the outcast.” Roy STEAMROLLS streaker at the Gabba | 00:47 Clarke went on to write at the time that his captaincy would cost him “other friendships” but that “none” left him with “as much pain as the one I lost with Andrew Symonds”. Symonds had told journalist Robert Craddock on an episode of Cricket Legends in 2018 that the pair’s friendship was “destroyed” when he threw a drink at Clarke while on tour in the West Indies. “I threw a drink on him. He didn’t tell me to go to bed, he said something else but I threw a drink on him and what he said to me put me into a rage,” Symonds said. “What he said to me was nowhere near accurate and that immediate point is where he lost me and I lost him. “Our friendship was destroyed in that moment. “He’d said to me, not in these words, but he’d suggested I was a selfish player and a selfish person.

The 24-run loss to Rajasthan Royals on Sunday was LSG’s first back-to-back defeat in the competition, denting their chances of finishing in the top-two. They need to win their remaining game against Kolkata Knight Riders on Wednesday to finish in the top-two and get two shots at reaching the final. “I won’t lie, yes, there is a bit of pressure. We all know in this competition nothing comes easy and no point comes easy, and we’ve had to learn that the hard way. “We could have so easily been sitting today and could have qualified and gone into the last game with a free mindset and try to enjoy our cricket,” Rahul said at the post match press conference. Chasing 179, LSG were reduced to 29 for three which put extra pressure on the middle order. He also explained why Marcus Stoinis is batting lower down the order. “What we’re trying to do is utilise players who will best suit the situation. And for us Marcus is one of those players. He has that brute force and we know that he can be really dangerous at the back end. So we just tried to hold him back a little bit. “We’ve given everybody different roles and it depends on which over someone gets out and who walks in. So we’ve kept it slightly flexible with the batting roles. This is the role we picked him to do, which is to be a finisher for us. “But you need someone to support him at the other end. He needs and the team needs the top order to set up the game for someone like Stoinis and Jason (Holder) to come in and finish games. Which hasn’t happened, unfortunately.” Rajasthan entered the top-two following the win over LSG. No batters scored a fifty, yet the Royals put up a decent total. “That’s what our team is all about. If you look at the win today, each and everyone who went in to bat showed intent and contributed around 10-20 runs which was very crucial in this game,” skipper Sanju Samson said. “If you look at our team we have a lot of match-winners, match-winners in the sense that they go and play their role in that particular moment. Be it only three-four overs remaining or in the PowerPlay, it’s only about doing your role and sticking to it,” he added. — PTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-05-16 19:42:53","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Hard work pays off for Bryce Jackson as the Albany fast bowler earns full contract with WA men’s cricket squad","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/albany-advertiser/hard-work-pays-off-for-bryce-jackson-as-the-albany-fast-bowler-earns-full-contract-with-wa-mens-cricket-squad-c-6814492","keywords":null,"creator":["Calvin Sims"],"video_url":null,"description":"The fiery quick was a rookie with the WACA last season but it was announced last week the 22-year-old has been upgraded to a full contract in the 25-man WA squad for the upcoming season.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-16 18:00:00","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-6814492/955443edd5e35610a2f95cd9cda405c4f460c7d4-16x9-x0y270w5184h2916.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Not worried about Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma's poor form, says Sourav Ganguly","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/ipl-2022-not-worried-about-virat-kohli-rohit-sharmas-poor-form-says-sourav-ganguly-743107","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"Rohit’s MI have already been eliminated from IPL 2022MI are the most successful IPL team with 5 titlesKohli has scored just 236 runs in 13 games this season","content":"Sourav Ganguly, the chief of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), has said he is not worried about Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma being out of form ahead of T20 World Cup 2022. T20 World Cup is scheduled to take place in Australia, starting from Oct. 16. India failed to qualify for the semi-final last year at T20 World Cup and the current forms of Rohit and Kohli in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 is worrisome. \"I'm not worried at all about the form of Rohit or Virat. They are too good…real big players. The World Cup is far away and I am quite confident that they will be in top shape much before the tournament,\" Ganguly told Mid-Day. Kohli, who is the leading run-scorer in the IPL with 6,000-plus runs, has managed just 236 runs in 13 matches at an average of 19.67 and strike rate of 113.46. In the ongoing tournament, Kohli has scored just one fifty, while he has three golden duck dismissals to his name. The former Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) captain's numbers have never been so low except for the maiden IPL season. The RCB star quit captaincy ahead of the 2022 season to focus on batting but that has not worked in his favour so far. Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians (MI) skipper Rohit has scored 218 runs in 12 games at an average of 18.17 and a strike rate of 125.29 in IPL 2022. Rohit, who has won a total of six IPL titles, including his maiden title with Deccan Chargers in 2009, has failed to record a single fifty in the ongoing campaign. In 12 games, Rohit has recorded five single-digit scores apart from one duck. A string of poor results meant the five-time champions MI became the first team to be knocked out of the race. In the lead up to the T20 World Cup 2022, Team India have a long schedule. Apart from the one-off Test in England and the One-Day International (ODI) series, India are set to play four T20I series. The first series is scheduled against the South African side in June, followed by India's tour of Ireland. The team will then move to England for their next assignment and fly to the Caribbean after the conclusion of the England series.","pubDate":"2022-05-16 17:37:51","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/05/16/500x300_1292534-ganguly.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ranji Trophy 2022: Wriddhiman Saha returns to Bengal squad for knockouts","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/domestic/ranji-trophy-2022-knockouts-bengal-squad-wriddhiman-saha-returns-shami/article38493203.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Team Sportstar"],"video_url":null,"description":"Saha, who opted out of Bengal's league stage campaign earlier this year, was listed in the 22-member squad announced by Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB)","content":"Senior India wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha was named in the Bengal squad for the Ranji Trophy knockouts on Monday.

A must win for both the teams and Punjab have done a decent first half job. They will look to continue with the momentum and make sure they stay in the playoffs contention. Same goes for Delhi as well, who will look to create pressure early on. Stay tuned as the chase is coming up. Sarfaraz Khan is up for a quick chat. He says that the wicket is slow and they will try to give as less runs as possible inside the Powerplay and they would like to take wickets early in the innings. Tells that in the Powerplay, it is important to score quickly as it gets difficult to score quickly later on. Mentions that they wanted to up the ante in the middle overs but lost wickets in the process and tells that they will also look to take wickets at regular intervals. Talks about his scoop shot and says that it is important to read the bowler's mind while playing those shots. Says that they would have to take wickets in the Powerplay to defend this total. Punjab will be happy with the score but just like Marsh, someone has to anchor the innings for them. Their innings was mostly thrived by spinners as they controlled the middle phase quite well and that created enormous pressure on Delhi, leading to a flurry of wickets. The seamers had to come up with variations and they did a decent job as well. Liam Livingstone though was the pick of the bowlers as he took three huge wickets of Warner, Pant and Powell. Delhi were off to a good start thanks to a quickfire knock by Sarfaraz Khan. The middle phase saw spinners coming into action and after being in a good position, Delhi lost the plot as runs dried up and wickets started to fall. Mitchell Marsh's stay till the end helped them to reach where Delhi are. He read the pitch and played a responsible innings of 63. After his departure, Delhi missed out to finish it well. Punjab have done really well to keep Delhi near the 160-run mark. At one stage, it looked like 170-175 pitch but it's been on the slower side and Punjab will be the happier team at the break. 19.6 overs (2 Runs) Couple to end the innings! Nails a yorker on middle. Patel heaves it to wide long on and comes back for the second run. Delhi finish with 159/7 after 20 overs! 19.5 overs (1 Run) On a length and slower one this at 117.7 kph.

India and Punjab Kings opening batter Shikhar Dhawan is said to be preparing for an acting debut with his first feature movie expected to release sometime this year. Dhawan, 36, is currently representing Punjab in the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League. As this story is being written, Dhawan is playing their 13th IPL 2022 match against Delhi Capitals at the Dr DY Patil Sports Academy. Highest run-scorer for Kings this season and fifth-highest overall, Dhawan has scored 402 runs at an average and strike rate of 40.20 and 122.93 respectively with a couple of innings in the league stage yet to be played. Dhawan, who has scored three half-centuries this season thus far, had become only the second batter to score 6,000 IPL runs earlier this season. Shikhar Dhawan movie name Dhawan, who is known for his Instagram reels apart from his ability with the bat in hand, is said to already have shot for his first movie. According to a report in Pinkvilla, Dhawan’s debut movie will see him playing a “proper full length role” and not a cameo or a special appearance. “Shikhar [Dhawan] always had huge respect for actors, and when he was offered this part he was happy to come aboard. The makers felt that Shikhar suits the character and reached out to him a few months back. It’s a proper full length role and is not a cameo. His part is pivotal to the film, which is expected to release sometime this year,” a source close to the development told Pinkvilla.   View this post on Instagram   A post shared by Shikhar Dhawan (@shikhardofficial)   Dhawan will join the likes of former Indian cricketers namely Yograj Singh, Ajay Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Sreesanth and Irfan Pathan (to name to few) in the list of cricketers-turned-actors. Dhawan, an active international cricketer, should be able to allure eyeballs regarding his upcoming movie. Readers must note that the name of the movie, rest of the cast and other details are yet to be made public by the makers.

Delhi Capitals batter Sarfaraz Khan and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh’s all guns blazing approach has commenced on an affirmative note in their ongoing Indian Premier League 2022 match against Punjab Kings at the Dr DY Patil Sports Academy. Put in to bat first by Punjab captain Mayank Agarwal, Delhi lost opening batter David Warner (0) on the first ball itself. Wanting to play a casual drive off Liam Livingstone, all Warner did was lob the ball to Rahul Chahar at point. However, the early breakthrough didn’t affect the other two top-order batters who found boundaries at will in the powerplay. Playing only his fifth match of the tournament, Sarfaraz scored a brisk 32 (15) with the help of five fours and a six before mis-timing an Arshdeep Singh delivery to Chahar at mid-on. Why Delhi Capitals and Punjab Kings wearing black armbands today? As fans must have noted by now, players of both the teams are donning black armbands in Navi Mumbai tonight. In what is a rare situation of both teams’ wearing black armbands, it has been done as a mark of respect and tribute towards former Australia all-rounder Andrew Symonds. Symonds, 46, died at the scene after being the single occupant in a single-vehicle car crash near Townsville on Saturday night. The sudden and shocking demise of Symonds has saddened the cricketing fraternity across the world. Another sad day for cricket!! RIP Andrew Symonds #RIPRoy — Liam Livingstone (@liaml4893) May 15, 2022 Symonds, who played 238 international matches across formats between 1998-2009, was part of Australia’s World Cup victories in 2003 and 2007.

The win is of such an unprecedented scale that it is being compared to the 1983 cricket World Cup triumph. Needless to say, the likes of Lakshya Sen, Kidambi Srikanth, and HS Prannoy have led India to eternal glory. Amidst all this, when the entire country is celebrating, an IAS officer by the name of Somesh Upadhyay tweeted a photo of a racquet used to kill mosquitos and wrote, \" \" The comment did not sit well with Twitterati and people were quick to point out the distastefulness of the tweet. Cricketer Amit Mishra too, was quick to reply to the post and wrote, \"This is not only distasteful but also insulting the achievement of our badminton heroes.\" Here are other reactions: Some individuals also saw the light side of it and said that it is sad that people these days can't take a joke. Battling an ankle injury, and praying that it doesn't get worse, somehow, someway, Prannoy made it through the deciders to take India to the final of the Thomas Cup. The 29-year-old hails from Thiruvananthapuram and won a Silver Medal in the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. The man who started it all and gave India a lead in the Final vs Indonesia, Sen has been one of the most sought-after players in a recent while. Who can forget the epic duel between Sen and Axelsen at the All England Open 2022? Although Sen failed to win the final, everybody watching from home and in the stands knew that the boy was special. Srikant delivered the ultimate win when he defeated Jonathan Christie at the Thomas Cup. He is one of the top players in the World, and created history last year when he clinched Silver at the World Badminton Championship. Incidentally, that was the best performance by an Indian at the competition. Rajawat is currently ranked 85 in the world and defeated Victor LAI in the Thomas Cup. Last year, Priyanshu won the men's singles title at the Ukraine International in Kharkiv. Although he lost to Julien I in the Orleans Masters 2022, he impressed everyone with his sharp skills. The 24-years-old Chirag, along with 21-years-old Satwiksairaj Rankireddy defeated Mohammad Ahsan and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo in one match, and then Kim Astrup and Mathias in the other on their way to the title. They both are ranked 8th in men's double.","pubDate":"2022-05-16 14:09:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Punjab Kings vs Delhi Capitals: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/punjab-kings-vs-delhi-capitals-live-score-over-match-64-t20-1-5-updates-2981131","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Punjab Kings vs Delhi Capitals from Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy, Navi Mumbai.

Actually, it was Sarfaraz Khan who was all set to take the strike but Warner decided at the last moment that he will take the strike and pays a heavy price here. Punjab are not complaining here though and the smiles on their faces show how big a wicket this is! We are all set to begin! Punjab players make their way out to the middle. Sarfaraz Khan and David Warner are the openers for Delhi. It is the fifth opening pair they have used this season. Spin to start for Punjab. Liam Livingstone will start the proceedings. Here we go... So, Punjab feel they have found their best XI while Prithvi Shaw's absence is hurting Delhi a bit. Khaleel Ahmed is back and that will give a huge boost to Delhi. Rovman Powell is down for a chat. He says they'll try to bring the best game knowing what is at stake. Adds that it's their 4th game here, it's not been a happy hunting ground for them but they'll try to change. Admits he doesn't like one side with a bigger boundary, he likes it when the circumference and everything is roughly around the same so the bowlers can bowl from any end but now they know what the bowlers will come up with. Rishabh Pant, the skipper of Delhi, says that they were looking to bowl first but that is not in their control. Informs they have made two changes as Khaleel Ahmed comes in for Chetan Sakariya and Sarfaraz Khan for Srikar Bharat. Mentions that they were focusing on how they can prepare for the match and as a captain he was talking to his team about just concentrating on the game and that is all that matters. Mayank Agarwal, the skipper of Punjab, says they will bowl first. Feels like the wicket won't change much and dew can come into play. Informs they are playing the same team. Mentions that they have found the right combination and it is going well from the last few games. Shares that they'll take as another game, it is important to win but they'll follow the process. Delhi (Playing XI) - Sarfaraz Khan (In place of Srikar Bharat), David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Rishabh Pant (C) (WK), Rovman Powell, Lalit Yadav, Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav, Anrich Nortje, Khaleel Ahmed (In place of Chetan Sakariya). Punjab (Unchanged Playing XI) - Jonny Bairstow, Shikhar Dhawan, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Liam Livingstone, Mayank Agarwal (C), Jitesh Sharma (WK), Harpreet Brar, Rishi Dhawan, Rahul Chahar, Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Singh. TOSS - The coin goes up and lands in favour of Punjab. They have elected to BOWL first. Pitch Report - Graeme Smith is near the pitch. He says the dimension will play a key role as it is short on one side. Adds that there is a lively grass covering but underneath it is very dry, spin can come into play. Mentions that the captain winning the toss will look to chase here and 165 looks a par score. Delhi and Punjab both have not won two consecutive games this season, so surely one of them will stitch a winning streak here. Both teams have found their balance after mixing and shuffling early on and it's very hard to pick one team with the upper hand right now. It's easy for you, cheer your favorite team, lay back, and enjoy the action. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates. Hello everyone and welcome to the final week of action in the group stages. It's Punjab vs Delhi in match number 64. Both the teams are relishing out of the top four and their fate to make the next round relies upon themselves. A slight hiccup now and they could lose a shot forward. On that note, welcome to the coverage. ...

During the second day of the first Test of the ongoing Sri Lanka’s tour of Bangladesh in Chattogram, former Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews missed out on his second Test double century by just a run. Mathews, who had completed his 12th Test century on Day 1, returned back to the dressing room after scoring 199 (397) with the help of 19 fours and a six. Mathews was the last Sri Lankan batter to be dismissed in the first innings as his attempt to slog Bangladesh spinner Nayeem Hasan went completely in vain. Mathews’ unwanted feat has made him the 12th batter to be dismissed on 199 in Test cricket. Only the second Sri Lankan batter to do so, Mathews is also the second batter to get out on 199 against Bangladesh but the first-ever to do so in Bangladesh. How sad was that dismissal? Angelo Mathews out for 199! So close but in the end yet so far! What a difference a single run could do! — Roshan Abeysinghe (@RoshanCricket) May 16, 2022 It is worth mentioning that former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower and former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara are the only two batters who have scored 199* (not out) in Test cricket. While Flower had done the same against South Africa in Harare in 2001, Sangakkara had scored 199* against Pakistan in Galle a decade ago. Mathews, who resumed his innings from overnight score of 114*, put together a 136-run fifth-wicket partnership alongside another former captain in Dinesh Chandimal (66). Mathews’ maiden Test century against and in Bangladesh and fourth at No. 4 played a pivotal role in Sri Lanka scoring 397 in 153 overs. 199 runs out batsman in Test cricket full list Batter Runs Balls Team Opposition Ground Year Mudassar Nazar 199 408 Pakistan India Faisalabad 1984 Mohammad Azharuddin 199 India Sri Lanka Kanpur 1986 Matthew Elliott 199 351 Australia England Leeds 1997 Sanath Jayasuriya 199 226 Sri Lanka India Colombo 1997 Steve Waugh 199 376 Australia West Indies Bridgetown 1999 Younis Khan 199 336 Pakistan India Lahore 2006 Ian Bell 199 336 England South Africa Lord’s 2008 Steven Smith 199 361 Australia West Indies Kingston 2015 KL Rahul 199 311 India England Chennai 2016 Dean Elgar 199 388 South Africa Bangladesh Potchefstroom 2018 Faf du Plessis 199 276 South Africa Sri Lanka Centurion 2020 Angelo Mathews 199 397 Sri Lanka Bangladesh Chattogram 2022 The post 199 runs out batsman: Full list of batsmen dismissed on 199 in Test cricket appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-05-16 13:05:58","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"FairBreak Global Invitation: players hail ‘incredible’ women’s T20 tournament as Hong Kong event confirmed for 2023","link":"https://www.scmp.com/sport/cricket/article/3177961/fairbreak-global-invitation-players-hail-incredible-womens-t20?utm_source=rss_feed","keywords":null,"creator":["Matt Eaton","Josh Ball"],"video_url":null,"description":"The inaugural FairBreak Global Invitation T20 women’s cricket tournament ends on a high note, with organisers announcing a second tournament for Hong Kong in March 2023.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-16 13:02:11","image_url":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/16/2b90c109-775e-4464-b632-5eef80955bfd_6833a958.jpg?itok=LM1Q9PGu","source_id":"scmp","country":["china"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Women’s T20 Challenge | Three-team profile release; ‘No’ Mithali & Julan Goswami","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/womens-t20-challenge-three-team-profile-release-no-mithali-julan-goswami/","keywords":["Sports","Cricket","India","Women","Women's"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai: The All India Women’s Selection Committee has announced the list of players in the three teams for the Women’s T20 Challenge Series.

The tournament is being touted as the inaugural women’s IPL in the country. Priyanka Priyadarshini and Sujata Mallick will represent the IPL Trailblazers team in the event. The two other teams are IPL Supernovas and IPL Velocity, the BCCI said Monday. The tournament is being organised alongside the play-off stage of the ongoing men’s edition of the IPL. The women’s event is appearing like a mini-version of the IPL as 14 overseas players will be playing for the three women’s teams. Star Indian players Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur and Deepti Sharma were Monday named captains of the three teams. The BCCI announced 16-member squads for each of three teams – Harmanpreet-led Supernovas, Mandhana-led Trailblazers and Deepti-led Velocity. Veteran India cricketers Mithali Raj, Jhulan Goswami and Shikha Pandey are the notable absentees in the squads. They had played in the last edition of the tournament in 2020. A BCCI official said India greats Mithali and Jhulan have been rested. Both were expected to retire after the World Cup earlier this year but are yet to take a call on their future. “Both Mithali and Jhulan have been rested,” the official said. A total of 12 overseas players were also announced for the exhibition event. Among them are star South African opener Laura Wolvaardt and World No. 1 one bowler Sophie Ecclestone. Thai player Natthakan Chantam will make her second appearance in the competition. The only Australian featuring in the line-ups is leg spinner Alana King while the English cricketers include Ecclestone, Sophia Dunkley and Kate Cross. Bangladesh cricketers Salma Khatun and Sharmin Akhter have also been picked. The West Indians include Deandra Dottin and Hayley Matthews. The performers in the recently held Senior Women’s T20 Trophy have also been rewarded. The tournament’s leading run getter KP Navgire and leading wicket-taker Aarti Kedar will play for Velocity. The upcoming edition is expected to be the last one with BCCI planning a full-fledged Women’s IPL from next year.  ","pubDate":"2022-05-16 12:23:36","image_url":"https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Trailblazers-300x211.jpg","source_id":"orissapost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ajinkya Rahane Injury Update: Will Ajinkya Rahane play for KKR in remaining IPL 2022 matches?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ajinkya-rahane-injury-update-will-ajinkya-rahane-play-for-kkr-in-remaining-ipl-2022-matches/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","KKR","Ajinkya Rahane"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ajinkya Rahane Injury Update: Kolkata Knight Riders batter Ajinkya Rahane suffered a Grade-3 Hamstring injury against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

Kolkata Knight Riders have won six of their 13 games in the Indian Premier League, and the next game is Do or Die for them. If they can win their next game against Lucknow Super Giants, they will have some chances to qualify for the playoffs for the tournament. Kolkata Knight Riders have experimented a lot this season with their playing eleven, and they have used the maximum players in the tournament so far. They have tried different players in the opening positions such as Ajinkya Rahane, Venkatesh Iyer, Aaron Finch, Sunil Narine, Baba Indrajith, etc. Kolkata Knight Riders batter Ajinkya Rahane has been ruled out of the ongoing Indian Premier League 2022. Rahane got injured during the Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Kolkata Knight Riders game. He suffered a serious Grade-3 hamstring injury. He did not field for the Kolkata Knight Riders in that game. Apart from the IPL, Rahane is set to be ruled out of the upcoming English tour as well. Ajinkya Rahane was dropped from the Indian test team, but there were chances of having him on the England tour. According to reports, Ajinkya Rahane will head to National Cricket Academy in Bangalore for at least four weeks of rehab. Ajinkya Rahane ruled out of #IPL2022 due to Grade III hamstring injury. He is set to exit the Kolkata Knight Riders bubble on Monday evening. — Subhayan Chakraborty (@CricSubhayan) May 16, 2022 Kolkata Knight Riders bought Ajinkya Rahane for a price of INR 1 crores in the IPL 2022 auction. Rahane started the tournament with a decent knock, but he failed to deliver in the tournament. Rahane scored 133 runs in seven games at an average of 19.00, without scoring a single half-century. Ajinkya Rahane possesses a brilliant test record in England, and he played some fine knocks in the last English tour as well. The loss of Ajinkya Rahane can be a loss to the Indian cricket team as well.","pubDate":"2022-05-16 12:16:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BAN vs SL: Heartbreak For Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews As He Becomes 12th Man To Be Dismissed On 199 -
