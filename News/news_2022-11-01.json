Tony Hume, who heads Variety, The Children’s Charity, says a healthy elite cricket program must underpin a strong community focused culture. He said he was an “absolute fan” of the WA Cricket Foundation. Justin Chadwick “I am of the belief that cricket is a great enabler of kids with disabilities, kids from tough socio-economic backgrounds,” Hume said. “I just want to make sure good governance is kept at the WACA and play my role and use my networks to assist where I can. “I am an absolute fan of what the foundation is doing and their inclusive approach.” Hume said the fact WA Cricket cleaned up last year, winning the men’s domestic Sheffield Shield and one-day titles as well as the BBL and WBBL crowns, was proof the organisation had the right leadership. “It shows you can have these programs and give it a wider appeal in the community as well as ensuring the elite level is going extremely well,” he said. Hume’s nomination was supported by fashion designer and philanthropist Meredith McClements, who is a trustee on the WA Cricket Foundation. He said the $100 million WACA development would ensure the historic ground once again found its niche in WA’s sporting landcape. “To be honest, I think all of us would prefer if we had the MCG in our back garden,” he said. “I got a bit sad towards the end of the WACA before the (Optus) stadium came along when we were only able to get about 15,000 people in when the Scorchers were absolutely flying. “We had outgrown it. It is still a great ground and a great cricket ground but I think the sensible approach that is happening right now to get more of the community involved is the way to go., inclusive playgrounds, all these community facilities. “It is never going to be a 100,000 seat stadium. “It was a shut off place in the past with big fences around and you only went there if you were interested in the elite cricket. “Well this has opened it up to a far wider audience.” There have been 12 nominations for the two vacancies on the WA Cricket board that opened up when chair Terry Waldron and Nicola Brandon resigned last month. WA cricket great John Inverarity, former Australian Medical Association president Michael Gannon, accountant David Brown, cricket coach and former ACB international liaison officer Alan Abraham, digital entrepreneur and community engagement expert Cam Sinclair, Cardin Langer, the director of Langer Auto Group, communication consultant Daniel Smith, former Australian diplomat Tony Sewell, Bunbury accountant John Tombleson, building practitioner Jeffrey Riley and retired JP and entreprenuer Maurice Fawcett. The two new board members will be announced at a Special General Meeting on November 21.

The two sides will first lock horns in the three-match ODI series, starting from Dec. 4 in Dhaka. The second and third ODI is scheduled to be played on Dec. 7 and 10. All the three games are going to be played at Dhaka's Shere Bangla National Stadium. The Test series will go underway on Dec. 14 at Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium, Chattogram. The second Test will be played again in Dhaka from Dec. 22. While India are touring with mostly a full-strengthen squad with Rohit, Rahul, and Virat Kohli back, the Men in Blue have decided to rest Hardik Pandya, Suryakumar Yadav, and Dinesh Karthik for the Bangladesh tour. While DK won't be a part of both New Zealand and Bangladesh tours, Surya and Hardik have been added to India's squad for the white-ball series against the Kiwis. Ravindra Jadeja, who missed the T20 World Cup due to a knee injury, has returned to the side, while likes of Rajat Patidar and Yash Dayal have been called up to form a strong bench in the ODI format. Meanwhile, Hanuma Vihari, who was one of India's heroes in their 2020-21 Australia tour, has been dropped from the Test side. It has been reported that Chetan Sharma, the chairman of selectors, has stated that Vihari does not fit in India's combination for the Bangladesh series. India's No. 3 in Tests, Cheteshwar Pujara has retained his place in the India line-up after his fabulous comeback into the Test side after his form revival in County Cricket, while former India Test vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane continues to be away from the team. Meanwhile, Prithvi Shaw and Sarfaraz Khan have been the major absentees in the squad after their stellar domestic season. Khan finished as the leading run-scorer in the 2021-22 Ranji Trophy, scoring 982 runs in six games at an incredible average of 122.75. When asked about the duo, Sharma said that both players will get their due and the Indian selectors have been thinking about fitting both players in the team. Even Ruturaj Gaikwad has not been included in both New Zealand and Bangladesh tours.

A report into racism in Scottish cricket called 'Changing the Boundaries' was published in July, having been instigated in part by the claims of former internationals Majid Haq and Qasim Sheikh, leading to probes into 68 individual referrals. Since its release that number has risen to 77 in total, with 43 of those found to be distinct race-related issues. Almost half of those have now been sent for investigation, with a further 17 requiring additional information and four more either close to being settled or paused due to legal proceedings. Sports law firm Harper MacLeod LLP led the review process, with assistance from the charity Sporting Equals and campaigners Running Out Racism. While there is no clear timescale for the investigations, a statement for Cricket Scotland said the body was \"committed to ensuring that these are conducted thoroughly and sensitively and, where appropriate, as quickly as possible\". A new 'conduct in sport' panel is also being set up to deal with disciplinary matters.

He was elected as president on October 18 in Mumbai. Binny indicated that a focus area for his administration will be the prevention of injuries to players. “As the BCCI president, I want to primarily focus on two things. First is the prevention of injuries to the players. Jasprit Bumrah got injured just before the World Cup, which affects the whole plan. Second, I want to focus on the pitches in the country... The wickets in India should be lively so when we go overseas, it helps our players,” Binny said. The rest of the BCCI office bearers are: Rajiv Shukla (vice-president), Jay Shah (secretary), Devajit Lon Saikia (joint secretary), Ashish Shelar (treasurer), Arun Singh Dhumal (chairman, IPL governing council), Avishek Dalmiya (member, IPL governing council), and Khairul Jamal Majumdar (apex council member). Georgia Redmayne and Amelia Kerr excelled with bat and ball, respectively, to lift Brisbane Heat to second place 10 days into the Women’s Big Bash League competition. Wicketkeeper-batter Redmayne made useful contributions with the bat – including an unbeaten 98 and a 49 – and leg-spinner Amelia Kerr backed them up with productive bowling spells, picking up seven wickets in four games. Harmanpreet Kaur, one of Melbourne Renegades’ key players, was ruled out of the tournament with a back injury. Jemimah Rodrigues played just a couple of matches for her team, Melbourne Stars, but got out for a duck the only time she got a chance to bat. Smriti Mandhana opted out of WBBL to ease her workload.

Captain Finch's 63 off 44 balls helped the champions to an imposing total of 179 for five at the Gabba before Australia's bowlers led by Mitchell Starc terrorised Ireland's top order on Halloween.

After a slow and awkward 31 not out against Sri Lanka in Perth, Finch started tensely with the bat but grew in confidence in partnerships with Mitchell Marsh (28) and Marcus Stoinis (35). The stocky opener struggled with his running later in the innings, though, and left the field early with a hamstring strain during Ireland's chase. \"A little hammy twinge, I think, so we'll get a scan tomorrow.

Both the Asian countries will face each other merely a couple of months after their intriguing Asia Cup 2022 clash at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium. The third of three Afghanistan-Sri Lanka T20Is had witnessed Sri Lanka pulling down a 177-run chase in the absence of a standout batting performance. However, four batters scoring in excess of 30 runs called for an archetype team effort. Reeling at the bottom of the points table in Group 1, both Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are tied at a couple of points to be at the fifth and sixth positions respectively. However, while two Sri Lankan points have come because of a victory, two points for the Afghans have come on the back of their unfortunate participation in two rain abandoned Super 12 matches.
