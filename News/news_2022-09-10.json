Out of form and with his spot in the side in doubt, Finch confirmed Sunday's ODI against New Zealand would be his last in the format for Australia. However he still intends to lead Australia's charge in the T20 format, with Cricket Australia confirming he plans to lead the country in next month's world title defence. \"It has been a fantastic ride with some incredible memories,\" Finch said. \"I have been extremely fortunate to be a part of some brilliant one-day sides. Equally, I have been blessed by all those I have played with and the many people behind the scenes. \"It is time now to give a new leader the best possible opportunity to prepare for and win the next World Cup. \"I thank all of those who have helped and supported my journey to this point.\" Australia's leader since 2020, Finch has played 145 matches - 54 as captain. One of the most damaging opening batters in the world when at his best, he has made over 5000 runs in the format and averaged close to 40. But those numbers have taken a significant hit in recent years, averaging 14.6 in 2022 while failing to pass 20 in his last seven innings. Ultimately, his call to retire came after his fifth duck across all formats this year. He debuted against Sri Lanka in 2013 with his 17 centuries fourth only to Ricky Ponting, David Warner and Mark Waugh in one-day cricket for Australia. The right-hander played a key part in Australia's 2015 one-day World Cup success before leading the team to the semi-finals in the 2019 tournament. Finch's decision leaves Australia searching for a new one-day captain ahead of next year's World Cup, with Test skipper Pat Cummins previously indicating he does not want to lead the side. \"On behalf of Australian Cricket, I would like to congratulate Aaron on his vast contribution as captain of the Australian men's ODI team and as a wonderful exponent of the 50-over format,\" Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley said. \"Aaron is an enormously gifted and determined player whose outstanding deeds with the bat have been matched by his strong and inspiring leadership. \"His decision to step aside from the ODI captaincy now is typical of his selfless approach to the game. \"I'm delighted Aaron will lead the Australian team into the forthcoming ICC Men's T20 World Cup where his leadership, experience and tactical nous will be integral to the defence of our T20 World Cup title on home soil.\"","pubDate":"2022-09-09 23:43:20","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-8188875/0428641ae346fcf730c931d9bcb7f596f9f45b5e-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Finch retires from one-day cricket but remains for Twenty20","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/finch-retires-from-one-day-cricket-but-remains-for-twenty20-20220910-p5bgzs.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Malcolm Conn"],"video_url":null,"description":"White-ball captain Aaron Finch will retire from one-day cricket after Sunday’s 50-over match against New Zealand, but will lead Australia to next month’s Twenty20 World Cup.","content":"Australia’s white-ball captain Aaron Finch has announced his retirement from one-day international cricket after a dreadful run of form but will lead the national team to the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia next month. The third and final one-day match in a series Australia have already won against New Zealand , to be played in Cairns on Sunday, will Finch’s last in the 50-over format. His departure from the 50-over format gives the selectors a year to bed down the one-day team ahead of the World Cup in India 12 months from now. “It is time now to give a new leader the best possible opportunity to prepare for and win the next World Cup,” Finch said in a short statement ahead of a press conference in Cairns on Saturday. Following a second-ball duck last Thursday , Finch has six single-figure scores in his past seven one-day innings for a total of just 26 runs and just one half-century from 13 innings this year, including five ducks. His extended run of outs in one-day cricket put mounting presser of the selectors, with panel chairman George Bailey and coach Andrew McDonald recently reaffirmed that Finch, 35, would lead the national team at the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia during October and November. Aaron Finch lasted just two balls in the second one-dayer against New Zealand. Credit: Getty He took Australia to a first Twenty20 World Cup title in the UAE less than a year ago. After the last match against the Kiwis on Sunday, Australia have seven Twenty20 matches and a practice game scheduled before their first official Twenty20 World Cup clash, against New Zealand in Sydney on October 22. Finch’s Twenty20 form for Australia and the Renegades has been solid but his last Twenty20 international was in Sri Lanka in June and his one-day form since has been dreadful. In last week’s one-day series against Zimbabwe in Townsville, Finch scored 15, one and five, while in the opening match against New Zealand on Tuesday night he also scored five. Finch played 145 ODI matches with 54 as captain. “It has been a fantastic ride with some incredible memories,” Finch said. “I have been extremely fortunate to be a part of some brilliant one-day sides. Equally, I have been blessed by all those I have played with and the many people behind the scenes. “It is time now to give a new leader the best possible opportunity to prepare for and win the next World Cup.

On Friday, Premier League, EFL, WSL and even grassroots football was suspended as a mark of respect to the Queen, though the move was at odds with most other major sports. Cricket, rugby, golf, horse racing and other events will continue over the weekend, with football’s decision largely greeted by a backlash from the likes of Gary Neville and Piers Morgan who felt it should have gone ahead as scheduled. According to the Daily Mail, the possibility of staging Premier League matches with appropriate gestures and messaging was debated but ultimately vetoed. Part of the reason behind that decision owed to concerns that some supporters may not respect the tributes and potentially cause ‘global embarrassment’ for the league and wider football community. Top-flight clubs feared the potential for scenes such as those at Shamrock Rovers’ Europa Conference League match against Swedish side Djurgardens on Thursday, where supporters sparked outrage by signing offensive songs. While that was likely to have stemmed from Irish Republican sentiment, some English clubs also have politicised elements of their fan base – something which will not have gone unnoticed by the clubs themselves. Queen Elizabeth II dead: What happens next? Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has died after 70 years on the throne, with her death announced by Buckingham Palace on September 8, 2022. She died at the age of 96 at her home in Balmoral, with her son, the now King Charles, and daughter Princess Anne by her side.

It was the Premier League board’s unanimous recommendation to postpone the weekend’s matches and while it was debated, the decision was accepted by all 20 clubs. They intend to resume the schedule next weekend but with the Queen’s funeral expected to take place on Monday 18 September there are concerns that policing logistics may cause fixtures to be impacted. There is an expectation that the Met Police will require an increased presence in London next weekend with people travelling to the capital ahead of the funeral. Some FC Zurich fans started jeering towards the end of a minute’s silence for the Queen held before the second half of Thursday’s match with Arsenal (Picture: Reuters) But a host of matches are scheduled to take place in London, with Tottenham hosting Leicester on Saturday, Arsenal travelling to Brentford for a 2pm kick-off on Sunday and Chelsea hosting Liverpool later that same day. According to The Guardian, there is an acknowledgment that losing two full rounds of matches would be a nightmare given how congested the calendar already is due to the World Cup. As such, the Premier League would be willing to have a partially completed round of fixtures and will try to host as many matches as they can, with those teams playing on Sunday most at risk of missing out.

There will be three days’ play after day one on Thursday was washed out and Friday’s play cancelled as a mark of respect to the Queen . The ECB wanted to extend the match into Tuesday but South Africa are set to fly home that day and refused to budge. The national anthem will be sung as usual before the start of play and, with a sell-out crowd of 27,500 expected, it could be the first massed rendition of God Save the King. God Save the Queen was about to be sung on Thursday when rain arrived. Captain Stokes made his views clear when responding to a tweet asking whether sporting events should go ahead this weekend. Stokes wrote: “She loved sport, be honoured to play in her memory.” Teams and the toss will stand after England handed a debut to Yorkshire batsman Harry Brook and chose to bowl first. The three remaining days will have a minimum of 98 overs to make up for lost time but poor light and a slow pace of play may make that a struggle. Surrey have urged spectators to arrive early and be in their seats by 10.30am for a “special on-field celebration of Her Majesty’s life”. The host county added that bars will not serve alcohol until after the celebration and fancy dress is not allowed on any of the three days. Advertising will be removed from areas such as sight screens, boundary cushions, giant screens and outfield mats and be replaced by tributes to HM Queen Elizabeth II. The women’s Twenty20 match between England and India in Durham and England Under-19s v Sri Lanka in Leicester will also go ahead, as will recreational cricket. An ECB spokesperson said: “Cricket will resume on Saturday to pay tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and honour her remarkable life and service. “The decision has been taken after consultation with DCMS and in line with official national mourning guidance. “Before each match, a minute’s silence will be observed followed by the national anthem. “All players and coaches will wear black armbands. Branded inventory will be replaced with messaging paying cricket’s respects to the Queen.” The ECB hoped to persuade the Proteas to agree to an extra day. But the spokesperson added: “We have been in discussions with Cricket South Africa but the team has to fly on Tuesday to spend a few days at home before heading to India and Australia. “So Saturday’s play is confirmed as day three of a five-day Test match.” The series is level at 1-1 after South Africa won at Lord’s and England triumphed at Old Trafford.","pubDate":"2022-09-09 21:38:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Premier League clubs fear more games will be postponed next weekend - The Guardian","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mb290YmFsbC8yMDIyL3NlcC8wOS9wcmVtaWVyLWxlYWd1ZS1jbHVicy1mZWFyLW1vcmUtZ2FtZXMtd2lsbC1iZS1wb3N0cG9uZWQtbmV4dC13ZWVrZW5k0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Premier League clubs fear more games will be postponed next weekend  The GuardianEngland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland call off weekend's football following death of Queen Elizabeth II  BBCPremier League / Football stance on the Queen so different to Rugby, Cricket, Golf, Horse Racing – Why?  The MagFixture chaos looms as next weekend in danger too  ClaretandhughPremier League suspension: What happens next?

Manchester United news, exclusives and analysis The United Kingdom has entered a period of mourning following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, with all top-flight, EFL, WSL and even grassroots matches postponed this weekend as a mark of respect. That has prompted question marks over what will happen with the upcoming mid-week European fixtures, but all seven matches involving English teams are likely to be played as per normal. United – who are playing away in Moldova – have now confirmed that, after liaising with the government and UEFA, their match against FC Sheriff on Thursday will definitely be played. A brief statement read: ‘Following discussions with the relevant governing bodies and in line with guidance issued by the UK Government, we can confirm our UEFA Europa League fixture against FC Sheriff will take place as scheduled on Thursday evening in Moldova. ‘Match arrangements will remain the same for fans who are traveling to support the team in Chisinau.’ United are one of three teams playing away from home in Europe next week, with Tottenham’s match in Lisbon against Sporting and West Ham’s trip to face Danish side Silkeborg both expected to go ahead too. Arsenal, meanwhile, are playing at home against Dutch side PSV, but have been informed by the Met Police that they are ‘comfortable’ for the game to go ahead . That is also likely to be the case for Chelsea, who host RB Salzburg in the Champions League, as well as Manchester City and Liverpool who host Borussia Dortmund and Ajax respectively. Government says Premier League and EFL football matches can go ahead this weekend Gary Neville disagrees with Premier League's decision to postpone weekend fixtures Paul Merson names top six side that should have appointed Graham Potter before Chelsea While many sports – such as rugby and cricket – have elected to continue over the weekend, footballing bodies made the decision to suspend all scheduled matches until Monday. Although the midweek European matches will likely all go ahead as planned, next weekend’s Premier League and domestic fixtures remain a doubt due to potential policing issues so close to the Queen’s funeral – which is expected to take place on Monday 19 September. Chelsea are due to host Liverpool on the Sunday afternoon beforehand, but many people will be travelling to London ahead of the funeral which could cause issues for the game.

India Women, who had toured England for Commonwealth Games 2022 Women’s Cricket Competition last month, have reached the same country again for a white-ball tour. Although a rare occasion when India Women will be beginning their tour of England for the second time in one summer but it will be happening tonight with the first T20I to be played in Chester-le-Street. While India will be playing their first-ever T20I at the Riverside Ground, England have won both their previous T20Is here. It is noteworthy that India are scheduled to play three T20Is and as many ODIs across six venues within 15 days. Notwithstanding losing the Commonwealth semi-final to India by 4 runs, England have a sterling T20I record against them winning 17 and losing six out of a total of 23 T20Is. As far as series record is concerned, England have won four out of five bilateral T20I series against this opposition. Readers must note that the last India had won a bilateral T20I series against England was in a one-match series 16 years ago. Sony Sports Network will be televising India Women’s tour of England 2022 in India. A potentially blockbuster clash between two high-profile teams will be covered only in English commentary unlike Commonwealth Games 2022 Women’s Cricket Competition last month. Indians fans must note that they will be able to watch this match in English commentary on Sony TEN 1. Fans, who prefer to watch matches in Hindi commentary, will have no other option than to watch it in English. Online users in India can stream the match on Sony’s streaming application named Sony LIV.

But other sporting events, including the England men's cricket Test against South Africa, will go ahead as planned this weekend. Elizabeth II's death at the age of 96 was announced by Buckingham Palace on Thursday evening. Within hours of the announcement, the England and Wales Cricket Board quickly confirmed day two of the deciding Test at the Oval would not take place, but said that play would resume on Saturday following Government guidance. The official mourning guidance, published by the Government on Friday morning, stated there was no obligation on sports organisations to cancel or postpone events. So, events like the mass participation Great North Run will go ahead on Sunday, as will Premiership rugby, Super League rugby league and the BMW PGA Championship golf tournament. But the UK's football authorities decided to postpone all fixtures planned for this weekend, and there is a possibility no further Premier League matches will now be played this month. A host of English teams are due to be in European action on home soil in midweek, but those matches are expected to go ahead as scheduled. In addition, the women's middleweight world title fight between Savannah Marshall and Claressa Shields, scheduled for the O2 Arena in London on Saturday, is off after the British Boxing Board of Control cancelled all the weekend's bouts as a mark of respect. A decision on next weekend's Premier League games will be made in due course but some or even all of them could yet be affected by policing requirements in London and elsewhere related to the State Funeral. No date has been fixed for that occasion yet. Matches in the EFL and the Women's Super League this weekend have been called off, along with all matches at all levels in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Football Association chair Debbie Hewitt, who was involved in Friday's meetings with Government, said: \"This is a great example of football working in unity. We (the football authorities) all absolutely 100 per cent agree this was the right thing to do to pay our respects.\" However, many other sporting occasions will go ahead and offer spectators and participants to pay their respects at venues. The Football Supporters' Association issued a statement saying there was no perfect decision, but added many supporters would see this was \"an opportunity missed\" for them to pay their respects at matches this weekend. Cricket at international, domestic and recreational level will resume from Saturday, the ECB said. \"Before each match, a minute's silence will be observed followed by the national anthem,\" the governing body said. \"All players and coaches will wear black armbands. Branded inventory will be replaced with messaging paying cricket's respects to the Queen.\" As tributes continued to pour in for Britain's longest-serving monarch, England's men and women's national soccer coaches offered their own messages. Gareth Southgate said the Queen \"showed the world what it is to be British\", while Sarina Wiegman hailed an inspiration through \"unrelenting work ethic, leadership, dignity and kindness\". England's men will pay tribute to the Queen when hosting Germany on September 26. The first day's play at the PGA Championship golf at Wentworth was cut short on Thursday when news of the Queen's death was announced and Friday's play was cancelled, but organisers confirmed the tournament would resume on Saturday as a 54-hole event.","pubDate":"2022-09-09 18:44:37","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-8187622/20964959da753ecc2be202d3091b643ca6eff3d2-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Aja catch catch khelte hein”: Fans react hilariously to Hasan Ali and Iftikhar Ahmed playing Catch-Catch after Dasun Shanaka dismissal in Dubai T20I","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-aja-catch-catch-khelte-hein-fans-react-hilariously-to-hasan-ali-and-iftikhar-ahmed-playing-catch-catch-after-dasun-shanaka-dismissal-in-dubai-t20i/","keywords":["Cricket","Videos","asia cup","Asia Cup 2022","Dasun Shanaka","Hasan Ali","Iftikhar Ahmed","Pakistan","Sri Lanka"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Hasan Ali and Iftikhar Ahmed: Two Pakistani cricketers were seen indulging in a popular Gully Cricket activity tonight.

It all happened right after the dismissal of Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka (21) as Ali and Ahmed nearly bumped into each other while grabbing a catch. Wanting to dispatch a Mohammad Hasnain slower delivery out of sight, all Shanaka did was hit the ball high into the night sky. Showing interest in grabbing a catch, Ali and Ahmed ran from long-off and long-on respectively without effective communication. While Ali somehow managed to complete the catch in spite of facing a running obstacle in the form of Ahmed, the duo was soon seen throwing simple catches at each other. Ali and Ahmed’s moment of amusement caught the attention of fans who, as expected, pointed out how the pair participated in a fun activity when Pakistan were on the verge of losing a match.

Prince Charles has arrived at Balmoral. Tea will be taken early. And we will now cut to a special announcement. Premier League, WSL and EFL weekend games off but other sports to continue Read more I make no apologies for writing about the Queen here. It has after all after been 96 years, a fair part of this spent around the kind of places where big sport happens, from the Austerity Games to the Matthews Final to a minute’s Uefa-approved solemnity in the Europa Conference League (it’s what she would have wanted) on Thursday night. Not that the Queen had any obvious fondness for sport. “I have often observed in women of her type a tendency to regard all athletics as inferior forms of fox-hunting,” Evelyn Waugh wrote of Lady Circumference in Decline And Fall. Does that sound about right? The Queen did love the horses. She seemed to quite like going to cricket. One of her first non-ceremonial appearances was to meet the touring Indian team of Vijay Hazare at Lord’s in 1952. She met Don Bradman’s Australians at Balmoral and her sister stood very near Keith Miller looking pleased. But generally the Queen’s regular appearances at sport had an air of something to be endured, on the spectrum between another garden party full of people who actually want to be at royal garden parties, and an ill-fated Dane Bowers dubstep set at a rain-sodden jubilee concert. The Queen looks on as Virginia Wade lifts the Wimbledon trophy in 1977. Photograph: Mike Stephens/Getty Images I once followed the Queen around on a visit to Wimbledon. The crowds cooed as she stalked the concourses in a mint-green suit and an impressive matching hat the shape and size of an elegantly turned casserole dish. The most remarkable part was the physical reality, still startling in the flesh, of that total commitment at all times to Being The Queen, to being a cipher, a presence, an object. The moment this really came into focus was on Centre Court. From a distance the Queen seemed to be actually watching and possibly even enjoying the tennis, that mint-green hat fixed rock solid in its upright position. The giveaway came when a line call was challenged and the entire court wrenched around to stare at the Hawkeye screen. Only one object remained stationary among those 20,000 heads, the lime green hat staring resolutely straight ahead, magnificently unmoved, regally disinterested in line calls, and surprisingly tender out there in all that air. There are probably two things worth saying about all this. First, football should not have been cancelled in tribute , and not just because this seems far too timorous and craven. Probably there are sound operational reasons, but the Queen was all about getting on with stuff. More to the point, people don’t mourn and grieve like this now, obediently tucked up in their drawing rooms. Public sentiment is restless and volatile. What, exactly, are they worried will happen in these spaces? Certainly cancelling sport is unlikely to do much for those of us who believe that a monarchy is a silly thing, that we could probably just let this one go from here (Charles III? Really? Do we have a Gracious King now?) Much better to use the occasion as a celebration, a wake for a 96-year-old monarch who had (I am going to say it) a very decent knock. Plus, no matter how opposed the absurd, sealed world of monarchy may be to the ideal of sport for all, Queen Elizabeth II was also a fixture of how we have arranged these things, a part of the architecture and the myth kitty of sport. The Queen is in all the pictures. The Queen has lifted the FA Cup more than any other human, even Ashley Cole. She was there when Rob Key made his double ton against West Indies. At the other end of the scale only the hardest heart could find nothing poignant or at least interesting in Bobby Moore wiping his hands on the Wembley steps before shaking those white gloves. This is one shade of what Englishness has been, a presence in the shared sporting memory bank that will never be repeated, that is now gone for good.

Perhaps there is a kind of liberation in all this. It has been pointed out that the Queen was also the visible figurehead of an inequitable society. This is not an observation that really takes us anywhere. She literally wore a crown and said: be oppressed by my presence. All royal families are, by definition, vessels of prejudice. Their basic existence says: I am more worthy than you, my blood is holier. The Queen watches the hockey at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images But equally the world is like this everywhere in some form or other. If you think the Queen represents a state of entrenched wealth and favour, wait ’til you get a load of global capitalism and the 1%. Or check out the Premier League, where we have clubs owned, ultimately, by dictatorial monarchies with a degree of inherited power roughly equivalent to Britain in the early 1640s. Fold time back on itself, reinstate the last absolute monarch, and it seems pretty likely Charles I owns Manchester United (he’s running it terribly) plus a vast slice of the treasury and all your personal freedoms. Try booing the King in this version of the FA Cup final, or indeed at this winter’s World Cup. Getting up off our knees, ceasing to tug the forelock, it all seems like a deeply sensible idea. But that journey is long. Is this shaping up as a fond, nuanced celebration of the Queen and sport? Probably not. It is worth adding one reason people liked the Queen is that she didn’t choose to be the Queen, but remained entirely dedicated to what she perceived as her national duty, a part of the staging of life in whatever form we demanded. Which was, as sport tells us more clearly than anything else, an opaque, ever-present figurehead, that unchanging hat in the stands.","pubDate":"2022-09-09 18:00:40","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862295b64a70b8bda7b20b0985672c7c773ecfe2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5a15da53d8843cc88b3c33072d68fe67","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Highlights: Hasaranga, Nissanka lead SL to five-wicket win - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9zcmktbGFua2EtdnMtcGFraXN0YW4tbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3JlLWFzaWEtY3VwLTIwMjItc3VwZXItNC1zbC12cy1wYWstdDIwLW1hdGNoLXRvZGF5LWxhdGVzdC1zY29yZWNhcmQtMTAxNjYyNzIyODQ3MDAzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Highlights: Hasaranga, Nissanka lead SL to five-wicket win  Hindustan TimesAsia Cup Schedule 2022 Live, Points Table, Match, Final, Today Match List, Live Score, Live Streaming And Live Telecast Details in India  Cricket AddictorPakistan vs Sri Lanka, Asia Cup 2022, Highlights: Pathum Nissanka Stars As Sri Lanka Defeat Pakistan By 5 Wickets  NDTV SportsSL vs PAK Dream11 Team Prediction: Check Captain, Vice-Captain, and Probable Playing XIs  News18Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Live Score- Asia Cup 2022 Live Telecast Channel In India, Live Streaming In India- SL vs PAK Live Score Asia Cup 2022 Live Score  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-09 17:41:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Road Safety World Series winners list: Who was Man of the Series in Road Safety World Series 2021?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-road-safety-world-series-winners-list-who-was-man-of-the-series-in-road-safety-world-series-2021/","keywords":["Cricket","Road Safety World Series 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Road Safety World Series winners list: Sachin Tendulkar-led India Legends will take on South African Legends at the Green Park on Saturday.

Persistent showers meant the game was repeatedly delayed and, by lunchtime, it had become apparent that something very serious was happening with the Queen. By 2:30 p.m., it was clear we were in the final hours, perhaps minutes, of her reign.There was a strange sense that this was history, a day I would always remember, in the way I remember where I was when I heard Diana had died in 1997 (drunkenly asleep under a table-tennis table on a farm in Derbyshire) or when Margaret Thatcher resigned in ’90 (crowding into Room 8 at school with everybody else because that was the only classroom with a TV). I kept looking across at the pavilion thinking what a poignant sight it would be when the flags were lowered to half-mast, and wondering how the drenched remnants of the crowd might react if an official announcement were made over the loudspeaker. As it was, play had been abandoned for the day by the time death was confirmed at around 25 past 6, and so I found out on my laptop while eating a disappointing sandwich in a café on Vauxhall Bridge.There were plenty of other people in the café, most on laptops or phones. Everybody must have known, but nobody reacted, nobody said anything—which was when it occurred to me that a sports stadium is probably the best place to experience one of those rare moments of national unity. In fact, most moments of national unity, when there is a sense of almost everybody focused on the same event, are sporting fixtures. A moment of silence was observed at Old Trafford following the news of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’s death.Jose Breton/NurPhoto/Imago Images Later in the evening, West Ham fans spontaneously sang the national anthem during the silence for the Queen before the Europa Conference League game against Romania’s FCSB; it was a hugely respectful outpouring of emotion. Manchester United honored her memory before its Europa League match vs. Real Sociedad at Old Trafford as well. And that is what makes it so odd that all football has been postponed this weekend. The Premier League, schools and amateur football and, perhaps most frustratingly, the launch of the Women’s Super League, which had hoped to benefit from the surge of interest that has followed England’s victory in the European Championship this summer, have all stood down.The Test will get underway Saturday, although over three days not five, with fancy dress in the stands banned. Golf’s PGA Championship, likewise, canceled Friday’s play but will restart Saturday, reduced to 54 holes. The St Leger, one of the five classics of the flat-racing calendar, has been pushed back from Saturday to Sunday. The rugby Premiership is going ahead as scheduled Saturday. The Great North Run, the world’s biggest half-marathon, will take place as planned Sunday. So why, then, has football taken this decision?Government left the decision up to individual sports. In 1952, football went ahead as planned three days after the death of George VI. In 1936, it went ahead five days after the death of George V. There has been some talk about security being stretched by the need to police mourners, but that was not mentioned in the Football Association’s statement and, besides, it’s hard to see how that could be a problem anywhere other than London. Rather, this seems to be about football’s determination to be seen to do the right thing, a fear of criticism, perhaps class-driven, that stretches back to 1914 when the decision not to abandon the season at the outbreak of World War I drew condemnation.Cancellation means hundreds of thousands of fans will have had travel plans ruined. Tens of thousands of stewards and freelance workers will lose pay at a time when Britain is facing a cost-of-living crisis. A congested fixture list has been packed even tighter. Perhaps the argument is that none of that matters alongside the importance of paying due respect. But why should that be different for football than it is for other sports? And how better to express that respect than by a mass singing of the anthem and observing a communal silence within a football stadium? That surely is a more meaningful act of remembrance than grumbling about at home while rolling news channels wheel out people with increasingly tangential connections to the royal family to share their anecdotes.Not for the first time, the Football Association seems to have been cowed into a poor decision by the terror of potential negative publicity. There is a cost for fans, for clubs and for stadium workers, but there is also a cost in terms of the great national moment that has been lost.More Soccer Coverage:Wilson: Graham Potter’s Unique Ascent to ChelseaClubs, Leagues, Stars Pay Tribute to Queen Elizabeth IIWilson: Napoli Takes Liverpool’s Rocky Start to New Depths","pubDate":"2022-09-09 16:03:39","image_url":"http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyMjEzODA4MjIyMDUzNjEy/man-united-queen-elizabeth.jpg","source_id":"si","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2022 Super 4 Live Score Updates: Gunathilaka & Mendis depart early as PAK rattle SL - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9zcmktbGFua2EtdnMtcGFraXN0YW4tYXNpYS1jdXAtMjAyMi1zdXBlci00LWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtdXBkYXRlcy04MTQwODMwL9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2022 Super 4 Live Score Updates: Gunathilaka & Mendis depart early as PAK rattle SL  The Indian ExpressAsia Cup Schedule 2022 Live, Points Table, Match, Final, Today Match List, Live Score, Live Streaming And Live Telecast Details in India  Cricket AddictorSri Lanka vs Pakistan Live Score: SL lose two wickets in first two overs  Hindustan TimesAsia Cup 2022: India's dismissals against left arm seamers were out of desperation, says Sanjay Manjrekar  India TodayLive Cricket Score Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2022 Latest Updates: Hasnain, Rauf Strike Early as SL Struggle in 122 Chase  News18View Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-09 15:54:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Futebol escocês também vai parar em homenagem à rainha Isabel II","link":"https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/desporto/2070128/futebol-escoces-tambem-vai-parar-em-homenagem-a-rainha-isabel-ii?utm_source=rss-desporto&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rssfeed","keywords":["Desporto"],"creator":["Notícias ao Minuto"],"video_url":null,"description":"Escalão profissional, masculino e feminino, não será disputado neste fim de semana.","content":"A Federação Escocesa de Futebol anunciou na tarde desta sexta-feira o adiamento da jornada desportiva deste fim de semana.

One of the many issues of protocol that the England and Wales Cricket Board had to consider on Friday was whether there would be any issue with the anthem being played in SE11 before the Accession Council formally proclaims Charles III as monarch at St James’s Palace. With the Council’s meeting scheduled to start just an hour before play gets under way at the Oval any problem could have led to another delay, but the cricket was eventually cleared to resume. The first official rendition of God Save the King will be sung at St Paul’s Cathedral at the end of a memorial service for the Queen on Friday night. Organisers also had to decide whether they should hold a single minute’s silence or two (protocol demanded one), whether it would be appropriate to ring the bell before play (yes), whether a military band could be involved – the Band of the Household Cavalry would have performed the anthem on Thursday had rain not intervened (also yes) – and whether the traditional rendition of Jerusalem before the start of play should also go ahead (probably not). But the Test will have to be decided in just three days after attempts to extend the match, which had already lost its first day to bad weather before surrendering the second as a mark of respect to Queen Elizabeth II, were stymied by South Africa’s hectic schedule. The tourists are due to return home on Tuesday and several players will have only a few days there before leaving for a white-ball tour of India. She loved sport, be honoured to play in her memory ❤️ https://t.co/sNSJ3qJreW — Ben Stokes (@benstokes38) September 9, 2022 The decision to restart cricket at all levels from Saturday was announced two and a half hours after the Premier League had made public its decision to postpone this weekend’s fixtures, reflecting the unusual complexity of the situation the ECB was placed under. This included the fact that the Oval lies on the Manor of Kennington, part of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall since 1337. The title is traditionally held by the eldest son of the reigning monarch and, as such, King Charles III had been Duke of Cornwall from his mother’s coronation in 1952 until his own ascent to the throne, whereupon Prince William inherited the position. Charles last visited the Oval as recently as June, though it was for a platinum jubilee celebration rather than the Vitality Blast. England’s players were keen to play, and almost four hours before the ECB made its decision, Ben Stokes had publicly called for the game to continue. “She [the Queen] loves sport,” the captain wrote on Twitter , stating he would “be honoured to play in her memory”. Players and coaches will wear black armbands for the remainder of the Test, while all removable advertising, including boundary ropes and sightscreens, will be removed. Spectators have also been asked to arrive early in order to take part in a celebration of the Queen, which is due to start at at 10.30am. Surrey have also made it clear that anyone who turns up in fancy dress will be turned away at the gates.","pubDate":"2022-09-09 15:34:13","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a8a7b938e8ebb96c64b7ad77a5c91a9067cca66/48_43_4878_2925/master/4878.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b63f8e68029b95750101e897517aad2","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India squad for Road Safety World Series 2022 All Teams Squads and Player List","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-india-squad-for-road-safety-world-series-2022-all-teams-squads-and-player-list/","keywords":["Cricket","India Legends","Road Safety World Series 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"India squad for Road Safety World Series 2022: India Legends will take on South Africa Legends in the opening match of the new season.

Third England vs South Africa Test match at The Oval will return tomorrow after not a single ball was bowled on the first two days. While the first day was abandoned due to inclement weather conditions, the second one had to be abandoned due to the passing away of Queen Elizabeth II in Scotland yesterday. Contrary to the reports doing the rounds with respect to the second day of the match getting postponed by a day, it won’t be happening after England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed that Saturday will be Day 3 of the match. A first-of-its-kind three-day Test match between two leading teams will put forward an opportunity for players to register a thrilling match. Knowing that only a limited numbers of overs will be at service in a series-decider, it wouldn’t be surprising if England and South Africa are able to yield a result within three days for the third time in a row. Weather at Kennington Oval London tomorrow Having said that, a riveting Test match will only be put on display if weather gods remain kind enough to not interrupt in London for the next three days especially after completing washing the first day. That said, the weather forecast according to AccuWeather on Saturday is a mixed one. While chances of rain will reduce as the day passes, there’s a 32% rain probability at The Oval in the morning session tomorrow. The number will almost reduce to single digits by the end of playing hours. Hourly weather at Kia Oval on Day 3 11:00 AM – 17 degree (Rain Probability – 32%). 12:00 PM – 18 degree (Rain Probability – 32%). 01:00 PM – 18 degree (Rain Probability – 28%). 02:00 PM – 19 degree (Rain Probability – 20%). 03:00 PM – 19 degree (Rain Probability – 20%). 04:00 PM – 21 degree (Rain Probability – 20%). 05:00 PM – 20 degree (Rain Probability – 20%). 06:00 PM – 19 degree (Rain Probability – 20%). 07:00 PM – 19 degree (Rain Probability – 14%).

I nestled into my couch with my piping hot bowl of vegetable soup to watch the classic. I recently watched the original “Pinocchio” in preparation and honestly, I was disappointed with the remake. I’ve loved other live-action movies by Disney, especially “Cinderella” and “Beauty and the Beast,” but “Pinocchio” didn’t strike me as a film on par with either one of them. The mix of animated and live-action doesn’t serve this film well. The titular character clearly looked fake and the film suffers massively in the aesthetic department because of the inharmonious blending of these elements. Sadly, Figaro, Gepetto’s beloved cat, looks suspiciously like a CGI creation, too. The mix of animation and human characters did very little to bring it to life. Even another cat in the film named Gideon isn’t really real. The plot itself is basic. The lonely, childless Gepetto, played by Tony Hanks, wood carves a puppet named Pinocchio, voiced by Ben Ainsworth. Since Gepetto has lost his own son, he makes a wish upon a star that Pinocchio will come to life. The Blue Fairy, Cynthia Ervio in this adaptation, grants this wish on the condition of Pinocchio’s good character. This coming-of-age film traces Pinocchio’s development as he receives help from characters like Jiminy Cricket, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Cynthia Ervio gave the best performance in the film. Tom Hanks was not exactly the right choice for Gepetto in my opinion. The nostalgia!! 🥹 Disney's reimagined #Pinocchio is now streaming on #DisneyPlusDay only on @Disneyplus . 🌟🌟🌟 pic.twitter.com/bzFcVNXcNm While there are a couple new characters and a couple twists, especially towards the end, this remake does not stray very far from the original Pinocchio. Having just rewatched the original Pinocchio, I thought the two films were much too close. This adaption does not really adapt much and isn’t visually interesting enough to compensate for that fact. Take for example, the live-action “Beauty and the Beast.” Even though the plot is very similar, the dialogue is different and beyond that, Disney created an absolutely beautiful film. The music is passable and even great at times, but not particularly special. What made that remake magical was the way that it brought the setting to life. I can’t say the same for the setting of Pinocchio. The would-be charming Italian town that Gepetto lives in loses its charm because of the mediocre CGI. While certain settings like the workshop are real, most of the buildings and settings seem to be CGI. It doesn’t blend seamlessly with the real people who act in the film. I was also disappointed by the music. It would be hard to redo “When You Wish Upon a Star” in any capacity that matched the prowess of the original, but this version missed the mark too much. Yes, you can. The film is rated PG and is minimally different than the first Pinocchio, but I’m unsure if watching this movie is worth your time. I thought the original was significantly better and that the new movie was overall mediocre. If I were to give it a grade while feeling generous, it would be a C-.","pubDate":"2022-09-09 15:11:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"deseret","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Test match between England and South Africa to resume play on Saturday and pay tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/19761041/england-south-africa-cricket-test-match-the-queen/","keywords":["Cricket","Sport","Royal Family"],"creator":["Joshua Mbu"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"THE CRICKET Test match between England and South Africa will resume play on Saturday and pay tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

For the unversed, the first day of the match on Thursday had to be abandoned due to rain. Scheduled to be played today, the second day of the match was abandoned due to the passing away of Queen Elizabeth II in Scotland yesterday. All kind of sports and recreational activities in the UK had been suspended as a mark of respect for the Queen. While talks of the whole match getting abandoned had been doing the rounds since the last 24 hours, it wouldn’t be the case after it has been decided that cricket will resume on Saturday to “pay tribute” and honour the Queen’s remarkable “life and service”. It is worth mentioning that it had also been reported in this period that a one-day postponement will result in Saturday becoming the second day of the Test match. Quashing all such reports, ECB have further confirmed that the original schedule of the match won’t be tinkered with. Therefore, Saturday will continue to be the third day of this match. “We have been in discussions with Cricket South Africa but they have to fly home on Tuesday to spend a precious few days at home before heading to India and Australia. Tomorrow [Saturday] is therefore confirmed as Day 3 of a 5-day Test Match,” ECB said in a statement.
