The players spoke, the wounded coach listened, the results turned. Now it’s time for Cricket Australia to move swiftly to re-sign Langer, or risk minimising the value of winning at the elite level. It’s worth recapping that the unrest was real and the frustration from the playing group palpable after tours to Bangladesh and the West Indies. Bubble life undoubtedly exacerbated the issues throughout the 2020/21 summer and into the colder months. At the height of the football codes’ seasons, and with no Test cricket to speak of, cricket (and Langer himself) was still in the news for all the wrong reasons.

Langer could have argued with the criticism around his methods, but he had no choice to heed the feedback. His job depended on it. There were some well connected officials behind the scenes who believed an Australian exit before the T20 World Cup final would have spelt the end of Langer. Months later in an interview with Adelaide-based sports reporter and former state batsman Theo Doropoulos, Langer recalled the extent of the piercing critique in typically evocative language. “Everyone was telling me what a bad person I was,” he said to Doropoulos. “At times, it felt like I was being treated like a criminal, and my only crime is trying to coach the Australian cricket team. “Last winter was horrible for my family. You hit rock bottom, and you’re the criminal for whatever reason.” Of course he was not a criminal and it’s doubtful anyone actually called him anything of the sort. But his vivid reference indicates precisely how vilified he felt and how hurt he was. If – and we can’t be certain – Langer’s suffocating approach and intensity was a key reason for a splattering of losses, then it’s only fair to credit him for the World Cup win in the UAE and the 4-0 Ashes result. How much of an influence a coach has on results depends on who you listen to, but the criticism directed at him throughout last winter at the very least should be matched by praise now. Should Cricket Australia not renew Langer’s contract, it would be incumbent on them to explain why and show transparency which has been sorely lacking in the past across a variety of issues.

Shane Warne is deep in his corner too after results turned around. And while the Baggy Green crew may have a degree of natural bias, the broad sentiment is consistent: If a team is improving and winning, the coach should be safe. As former England captain Michael Vaughan has noted in several columns and TV spots, player power should only go so far. Langer’s role in reintegrating David Warner and Steve Smith back into the fold should also be taken into account, according to Fox Cricket expert Isa Guha. “To be able to do that and manage the dynamics deserves a huge amount of credit,” Guha said on Fox Cricket’s Follow-On podcast. “Not least after a tough series loss to India, listening and evolving as a coach, then taking them on a journey to lifting a T20 World Cup and winning an Ashes in ruthless fashion. He put his ego to one side as pressure was mounting and that deserves a lot of praise. “He’s taken them to another level, safely reinstated as a likeable and competitive group of men among the Australian public. “A job well done you might say.” But the delay is a concern for Langer, who remains sensitive about his position and the criticism that has come his way across the last 11 months. Aussies secure Ashes victory in Hobart | 03:06 Unlike the football codes, there isn’t really a competitive market place for Langer, which is why Cricket Australia chief Nick Hockley is in no rush. In the coming months, overcoming spinner-friendly conditions in the subcontinent and defending a T20 World Cup on home soil presents an array of challenges but from a managerial viewpoint, continuity in messaging should be a non-negotiable. It would be impractical for Langer to coach the team in Pakistan, only to depart before tours to Sri Lanka and India later in the year. It’s why a decision needs to be made sooner rather than later. Cricket Australia’s decision – presuming Langer does not walk away himself – is a mighty test of Hockley’s leadership, the board’s priorities, and an even bigger examination of the degree to which results truly matter when assessing the performance of a national coach.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"Australia's U-19 WC hopes hit after loss","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/australias-u-19-wc-hopes-hit-after-loss-c-5349601","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia need results to go their way on the final day of matches in their group to reach the U19 Cricket World Cup quarter-finals after losing to Sri Lanka.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 20:45:07","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5349601/7f4aaaca2816e76d72537f0b0ba73e71c8826179-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest"},{"title":"Australia's U-19 WC hopes hit after loss","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/australias-u-19-wc-hopes-hit-after-loss-c-5349602","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia need results to go their way on the final day of matches in their group to reach the U19 Cricket World Cup quarter-finals after losing to Sri Lanka.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 20:45:07","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5349602/7f4aaaca2816e76d72537f0b0ba73e71c8826179-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow"},{"title":"Giles and Silverwood must go but Joe Root can help England’s post-Ashes rebuild | Mark Ramprakash","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/giles-and-silverwood-must-go-but-joe-root-can-help-englands-post-ashes-rebuild","keywords":["The Ashes","England cricket team","Ashes 2021-22","Australia cricket team","Australia sport","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Mark Ramprakash"],"video_url":null,"description":"Humiliation in Australia is a reflection of poor preparation, tactics and team selection.

England’s performance with the bat across the series was terrible, with that final-day collapse completely in keeping. I was a bit taken aback by the pitches. It is a tough enough task to face Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland on decent surfaces but these were very bowler-friendly, and with the ball moving around at pace, poorly prepared tourists relying on young batters were never likely to excel. It is certainly not fair to look at the lower order in these circumstances, but the final impression was of Ollie Robinson backing away so far that he could hardly reach the ball when it was aimed at the stumps – a fitting denouement to a miserable tour. Teams get outplayed by better sides, that’s part of sport, but to lose the Ashes inside 12 days indicates something has gone seriously wrong. There were mitigating circumstances in terms of the team’s preparation, which would have been poor even if it hadn’t been affected by bad weather and left Ben Stokes, in particular, coming into the series with hardly any cricket in him. But that’s where the sympathy stops. The tactics and team selection were particularly hard to understand. England went into the first Test on a green pitch without James Anderson and Stuart Broad, and then the second Test in Adelaide, where spin was always going to play a part, not only without a spinner but also our one fast bowler in Mark Wood. It was when Chris Silverwood came out after that match to insist that, even with the benefit of hindsight, he had picked the right team that he lost my confidence. Silverwood had spoken at length over the two years since his appointment about building for the Ashes, but when the team arrived whatever he thought he had constructed turned out to have no foundations. He is a nice guy who I know well, but decisions like batting first at Brisbane and leaving Jack Leach out in Adelaide suggested that he was approaching games with a pre-planned template rather than looking at the conditions in front of him. Tactics and team selection are his responsibility, and he has to carry the can for their failure. Ashley Giles, the ECB’s managing director of men’s cricket, gave a very uninspiring interview before the fourth Test when he talked, as a man whose job is under threat might, about the need to change systems rather than individuals. He has been in post for three years and again there are mitigating circumstances with Covid, but he is the man who appointed Silverwood, handing him all the power to determine selection and tactics, and his other key contribution has been to completely wipe out the support structure that England had build up over many years at Loughborough. As we look ahead to the promised reset of England’s Test team I think the positions of both Silverwood and Giles are untenable. A new head coach has to know the English game, have experience across formats and their own ideas for how to reshape the side. Look at what happened to the one-day team between 2015 and 2019, but this process will take a little longer. We simply don’t have top-order batters scoring lots of runs in domestic cricket, so we’re picking on potential rather than evidence. There are lots of important series and the focus on Australia is often excessive but it makes sense to plan in a two-year cycle, which takes us to the next Ashes. Gary Kirsten has said he would be interested and would make a very interesting candidate. There are two names that come instantly to mind as replacements for Giles – Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart. Both have experience, knowledge of English cricket and the gravitas to make things happen. We know that commercial considerations are paramount at the ECB and that is unlikely to change, but this defeat has been so emphatic and the reaction so strong that some things must. Their recent priority has been the Hundred, which has had several positive impacts, putting cricket back on the BBC and having the women’s competition running in parallel, but young players should be encouraged to aspire to face the ultimate challenge, and that is Test cricket. In Australia we saw three young batters in Haseeb Hameed, Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope learning on the job, trying to bridge what has become an enormous gap between facing county seamers in April and an Australian Test attack in unfamiliar conditions. One thing I do agree with Giles about is that we need to get counties on board, and give players more opportunities to play pressurised and higher-quality matches. England Lions are meant to be that bridge and there will hopefully be more of a focus on their tours in future, but a couple of other fixtures could be squeezed into the calendar – Lions against the best of the rest, perhaps, or north v south. Joe Root spoke after the final Test about his ambition to lead the team through the turbulent times ahead, and outlined some of his own ideas for the future . One of the failings of Giles and Silverwood is that we have got to this point with a complete lack of contenders for the England captaincy, so it is just as well that there is no need for a replacement. Despite the embarrassments of the last few weeks Root has done enough to keep his job – but not everyone involved can say the same.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4760d1590e8cbda84f9bfef31a2b3b48a6ba45ae/140_129_2244_1346/master/2244.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8e2c453fadc2dca893e7a2f2e8bcdbf9","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Return of the chosen one; cult hero among THREE brutal axings: Aussie ‘23 Ashes XI - Fox Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__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?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Return of the chosen one; cult hero among THREE brutal axings: Aussie ‘23 Ashes XI  Fox SportsAussie quicks rout England under lights to win Ashes 4-0 | Men's Ashes 2021-22  cricket.com.auUgliest image of the Ashes sparks outrage  NEWS.com.auFormer England stars criticise Ashes capitulation after the tourists' day three collapse against Australia in Hobart  ABC NewsReflections of the Fifth Ashes Test at Tasmania's Bellerive Oval  The ExaminerView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 19:03:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Ashes 2022, Australia vs England, cricket news, 2023 series, predicted teams, Scott Boland, Will Pucovski, Josh Inglis","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/the-ashes/ashes-2022-australia-vs-england-cricket-news-2023-series-predicted-teams-scott-boland-will-pucovski-josh-inglis/news-story/cd888a1174be12c68f6e5694bcf871b5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The men’s Ashes are over for another series which can only mean one thing: It’s time to look at the next one.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 19:00:00","full_description":"The men’s Ashes are over for another series which can only mean one thing: It’s time to look at the next one.

DAVID WARNER Warner sneaks in for another series which will almost certainly be his last Ashes. The left-hander will be almost 37 but there’s a feeling he has a score to settle. He only averages 26.04 in England and will likely fancy one last crack to put the poor record behind him. That Australia has a dearth of Test-calibre openers only makes it more likely that Warner goes around one last time. WILL PUCOVSKI Usman Khawaja is unlucky to miss out here, but his omission is only to make room for the chosen one of Australian men’s cricket, Pucovski. There is, however, one major asterisk to this selection. Having missed copious amounts of cricket through concussions, he will need to have an extended, uninterrupted run in the game from now until then. If he does, then the soon-to-be 24-year-old, with a first-class average of 53.41, and who made 62 in his debut Test innings against India, is the obvious pick to open the batting for Australia in 2023, and for many years to follow. If Pucovski is unavailable, then Khawaja is an outstanding back-up option have. MORE CRICKET NEWS COLUMN: How an emotional Paine post fell on deaf ears and revealed brutal Ashes truth 4-0!

After scoring runs for Glamorgan in 2019, Labuschagne was subbed into the Ashes and averaged an impressive 50.42. He’s been a lock at No.3 ever since and has a stunning Test average of 56.92. An obvious pick at No.3. The less obvious pick would have him open the batting, as suggested by Ed Cowan last week, to have Khawaja slot into the middle order. That seems unlikely at this stage, though. STEVE SMITH Another total no-brainer. Smith averaged 110.57 on his last trip to the UK where he reached those Bradman heights. His form has dropped off ever since, but Smith will be in the Australian XI for as long as he likes. TRAVIS HEAD Two centuries in four matches and a player-of-the-series award to his name, Travis Head has returned to the Australian Test team in style. He appears to be leaning into his strengths as a dashing left-hander, playing with a positive intent that makes him a major threat. What’s exciting for Australia is that Head, already averaging 43.14 after 23 Tests, should be only just coming into his prime in 2023, when he will be 29. A lock at No.5. Source: AFP CAMERON GREEN In the summer of 2020-21, when Green made his Test debut, he was an exciting prospect with a bright future. Just one year later, Green has emerged as a Test all-rounder of the highest calibre. His strength is with the ball, having just taken 13 wickets at 15.76 against England, although he made some key improvements with the bat late in the series to boost his Test average to 33.14. After just nine Tests, and at only 22 years of age, those are unbelievable numbers. The best thing is that Green is only just getting started. JOSH INGLIS (WK) In truth, this is a 50-50 call with Alex Carey as things stand. It’s not all that hard to imagine Carey making a big score this year, while his wicketkeeping during the Ashes was good enough to warrant reselection. Nonetheless, selectors are always going to be curious about Inglis who was only narrowly beaten to the gloves by Carey, who is averaging just 20.33 from five Tests. Inglis made three centuries and averaged 73.12 with the bat last Sheffield Shield season. If he can even vaguely replicate that form over the next season-and-a-half, and perhaps make some runs for Leicestershire in UK conditions, it’s hard to see how Inglis misses out come 2023. Inglis is still just 26 years old and is very much a star on the rise. Selectors could be tempted. Source: Getty Images PAT CUMMINS (C) Scary to think Cummins will have only just turned 30 by the time of the 2023 Ashes. Cummins will be fired up in a series that will be his best, and possibly only, shot to win the Ashes in England as Test captain. MITCHELL STARC This was a selection call that could have went one of three ways. Scott Boland’s incredible entry to Test cricket this summer made him a genuine contender, while Jhye Richardson’s swing ability also makes him a very attractive proposition in UK conditions. In truth, this position probably gets rotated during the series. But for the first Test, we’re locking in Starc. Starc will be 32 and will need to keep his pace up to keep his spot. Even then, Australia only picked him once in the 2019 series in favour of line-and-length bowlers. But for now, there’s simply no valid reason to keep Starc out of the XI given his strong home series. Starc was close to his best again this summer with 19 wickets at 25.36. He also took a wicket with the very first ball of the 2021-22 series. How can you not have him bowl the first ball in 2023? Mitchell Starc gets the nod for another tour. Source: Getty Images JOSH HAZLEWOOD This was another spot that was awfully tempting to give to Boland after he took 18 wickets at 9.55. For now, however, we’re going to respect the pecking order and say Hazlewood will return. After all, Hazlewood has 215 Test wickets at 25.63 and, when fit, is one of the three best fast bowlers in the world. That bowling average improves to 23.58 for Tests in the UK where his ability to consistently hit the right areas makes him a handful. He’ll be 32 for the series, making it possibly his last in the UK. NATHAN LYON The 2023 series could also be an England farewell for Lyon, who will be 35. Quite simply — and with all due respect to Mitchell Swepson — there aren’t enough spinners in Australia coming through to realistically challenge Lyon in time for 2023. Not that Lyon doesn’t justify his own selection anyway. 12TH MAN SCOTT BOLAND Jhye Richardson is stiff here, but we simply had to pick Boland. Boland does average less than 10 after three Tests after all. His ability to bowl stump-to-stump consistently and his ‘heavy ball’ make him the perfect back-up for Hazlewood in the UK. It’s extremely likely Richardson tours, too, and rotates with Starc.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"Five burning questions following a one-sided Ashes series","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/five-burning-questions-following-a-one-sided-ashes-series-20220117-p59osj.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Andrew Wu"],"video_url":null,"description":"We look at five key questions confronting Australian cricket after the team’s 4-0 Ashes triumph.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 19:00:00","full_description":"Australia’s dominance in the Ashes was evident from the first day until the last. In the end, they fell one wicket short of a 5-0 sweep of an England side that was clearly second best. But attention now turns to what’s next for Pat Cummins’ side. With Test tours of Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the coming months, plenty of hard work and hard decisions lie ahead. Here are five key questions to emerge from the five-Test series. England’s immediate future has more tough questions to answer but their best-possible bowling attack is still capable of serving it up to the tourists in the 2023 Ashes series in England. Australia have the pace stocks the envy of every international team, but world domination will not come without success in Asia. Much rides on spin great Nathan Lyon holding his form, and uncapped leggie Mitchell Swepson making the step-up to Test level. Marcus Harris needs to kick on otherwise the openers berths are a potential weakness with David Warner and Usman Khawaja both 35. Australia do not need Alex Carey to be the next Adam Gilchrist. If he can be as safe with the gloves as Gilchrist and scrounge backs to the wall type runs that will be enough. Get these three areas right and Australia will have a side capable of returning to the top and staying there. Find of the summer Scott Boland. Credit: Getty A more pertinent question is how often Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc will all be available together given the busy schedule and question marks over player availability in Pakistan. It will be difficult for Boland to tip out a fit Hazlewood, but selectors should now be confident the Victorian, who made his name on the once lifeless MCG track, can make an impact in any conditions. If there is a pecking order he has risen to No.4 with a bullet, providing selectors with pace depth for series on flat pitches. He is Test quality.

In the end, they fell one wicket short of a 5-0 sweep of an England side that was clearly second best. But attention now turns to what’s next for Pat Cummins’ side. With Test tours of Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the coming months, plenty of hard work and hard decisions lie ahead. Here are five key questions to emerge from the five-Test series. England’s immediate future has more tough questions to answer but their best-possible bowling attack is still capable of serving it up to the tourists in the 2023 Ashes series in England. Australia have the pace stocks the envy of every international team, but world domination will not come without success in Asia. Much rides on spin great Nathan Lyon holding his form, and uncapped leggie Mitchell Swepson making the step-up to Test level. Marcus Harris needs to kick on otherwise the openers berths are a potential weakness with David Warner and Usman Khawaja both 35. Australia do not need Alex Carey to be the next Adam Gilchrist. If he can be as safe with the gloves as Gilchrist and scrounge backs to the wall type runs that will be enough. Get these three areas right and Australia will have a side capable of returning to the top and staying there. Find of the summer Scott Boland. Credit: Getty A more pertinent question is how often Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc will all be available together given the busy schedule and question marks over player availability in Pakistan. It will be difficult for Boland to tip out a fit Hazlewood, but selectors should now be confident the Victorian, who made his name on the once lifeless MCG track, can make an impact in any conditions. If there is a pecking order he has risen to No.4 with a bullet, providing selectors with pace depth for series on flat pitches. He is Test quality. If swing is king, Jhye Richardson can come off the bench, while Michael Neser should aim for the 2023 Ashes. Call off the search, Australia have found their next Keith Miller.

England all-rounder Ben Stokes has opted his name out of the 15th season of the Indian Premier league (IPL) likely to start by April this year. Having lost the fifth Test in Hobart and thereby the Ashes series 0-4 on Sunday, Stokes has joined his Test skipper Joe Root to pull his name out of the IPL mega auction, slated to likely take place on February 12 and 13 at Bengaluru. Root had cited ‘his care for Test Cricket in England’ as the reason for him opting out of the lucrative league, and that he’ll continue to sacrifice for as long as he could for the same. “There’s a lot that we need to do for this [Test] team, which deserves all of my energy. I’ll keep sacrificing as much as I can because I care so much about Test cricket in our country and trying to get us to where we want to be,” Root stated post losing the 5th Ashes Test at Hobart. Ben Stokes IPL 2022 team: Why is Ben Stokes not playing in IPL 2022? Ben Stokes has decided to play in the County Championship, as part of his preparation for England’s first Test of their home summer against New Zealand beginning June 2. While there is no official statement coming from Stokes’ end yet, the various franchises of the IPL are no more expecting the English all-rounder to enter the auction deadline which has been pushed further back to January 20 (as against January 17 earlier). So Ben Stokes to skip IPL. Expect few others also to pull out citing bubble fatigue. They will fetch big sum in the next auction. Smart decision too IMO. — Venkata Krishna B (@venkatatweets) January 17, 2022 Stokes would have been a huge prospect for any team at the auction table, after Rajasthan Royals (RR)-his previous franchise, decided not to retain him but wicketkeeper-batter Jos Buttler for the upcoming season. The 30-year-old was the most expensive player at the 2018 mega auction, signing an INR 12.5 crore (£1.4 million approx.) deal with Rajasthan Royals. The Southpaw’s decision also comes after a major section of the English Cricket fans and a few experts have blamed England Cricketers’ participation in ‘The Hundred’ and the IPL as reasons for their poor performance in Test Cricket. How many England players in IPL 2022? With Root and Stokes already opting out, and speedster Jofra Archer already making himself unavailable due to injury, IPL 2022 might witness a relatively small pool of English cricketers. While Jos Buttler (RR) and Moeen Ali (CSK) have been retained by their respective franchises, and are thus expected to be available, Sam Billings, Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran, Tom Curran, Adil Rashid, and Eoin Morgan are the other big names likely to mark their availability. England’s highest wicket-taker in the recently concluded Ashes series- Mark Wood has entered the auction but said before the Hobart Test that he was weighing up whether or not to withdraw as he did in 2021.   The post Ben Stokes IPL 2022 team: Why is Ben Stokes not playing in IPL 2022? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-17 18:43:26","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Albany and Districts Cricket Association B-section closing in on two wins to start senior country week","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/albany-advertiser/albany-and-districts-cricket-association-b-section-closing-in-on-two-wins-to-start-senior-country-week-c-5343066","keywords":null,"creator":["Taj Stubber"],"video_url":null,"description":"A wrap on Albany and Districts Cricket Association B and D-section sides at the opening two days at senior country week.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 18:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5343066/06a5ea63a55944e735f9d7cf8a8af613a3f4dfc9-16x9-x0y242w2151h1210.jpg","source_id":"thewest"},{"title":"Junior country week grand final heartache for both Albany and Districts under-14 sides","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/albany-advertiser/junior-country-week-grand-final-heartache-for-both-albany-and-districts-under-14-sides-c-5339609","keywords":null,"creator":["Taj Stubber"],"video_url":null,"description":"Both Albany and Districts Cricket Association under-14 sides fell short in their respective junior country week grand finals.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 18:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5339609/04f2b82624c246c5cef7987f91a9a19bdf036926-16x9-x95y418w1692h952.jpg","source_id":"thewest"},{"title":"Commonwealth Games Cricket: SL, Scotland and 3 other nations to fight for a single spot","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/commonwealth-games-cricket-sl-scotland-and-3-other-nations-to-fight-for-a-single-spot-2428659.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Bangladesh, Scotland, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Malaysia will compete in a round-robin T20 tournament to qualify for the Common Wealth Games Cricket competition in 2022.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 17:59:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews"},{"title":"“Who else is going to coach or captain this England Test team any better?”: Kevin Pietersen reckons there is no better coach or captain to lead England Test team presently","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-who-else-is-going-to-coach-or-captain-this-england-test-team-any-better-kevin-pietersen-reckons-there-is-no-better-coach-or-captain-to-lead-england-test-team-presently/","keywords":["Cricket","England","kevin pietersen"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kevin Pietersen reckons there is no better coach or captain presently to lead the England Test team after a 0-4 Ashes series loss on Sunday.

A 146-run loss against Australia in the 5th Test match at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart has meant that England have now lost three successive Ashes series Down Under, without a win under their belt to even take some solace. Having drawn the 4th Test match in Sydney, courtesy some fight with the bat from the lower order, England yet again relived their infamous batting collapse during the final Test, to leave the Australian shores in the sourest possible manner. Apart from an half-century opening stand in the final innings at Hobart, none of the English openers could give their team a good start throughout the series. In fact, apart from Joe Root (322 runs across 10 innings), none of the England batters were able to give a consistent performance with the bat. In the bowling department, Mark Wood was the lone performer throughout, picking 17 wickets across 7 innings. While fans and experts rued lack of solid performances and logic-defying team selections as a couple of reasons leading to an England downfall, someone like a Kevin Pietersen has blamed England’s County Cricket-in its current form as the reason for England’s poor performance in Test Cricket. The 41-year-old has now, also brushed certain calls for sacking the captain and the coach of the Test team, and has stated that there isn’t anyone better on both fronts to replace the current ones. Kevin Pietersen reckons there is no better coach or captain presently Pietersen had, post England’s loss in the 3rd Ashes Test in Melbourne, advocated for a red-ball franchise tournament akin ‘The Hundred’, as the best step forward for the betterment of England Test Cricket. The former England right-handed batter, in a bid to bring back the discussion towards his aforementioned point, dismissed the calls of removal of captain Joe Root and coach Chris Silverwood post the Ashes drubbing. Pietersen, via his Twitter handle, in fact stated that there aren’t any world class players, that can replace the present captain-coach duo of the England team. They’re saying, SACK THE COACH! SACK THE CAPTAIN! Who else is going to coach or captain this England Test team any better? If you name me some world class players to replace the current underperforming ones, I’ll agree. But, there isn’t! #BlameTheSystem — Kevin Pietersen (@KP24) January 17, 2022 Pietersen, has for quite some time now blamed the system for England’s poor performance in Tests off-late. While consistently pressing doing away with the County Championships in the current form, he has also blamed Andrew Strauss and Co. for ruining the format in 2015.           The post “Who else is going to coach or captain this England Test team any better?”: Kevin Pietersen reckons there is no better coach or captain to lead England Test team presently appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-17 17:45:42","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Cricket-Bumrah backs &quot;driven&quot; Kohli and courts test captain role","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/01/17/cricket-bumrah-backs-driven-kohli-and-courts-test-captain-role","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PAARL, South Africa (Reuters) - India's Jasprit Bumrah says former captain Virat Kohli still has a big role to play for the test side following the latter’s surprise resignation in the wake of the 2-1 series loss to South Africa last week.

Discussions are rife regarding Team India’s next Test captain, ever since Virat Kohli left every Cricket fan stranded with an open jaw following his decision to quit from the post on Saturday. Having played a total of 99 Tests for India, Kohli had a wonderful opportunity to lead the team in his 100th Test versus Sri Lanka at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru- which also happens to be his IPL team’s (RCB) home ground. With the induction of Rohit Sharma as India’s new captain in the two limited Overs format, the Test captaincy post now lies vacant with one of KL Rahul or Rohit Sharma likely to be handed that responsibility. However, India’s star pacer Jasprit Bumrah is more than just open to take that extra responsibility, and has expressed his willingness to lead Team India in the longest format of the game. He is energy driven; he has brought a lot of change. @Jaspritbumrah93 lauds @imVkohli for his contribution as #TeamIndia captain. pic.twitter.com/x5FJVN37qt — BCCI (@BCCI) January 17, 2022 Jasprit Bumrah expresses willingness to lead Team India Addressing the press as Team India’s vice-captain for the upcoming 3-match ODI series versus South Africa, Jasprit Bumrah exclaimed that it would be an honour for him to lead India in the Test format, and that he doesn’t see any player shying away from a huge responsibility as such. “If given an opportunity, it will be an honour and I don’t see any player (who) would say no and I am no different,” remarked Bumrah ahead of India’s first ODI against South Africa in Paarl. “Be it any leadership group, I always look to contribute however I can, to the best of my abilities,” he added. Opening up on taking the extra responsibility on becoming Team India captain, Bumrah said, “I look at this situation in the same manner. Taking responsibility and talking to players and helping them out has always been my approach and it will always be my approach going further keeping any situation in mind.” Ajinkya Rahane could have been a natural choice for India’s next Test skipper. But, a consistent poor run of form has meant that he, in all likelihood will fail to even make it to the squad for the upcoming series. Also, with Rohit Sharma turning 35 next year, it is KL Rahul who might perhaps be considered to lead the side looking forward. It remains to be seen if Bumrah is considered for the post, given India’s rotation policy with the pace battery in view of the workload management.       The post “If given an opportunity, it will be an honour”: Jasprit Bumrah expresses willingness to become India’s next Test captain appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-17 15:08:32","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Rahul’s possible coronation a sign of IPL logic infiltrating Indian cricket - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQvcmFodWxzLXBvc3NpYmxlLWNvcm9uYXRpb24tYS1zaWduLW9mLWlwbC1sb2dpYy1pbmZpbHRyYXRpbmctaW5kaWFuLWNyaWNrZXQtNzcyNjk2MS_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rahul’s possible coronation a sign of IPL logic infiltrating Indian cricket  The Indian Express'Spare a thought for him': Ex-IND opener compares ongoing turmoil in Indian cricket to 'many of Dravid's Test innings'  Hindustan TimesRahul Dravid faces tricky task to rebuild team  Times of IndiaWeekly Sports Newsletter: KL Rahul India skipper, Hardik Pandya IPL captain … What?  The Indian ExpressView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 14:35:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"'It's hurting, and it's hurting badly' - Pollard places blame on batting group after defeat to Ireland - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuY3JpY2luZm8uY29tL3N0b3J5L3dpLXZzLWlyZS0zcmQtb2RpLWl0LXMtaHVydGluZy1iYWRseS1raWVyb24tcG9sbGFyZC1wbGFjZXMtYmxhbWUtb24tYmF0dGVycy1hZnRlci1kZWZlYXQtdG8taXJlbGFuZC0xMjk3MzIz0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"'It's hurting, and it's hurting badly' - Pollard places blame on batting group after defeat to Ireland  ESPNcricinfoMcBrine inspires Ireland to historic series win West Indies | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  Cricbuzz\"Sad Day For West Indies Cricket,\" Says Kieron Pollard After Losing ODI Series vs Ireland  NDTVSports.comRecent Match Report - West Indies vs Ireland 3rd ODI 2021/22  ESPNcricinfoIreland achieve historic ODI series win over West Indies  Hindustan TimesView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 14:06:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"This golfer is 6'10 with Kyle Berkshire swing speed – and he's playing American Express","link":"https://www.golfchannel.com/news/golfer-610-kyle-berkshire-swing-speed-and-hes-playing-american-express/","keywords":null,"creator":["Brentley Romine"],"video_url":null,"description":"One of the longest – and tallest – hitters in professional golf is teeing it up in Palm Springs this week: 26-year-old South African James Hart du Preez.","content":"One of the longest hitters in professional golf is teeing it up in Palm Springs this week.

Plenty time to make this the best year of my life to date.” He can start the turnaround this week in Palm Springs, where all eyes will likely be on the big big-hitter.","image_url":"https://www.golfchannel.com/sites/default/files/2022/01/17/hart_du_preez_1920.jpg","source_id":"golfchannel"},{"title":"Mitchell Marsh helps Scorchers seal top spot | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz - Cricbuzz","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaWNidXp6LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0LW5ld3MvMTIwNzI4L21pdGNoZWxsLW1hcnNoLWhlbHBzLXNjb3JjaGVycy1zZWFsLXRvcC1zcG90LWNyaWNidXp6Y29t0gFmaHR0cDovL20uY3JpY2J1enouY29tL2FtcC9jcmlja2V0LW5ld3MvMTIwNzI4L21pdGNoZWxsLW1hcnNoLWhlbHBzLXNjb3JjaGVycy1zZWFsLXRvcC1zcG90LWNyaWNidXp6Y29t?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mitchell Marsh helps Scorchers seal top spot | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzAdelaide Strikers v Sydney Sixers Big Bash Tips: Strikers on the charge  Betting.betfairAdelaide Strikers v Sydney Sixers, Big Bash 2021-22: score, scorecard, result, report  The CricketerBBL 11 Match 52 Adelaide Strikers vs Sydney Sixers: Convincing win by Strikers over Sixers by 8 wickets  Cricket WorldSTR vs SIX Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Pitch Report, Playing XI, Injury Update- KFC Big Bash League T20  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 13:34:14","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Rohit Sharma set to be announced as new Test captain after South Africa series, claim reports - Zee News","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3plZW5ld3MuaW5kaWEuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvcm9oaXQtc2hhcm1hLXNldC10by1iZS1hbm5vdW5jZWQtYXMtbmV3LXRlc3QtY2FwdGFpbi1hZnRlci1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2Etc2VyaWVzLWNsYWltLXJlcG9ydHMtMjQyODYyOS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rohit Sharma set to be announced as new Test captain after South Africa series, claim reports  Zee NewsBCCI Officials & Selectors To Discuss New Test Captain With Rahul Dravid, Rohit Sharma & KL Rahul  India Today`Serious questions on Rohit Sharma`s fitness`: Ex-India cricketer picks 3 contenders to captain India in Tests  WIONNot KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant; Sanjay Manjrekar Reckons Rohit Sharma Would Replace Virat Kohli as India's Next T  India.comCan We Make Rishabh Pant The Test Captain?

As expected, the development left Team India management scratching their heads as they will now have to pick the batter’s successor. However, if reports are to be believed then the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has already made up their mind and they are soon going to announce Rohit Sharma as the new Test captain. As per a report by InsideSport, the BCCI will make official announcement right after the ongoing tour of South Africa , which ends January 23 with India playing their last ODI of the three-match series. “Without any doubt Rohit Sharma will be the new Test captain of India. Rohit was named vice captain before the South Africa series & will now be elevated as captain of the team. The announcement will be made soon”, BCCI official told InsideSport. The BCCI official further said that selectors will also speak to Rohit on his workload & fitness related issues. “The workload will be immense. He needs to keep himself very agile and fit. I think the selectors will have a word with him. He will have to work to extra-bit on his fitness”, said the BCCI official. Notably, the home Test series against Sri Lanka, which is set to commence from February 25, is likely to be Rohit’s first official assignment as India’s new Test captain. It has been an open secret in recent years that apart from being one of the best performers across formats, Rohit, who is already captaining Team India in the white-ball format, has been a few notches above his peers in terms of acceptance of one and all in this team. Having learned the ropes of captaincy handling Mumbai Indians in the IPL, Rohit's man-management is seen closer to MS Dhoni's style. While KL Rahul, because of his age, is also being considered a long-term all-format leader, something which might also have the backing of head coach Rahul Dravid, what will go in Rohit's favour, despite the fitness and age concern, is his excellent form across formats. ''Rohit Sharma should be the bridge before BCCI is confident about the next young India captain that they want the team to lead for at least five years. ''This ICC World Test Championship cycle should be about giving it to an experienced hand rather than someone, whose leadership credentials aren't proven enough,'' a senior BCCI official stated to PTI.","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews"},{"title":"KAS vs IGM Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for Sharjah CBFS T20, Match 14","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/kas-vs-igm-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-sharjah-cbfs-t20-match-14?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Azhar"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 13:14:23","full_description":"The Karwan Strikers will be up against Interglobe Marine in the 14th match of the Sharjah CBFS T20 on 17th January at Sharjah Cricket Stadium in UAE.

The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee issued a report last week calling on the ECB to \"clean up its act\" on racism or face a limit on the public funding it receives. The report found there was \"deep-seated\" racism within the sport and gave the example of the language used in correspondence with the committee and attempts to \"discredit\" Azeem Rafiq in the media as evidence of a \"long and difficult road\" ahead for the sport. The committee called on the ECB to develop key indicators to measure its progress and to report to the committee every quarter, and representatives of the governing body will now appear on January 25. Executives from four county clubs, including Yorkshire, have also been called as witnesses. A timeline of how former Yorkshire cricketer Azeem Rafiq's allegations of institutional racism against the club have shaken the sport. Yorkshire chair Lord Patel first addressed the committee on November 16, the same day the county's former player, Rafiq, provided harrowing testimony about the abuse he suffered across two spells at the club. Lord Patel will be joined by the chairs of Middlesex, Hampshire and Glamorgan. Azeem Rafiq says the \"atrocious\" backlash he has faced as a whistleblower for racism in cricket has deterred many other victims of abuse from coming forward. MPs will question Lord Patel on the progress made at Yorkshire since he succeeded Roger Hutton in November and on the significant changes in personnel and procedures he has introduced. The county chairs will be asked about their clubs' approaches to diversity, the ECB's game-wide plan to combat discrimination and the way the sport is regulated. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The DCMS select committee report said \"the future public funds for cricket are dependent on continuous, demonstrable progress in getting rid of racism\". This followed the ECB's November publication of a game-wide 12-point plan to tackle discrimination. Its chief executive Tom Harrison described the racism allegations made by Rafiq and other players as an \"earthquake\" in cricket. The plan includes a review of dressing-room culture, diversity training for all those involved in the sport, a governance review, a drive to remove barriers to playing top-level cricket, localised equality, diversity and inclusion for clubs, counties and government bodies and examining how stadia can be made more welcoming to people from diverse backgrounds. Asked what his definition of progress would be, Rafiq said: \"I think it's got to be organic. \"It's important that we don't look for knee-jerk, quick reactions, which I see a lot of counties attempting to do, sort of going out there trying to speak to a lot of people and offer them little jobs to try to keep them quiet - that's not the way forward. \"I think we need a lot of education right at the bottom, right at the start - grassroots, and then hopefully organically as the players get more education of each other's cultures, more understanding, that will build respect and as they get older together, hopefully in four-five years' time we'll get to a place where cricket is a welcoming place for everyone.\"","image_url":"https://e1.365dm.com/22/01/1920x1080/skysports-cricket-balls-general_5640831.jpg?20220113230435","source_id":"skysports"},{"title":"Virat Kohli will have to give up his ego: Kapil Dev","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-south-africa/virat-kohli-will-have-to-give-up-his-ego-kapil-dev/articleshow/88953896.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli needs to shed his ego to play under a new leader after giving up the Test captaincy, cricket icon Kapil Dev said as uncertainty swirled about the future of the national team.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-17 12:22:20","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"toi"}]}
