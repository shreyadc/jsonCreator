England would love to be in that position next month at the T20 World Cup final in Melbourne - and have somewhat of a dry run this Sunday with a deciding T20 international against Pakistan in Lahore. After a series that has swayed one way and then the other, the two teams are locked at 3-3 after six of the seven games - although England should arguably have sewn up the silverware already. Bungled run chases in the fourth and fifth matches in pursuit of modest totals cost them and left them needing to win Friday's penultimate fixture, also in Lahore, to keep the series alive. A blistering assault from Phil Salt (88 not out from 41 balls) took the tourists to that victory in brutal style, with his onslaught helping England plunder 102 in the first seven overs chasing 170. Virtually job done,. Moeen Ali's men eventually eased home with a whopping 33 balls to spare. One must-win game down and another to go. These fixtures are certainly giving England great preparation should they find themselves in a similar scenario during the World Cup in Australia, a tournament they will be aiming to win for the first time since triumphing in the Caribbean in 2010. The team's mettle will be tested in the series decider on Sunday but Jos Buttler's calf probably won't be, with the usual skipper not rushing his comeback from an injury that has sidelined him since mid-August. His return should come in the three-match series against Australia, which starts in Perth on October 9 ahead of further meetings in Canberra. \"I feel like if it was a World Cup game tomorrow I could play but I am being a bit cautious and taking it a bit slowly. If I had to, I could play,\" Buttler told Sky Sports Cricket earlier this week. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player In Buttler's absence, Salt and Hales have been paired at the top of the order - both have made some low scores but also a half-century apiece, with Salt's 16-boundary blitz on Friday night following Hales notching 53 in the series opener, in what was his first England game since 2019. England's batting depth has been on show around those two limp chases mid-series, with Harry Brook - who looks increasingly nailed on to start at the World Cup - and Ben Duckett - who is not even in the squad for that tournament such are the team's riches - also plundering runs. The bowling looked a real concern after game two when Pakistan knocked off a target of 200 with three balls to spare, although two things to note were that express paceman Mark Wood did not play and Sam Curran was actually spared real punishment, with his four overs only going for 29. Both Wood and Curran have been plus points for England in this series. Wood has only played two games but underlined in both of them how vital he could be at the World Cup, snaring three-wicket hauls - each of his victims, bar one, proper batters - and bowling at well in excess of 90pmh. In his first appearance, he touched 97mph. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Curran, meanwhile, has picked up two wickets in each of his last two matches, with his subtle cutters accounting for Pakistan batters Haider Ali and Iftikhar Ahmed on Friday night. He has been economical, too, holding an economy rate of 7.25 across his 20 overs, a frugality that is only bettered by Wood (5.50), England spinner Liam Dawson (7.22) and Pakistan spinner Iftikhar (4.87), all of whom have bowled far fewer overs than Curran - eight for Wood and Iftikhar, nine for Dawson. England bowling coach David Saker said: \"There was a little bit of talk that the options weren't as broad as some other teams, but I'm pretty confident we're in a really good space with our bowlers \"We've got left and right-arm options, we've got Wood with a bit of pace and we've got spin options. At World Cups you need as many options as you can and I think we're in really good health. \"Mark is going to be pretty special, he's been bowling some seriously quick overs for us. Obviously he is going to be a pretty important weapon for us throughout the World Cup with his pace. But he's been out all summer back home so we have to make sure we're looking after him.\" October 2, 2022, 3:00pm Live on England have certainly looked after Wood in this series with the speedster given a watching brief for four of the matches but the temptation must be to bring him back in on Sunday as they look for a first white-ball series victory in five attempts. Since shellacking Netherlands in 50-over cricket in June, England have lost T20I and ODI series to India, drawn an ODI series with South Africa and then gone down in T20 cricket to the Proteas. Thanks to Salt's match-deciding knock on Friday night, they now have a chance to snap that barren run. The chance to win when it really matters. If they can do it this Sunday in Lahore, belief should rise that they could yet do it on World Cup Sunday in Melbourne on November 13. Watch the series-deciding seventh T20 international between Pakistan and England live on Sky Sports Cricket on Sunday.

It already has around 20 covers at its disposal.","content":"An overcast sky ahead of India's T20 fixture against South Africa at Guwahati on Sunday has made organisers and fans anxious, bringing back memories of the last international cricket match at the venue that had to be abandoned after heavy rain. Enthusiasm has been high among people in the run up to the match, with all tickets being sold out for the first international cricket game since the COVID-19 pandemic. The last international fixture at Barsapara Stadium at Guwahati was an India-Sri Lanka T20 match on January 5, 2020, which was called off due to persistent rain. At a pre-match media interaction, India head coach Rahul Dravid said it's great to see fans back in the stadium. \"Since June, when things opened up, every time we play in India, every stadium has been packed. That's a great thing. I am sure the boys really appreciate the fans cheering for them, hopefully supporting good cricket. I think it's a wicket that would support good cricket,\" Dravid said. The regional meteorological centre has forecast a partly cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain or thundershower for Guwahati on Sunday. The organisers, meanwhile, said they have put in place all arrangements to minimise time loss in the event of rain. The Assam Cricket Association (ACA) has imported two \"extremely lightweight\" pitch covers from the US. It already has around 20 covers at its disposal. \"These imported covers ensure that water or moisture does not seep into the pitch,\" ACA secretary Devajit Saikia had said. The stadium can accommodate around 39,000 people. Saikia also said additional measures are being planned for crowd management as the match schedule coincides with the Durga Puja days and Gandhi Jayanti. Earlier in the day, Indian cricketers Axar Patel and Umesh Yadav visited the famous Kamakhya Temple atop the Nilachal hill. They were escorted to the 'Shaktipeeth' under high security cover, officials said. Promoted Both posed for photographs with fans before returning to the hotel.

India suffered a big setback when their pace spearhead Bumrah was ruled out of their final preparatory series against South Africa due to stress fracture in his lower back. ‚ÄúWe are awaiting the official confirmation on the next steps. As of now, he‚Äôs officially ruled out of this (SA) series. But we will see what happens over the next few days,‚Äù Dravid told reporters on the eve of the second T20I against South Africa. Usually a stress fracture in the back takes about six months to heal completely but Dravid said they are still ‚Äúhopeful‚Äù. ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôve not gone deeply into the medical reports, I rely on the experts to tell me what it is. They ruled him out for this series and he‚Äôs being assessed. We will know in due course what happens in the future,‚Äù the 49-year-old said. ‚ÄúObviously till he‚Äôs completely ruled out, and we get an official confirmation that he‚Äôs ruled out, we will always be hopeful. We will always hope for the best just for us as a team and Jasprit as an individual.‚Äù Bumrah, who has been out of action since the India tour of England in July, had recently made a comeback during the home T20I series against Australia but the 28-year-old has been forced to head back to the National Cricket Academy for rehab again. Bumrah‚Äôs spate of injuries, despite his workload being carefully looked after by the think-tank, has become a matter of debate. Bumrah played all the 14 IPL matches for his franchise Mumbai Indians and since then he only featured in six Internationals in four months. Doing rehab at the NCA, Bumrah made a comeback in the preceding Australia series where he played two matches and travelled with the team to Thiruvananthapuram for the 1st T20I against South Africa only to be ruled out ahead of the game. ‚ÄúTo a large extent we manage to get everything. Not everything will be perfect. It happens, it‚Äôs part and parcel of the game, we are not the only team which suffers from injuries. ‚ÄúObviously if they happen closer to big tournaments they can upset your plans a little bit. Everyone is making good efforts to minimise the injuries as much as possible.‚Äù The workload management and their experiments in the build-up to the World Cup may have come in for a lot of criticism but Dravid chose to keep away from the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù. ‚ÄúI know there is a little bit of noise from the outside but in the group, communication has been very good and there‚Äôs clarity. It‚Äôs a bit unrealistic to expect us to keep playing the same guys over and over again, sometimes they are forced upon you ‚Äî like Bumrah. ‚ÄúWe played the same XI against South Africa in June if you remember, and people kept saying why don‚Äôt they change. But in the group we‚Äôre very sure of what we are doing. ‚ÄúSometimes, there are a lot of things people won‚Äôt know from outside, what are the niggles, how we are going to manage, how we are preparing for a Test when there‚Äôs a series in Ireland. It‚Äôs hard to just explain.‚Äù There has been a lot of debate on who is going to replace Bumrah if he is officially ruled out as only two weeks are left for their World Cup warm-up fixture against Australia. But Dravid said they are in their comfort zone, having got all the skill sets for different conditions and rival sides in Australia. ‚ÄúWe are quite comfortable that we have got all the skills that allow us to play different combinations and different kinds of XIs based on the wickets and oppositions. That‚Äôs really important in a World cup when you play in 4-5 different venues. ‚ÄúYou need to have that little bit of versatility and flexibility in your squad that allows you to change things. ‚ÄúOver the last few series, we probably have not been able to play that squad due to a variety of reasons. But most of the guys in the 15 now have had a pretty decent amount of cricket in the last six months.‚Äù Dravid said they have absolute clarity on the roles assigned to each of the players in the World Cup-bound squad. ‚ÄúWithin the group, within the team, we have been pretty clear about the kind of combinations we want, the kind of players that we are likely to play in the XI. You can‚Äôt pick an XI months in advance, you don‚Äôt know the wicket, and what it‚Äôs like. ‚ÄúWe have been pretty clear about the skills we want in the 15. For me, that is really important. The kind of squad we pick to the World cup, barring injuries, what were the skills that we are looking for, different kinds of bowlers, certain batting skills, we have been very clear about.‚Äù ¬† Happy with Harshal progress ================== Having returned to action after overcoming a rib injury, death overs specialist Harshal Patel has leaked runs in the series against Australia. But Dravid was happy with his progress. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very happy with the way he‚Äôs progressing. He bowled a phenomenal last over against Australia in Hyderabad. The more and more games he plays, the better for him. He‚Äôs really a mentally strong cricketer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe has been phenomenal for the franchise he plays in, even in international cricket he has played some good spells. He‚Äôs preparing really well, he‚Äôs practising really hard.‚Äù PTI","pubDate":"2022-10-01 15:17:57","image_url":"https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rahul-Dravid-300x214.jpg","source_id":"orissapost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Brett Lee: Great to play alongside Gayle, Harbhajan in Legends League Cricket","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/brett-lee-gayle-harbhajan-legends-league-cricket/article65959874.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        PTI  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"Lee, who will represent Manipal Tigers, had also played the inaugural edition in Oman‚Äôs capital city of Muscat.","content":"Former Australian fast bowling great Brett Lee is happy that he will have Chris Gayle and Harbhajan Singh for company in the ongoing Legends League Cricket (LLC).

Coming on the back of two consecutive losses, England registered a strong comeback in the sixth T20I at the Gaddafi Stadium last night. Opening batter Phil Salt thwacking 88* (41) at a strike rate of 214.63 in a 170-run chase had played a key role in England winning by 8 wickets with 33 balls to spare. With the match scheduled to bring an end to the penultimate series for both the teams before ICC T20 World Cup 2022, it is needless to say that both Pakistan and England would be keen to finish this series on a winning note. In its seven years of hosting T20Is, Gaddafi Stadium has hosted a total of 17 matches in this format.

The Men in Blue will start as the favorites on Sunday (October 2) as they have won their last three T20Is against the Proteas. Interestingly though, India have never won a T20I at this venue despite playing competing in two matches. While one of them was abandoned due to rain, Australia defeated India by eight wickets in the other fixture. Before the second T20I of the India vs South Africa series begins, here's a look at some vital stats you need to know from previous matches hosted by this stadium. T20I matches played: 2. Matches won by teams batting first: 0. Matches won by teams batting second: 1. Matches Tied: 0. Matches Abandoned: 1. Highest individual score: 62* - Moises Henriques (AUS) vs. India, 2017.

Highest successful run chase: 122/2 - Australia vs. India, 2017. Average 1st innings score: 118. In the only completed T20I match at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium, India lost to Australia by eight wickets. After being invited to bat first, the home team could only score 118 runs in their 20 overs. None of the Indian batters touched the 30-run mark. Chasing 119 for a win, Australia won the game in the 16th over itself thanks to a fifty from all-rounder Moises Henriques. Fast bowlers had a great night in Guwahati in that match as they picked up nine out of the 12 wickets that fell across both innings. The batters from the two teams hit a total of only seven sixes in the low-scoring encounter.

Jasprit Bumrah Invaluable The right-arm speedster is not only famous for Yorkers as he has got a lot of variety in his amour. The pacer knows how to fox the batters by bowling a surprise short ball and bowling off cutters and a lot of other deliveries. His 4 overs can decide the fate of the match as batters don‚Äôt usually try to attack him. Jasprit Bumrah. (Photo: Twitter) If Bumrah travels with the team for ICC T20 World Cup 2022 then it would be a huge boost. The bowler can help the likes of Arshdeep Singh & Harshal Patel as winning championships requires teamwork. We all have seen how destructive Bumrah can be and on Australian pitches, he would be a force to reckon with.

India suffered a big setback when their pace spearhead Bumrah was ruled out of their final preparatory series against South Africa due to stress fracture in his lower back. \"We are awaiting the official confirmation on the next steps. As of now, he's officially ruled out of this (SA) series. But we will see what happens over the next few days,\" Dravid told reporters on the eve of the second T20I against South Africa. Usually a stress fracture in the back takes about six months to heal completely but Dravid said they are still \"hopeful\". \"Honestly, I've not gone deeply into the medical reports, I rely on the experts to tell me what it is. They ruled him out for this series and he's being assessed. We will know in due course what happens in the future,\" the 49-year-old said. \"Obviously till he's completely ruled out, and we get an official confirmation that he's ruled out, we will always be hopeful. We will always hope for the best just for us as a team and Jasprit as an individual.\" Bumrah, who has been out of action since the India tour of England in July, had recently made a comeback during the home T20I series against Australia but the 28-year-old has been forced to head back to the National Cricket Academy for rehab again. Bumrah's spate of injuries, despite his workload being carefully looked after by the think-tank, has become a matter of debate. Bumrah played all the 14 IPL matches for his franchise Mumbai Indians and since then he only featured in six Internationals in four months. Doing rehab at the NCA, Bumrah made a comeback in the preceding Australia series where he played two matches and travelled with the team to Thiruvananthapuram for the 1st T20I against South Africa only to be ruled out ahead of the game. \"To a large extent we manage to get everything. Not everything will be perfect. It happens, it's part and parcel of the game, we are not the only team which suffers from injuries. \"Obviously if they happen closer to big tournaments they can upset your plans a little bit. Everyone is making good efforts to minimise the injuries as much as possible,\" Dravid defended their workload management. The former India skipper said it's normal to have injury issues and added they really work hard with their sports science team to manage the players' workloads. \"I don't think there is a team in the world which can say they don't have injuries at all. It's part of the game, you play the game a lot, you play it all the time, people will get injured, that's the nature of the sport,\" he said. There has been a lot of debate on who is going to replace Bumrah if he is officially ruled out as only two weeks are left for their World Cup warm-up fixture against Australia. But Dravid said they are in their comfort zone, having got all the skill sets for different conditions and rival sides in Australia. \"We are quite comfortable that we have got all the skills that allow us to play different combinations and different kinds of XIs based on the wickets and oppositions. That's really important in a World cup when you play in 4-5 different venues. \"You need to have that little bit of versatility and flexibility in your squad that allows you to change things. \"Over the last few series, we probably have not been able to play that squad due to a variety of reasons. But most of the guys in the 15 now have had a pretty decent amount of cricket in the last six months.\" Dravid said they have absolute clarity on the roles assigned to each of the players in the World Cup-bound squad. \"Within the group, within the team, we have been pretty clear about the kind of combinations we want, the kind of players that we are likely to play in the XI. You can't pick an XI months in advance, you don't know the wicket, and what it's like. \"We have been pretty clear about the skills we want in the 15. For me, that is really important. The kind of squad we pick to the World cup, barring injuries, what were the skills that we are looking for, different kinds of bowlers, certain batting skills, we have been very clear about.\"","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-01 13:40:40","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/10/2022_10$largeimg_1534146883.JPG","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India Legends vs Sri Lanka Legends Prediction- Who Will Win Road Safety World Series Final Between IN-L and SL-L, Road Safety World Series 2022 Final","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/india-legends-vs-sri-lanka-legends-prediction-who-will-win-road-safety-world-series-final-between-in-l-and-sl-l-road-safety-world-series-2022-final/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"India Legends vs Sri Lanka Legends Prediction- Who Will Win Road Safety World Series Final Between IN-L and SL-L, Road Safety World Series 2022 Final.

India won the first T20I by 8 wickets and South Africa would want to stage a comeback to level the series. Before all the action starts, here's everything you should know about the pitch and the venue. The pitch at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium is generally on the slower side. The ball doesn't come onto the bat as well as the batters would like it to and that makes stroke-play a little difficult. The bowlers who bowl tight lines and take the pace off their deliveries enjoy success here and the spinners will come into play as the pitch might offer turn and grip for them. Don't expect the match to be a run-fest and expect scores on the lower end of 150. A total of 5 matches have been played at this venue and teams batting first and chasing have won an equal amount of matches. The pitch is generally slow and remains the same throughout the game. The toss won't dictate the result of the match, but the skipper who wins the toss might want to bowl to have a target in mind. The venue last hosted an International game in 2020. The game was set to be played between India and Sri Lanka but was abandoned due to rain.
