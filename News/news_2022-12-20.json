Uganda has been untidy in the last couple of games and got away with murder but this time Tanzania held its nerve to pick up a deserved win. Uganda got off to a flyer with the bat Simon Ssesazi (35) taking 24 runs off the second over bowled by Riziki Kiseto and he found a partner in Kenneth Waiswa (16) whose cameo came off just 5 balls. However, the departure of the two started the collapse for Uganda who were bowled out for only 132 in 17.4 overs leaving a whole lot of 14 balls unused in their innings. In reply, Tanzania got stuck in quickly with Ivan Suleiman (29) the aggressor. Suleiman clipped the second over bowled by Cosmas Kyewuta for 14 to ease the pressure on Tanzania. The breakthrough came when Tanzania had taken off 45 runs from required and despite Joseph Baguma’s heroics with the ball to try and drag the game back for Uganda, Ally Kimote (18 not out) and Salum Jumbe (12 not out) ensured the result for Tanzania. The win was deserved for the Tanzanians who have come close in the last couple of games but were unable to close out the games. In the afternoon, Uganda won the toss and unlike in the past, they decided to bowl first. They back up this decision by cleaning up Rwanda cheaply for just 56. Henry Ssenyondo continued his good form with the ball in hand, picking up 3/14 in 4 overs. Kenneth Waiswa (35 not out) came out with a blazing bat to knock off the required inside 6 overs for Uganda to finish in quick time. The win means Uganda will need at least two wins to be able to win the Tri-Nation. They will be in action tomorrow against Rwanda in the afternoon.","pubDate":"2022-12-19 20:48:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"kawowo","country":["uganda"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jammu Sports defeat IFCR J&K warriors by 9 runs","link":"https://thenorthlines.com/jammu-sports-defeat-ifcr-jk-warriors-by-9-runs/","keywords":["Jammu","Jammu Kashmir","Sports"],"creator":["Northlines"],"video_url":null,"description":"NL Correspondent Jammu, Dec 19: Jammu Sports veterans defeated International Fellowship of Cricket loving Rotarians (IFCR) J&K Warriors by 9 runs in the first match of the friendship cup series being played at M A Stadium Jammu.

He took 2 wickets in the first innings. He has taken a total of 7 wickets in this match. He played for England in the U-19 World Cup series held in January 2022. In this context, the 18-year-old has shown a stunning performance in his debut Test match. With this, he has created the record of being the youngest bowler to take 5 wickets in a single innings in a debut match in men’s Test cricket. A right-arm leg-break bowler, he has played in England’s domestic T20, first-class and List A competitions. His father Naeem Ahmed and two brothers are cricketers. His father was born and raised in Pakistan and moved to England. Ahmed has been included in England’s playing XI for the ongoing third Test in Karachi. In the second innings, Pakistan captain Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan took the wickets of 5 batsmen. In this match, Pakistan scored 304 and 216 runs in the first and second innings. England scored 354 runs in the first innings. The team is chasing the target of victory if they score 167 runs in the second innings. At the end of the third day’s play, the team scored 112 runs for the loss of 2 wickets. If they score 55 more runs, the team will win. The Ben Stokes-led England team has won the three-match series by taking a 2-0 lead. Now the England team is almost close to victory in the third match. If they win this, the England team will whitewash the Pakistan team 3-0 on their own soil and will be amazing.

This does not mean that they have to go for five days. Test matches that finish in the final hour of day five are great. This does not mean that the only good Test matches finish in the final hour of day five.

After winning the initial two tests, the English team is on the front seat to beat Pakistan in Karachi as well. England’s spinner Rehan Ahmed broke a world record in the process. On the 3rd day of the 3rd test match. England managed to restrict Pakistan to just 216 runs in their 2nd innings. England took a lead of 50 runs in the 1st innings, and they just have to make 167 runs in the last innings in order to complete a white-wash. The side will aim to score a chunk of runs on day 3 only. The day belonged to English spinner Rehan Ahmed, who took a fifer and became the youngest debutant in the history of test cricket to take a fifer. Rehan (18y 128d) broke the record of Australian test captain Pat Cummins (18y 196d). He took the wicket of Agha Salman to complete the milestone. Michael Vaughan tweets on Rehan Ahmed dad Rehan Ahmed’s father was in tears after his son took a fifer in Karachi, and former English batter Michael Vaughan was quick to point out the same. He has applauded Rehan Ahmed’s achievement of becoming the youngest debutant to take a test fifer, and he said that dreams do become true. “5 on debut at 18 !! Tears for the old boy in the stand .. Dreams really do come true .. absolutely brilliant,” Michael Vaughan tweeted. 5 on debut at 18 !! Tears for the old boy in the stand .. Dreams really do come true .. absolutely brilliant @RehanAhmed__16 #PAKvsENG — Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) December 19, 2022 Rehan is also the youngest test debutant for England, interestingly he is a Pakistan-origin boy. His father, Naeem Ahmed was from Mirpur in Pakistan and has also played professional cricket in Pakistan. It must be a different feeling for Naeem to see his son taking a fifer against his birth country. As Adil Rashid is not playing red-ball cricket for England, it is a great find for the English team to get a leg-spinner playing the test format of the game. Looking at the attacking approach of Brendon McCullum, Rehan can certainly thrive in this atmosphere.

Opening the batting with Adam Lyth (10) in a 173-run chase, du Plessis scored 32 (16) with the help of three fours and as many sixes at a strike rate of 200 to provide his team with a head-start tonight. First batter to get out in his attempt to continue with a boundary-hitting spree, du Plessis’ dismissal brought an end to a 24-ball 44-run opening stand. Playing only his third T20, Hurricanes spinner Patrick Dooley picked only his second T20 wicket in the form of du Plessis. Having played three dot balls in a row, a seemingly annoyed du Plessis looked to make room for himself only to completely miss the ball and get bowled. Faf du Plessis cricket player hits Riley Meredith for one-handed boundary at Aurora Stadium An enterprising innings saw the 38-year old player hitting some eye-catching shots at the Aurora Stadium tonight. In what was du Plessis’ first boundary of the match, he stepped out to Hobart pacer Riley Meredith to flick a ball through the leg-side although with one hand coming off the bat. du Plessis, who followed his first four with a six on the next delivery, attacked Joel Paris in the following over. A 20-run over saw the right-handed batter hitting two fours and sixes each against the left-arm bowler.

While a victory for the visitors will be their second consecutive of this season, a loss for the hosts will be their second consecutive BBL 12 loss.

Though Bangladesh fought hard to delay the inevitable, thanks to their skipper Shakib Al Hasan's 84, others didn't last long as they were bowled out for 324 in 113.2 overs. For India, left-arm spinner Axar took four wickets in the fourth innings, while Kuldeep picked three scalps, followed by Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, and Ravichandran Ashwin taking a wicket each. The win also boosts India's prospect of reaching a second successive World Test Championship final, going past Sri Lanka to be third in the table with 55.77 points percentage. Resuming from 272/6, Mehidy Hasan Miraz began with a stylish cover drive off Mohammed Siraj for four, while Shakib slog-swept Axar for a six over deep square leg. Mehidy tried to go for a drive against Siraj on a slightly wide ball and ended up hitting straight to backward point. Shakib got his fifty in aggressive fashion, dancing down the pitch and lofting over long-on for six off Axar. When Siraj tried to bounce him out, Shakib pulled him twice over long-on and fine leg for two fours and six respectively. After dancing down the pitch to smack Axar over cow corner for six, Shakib swept hard against Kuldeep through mid-wicket. But on the last ball of the over, India finally ended Shakib's blitzkrieg at 84 as Kuldeep got one to go past the attempted sweep and hit top of middle stump. Kuldeep had another wicket when Ebadot Hossain flicked off leg-break straight to forward short leg, before Axar took out Taijul Islam's off stump to seal the big win for India. There were multiple heroes for India in the 188-run win, starting from fifties by Cheteshwar Pujara, Shreyas Iyer and Ashwin, along with Kuldeep's 40 taking the first innings total to 404 after being 48/3 at one point. Siraj burst through Bangladesh top-order in the first innings, while Kuldeep took a five-for to bowl them out for 150. With a massive 254-run lead, India chose not to follow-on and batted again, with Pujara and Shubman Gill notching up respective centuries to give Bangladesh a target of 513. Chasing a mammoth total, Bangladesh's openers had a 124-run stand with debutant Zakir Hasan registering his maiden Test century. But India's bowlers, who had to toil hard on a slow-turning track which had some turn and bounce, fought back post lunch on day four to seal the victory. Bangladesh and India will now play the second and final Test of the series from December 22-26 at the Sher-E-Bangla National Cricket Stadium, in Mirpur, Dhaka. Brief Scores: India 404 in 133.5 overs and 258/2 declared in 61.4 overs beat Bangladesh 150 in 55.5 overs and 324 in 113.2 overs (Zakir Hasan 100, Shakib Al Hasan 84; Axar Patel 4/77, Kuldeep Yadav 3/73) by 188 runs.

With the ODI World Cup in India next year, these series will be quite vital for the Blackcaps. However, the duo of Kane Williamson and Tim Southee will be travelling to India for the 3-match ODI series. New Zealand have taken this decision to manage the workload of players as both Williamson and Southee will be preparing for the home test series against England later on. Tom Latham will be leading the New Zealand team in India, and Henry Shipley has got his maiden call-up.

As per a report in Cricbuzz, Rohit, who has missed the first Test in Chattogram after sustaining a thumb injury during the second ODI against Bangladesh, will no longer be travelling to Dhaka. With Rohit not traveling to Dhaka, vice-captain KL Rahul will continue to lead India in the second and final Test of the series which India is currently leading by 1-0, after winning the first Test at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram by 188 runs. The report says news of Rohit’s unavailability emerged on Monday (December 19) after it was found that the skipper’s thumb has not fully healed and is suffering from a little bit of stiffness. “Considering the important assignments ahead for the Indian team, the BCCI, the selection committee and the team management have decided not to risk him at this stage,” added the report. After India’s tour of Bangladesh, they will be kickstarting their home season against Sri Lanka, comprising three T20Is and as many ODIs, starting from January 3, 2023, in Mumbai. “It is learnt that Rohit, currently in Mumbai, would have managed to bat through the Test but concerns remained over the risk involved while fielding. The medical team and the team management felt that injury could get serious on the field if he gets hurt again on that thumb,” further said the report. Rohit had injured his left thumb while fielding in the second ODI against Bangladesh and had to fly back home to Mumbai to see a specialist for treating the injury. With him now not available for the Dhaka Test, India have avoided a major selection headache. In the Chattogram Test victory, Shubman Gill had scored his maiden Test hundred in the second innings, while Rahul, the stand-in captain and Rohit’s deputy, had a quiet game with the bat. If Rohit was available for Dhaka Test, it would have been a huge dilemma for the team management on dropping either Rahul or Gill. “About Rohit, I think we will get to know in the next day or two. Even I am not even aware of it. The focus was completely on the Test match,” Rahul had said in the post-match press conference on Sunday.","pubDate":"2022-12-19 07:30:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Most runs in a Test series: Most runs in 3 match Test series","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-most-runs-in-a-test-series-most-runs-in-3-match-test-series/","keywords":["Cricket","England","England tour of Pakistan 2022","Harry Brook","Pakistan"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan and England are playing the 3rd test of the 3-match test series at the National Stadium in Karachi.

The series is already decided as England have already won the initial two tests, and this series has given England a new star in Harry Brooks. Ahead of the tour, Brooks played just a single test in his career, but he made a name for himself in Pakistan. He got his chances in the absence of Jonny Bairstow, who is struggling with injury issues, and it is safe to say that he has taken his chance with both hands. Brooks is the highest run-scorer of the series so far, where he has scored 468 runs in 5 innings at 93.60 with the help of three centuries and one half-century. He still has one more inning to bat in the last match. Most runs in a Test series Legendary Australian batter Sir Donald Bradman has the record of scoring the most number of runs in a test series. In the 1930 Ashes in England, the legendary batter was on the song. He scored 974 runs in the series at 139.14 with the help of four centuries. 334 was his highest score in the series. The other batters in the top-5 list of the same are England’s Wally Hammond (905 runs at 113.12 in Ashes 1928-29), Australia’s Mark Taylor (839 runs at 83.90 in Ashes 1989), Australia’s Robert Harvey (834 runs at 92.66 vs South Africa in 1952-53) and West Indies’ Sir Vivian Richards (829 runs at 118.42 against England in 1976). Most runs in 3 match Test series England’s Graham Gooch has scored the most number of test runs in a 3-match series, where he scored 752 runs with the help of 3 centuries and 2 half-centuries against India in 1990. Apart from him, Brian Lara, Mohammad Yusuf, Virat Kohli and David Warner are the other names in the top-5 list. Out of these 5, Kohli and Warner are still active in test cricket.

The team is already now preparing for the Boxing Day test in Melbourne. The pacers of the Australian side were on fire in the last match where the likes of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Scott Boland all bowled really well in the match. Josh Hazlewood missed the first match, and he is also pushing to make his comeback in the Melbourne test. George Bailey has said that the Australian team will require a lot more pacers going forwards, and apart from the mentioned names, Jhye Richardson and Michael Neser are also in the test setup. George Bailey puts Scott Boland’s Boxing Day Test spot in doubt The Brisbane test got ended in just a couple of days, and the Australian team have some extra days to work on their playing 11 for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. However, apart from one position, the rest of the ten names are almost confirmed. Josh Hazlewood missed the last test, but he is in line to make his comeback for the Melbourne test. Hazlewood missed the last match due to injury, but he is having some good net sessions. Scott Boland has delivered on every occasion he has got, so it will be interesting to see if he can retain his place if Hazlewood gets fit. It has been seen that Cummins, Hazlewood and Starc are the preferred three pacers of the side. George Bailey has also said that it is a good problem to have for the Australian side. Boland made his debut in the last MCG test only, and Bailey said that he has been excellent since then. Although, the fitness of Hazlewood will be looked at with keen interest. “Boland was on the radar for the MCG last year because of exactly what we’ve seen him do – he bashes a length, and his ability to take multiple wickets in the same over speaks to how consistent he is,” George Bailey said as quoted by cricket.com.au. “He’s going fantastically (but) Josh is recovering really well and had another really good hit out and is close to 90 percent I reckon. He’ll keep building and clearly we’ve got a decision to make, but it’s a good problem to have.”   The post “He’s going fantastically but Josh is recovering”: George Bailey puts Scott Boland’s Boxing Day Test spot in doubt as Josh Hazlewood return looms appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-12-19 06:02:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Skipper Williamson, head coach Stead to miss tour of India","link":"https://www.orissapost.com/skipper-williamson-head-coach-stead-to-miss-tour-of-india/","keywords":["Sports","Gary Stead","india tour","kane williamson"],"creator":["Post News Network"],"video_url":null,"description":"Wellington: New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson and head coach Gary Stead will miss the white-ball tour of India, starting next month, as part of their workload management.

New Zealand Cricket (NZC) have named split ODI squads for the away series against Pakistan, which begins January 10, and India, scheduled to start January 18. Newly-appointed Test captain Tim Southee will also return home after the Pakistan tour to prepare for the home Test series against England in February. In Wiliamson and Stead’s absence, Tom Latham will lead the Kiwis while batting coach Luke Ronchi will serve as the head coach in the three-match ODI series against India. Ronchi will also be in charge as the head coach for the T20 series in India, the squad for which will be announced January 9. He will be assisted by former New Zealand women coach Bob Carter and former spinner Paul Wiseman. All-rounder Mark Chapman and pacer Jacob Duffy will replace Williamson and Southee in the squad for the India tour. In-form pace bowling all-rounder Henry Shipley has been handed a maiden call-up after impressing in the domestic circuit. He has been named in both squads. The tall (1.96m) right-arm pacer and middle-order power batter was the leading wicket-taker in last season’s Super Smash. “Henry’s an exciting talent who we’ve had our eye on for a while,” New Zealand selector Gavin Larsen said. “He’s taken his game to another level in the past 12 months, and we’re delighted to see his progression given how valuable genuine all-rounders are in any cricket team,” he added. Legspinner Ish Sodhi and batter Henry Nicholls, who had been omitted from the squad for the home ODI series against India, have also been named in both squads. Meanwhile, pacer Kyle Jamieson still remains unavailable for selection as he recovers from a back injury. He last played for New Zealand in June. Larsen said the two ODI series will help prepare for the 50-over World Cup in India next year. “This is a great opportunity to take on two quality white-ball sides in sub-continental conditions. It’s going to be tough cricket against world-class opposition which should prove a real test of a player’s skill and temperament. “With the one-day World Cup less than a year away in India, it’s the perfect time to be playing these sides at home as we look to nail down our game plans, and understand the different situations and conditions we may encounter.” Squads: For India: Tom Latham (c), Finn Allen,Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway,Jacob Duffy, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Adam Milne, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Henry Shipley and Ish Sodhi.
