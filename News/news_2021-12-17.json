Marnus Labuschagne and David Warner both ground out 95s as Australia seized control of the second Ashes Test on Thursday , surviving an onslaught from veteran English seamers Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. The visitors came into the day-night Adelaide Test on the back of a nine-wicket mauling in Brisbane but confident they could get back into the five-match series.

Warner & Marnus put Aussies in control | 04:21 But even with the greatest wicket-takers in English history back in the side they struggled to make inroads with the pink ball as the home team compiled 221 for two by the close. It has Clarke urging Australia to come out of the blocks aggressive on Friday, declaring this is their “chance” to make a big statement on the world stage. “I think this is the difference between Australia over the last couple of years and where they sit now,” Clarke said on ‘The Big Sports Breakfast’ . “I hope Smithy, getting the opportunity to captain, is really strong on it. This Test match, now with the position they are in, if they bat well today England are out of the game. “This is where Australia has the chance to go: ‘We’re a different team, we’re not here to draw this Test match. We are going to destroy you England and win this Test match’. “If that means going into this second day and smacking a quick 100 and putting them back in with enough time to bowl them out, take that risk or send them back in if they don’t pass the follow-on.

LISTEN ON SPOTIFY OR SUBSCRIBE IN ITUNES “Don’t be worried about — we’ve got five Test matches, we’ve got to rest, we’ve got to be gentle, as long as we don’t lose — this is the Test match to change that attitude now because of the position they’re in. “Australia has the opportunity to destroy England right here. Make it loud and clear we are not here to win the series 3-0. We are going to smoke you here and we are going to smoke you in the next three as well. We want 5-0. “You’ve got to have a crack now. Under lights, brand new ball, 14 overs today... bang, England three down. Game over.” The tourists snared an early breakthrough on Thursday with Broad getting Marcus Harris for three, before Warner and Labuschagne put on 172 for the second wicket. Warner looked destined for his 25th Test century as he began to open his bat, but fell in the nervous 90s for the second Test in a row, caught by Broad off Ben Stokes. Labuschagne almost did the same, also on 95, when wicketkeeper Jos Buttler dropped a sitter off Anderson -- much to the delight of the crowd.

The former Australian captain said that the reaction of Buttler’s teammates was telling in just how crushing a blow the drop was. “You watch Joe Root in slip, you watch the rest of them around Buttler,” he said. “They were like: ‘Uh oh, we’ve got 37 degrees today, running into bowl on an absolute belter, chasing leather, we are in deep trouble’.” As Clarke mentioned, what will only make matters worse for England is the weather, with Adelaide tipped to hit a top of 37 degrees on Friday according to the Bureau of Meteorology. “If England thought it was tough today,” Australian cricket legend Brett Lee said on Fox Cricket on Thursday night. “They wake up tomorrow morning, open the blinds and it is 37 degrees.

He joins Josh Hazlewood (side strain) on the sidelines but Clarke warns England won’t get any reprieve from the replacements — Jhye Richardson and Michael Neser. “I know we haven’t got Hazlewood and Cummins,” he said. “It’s not going to make a difference because these two blokes that are coming in are very good bowlers.

A wave of new infections, driven by the new Omicron variant of coronavirus, suggested more postponements and cancellations will follow as sporting codes warily await the impact. The Premier League fixture list was thrown into chaos nL1N2T10YD as six games were postponed due to COVID outbreaks taking the total for the past week to nine but league officials intend to continue with the schedule where safely possible as new COVID-19 cases in Britain hit a record for the second day running on Thursday. The Premier League found a record 42 cases nL1N2SY19O of COVID-19 among players and staff at various clubs this week, leading Brentford manager Thomas Frank to suggest all this weekend’s games should be postponed as cases “are going through the roof”. With 13 new positive cases at his club, Frank told a news conference: \"To postpone this round would give everyone a week at least, or four or five days to clean and do everything at the training ground so everything is clean and you break the chain.\" Amid a multitude of postponements in England's lower leagues, the Football League (EFL) on Thursday ordered clubs to implement enhanced safety protocols for training, with social distancing and restrictions on the use of indoor facilities, manual therapy and group travel. LaLiga leaders Real Madrid were struck a blow when four more players tested positive nL1N2T121M on Thursday to add to Luka Modric and Marcelo, who had been forced into quarantine some 24 hours earlier. But Sunday’s home game against Cadiz is going ahead. Rugby’s European Champions Cup has also been hit with Montpellier’s game at home to Leinster the latest to be postponed over COVID cases in both squads, while Welsh club Ospreys suggested their trip to Racing 92 in Paris could also be off with at least seven positive cases in their camp. HOLIDAY SEASON Over the last three days, the National Football League, National Hockey League and National Basketball Association have faced a surge in positive tests, with more expected on Thursday, forcing players into league mandated COVID-19 protocols nL1N2T121U and the postponement of games. The holiday season across the United States and Canada is usually filled with sporting action but, with the coronavirus spreading through locker rooms, fans may not see all their favourite players. Australia captain Pat Cummins nL1N2T1010 had to miss the second Ashes cricket test, which started in Adelaide on Thursday, after a close contact with someone who tested positive for the virus. West Indies' tour of Pakistan was cut short nL1N2T11P6 after the number of positive COVID-19 cases in the touring party rose to nine. A third T20 international went ahead on Thursday but the three-match One Day International series to follow is now off. Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc said he was self-isolating nL1N2T1235 at home in Monaco after testing positive. The news came after Sunday’s conclusion of the Formula One season.

Kohli will still captain India in the Tests in South Africa but press reports suggested that he had decided to skip the subsequent ODI series in a huff. But Kohli denied this, telling reporters Wednesday that he “was and am available for selection” and hit out at sections of the media for “writing lies”. “Nothing can derail me from being motivated to play for India,” he said. “I am very focused and mentally prepared and very excited to go to South Africa and do the best that I can for my team. “I was always available.

We have seen that in the games that he captained for India and in the IPL as well,” Kohli said. India have never won a Test series in South Africa, but Kohli said the visitors were motivated by the fact that the last Test they played there, in Johannesburg in 2018, they won. “We probably won in the toughest conditions in that tour, so that should give us a lot of confidence that if we have the right mindset and we start out the series with a lot of confidence, we can definitely stand up to any challenge that comes our way,” Kohli said. “South Africa is one place where we have not won a series yet. We are very motivated to do that and the mindset is always (to) go out there and win a series in any country that we play. We don’t anymore just think of winning a Test match in India,” he added. This year India beat Australia 2-1 Down Under -- albeit in Kohli’s absence apart from the first Test -- and were 2-1 up in England before the tour was called off because of the pandemic.

After an action-packed players retention event before the IPL mega auction for the 15th season in 2022, the action now shifts towards the to-be debutant franchises of the lucrative tournament- Lucknow and Ahmedabad. As per the latest update, the two new franchises are supposed to draft in a total of 3 players (2 Indians, and 1 overseas) before December 25, 2021. While the imminent date is near for the draft ins, the existing franchises have also started with their respective brainstorming activity- to form the best possible squad around the core of retained players within the purse limit not exceeding the limit of INR 90 Crore. The defending and four-time IPL champions Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have reportedly, already laid their eyes on top Indian players as targets for inclusion in their IPL 2022 squad. IPL 2022 CSK team players list: MS Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings might target R Ashwin, Dhawan As per a recent report, the Chennai Super Kings think-tank have laid their eyes on experienced Indian mainstays in all rounder Ravichandran Ashwin and left-handed opener batter Shikhar Dhawan as targets they would most likely aim at during IPL 2022 mega auction. The other two names that they would possibly go for during the auctions are Tamil Nadu’s Washington Sundar and Shahrukh Khan. Ashwin and Dhawan were both a crucial part of their previous franchise- Delhi Capitals for the past three seasons when they managed to reach the playoffs. Both of them, however, couldn’t be part of the 4 players retained by the Capitals ahead of the 2022 auction. Dhawan was, in fact the leading run-scorer for the Capitals in IPL 2021 amassing a total of 587 runs across 16 innings at an average of 39.13. He has been a consistent performer for the Delhi side at the top of the batting order over the previous season as well. Delhi Capitals’ Shikhar Dhawan was the leading run-scorer at #IPL2021 before the tournament was postponed. pic.twitter.com/tDJlst7RF4 — ESPNcricinfo (@ESPNcricinfo) May 5, 2021 Ravichandran Ashwin, on the other hand has been in top-notch form off-late and has, on the back of some good performances in the IPL for the Capitals, earned his place back in the Indian T20I side after a 4-year wait. He has played under MS Dhoni in the CSK previously as well, and is huge name in Tamil Nadu Cricket in particular. The two other big names in the Tamil Nadu Cricket circuit- Washington Sundar and Shahrukh Khan could might well be great additions to the CSK contingent. Sundar, was ruled out of the UAE-leg of IPL 2021 due to injury and played only 6 matches for his franchise RCB in the recently concluded season. Shahrukh Khan, on the other hand, dominated the headlines when he won Tamil Nadu the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2021, hitting a maximum off the last delivery in the finals against Karnataka with 5 runs required off 1 ball. He has time and again proved his worth, playing his role as a pinch hitter down the order; be it for Punjab Kings in the IPL or Tamil Nadu in the domestic circuit. Retained Chennai Super Kings Players 2022 CSK had retained the maximum permissible limit of 4 players before the mega auctions ahead of IPL 2022. All rounder Ravindra Jadeja took the first retention spot for INR 16 Crore with their charismatic skipper MS Dhoni (INR 12 Crore) taking the second spot. England Moeen Ali (INR 8 Crore) was the third and the only retained overseas player, with the young sensation Ruturaj Gaikwad (INR 6 Crore) completing the list as the fourth player.       The post IPL 2022 CSK team players list: MS Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings eyeing R Ashwin, Shikhar Dhawan and two others as initial picks in squad for IPL 2022 mega auction appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2021-12-16 15:49:50","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"England vow to come out fighting on day two after Buttler’s nightmare drop","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/16/england-ashes-second-test-come-out-fighting-day-two-jos-buttler-nightmare-drop","keywords":["Ashes 2021-22","England cricket team","Australia cricket team","The Ashes","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Simon Burnton"],"video_url":null,"description":"Wicketkeeper’s mistake reprieved Marnus Labuschagne on 95Graham Thorpe: ‘Jos will be hurt tonight, he’s a human being’England have promised to “fight hard” to turn the second Ashes Test in their favour after leaving the field at the end of the first day with memories still fresh of the inexplicable drop from Jos Buttler behind the stumps that reprieved Marnus Labuschagne.

Having started the day dealing with the absence of their captain, Pat Cummins having been ordered to self-isolate as a close contact of a confirmed Covid case, Australia ended it in a position of strength on 221 for two at the Adelaide Oval. “Jos is going to hurt tonight but he’s going to have to get out of bed and come again and enjoy his day tomorrow, because that’s what Test cricket’s all about,” said Graham Thorpe, England’s assistant coach. “Anyone who drops a catch is always disappointed. He’s a human being – it’s a bit like being a goalkeeper, you keep magnificently throughout the day but if you drop a catch it gets highlighted. We’ll get round him and try to be philosophical about it as well, because I think you have to be. At the end of the day you’re playing a game of cricket.” Labuschagne, who was on 95 at the time and did not add to his score before the close, was also dropped by Buttler when he was on 21, albeit from a harder chance. “I don’t know how that happened,” Labuschagne said of the second drop. “A bit of disbelief, but my job is to make sure I capitalise on that tomorrow.” England’s will be to ensure he does not, with the second new ball just nine overs old and still offering some movement. “It’s very important that we’re able to get in and make some inroads tomorrow,” Thorpe said. “We’re going to have to roll our sleeves up and show some fight.” As expected Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad returned to the side, and with Jack Leach missing out England bowled 78 overs of right-arm seam, with only Joe Root’s off-spin providing a significant change. “I thought we picked the right team for this match and on another day we could have grazed the edge more and it could have been different,” Thorpe said. “They may all be right-arm bowlers but for me they’ve all got a slightly different style about them. We stuck at it well but we didn’t quite get the rub today – if we’d bowled poorly we’d have gone for a lot more. It’s not about feeling sorry for ourselves when we come in tomorrow, it’s about trying to do very similar things.” David Warner, whose participation in the match had been in doubt because of a rib injury, played with the aid of local anaesthetic and painkillers and made 95 – the second time in as many games he has been dismissed in the 90s, and precisely the same number of runs he scored in the entire series in England in 2019. “The last couple of days I was in a bit of pain, a bit of agony, not being able to pick up the kids, which is a bit tough,” he said. “It doesn’t feel great but I had a Test match to play and there’s a series on the line. The difference [since 2019] is that the length they’ve bowled here isn’t hitting the stumps. The length there is hitting the stumps in England, and that’s the difference.” Having won the toss and chosen to bat first, the absence of Cummins, who was in a restaurant on Wednesday night on an adjacent table to someone who has tested positive, has not yet been felt. “The rules for us are three players can be at a venue. We have to check in with each other to see what restaurants everyone’s going to,” Warner said. “You can’t help what happened with Patty, unfortunately he was in a spot where somebody had tested positive that day. He probably won’t be the last. It’s just being smart, isn’t it? Don’t go where you think restaurants are going to be jam-packed. Thankfully it’s a day-night game and we don’t have to worry about that now.”","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a89f5aa600bdb1bca841a80d14eaec3fd668bd1b/0_91_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5a1c5d35cdbe25840c61837a11745a68","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Mohammad Hasnain Iftikhar Ahmed drop catch: Pakistani duo emulate Shoaib Malik-Saeed Ajmal hilarious drop catch in Karachi T20I","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-mohammad-hasnain-iftikhar-ahmed-drop-catch-pakistani-duo-emulate-shoaib-malik-saeed-ajmal-hilarious-drop-catch-in-karachi-t20i/","keywords":["Cricket","Videos","Iftikhar Ahmed","Mohammad Hasnain","Pakistan","Saeed Ajmal","Shoaib Malik","West Indies","West Indies tour of Pakistan 2021"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mohammad Hasnain Iftikhar Ahmed drop catch: The Pakistani pair became victim of a hilarious confusion while calling for a catch.

During the third T20I of the ongoing West Indies’ tour of Pakistan in Karachi, Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Hasnain and batter Iftikhar Ahmed teamed up to drop what should have been a straightforward catch to dismiss West Indies batter Shamarh Brooks. It all happened on the second delivery of the eighth over when Brooks danced down the track to hit Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz between long-on and deep mid-wicket. With the batter not timing the ball as well as he would’ve liked, Hasnain and Ahmed had a chance of dismissing the second West Indian batter tonight. Running towards his right from long-on, Hasnain was the one who called for the catch but ended up getting distracted to the extent that he didn’t even try to catch the ball. Running towards the ball from deep mid-wicket, Ahmed was also interested in grabbing the ball but eventually decided against it thinking that Hasnain would do the same. What followed was Hasnain and Ahmed recreating a hilariously epic drop by Shoaib Malik and Saeed Ajmal against the same opposition back in the day. Brooks, who was batting at 27* at this point in time, ended up scoring 49 (31) with the help of two fours and four sixes. Winning the toss and electing to bat first, West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran scored his fourth T20I half-century to power his team to 207/3 in 20 overs. Pick of the West Indian batters at the National Stadium tonight, Pooran contributed with 64 (37) including two fours and six sixes. In the combined four overs which Hasnain and Ahmed bowled in the first innings, they leaked as many as 64 runs between them as Mohammad Wasim and Shahnawaz Dhani were the only wicket-takers for the hosts picking two and one wicket respectively.

England recalled the veteran seam duo of James Anderson and Stuart Broad while sacrificing the express speed of Mark Wood and spinner Jack Leach as they seek to level the five-test series after their comprehensive defeat in Brisbane. They dominated the first session of the pink-ball contest before David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne rebuilt Australia, who ended the day on a strong 221-2. \"We picked the right team for this match,\" Thorpe said. \"On another day, we could have grazed the edge more. I thought they played very well.\" \"There was a bit of a rub of the green but they played well.\" It had been a good toss for Australia to win, he said. \"I thought we stuck at it well. They played particularly well in those first few sessions. The run-rate didn’t go too far but we'd love to have more wickets down. They defended straight and every time we went fuller they punched us down the ground.\" Jos Buttler took a stunning catch to dismiss Marcus Harris but spilled Labuschagne twice. Thorpe was sympathetic to the wicket-keeper. \"We put a couple of catches down. Jos is going to hurt tonight but we are going to have to come again tomorrow,\" he said. England were fined their entire match fee and docked five World Test Championship points for maintaining a slow over-rate at the Gabba and it was an issue again at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday. \"There are bigger things in the world, you get through as quick as you can,\" Thorpe said. \"Reviews take time and batters sometimes aren’t ready. In an ideal world, you’d like more overs with a newer ball. We've got to make inroads early. We’re going to have to fight hard.\" Australia dominated the opening day but Thorpe expected England to strike back on day two. \"I don’t think our plans were too bad. If we'd bowled poorly, we’d have gone for more runs. \"It’s very important we get in and make inroads tomorrow. It’s for us to roll our sleeves up and get stuck in.\" (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty and Toby Davis)","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/12/16/1409375.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my"},{"title":"Pakistan vs West Indies ODI Series Postponed Over Covid Cases","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/pakistan-vs-west-indies-odi-series-postponed-over-covid-cases-2655306","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"\"The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Cricket West Indies (CWI) have issued a joint statement after five more positive cases were reported in the West Indies camp following Wednesdays PCR testing,...","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-16 14:50:07","full_description":"The Pakistan vs West Indies three-match ODI series has been postponed due to five more positive cases in the visiting camp, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Cricket West Indies (CWI) said in a joint statement on Thursday. \"The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Cricket West Indies (CWI) have issued a joint statement after five more positive cases were reported in the West Indies camp following Wednesday's PCR testing, raising the total number of positive cases to nine since their arrival in Karachi on December 9,\" the release said.

Vice-captain Smith was shoehorned into the skipper's role after Pat Cummins was ruled out hours before the match after being deemed a close contact of a COVID-19 case. Smith became Australia's third captain in three tests following Tim Paine's resignation over a 'sexting' scandal in the lead-up to the series. Smith was suspended from international and most domestic cricket for 12 months and also banned from leadership roles in the Australian set-up for two years for his involvement in the 2018 ball-tampering scandal against South Africa in Newlands. The leadership ban expired in March 2020. The 32-year-old endured anxious moments after winning the toss and electing to bat as England dominated the morning session before David Warner (95) and Marnus Labuschagne wrested the initiative back with their nervy but determined 172-run second-wicket stand. Labuschagne was batting on 95 at stumps, while Smith himself was on 18 with another partnership blooming. Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley said elevating Smith was an easy decision. \"Steve served his ban in full and by his own admission has grown a lot as a person,\" Hockley said. \"The national selection panel and the board, we felt he had demonstrated that he was absolutely fit to hold a leadership position again. He is the best person to step in in this eventuality.\" For Australia, pace bowler Michael Neser made his test debut replacing Cummins. Smith's bigger challenge as captain of the side would be to get the best of a pace attack depleted by the absence of Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, who missed the match with a side strain sustained during their victory in the Brisbane opener.

Rizwan will join Sussex following Australia's tour of Pakistan that concludes in early April. He will then be available in both Championship and T20 cricket until the end of the Vitality Blast in mid-July. As well as being regarded as one of the most accomplished 'keepers in the world, the 29-year-old from Peshawar also has a formidable batting record in all formats. In first-class cricket, Mohammad averages over 43 with the bat, including nearly 1,000 runs in 19 Test matches at an average of over 42. He enjoyed significant success in English conditions during Pakistan's three-match Test series in 2020, averaging over 40, being named Pakistan's player of the series and being described by Nasser Hussain as \"the best for a long, long time\" when it came to touring wicketkeepers. In 54 T20Is, Mohammad averages a stunning 50.06 with the bat at a strike-rate of 126.6. He has enjoyed a stellar 2021, becoming the first batter to score over a thousand T20I runs in a calendar year and surpassed Chris Gayle's six-year-old record for the most T20 runs scored in a calendar year. He was also the third-highest run-scorer in the recent ICC Men's T20 World Cup, scoring 281 runs in six innings as Pakistan made it to the semi-finals, and is now ranked by the ICC as the world's fourth-best batter in men's T20Is. Promoted Mohammad was full of positivity after signing for Sussex, sending this message to the club's supporters: \"Dear Sussex Family. I am absolutely honoured and excited to be a part of the historic Sussex County Cricket Club for the 2022 season. I have always heard great things about the Sussex community and this family club was always close to my heart.\" \"In my heart, I know our young team has the potential to beat any team. Our strength lies in our hard work, honesty, deep commitment, and self-belief: we can win, we will win, and we will play like champions, no matter what!

Individual Test half-centuries from Marnus Labuschagne (95*) and David Warner (95) formed highlights on Day 1 which ended up being dull despite the presence of some eye-catching moments. In addition to debatable bowling changes and fielding dismissals, what hurt England the most was wicket-keeper Jos Buttler dropping Labuschagne not once but twice. While Buttler commenced his day with a stunning one-handed catch to dismiss Australia opening batter Marcus Harris (3) in the eighth over, it all went downhill for the experienced campaigner form thereon. “Everyone thinks it’s the hands that get you the catch, it’s not, it’s your footwork” “There were a couple of takes where he had a dive, that’s lazy wicketkeeping.

We preview and predict all 44 remaining games.Forty-plus names, games, teams and minutiae making news this bloated bowl season:WELCOME TO BOWL SEASON. LET’S HOPE IT’S ABOVE AVERAGEWe are approaching the 120th anniversary of the first bowl game: the 1902 Rose Bowl, a 49–0 Michigan rout of Stanford. Unlike in recent decades, that game assuredly was not timed around the sunset over the San Gabriel Mountains; there were no stadium lights back then, so playing the fourth quarter after dark would have been inadvisable.Thousands of bowl games have been played since then, many of them memorable but most of them fleeting in impact. We said quick hellos and goodbyes to the Bacardi Bowl in Cuba (seven iterations between 1907 and ’46); the Poinsettia Bowl (’05–’16, when San Diego ambitiously tried to be a two-bowl town); and the Great Lakes Bowl (a one-and-done in ’47, after the idea of December bowl games in Cleveland shockingly didn’t take root). Pierre Aguirre/USA TODAY Sports In examining this mountain of bowl history, it’s easy to find nominees for Greatest Bowl Ever (Texas 41, USC 39 in the ’06 Rose Bowl leaps to mind) and Worst Bowl Ever (Oregon State 3, Pittsburgh 0 in the ’08 Sun Bowl presents a dismally strong case). But what about the Most Average Bowl Ever? The Dash is at your service, doing the important research others wouldn’t dare undertake.The winner: the 1973 Liberty Bowl. It is the not-great, not-terrible standard by which all other average bowl games should be judged. North Carolina State, coached by Lou Holtz, defeated Kansas, 31–18. It matched a pair of moderately successful teams in a more selective bowl era—the Wolfpack were 8–3, the Jayhawks were 7-3-1. It was a competitive game into the second half, but not close at the end. There was a brief flare of controversy over a muffed Kansas punt in the third quarter. The game MVP rushed for 83 yards. Two weeks later, Notre Dame defeated Alabama 24–23 in the Sugar Bowl to win the national title, a slightly more memorable game.In previewing and predicting this year’s slate of matchups—The Dash is never responsible if you use these picks in your bowl pool and finish last—let’s apply the 1973 Liberty Bowl Epitome of Average Yardstick to every game.Bowl Watchability Rankings: One Reason to Tune in to Each Matchup BAHAMAS BOWL (1)When: Dec. 17, noon ETWhere: The BahamasWho: Middle Tennessee (6–6) vs. Toledo (7–5).Middle Tennessee season in a sentence: After winning a total of seven games the previous two years, a modest flutter of revival in Murfreesboro.Toledo season in a sentence: A massive disappointment was salvaged somewhat by a closing three-game winning streak to become Caribbean-bound.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Assuredly worse, but with better weather. And it is nice of ESPN to tempt us into an early start to the weekend with a noon Friday kickoff to the first bowl.Line (according to SI Sportsbook): Toledo by 10Dash pick: Toledo 41, Middle Tennessee 28. Interesting tension here between a team that never turns the ball over (the Rockets have the fewest giveaways in the nation with six) and a team that often forces turnovers (the Blue Raiders are first nationally in takeaways with 31). Dual-threat Toledo quarterback Dequan Finn should be the difference maker here.TAILGREETER CURE BOWL (2)When: Dec. 17, 6 p.m.Where: OrlandoWho: Northern Illinois (9–4) vs. Coastal Carolina (10–2) Northern Illinois season in a sentence: The heart-attack Huskies kept winning the close ones, going 7–2 in one-score games on their way to the MAC title.Coastal Carolina season in a sentence: With a pair of close Sun Belt losses, the Chanticleers couldn’t replicate last year’s magic, but this remains the nascent program’s Golden Era.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better. Two good teams.Line: Coastal Carolina by 9.5 Dash pick: Coastal Carolina 48, Northern Illinois 34. The key stat here: Coastal is second in the nation in yards per play at 7.63. NIU is 120th nationally in yards allowed per play at 6.69. Quarterback Grayson McCall could have a huge day against the Huskies defense, and in the process break Mac Jones’s single-season FBS pass efficiency record.ROOFCLAIM.COM BOCA RATON BOWL (3)When: Dec. 18, 11 a.m.Where: Boca Raton, Fla. Who: Western Kentucky (8–5) vs. Appalachian State (10–3).WKU season in a sentence: The raiding of FCS Houston Baptist for its quarterback (Bailey Zappe), top receiver (Jerreth Sterns) and offensive coordinator (Zach Kittley) paid record-setting offensive dividends.App State season in a sentence: Other than two trips to Lafayette, La. and a narrow loss to Miami, everything was beautiful for the Mountaineers.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. Nobody really needs an 11 a.m. ET bowl kickoff.Line: Appalachian State by 3Dash pick: Appalachian State 45, Western Kentucky 38. One team is playing touch football, the other is playing tackle—take the one with the more physical running game. There is no stopping the Hilltoppers’ passing attack, but the App State defense has allowed just 11 points per game over its last five. Deion Sanders's Tigers have only lost one game, to FBS Louisiana-Monroe.David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated CRICKET CELEBRATION BOWL (4)When: Dec. 18, noon. Where: Atlanta Who: South Carolina State (6–5) vs. Jackson State (11–1)South Carolina State season in a sentence: The Bulldogs won five of their last six, with a three-point win at North Carolina Central keying their MEAC championship and first Celebration Bowl berth.Jackson State season in a sentence: Never dull under Deion Sanders, the Tigers rolled through the SWAC undefeated and never allowed more than 21 points in a game.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse game, better bands. Line: Jackson State by 10 Dash pick: Jackson State 21, South Carolina State 10. Sanders has spent some time in recent weeks chasing FBS jobs (TCU, Colorado State) but he clearly has the better team here. His son, Shedeur, is a major quarterback talent.Deion Sanders, Jackson State Land Nation's No. 1 RecruitPUBG MOBILE NEW MEXICO BOWL (5)When: Dec. 18, 2:15 p.m.Where: Albuquerque, N.M.Who: UTEP (7–5) vs. Fresno State (9–3).UTEP season in a sentence: A 6–1 start launched the Miners to their first bowl bid in seven seasons, validating Dana Dimel as a good coach for bad jobs.Fresno State season in a sentence: Beating UCLA in the Rose Bowl and winning nine games reestablished the program in the upper echelon of the Mountain West—while also launching coach Kalen DeBoer to Washington.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. Despite the Mexican food.Line: Fresno State by 11Dash pick: Fresno State 47, UTEP 34. The Miners are a feel-good story and should have a home-crowd advantage, since ABQ is a reasonable drive from El Paso. But unless some of those fans can rush Bulldogs quarterback Jake Haener (3,810 yards passing) or cover his receivers, this will be a tough afternoon for a suspect UTEP defense.RADIANCE TECHNOLOGIES INDEPENDENCE BOWL (6)When: Dec. 18, 3:30 p.m. Where: Shreveport, La.Who: UAB (8–4) vs. BYU (10–2) UAB season in a sentence: Missed the Conference USA title game for the first time since 2017, but still recorded a fifth-straight winning record since being forced into near-extinction.BYU season in a sentence: Unofficial Pac-12 champion recorded its second straight year of double-digit victories and retained coach Kalani Sitake.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Slightly better, despite being played in Shreveport.Line: BYU by 7Dash pick: BYU 31, UAB 20. This should be a run-heavy game, with the Blazers running on 64% of their plays this season and the Cougars 55%. BYU has played the superior schedule and deserved a better bowl and opponent than this. Also: As you may have discerned by now, The Dash is fading Conference USA. LENDINGTREE BOWL (7)When: Dec. 18, 5:45 p.m.Where: Mobile, Ala.Who: Eastern Michigan (7–5) vs. Liberty (7–5)Eastern Michigan season in a sentence: Living on the edge, with six out of eight MAC matchups being one-score games and a pair of them one-point victories.Liberty season in a sentence: First half was fine, second half stank.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Markedly worse, despite the verbal similarities between Liberty and LendingTree.Line: Liberty by 9.5.Dash pick: Liberty 35, Eastern Michigan 21. The Flames have the best player in the game in quarterback Malik Willis, who should be motivated to put some good things on tape for NFL scouts after a rocky latter half of the season. He should have his way running and passing against a defense surrendering 6.11 yards per play.JIMMY KIMMEL L.A. BOWL PRESENTED BY STIFEL (8)When: Dec. 18, 7:30 p.m.Where: Los Angeles Who: Utah State (10–3) vs. Oregon State (7–5).Utah State season in a sentence: A remarkable reset in its first year under Blake Anderson, who brought his quarterback with him from Arkansas State and won the Mountain West for the first time.Oregon State season in a sentence: Bowling for the first time since 2013 as fourth-year coach Jonathan Smith’s methodical program-building takes root.Line: Oregon State by 7.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Slightly worse, despite the celebrity tie-in and the bowl’s mascot, Jimmy Camel, a vomiting camel.Dash pick: Utah State 28, Oregon State 27. The Aggies have to slow down the Oregon State running game, and they showed some newfound proficiency in that area while routing San Diego State in the MWC title game. Undersized Utah State receiver Deven Thompkins has blossomed since the coaching change, averaging 16.6 yards per touch and helping USU lead the nation in scrimmage plays of 40 yards or longer (24).R+L CARRIERS NEW ORLEANS BOWL (9)When: Dec. 18, 9:15 p.m. Where: New Orleans Who: Louisiana (12–1) vs. Marshall (7–5). Louisiana’s season in a sentence: After being upset by Texas in the opener (true statement, in retrospect), it’s been a dream that ends with the inevitable departure of coach Billy Napier.Marshall’s season in a sentence: Zero victories over FBS teams with winning records.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse, but with beads and better food.Line: Louisiana by 5Dash pick: Louisiana 30, Marshall 23. Dicey spot for the Ragin’ Cajuns after losing Napier to Florida, and the secondary could be tested by the Thundering Herd’s Grant Wells. But promoting Michael Desormeaux from within and a strong senior class should help maintain continuity and focus on finishing out a great season on a high note. MYRTLE BEACH BOWL PRESENTED BY TAXACT (10)When: Dec. 20, 2:30 p.m.Where: Conway, S.C.Who: Old Dominion (6–6) vs. Tulsa (6–6) Old Dominion’s season in a sentence: Didn’t see this coming after a 1–6 start.Tulsa’s season in a sentence: Two bad months, followed by a very good November that was about a foot short in Nippert Stadium of an epic month.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Substantially worse.Line: Tulsa by 9Dash pick: Tulsa 31, Old Dominion 28. Operation Fade C-USA takes a brief respite here due to a trap-ish spread. Five of the Golden Hurricane’s six wins are by seven points or fewer, and the Monarchs are a hot team. ODU has forced 10 turnovers in its last four games, and Tulsa is one of the most turnover-prone teams in the nation with 24 giveaways. FAMOUS IDAHO POTATO BOWL (11)When: Dec. 21, 3:30 p.m.Where: Boise, Idaho Who: Kent State (7–6) vs. Wyoming (6–6). Kent State season in a sentence: Many points scored, many points surrendered.Wyoming season in a sentence: Blowing out eventual Mountain West champion Utah State on the road one week, being blown out at home by Hawai’i the next—that’s how you get to 6–6.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse by several light years.Line: Wyoming by 3Dash pick: Wyoming 41, Kent State 37. This is a tortoise-and-hare tempo matchup, with the Cowboys methodically grinding their way to 10 fewer offensive snaps per game. But they shouldn’t need many plays to score on the Golden Flashes, who have given up more than 40 points in five of their last seven games. As many Pokes fans as can free themselves up for a Tuesday afternoon game should make the relatively short trip to Boise and turn this into a Wyoming home game.TROPICAL SMOOTHIE CAFE FRISCO BOWL (12)When: Dec. 21, 7:30 p.m.Where: Frisco, Texas Who: UTSA (12–1) vs. San Diego State (11–2).UTSA season in a sentence: Best in school history, paving the way for a leap to the American Athletic Conference.San Diego State season in a sentence: A lot of accumulated mileage, both commuting to “home” games in Carson and in Matt Araiza punts.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better. This is the best matchup of all the pre-Christmas bowls.Line: UTSA by 2.5Dash pick: UTSA 24, San Diego State 21. Is Brady Hoke having a 2008 experience all over again? That year he guided Ball State to a 12–0 record, then was surprisingly routed in the conference title game. The Cardinals subsequently dropped their bowl game as well, after Hoke had departed for San Diego State Tenure 1.0. The Aztecs were beaten badly by Utah State in the MWC title game and could be in trouble here in what should amount to a Roadrunners home game.LOCKHEED MARTIN ARMED FORCES BOWL (13)When: Dec. 22, 8 p.m.Where: Fort WorthWho: Army (8–4) vs. Missouri (6–6) Army season in a sentence: Any season that ends in a loss to Navy cannot be considered great, but otherwise this was another good one.Missouri season in a sentence: When you’re an SEC team playing your bowl game on Dec. 22, it didn’t go very well.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse.Line: Army by 3.5.Dash pick: Army 35, Missouri 28. Don’t overthink it—the Cadets are the No. 2 rushing offense in the country; the Tigers are the No. 125 rushing defense. Army might not have to pass at all, which is perfectly fine with coach Jeff Monken. (When his teams at West Point throw the ball more than 100 times in a season, they average 5.4 wins. When they have thrown in fewer than 100 times, they average 10 wins. This team has passed 101 times.) Army also is much more likely to be motivated to play. Army QB Christian Anderson has thrown for five touchdowns and ran for seven more in 2021.Danny Wild/USA TODAY Sports FRISCO FOOTBALL CLASSIC (14)When: Dec. 23, 3:30 p.m. Where: Frisco, Texas Who: North Texas (6–6) vs. Miami (Ohio) (6–6).North Texas season in a sentence: The Mean Green saved Seth Littrell’s job by closing with a five-game winning streak, capped by handing UTSA its only loss.Miami (Ohio) season in a sentence: The RedHawks also finished well, going 5–3 since September with the three losses by a combined four points.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Please. U.S. quality of life would not have suffered if this newly formed bowl had not been scheduled.Line: Miami by 3.Dash pick: North Texas 28, Miami (Ohio) 27. The only conference that should be faded harder than C-USA is the MAC. Should be a Mean Green home game if UNT fans show up (attendance this season at Apogee Stadium was not great). And the RedHawks have been much more successful at home than on the road this season.UNION HOME MORTGAGE GASPARILLA BOWL (15)When: Dec. 23, 7 p.m.Where: Tampa Who: UCF (8–4) vs. Florida (6–6). UCF season in a sentence: Gus Malzahn arrived, Dillon Gabriel got hurt and hit the transfer portal, and the glory days of 2017–18 receded a little further in the rearview mirror.Florida season in a sentence: Tire fire.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse, even with the in-state (non)rivalry stakes.Line: Florida by 6.5.Dash pick: UCF 21, Florida 19. There are two competing schools of thought here. On the one hand, the Knights’ in-state players who were not recruited by the Gators should bring superior motivation against a team that has performed listlessly for months. On the other hand, Malzahn is 2–5 against the spread in bowl games since nearly winning the 2013 national championship as a 10-point underdog. EASYPOST HAWAI’I BOWL (16)When: Dec. 24, 8 p.m.Where: HonoluluWho: Memphis (6–6) vs. Hawai’i (6–7)Memphis’s season in a sentence: Things deteriorated after beating Mississippi State to reach 3–0.Hawai’i’s season in a sentence: 33% of the Rainbow Warriors’ six victories came against New Mexico State.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: No amount of paradise can bring this game within range of average.Line: Memphis by 7.5Dash pick: Memphis 42, Hawai’i 34. With Aloha Stadium condemned, the Warriors have had their home games on campus at Ching Field, which is a “retrofitted” practice field that served as the smallest home stadium in FBS. That’s where this will be played as well. Nothing says bowl pageantry like staging this game where crowds have not exceeded 6,600. If the Tigers care even slightly, they should win and cover.TAXACT CAMELLIA BOWL (17)When: Dec. 25, 2:30 p.m.Where: Montgomery, Ala.Who: Georgia State (7–5) vs. Ball State (6–6).Georgia State season in a sentence: Upset Coastal Carolina and finished strong for a third-straight winning record.Ball State season in a sentence: More was expected of the defending MAC champions, who returned almost everyone from 2020.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: A Christmas Day matchup of mid-level Sun Belt and MAC teams? You know the answer.Line: Georgia State by 4.5.Dash pick: Georgia State 28, Ball State 23. This is the Quality Loss Bowl—all 11 combined defeats were to teams that are bowling. But the Panthers come in playing better, having won six of their last seven and pushing Sun Belt champion Louisiana on the road before submitting. Fade the MAC.QUICK LANE BOWL (18)When: Dec. 27, 11 a.m.Where: Detroit Who: Western Michigan (7–5) vs. Nevada (8–4).Western Michigan season in a sentence: Beat the ACC and MAC champions on the road, but not much to go along with those two high points.Nevada season in a sentence: A trio of two-point Mountain West losses left an aura of disappointment, then coach Jay Norvell left for a league rival.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: It’s 11 a.m. in Detroit in December, man.Line: Western Michigan by 3.5Dash pick: Western Michigan 30, Nevada 24. The only explanation for the line was that Vegas anticipated Wolf Pack quarterback and NFL prospect Carson Strong opting out, and he did exactly that Tuesday night. Without Strong and Norvell, and with WMU having a presumptive fan advantage, it’s time to reverse the MAC fade for this game.MILITARY BOWL PRESENTED BY PERATON (19)When: Dec. 27, 2:30 p.m.Where: Annapolis, Md.Who: Boston College (6–6) vs. East Carolina (7–5). Boston College season in a sentence: A third-straight six-win regular season, as the commitment to mediocrity remains strong.East Carolina season in a sentence: First winning record and bowl bid since 2014, as the Mike Houston rebuilding plan starts to pay off.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse.Line: BC by 3.Dash pick: East Carolina 24, Boston College 22. Give the Pirates the edge in enthusiasm and recent performance. Hard to look past the Eagles recording zero first downs in the second half and throwing for a full-game total of 19 yards in a home loss to Wake Forest. TICKETSMARTER BIRMINGHAM BOWL (20)When: Dec. 28, noon Where: Birmingham, Ala.Who: Houston (11–2) vs. Auburn (6–6). Houston season in a sentence: Eleven wins bookended by two losses, with faith in Dana Holgorsen restored.Auburn season in a sentence: Tumultuous, disappointing—and a single Iron Bowl play away from gut-your-rival glory.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Mildly better.Line: Auburn by 3.Dash pick: Auburn 29, Houston 24. The last time Holgo covered the spread in a bowl game was the first one he coached. And that was a decade ago. The Tigers have lost four straight heading into this game, but fade the mullet anyway.SERVPRO FIRST RESPONDER BOWL (21)When: Dec. 28, 3:15 p.m.Where: Dallas Who: Air Force (9–3) vs. Louisville (6–6).Air Force season in a sentence: The three teams that beat the Falcons have a combined record of 29–9.Louisville season in a sentence: Challenging schedule led to five losses against currently ranked opponents and a late giveaway against Virginia.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse.Line: Louisville by 2.Dash pick: Air Force 37, Louisville 35. The Cardinals were massacred on the ground by Kentucky to close the regular season. Now they have to decide whether they’re motivated to handle three hours of cut blocks from the No. 1 rushing team in the nation. Mercurial quarterback Malik Cunningham could win this by himself, though, if he plays to his full capability. Mike Leach will face one of his former schools in the Liberty Bowl.Jake Crandall/USA TODAY NETWORK AUTOZONE LIBERTY BOWL (22)When: Dec. 28, 6:45 p.m.Where: Memphis, Tenn.Who: Mississippi State (7–5) vs. Texas Tech (6–6). Mississippi State season in a sentence: The Bulldogs have passed 402 more times than they have run, which is assuredly a Southeastern Conference single-season record but not a Mike Leach single-season record.Texas Tech season in a sentence: Fired coach when he was 5–3, radio crew suspended for ripping the refs in a Tech win—just another silly season on the South Plains.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse.Line: Mississippi State by 8.5Dash pick: Mississippi State 48, Texas Tech 34. The nation’s No. 3 passing offense likes the look of the nation’s No. 118 passing defense. Leach Bowl goes to the guy who sued Texas Tech after the school fired him. “I’ve got great memories there,” Leach said last week. “They still owe me for 2009, the last time they won nine games, so maybe they’ll deliver the check. So we’ll see what happens there.”SAN DIEGO COUNTY CREDIT UNION HOLIDAY BOWL (23)When: Dec. 28, 8 p.m.Where: San Diego Who: UCLA (8–4) vs. North Carolina State (9–3). UCLA’s season in a sentence: Best regular season in six years, starting well and ending well, but a gap remains between the Bruins and the best of the West.NC State’s season in a sentence: A very good year that was a few plays short of a great year, with a chance for its first double-digit-victory season since 2002.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better teams and better weather, since the kickoff temperature in Memphis 48 years ago was 32 degrees. Line: NC State by 1.Dash pick: UCLA 33, North Carolina State 31. Fun quarterback matchup, with the Bruins’ Dorian Thompson-Robinson averaging 274.4 yards of total offense per game and 7.3 yards per play, while the Wolfpack’s Devin Leary checks in at 280 and 6.9, respectively. UCLA hasn’t been bowling in four years and should have an enthusiastic home crowd—if its fans show up. The Bruins are more balanced offensively and a bit better on third down.GUARANTEED RATE BOWL (24)When: Dec. 28, 10:15 p.m. Where: PhoenixWho: West Virginia (6–6) vs. Minnesota (8–4).West Virginia’s season in a sentence: Consistently inconsistent, with too many games where the offense failed to fire.Minnesota’s season in a sentence: Overcame an absolute plague of injuries at running back, which is a problem for a ground-based offense, and wound up holding Paul Bunyan’s ax at the end.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Let’s call it a push.Line: Minnesota by 3.5.Dash pick: Minnesota 24, West Virginia 14. A couple of good bowl coaches here, with P.J. Fleck 2–0 as an underdog both times at Minnesota and Neal Brown 4–0 in his career. The Gophers’ top-five defense is better than WVU’s offense, and Fleck should get a great scout after having recently re-hired Kirk Ciarrocca, who has been an offensive analyst on Brown’s staff this year. Minnesota is not expecting any players to opt out of the game; there may still be a couple to watch in that category for West Virginia. WASABI FENWAY BOWL (25)When: Dec. 29, 11 a.m.Where: Boston Who: SMU (8–4) vs. Virginia (6–6). SMU’s season in a sentence: Started fast against light competition, ended poorly when the schedule got tough, lost its coach.Virginia’s season in a sentence: Brennan Armstrong, bad defense and Bronco Mendenhall’s sudden resignation.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse, right down to the confusing title sponsor. (A tech company, not the sushi seasoning.)Line: Virginia by 2.Dash pick: Virginia 45, SMU 37. An interim coach at SMU, Mendenhall coaching his last game at UVA, gunslinger quarterbacks and questionable defenses—this could get wild. Tanner Mordecai and Armstrong will put the pop in the passing game, but two of Mordecai’s top three receivers have both opted out. The Cavaliers have the x-factor advantage in multi-purpose Keytaon Thompson, a former full-time quarterback at Mississippi State they have used creatively all season. Bowl prep affords for more experimenting with the Hoos’ leading receiver and No. 3 rusher.NEW ERA PINSTRIPE BOWL (26)When: Dec. 29, 2:15 p.m.Where: The BronxWho: Maryland (6–6) vs. Virginia Tech (6–6). Maryland’s season in a sentence: Good Taulia was very good, and Bad Taulia was unable to cover up for a porous defense.Virginia Tech’s season in a sentence: Started nicely and ended nicely, but everything in between was bad enough to cost Justin Fuente his job.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. It doesn’t get any more mediocre than two 6–6 teams from Power 5 conferences who needed to win their last regular-season game to reach .500.Line: Maryland by 1.Dash pick: Maryland 36, Virginia Tech 31. The Terrapins were tested against a tougher schedule, having played (and lost to) four currently ranked opponents. The Taulia Tagovailoa–to–Rakim Jarrett connection should concern the Hokies, who have had four starters opt out of the game. The Terrapins’ suspect run defense must deal with Tech’s Raheem Blackshear, who finished the season strong.CHEEZ-IT BOWL (27)When: Dec. 29, 5:45 p.m. Where: Orlando Who: Clemson (9–3) vs. Iowa State (7–5). Clemson’s season in a sentence: The Cheez-It Bowl was not the expected postseason destination.Iowa State’s season in a sentence: Major disappointment lessened by the retention of coach Matt Campbell; now what’s up with everyone hitting the transfer portal?Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better. The Tigers bring a brand name to the affair.Line: Iowa State by 1.Dash pick: Clemson 26, Iowa State 21. This game could be more about who’s missing than who’s present. The Tigers are down both their coordinators, with Brent Venables and Tony Elliott finally taking the leap to head-coaching jobs. Player opt-outs may follow. The Cyclones have had a flow of players into the portal, and it remains to be seen what their depth chart will look like when it’s finally released for this game. Which quarterback can end a disappointing season on a high note, Clemson’s D.J. Uiagalelei or Iowa State’s Brock Purdy? VALERO ALAMO BOWL (28)When: Dec. 29, 9:15 p.m.Where: San Antonio Who: Oregon (10–3) vs. Oklahoma (10–2). Oregon’s season in a sentence: Very good run with a major Utah problem, and now another coaching transition.Oklahoma’s season in a sentence: Hugely underwhelming on the field, massively shocking at the end … and is that really Bob Stoops? Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better. Brand names with big talent—and interim coaches.Line: Oklahoma by 4.5.Dash pick: Oregon 37, Oklahoma 34. Anyone who says they know what will happen here is lying. Coaches are missing, star players are missing, motivation is a jump ball for two teams that went late into November harboring College Football Playoff aspirations. But since the Sooners really didn’t do anything impressive all season, the Ducks are the pick here.DUKE’S MAYO BOWL (29)When: Dec. 30, 11:30 a.m.Where: Charlotte Who: North Carolina (6–6) vs. South Carolina (6–6). North Carolina’s season in a sentence: Didn’t you guys start out in the top 10?South Carolina’s season in a sentence: Pleasantly surprised to be bowling in Year 1 of Beamer (The Younger) Ball.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. This is a game only the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce could love.Line: North Carolina by 7.Dash pick: North Carolina 31, South Carolina 28. Sam Howell is expected to play, giving him the chance to go out in a blaze of Tar Heel glory, but this might be more of a running opportunity than passing, given the state of the Gamecocks’ run defense. Still, South Carolina has shown enough pluck that this could be a game that goes down to the wire.TRANSPERFECT MUSIC CITY BOWL (30)When: Dec. 30, 3 p.m.Where: NashvilleWho: Tennessee (7–5) vs. Purdue (8–4). Tennessee’s season in a sentence: Other than trashing its home field, this was a buoyant year as the Josh Heupel era gets a strong start.Purdue’s season in a sentence: Best since the Joe Tiller era.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: A smidge better.Line: Tennessee by 4.Dash pick: Tennessee 42, Purdue 31. When the two best Boilermakers—receiver David Bell and defensive end George Karlaftis—opted out, this matchup took on an orange hue. The Volunteers lost running back Tiyon Evans but still have plenty of firepower to throw at Purdue’s pretty solid defense. Hendon Hooker has had a great season at Tennessee after transferring from Virginia Tech, making the most of the Heupel influence.CHICK-FIL-A PEACH BOWL (31)When: Dec. 30, 7 p.m.Where: Atlanta Who: Michigan State (10–2) vs. Pittsburgh (11–2). Michigan State’s season in a sentence: The program slide was reversed in a dramatic manner, with an immense commitment to continue the upward trend.Pittsburgh’s season in a sentence: Best since the glory days of the 1970s and early ’80s, with a Heisman Trophy finalist leading the way to a first ACC title.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Much better. This is a good one.Line: Michigan State by 1.5.Dash pick: Michigan State 32, Pittsburgh 27. Until Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett and Spartans running back Kenneth Walker III declare their bowl intentions, this is a total crapshoot. The presumption is that Michigan State could better withstand the loss of its top-10 Heisman finisher than Pitt, if they both opt out. If Pickett plays, he could put on an epic display against the Spartans’ porous pass defense.SRS DISTRIBUTION LAS VEGAS BOWL (32)When: Dec. 30, 10:30 p.m. Where: Las Vegas Who: Wisconsin (8–4) vs. Arizona State (8–4).Wisconsin’s season in a sentence: Seven solid Saturdays from Oct. 9 to Nov. 20; everything before and after was an offensive debacle.Arizona State’s season in a sentence: A lot of buildup, not much delivery.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Perhaps a smidge better.Line: Wisconsin by 7.Dash pick: Wisconsin 24, Arizona State 13. The Badgers were better against a tougher schedule. The Sun Devils beat exactly one team that finished with a winning record (UCLA), losing to the other four. ASU will be down a couple of running backs, putting more on the shoulders of quarterback Jayden Daniels, who hasn’t had a great season passing the ball. Then again, neither has his counterpart, Graham Mertz. Paul Chryst has a 6–2 bowl record. Daniels, the ASU QB, has already announced he will return for 2022.Mark J. Rebilas/USA TODAY Sports TAXSLAYER GATOR BOWL (33)When: Dec. 31, 11 a.m.Where: JacksonvilleWho: Wake Forest (10–3) vs. Texas A&M (8–4).Wake Forest season in a sentence: One of the most successful and entertaining in school history; Slow Mesh forever.Texas A&M season in a sentence: Not really the stuff of $90 million contracts.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better. This should be quality entertainment.Line: Texas A&M by 7.Dash pick: Wake Forest 36, Texas A&M 34. If this were a regular-season game, the Aggies would be the pick. But quarterback Zach Calzada hit the portal, star defensive lineman DeMarvin Leal and safety Leon O’Neal Jr. opted out, and defensive coordinator Mike Elko took the Duke job. Too much upheaval, not enough playmakers to beat a veteran Wake Forest team that thrives on continuity.TONY THE TIGER SUN BOWL (34)When: Dec. 31, 2 p.m.Where: El PasoWho: Washington State (7–5) vs. Miami (7–5).Washington State’s season in a sentence: This one deserves its own paragraph, with Nick Rolovich and some assistants being fired in October for failing to comply with the state vaccine mandate and being replaced with interim coach Jake Dickert, who did so well that he got the full-time job after a 7–5 surprise.Miami’s season in a sentence: Messy, with a 2–4 start and a 5–1 finish and a quarterback change and ultimately changes at the athletic-director and head-coach levels, but not until after the school treated Manny Diaz like dirt on the way to hiring Mario Cristobal.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. The Survivors of In-Season Mayhem Bowl feels like a subaverage performance in the making.Line: Miami by 2.Dash pick: Washington State 25, Miami 24. This is the Hurricanes’ third Sun Bowl, all three of them coming after firing their head coach (the dysfunction is real in Coral Gables). Miami is 0–2 in the other Sun Bowls under interim coaches, so make it 0–3. The Cougars had leading rusher Max Borghi opt out, but the offense is more of a Jayden de Laura production, anyway. Key stat: Wazzu is plus-10 turnover margin to Miami’s minus-6.BARSTOOL SPORTS ARIZONA BOWL (35)When: Dec. 31, 2 p.m. Where: TucsonWho: Central Michigan (8–4) vs. Boise State (7–5). Central Michigan’s season in a sentence: A 4–4 start and a 4–0 finish powered by running back Lew Nichols III, the nation’s leading rusher.Boise State’s season in a sentence: Worst regular-season record since 1998, as the Andy Avalos era struggled to get off the ground against a stout schedule.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. A MAC vs. MWC also-ran matchup doesn’t move the needle past average.Line: Boise State by 8.5.Dash pick: Boise State 28, Central Michigan 24. The Chippewas are the hotter team, but the Broncos played the harder schedule. Boise’s run defense improved in the last five games and should be able to avoid being trampled by Nichols, who finished the season on a tear.OUTBACK BOWL (36)When: Jan. 1, 12 p.m.Where: TampaWho: Penn State (7–5) vs. Arkansas (8–4).Penn State’s season in a sentence: Winless in four games decided by fewer than five points, as the clutch play against Wisconsin and Auburn in September evaporated in October and November.Arkansas’s season in a sentence: Best since Bobby Petrino, without the motorcycle scandal.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better, since the Pig People should show up in force for their first bowl game since 2016.Line: Penn State by 2.5.Dash pick: Penn State 27, Arkansas 21. One of two star receivers in the game has opted out—that’s the Razorbacks’ Treylon Burks. We’ll see whether the Nittany Lions’ Jahan Dotson joins him (James Franklin said he generally leaves it to the players to make those kinds of announcements themselves). The Hogs certainly figure to be the more excited party for this game, but if Penn State protects Sean Clifford he could exploit their pass defense.VRBO CITRUS BOWL (37)When: Jan. 1, 1 p.m.Where: Orlando Who: Iowa (10–3) vs. Kentucky (9–3).Iowa’s season in a sentence: Some great moments, and not all of them were punts.Kentucky’s season in a sentence: Solo second place in the SEC East is UK’s best league finish since 1976.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better, although this could be a bit of a stylistic slog.Line: Kentucky by 2.5.Dash pick: Kentucky 22, Iowa 17. Hawkeyes running back Tyler Goodson opted out, which reduces the Iowa offense to tight end Sam LaPorta catching passes from a pair of scatter-armed quarterbacks. Can All-American center Tyler Linderbaum play fullback, too? For the Wildcats, the key is to not commit gobs of turnovers against a team that produces gobs of takeaways. Iowa is plus-13 and Kentucky is minus-13, but much of that was early in the season.PLAYSTATION FIESTA BOWL (38)When: Jan. 1, 1 p.m.Where: Glendale, Ariz.Who: Oklahoma State (11–2) vs. Notre Dame (11–1)Oklahoma State’s season in a sentence: Inches short—in Ames and in Arlington—of potential perfection.Notre Dame’s season in a sentence: Everything was wonderful until Brian Kelly wound up talking like Foghorn Leghorn one strange night in Baton Rouge.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Far better, one of the best of this bowl season.Line: Notre Dame by 2.Dash pick: Notre Dame 24, Oklahoma State 21. The Fighting Irish had safety Kyle Hamilton and running back Kyren Williams opt out, but Hamilton has been out for weeks with an injury, anyway. Mike Gundy has covered the spread in his last five bowl games but lost star defensive coordinator Jim Knowles to Ohio State. The expectation is that the Irish will be an energized team after the promotion of popular Marcus Freeman to head coach and the retention of the core of the staff. Will the Cowboys be demoralized over what they lost in the Big 12 title game?ROSE BOWL (39)When: Jan. 1, 5 p.m.Where: Pasadena, Calif.Who: Utah (10–3) vs. Ohio State (10–2).Utah’s season in a sentence: Against a backdrop of tragedy, the Utes fashioned one of their best seasons, and it will culminate in their first Rose Bowl.Ohio State’s season in a sentence: No trip to Indianapolis, no berth in the Playoff and a blowout loss to Michigan makes 10–2 feel quite disappointing.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: The worst Rose Bowl is always better than the best Liberty Bowl, and this is not the worst Rose Bowl.Line: Ohio State by 6.5.Dash pick: Ohio State 34, Utah 31. If Buckeyes wide receivers Garrett Wilson and Chris Olave don’t play, you can flip this pick—they and others have yet to declare their intention for this game, although coach Ryan Day said last week that he expects to have everyone in action. If Ohio State is missing some studs, the building blocks for a Utes upset are there: a physical running game against a defense that was trampled by Michigan; Kyle Whittingham’s ridiculous 11–3 bowl record (though he’s lost his last two); the record against Oregon (the Utes were an easy 2–0, the Buckeyes 0–1); and sky-high motivation against a blueblood opponent in a blueblood game. Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral will end his college career with the Sugar Bowl.Matt Bush/USA TODAY Sports ALLSTATE SUGAR BOWL (40)When: Jan. 1, 8:45 p.m.Where: New OrleansWho: Mississippi (10–2) vs. Baylor (11–2).Mississippi’s season in a sentence: Perfect outside the state of Alabama, and it held on to Lane Kiffin through the coaching carousel.Baylor’s season in a sentence: Could a surprise season end any better than a goal-line stand to win the Big 12 championship?Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Far better in every category.Line: Baylor by 1.Dash pick: Baylor 28, Mississippi 25. The Bears have two very good running backs and a mobile quarterback, if Gerry Bohanon is back from injury. The Rebels have issues stopping the run. That could be the difference in this game, unless Matt Corral just decides to go ballistic and win it on his own for Ole Miss.TAXACT TEXAS BOWL (41)When: Jan. 4, 9 p.m.Where: Houston Who: LSU (6–6) vs. Kansas State (7–5) LSU’s season in a sentence: The disaster escalated quickly.Kansas State’s season in a sentence: Streak City—win three, lose three, win four, lose two.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse, without question.Line: Kansas State by 1.Dash pick: Kansas State 23, LSU 21. This game is utter mayhem. Nobody knows who will play quarterback (due to injury at K-State and transfers at LSU). K-State will have an interim offensive coordinator, and LSU has an interim everything. More could change between now and the kickoff for a game weirdly scheduled on Jan. 4. GOODYEAR COTTON BOWL CLASSIC CFP SEMIFINAL (42)When: Dec. 31, 3:30 p.m.Where: Arlington, TexasWho: Cincinnati (13–0) vs. Alabama (12–1)Cincinnati’s season in a sentence: Best in school history, capped with a barrier-breaking Playoff bid and retention of star coach Luke Fickell.Alabama’s season in a sentence: Narrow escape on The Plains followed by no doubts in Atlanta.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Slightly better.Line: Alabama by 13.5.Dash pick: Alabama 28, Cincinnati 13. The Bearcats are a legitimate Playoff team that will not be scared of the moment and should give the Crimson Tide offense some problems—especially with wide receiver John Metchie III out. But the two major problems for Cincy are these: how to block monster linebacker Will Anderson and trying to shock the world with an unreliable kicker. Problems up front will mean problems for Desmond Ridder, and Cincinnati cannot win without a great game from him. And there is the fact that Nick Saban doesn’t just tend to win semifinal games; he tends to win big.CAPITAL ONE ORANGE BOWL CFP SEMIFINAL (43)When: Dec. 31, 7:30 p.m.Where: Miami Gardens, Fla.Who: Georgia (12–1) vs. Michigan (12–1)Georgia’s season in a sentence: Dreamy, other than Alabama—again.Michigan’s season in a sentence: What it’s been waiting for since 1997, and certainly since 2015.Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Also slightly better.Line: Georgia by 8.Dash pick: Georgia 21, Michigan 17. The spread is too big, but the Bulldogs’ defense is too good to be shredded for the second game in a row. Unless the Wolverines can hit some big plays in the passing game or via trickeration—which isn’t out of the question—an offense reliant on ground-and-pound running will struggle against the imposing Georgia front seven. The other issue: The teams that bothered Georgia’s defense the most (Alabama and Tennessee) did it with super tempo, which isn’t really in Michigan’s wheelhouse. The huge question for the Bulldogs is whether Stetson Bennett is the quarterback and how he fares with Aidan Hutchinson and David Ojabo chasing him. Wouldn’t be a shock to see JT Daniels early if Georgia’s first couple of drives falter.CFP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME (44)When: Jan. 10, 8 p.m.Where: Indianapolis.Who: Alabama vs. Georgia in the Greg Sankey Invitational, as the rest of the nation convulses in outrage.Dash pick: Alabama 26, Georgia 23. Tide win on a touchdown bomb in overtime by Paul Tyson to Ja’Corey Brooks. Or something like that.More College Football Coverage:• Alabama Lands No. 1 Recruiting Class on Signing Day• Cade McNamara, World-Beater? He Thinks So.• Inside the Wild Week That May Change CFB Forever","pubDate":"2021-12-16 14:00:00","full_description":"Forty-plus names, games, teams and minutiae making news this bloated bowl season: We are approaching the 120th anniversary of the first bowl game: the 1902 Rose Bowl, a 49–0 Michigan rout of Stanford. Unlike in recent decades, that game assuredly was not timed around the sunset over the San Gabriel Mountains; there were no stadium lights back then, so playing the fourth quarter after dark would have been inadvisable. Thousands of bowl games have been played since then, many of them memorable but most of them fleeting in impact. We said quick hellos and goodbyes to the Bacardi Bowl in Cuba (seven iterations between 1907 and ’46); the Poinsettia Bowl (’05–’16, when San Diego ambitiously tried to be a two-bowl town); and the Great Lakes Bowl (a one-and-done in ’47, after the idea of December bowl games in Cleveland shockingly didn’t take root). Pierre Aguirre/USA TODAY Sports In examining this mountain of bowl history, it’s easy to find nominees for Greatest Bowl Ever (Texas 41, USC 39 in the ’06 Rose Bowl leaps to mind) and Worst Bowl Ever (Oregon State 3, Pittsburgh 0 in the ’08 Sun Bowl presents a dismally strong case). But what about the Most Average Bowl Ever? The Dash is at your service, doing the important research others wouldn’t dare undertake. The winner: the 1973 Liberty Bowl. It is the not-great, not-terrible standard by which all other average bowl games should be judged. North Carolina State, coached by Lou Holtz, defeated Kansas, 31–18. It matched a pair of moderately successful teams in a more selective bowl era—the Wolfpack were 8–3, the Jayhawks were 7-3-1. It was a competitive game into the second half, but not close at the end. There was a brief flare of controversy over a muffed Kansas punt in the third quarter. The game MVP rushed for 83 yards. Two weeks later, Notre Dame defeated Alabama 24–23 in the Sugar Bowl to win the national title, a slightly more memorable game. In previewing and predicting this year’s slate of matchups —The Dash is never responsible if you use these picks in your bowl pool and finish last—let’s apply the 1973 Liberty Bowl Epitome of Average Yardstick to every game. Bowl Watchability Rankings: One Reason to Tune in to Each Matchup When: Dec. 17, noon ET Where: The Bahamas Who: Middle Tennessee (6–6) vs. Toledo (7–5). Middle Tennessee season in a sentence: After winning a total of seven games the previous two years, a modest flutter of revival in Murfreesboro. Toledo season in a sentence: A massive disappointment was salvaged somewhat by a closing three-game winning streak to become Caribbean-bound. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Assuredly worse, but with better weather. And it is nice of ESPN to tempt us into an early start to the weekend with a noon Friday kickoff to the first bowl. Line ( according to SI Sportsbook ): Toledo by 10 Dash pick: Toledo 41, Middle Tennessee 28. Interesting tension here between a team that never turns the ball over (the Rockets have the fewest giveaways in the nation with six) and a team that often forces turnovers (the Blue Raiders are first nationally in takeaways with 31). Dual-threat Toledo quarterback Dequan Finn should be the difference maker here. When: Dec. 17, 6 p.m. Where: Orlando Who: Northern Illinois (9–4) vs. Coastal Carolina (10–2) Northern Illinois season in a sentence: The heart-attack Huskies kept winning the close ones, going 7–2 in one-score games on their way to the MAC title. Coastal Carolina season in a sentence: With a pair of close Sun Belt losses, the Chanticleers couldn’t replicate last year’s magic, but this remains the nascent program’s Golden Era. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better. Two good teams. Line: Coastal Carolina by 9.5 Dash pick: Coastal Carolina 48, Northern Illinois 34. The key stat here: Coastal is second in the nation in yards per play at 7.63. NIU is 120th nationally in yards allowed per play at 6.69. Quarterback Grayson McCall could have a huge day against the Huskies defense, and in the process break Mac Jones’s single-season FBS pass efficiency record. When: Dec. 18, 11 a.m. Where: Boca Raton, Fla. Who: Western Kentucky (8–5) vs. Appalachian State (10–3). WKU season in a sentence: The raiding of FCS Houston Baptist for its quarterback (Bailey Zappe), top receiver (Jerreth Sterns) and offensive coordinator (Zach Kittley) paid record-setting offensive dividends. App State season in a sentence: Other than two trips to Lafayette, La. and a narrow loss to Miami, everything was beautiful for the Mountaineers. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. Nobody really needs an 11 a.m. ET bowl kickoff. Line: Appalachian State by 3 Dash pick: Appalachian State 45, Western Kentucky 38. One team is playing touch football, the other is playing tackle—take the one with the more physical running game. There is no stopping the Hilltoppers’ passing attack, but the App State defense has allowed just 11 points per game over its last five. Deion Sanders's Tigers have only lost one game, to FBS Louisiana-Monroe. David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated When: Dec. 18, noon. Where: Atlanta Who: South Carolina State (6–5) vs. Jackson State (11–1) South Carolina State season in a sentence: The Bulldogs won five of their last six, with a three-point win at North Carolina Central keying their MEAC championship and first Celebration Bowl berth. Jackson State season in a sentence: Never dull under Deion Sanders, the Tigers rolled through the SWAC undefeated and never allowed more than 21 points in a game. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse game, better bands. Line: Jackson State by 10 Dash pick: Jackson State 21, South Carolina State 10. Sanders has spent some time in recent weeks chasing FBS jobs (TCU, Colorado State) but he clearly has the better team here. His son, Shedeur, is a major quarterback talent. Deion Sanders, Jackson State Land Nation's No. 1 Recruit When: Dec. 18, 2:15 p.m. Where: Albuquerque, N.M. Who: UTEP (7–5) vs. Fresno State (9–3). UTEP season in a sentence: A 6–1 start launched the Miners to their first bowl bid in seven seasons, validating Dana Dimel as a good coach for bad jobs. Fresno State season in a sentence: Beating UCLA in the Rose Bowl and winning nine games reestablished the program in the upper echelon of the Mountain West—while also launching coach Kalen DeBoer to Washington. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. Despite the Mexican food. Line: Fresno State by 11 Dash pick: Fresno State 47, UTEP 34. The Miners are a feel-good story and should have a home-crowd advantage, since ABQ is a reasonable drive from El Paso. But unless some of those fans can rush Bulldogs quarterback Jake Haener (3,810 yards passing) or cover his receivers, this will be a tough afternoon for a suspect UTEP defense. When: Dec. 18, 3:30 p.m. Where: Shreveport, La. Who: UAB (8–4) vs. BYU (10–2) UAB season in a sentence: Missed the Conference USA title game for the first time since 2017, but still recorded a fifth-straight winning record since being forced into near-extinction. BYU season in a sentence: Unofficial Pac-12 champion recorded its second straight year of double-digit victories and retained coach Kalani Sitake. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Slightly better, despite being played in Shreveport. Line: BYU by 7 Dash pick: BYU 31, UAB 20. This should be a run-heavy game, with the Blazers running on 64% of their plays this season and the Cougars 55%. BYU has played the superior schedule and deserved a better bowl and opponent than this. Also: As you may have discerned by now, The Dash is fading Conference USA. When: Dec. 18, 5:45 p.m. Where: Mobile, Ala. Who: Eastern Michigan (7–5) vs. Liberty (7–5) Eastern Michigan season in a sentence: Living on the edge, with six out of eight MAC matchups being one-score games and a pair of them one-point victories. Liberty season in a sentence: First half was fine, second half stank. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Markedly worse, despite the verbal similarities between Liberty and LendingTree. Line: Liberty by 9.5. Dash pick: Liberty 35, Eastern Michigan 21. The Flames have the best player in the game in quarterback Malik Willis, who should be motivated to put some good things on tape for NFL scouts after a rocky latter half of the season. He should have his way running and passing against a defense surrendering 6.11 yards per play. When: Dec. 18, 7:30 p.m. Where: Los Angeles Who: Utah State (10–3) vs. Oregon State (7–5). Utah State season in a sentence: A remarkable reset in its first year under Blake Anderson, who brought his quarterback with him from Arkansas State and won the Mountain West for the first time. Oregon State season in a sentence: Bowling for the first time since 2013 as fourth-year coach Jonathan Smith’s methodical program-building takes root. Line: Oregon State by 7. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Slightly worse, despite the celebrity tie-in and the bowl’s mascot, Jimmy Camel, a vomiting camel . Dash pick: Utah State 28, Oregon State 27. The Aggies have to slow down the Oregon State running game, and they showed some newfound proficiency in that area while routing San Diego State in the MWC title game. Undersized Utah State receiver Deven Thompkins has blossomed since the coaching change, averaging 16.6 yards per touch and helping USU lead the nation in scrimmage plays of 40 yards or longer (24). When: Dec. 18, 9:15 p.m. Where: New Orleans Who: Louisiana (12–1) vs. Marshall (7–5). Louisiana’s season in a sentence: After being upset by Texas in the opener (true statement, in retrospect), it’s been a dream that ends with the inevitable departure of coach Billy Napier. Marshall’s season in a sentence: Zero victories over FBS teams with winning records. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse, but with beads and better food. Line: Louisiana by 5 Dash pick: Louisiana 30, Marshall 23. Dicey spot for the Ragin’ Cajuns after losing Napier to Florida, and the secondary could be tested by the Thundering Herd’s Grant Wells. But promoting Michael Desormeaux from within and a strong senior class should help maintain continuity and focus on finishing out a great season on a high note. When: Dec. 20, 2:30 p.m. Where: Conway, S.C. Who: Old Dominion (6–6) vs. Tulsa (6–6) Old Dominion’s season in a sentence: Didn’t see this coming after a 1–6 start. Tulsa’s season in a sentence: Two bad months, followed by a very good November that was about a foot short in Nippert Stadium of an epic month. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Substantially worse. Line: Tulsa by 9 Dash pick: Tulsa 31, Old Dominion 28. Operation Fade C-USA takes a brief respite here due to a trap-ish spread. Five of the Golden Hurricane’s six wins are by seven points or fewer, and the Monarchs are a hot team. ODU has forced 10 turnovers in its last four games, and Tulsa is one of the most turnover-prone teams in the nation with 24 giveaways. When: Dec. 21, 3:30 p.m. Where: Boise, Idaho Who: Kent State (7–6) vs. Wyoming (6–6). Kent State season in a sentence: Many points scored, many points surrendered. Wyoming season in a sentence: Blowing out eventual Mountain West champion Utah State on the road one week, being blown out at home by Hawai’i the next—that’s how you get to 6–6. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse by several light years. Line: Wyoming by 3 Dash pick: Wyoming 41, Kent State 37. This is a tortoise-and-hare tempo matchup, with the Cowboys methodically grinding their way to 10 fewer offensive snaps per game. But they shouldn’t need many plays to score on the Golden Flashes, who have given up more than 40 points in five of their last seven games. As many Pokes fans as can free themselves up for a Tuesday afternoon game should make the relatively short trip to Boise and turn this into a Wyoming home game. When: Dec. 21, 7:30 p.m. Where: Frisco, Texas Who: UTSA (12–1) vs. San Diego State (11–2). UTSA season in a sentence: Best in school history , paving the way for a leap to the American Athletic Conference. San Diego State season in a sentence: A lot of accumulated mileage, both commuting to “home” games in Carson and in Matt Araiza punts. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better. This is the best matchup of all the pre-Christmas bowls. Line: UTSA by 2.5 Dash pick: UTSA 24, San Diego State 21. Is Brady Hoke having a 2008 experience all over again? That year he guided Ball State to a 12–0 record, then was surprisingly routed in the conference title game. The Cardinals subsequently dropped their bowl game as well, after Hoke had departed for San Diego State Tenure 1.0. The Aztecs were beaten badly by Utah State in the MWC title game and could be in trouble here in what should amount to a Roadrunners home game. When: Dec. 22, 8 p.m. Where: Fort Worth Who: Army (8–4) vs. Missouri (6–6) Army season in a sentence: Any season that ends in a loss to Navy cannot be considered great, but otherwise this was another good one. Missouri season in a sentence: When you’re an SEC team playing your bowl game on Dec. 22, it didn’t go very well. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. Line: Army by 3.5. Dash pick: Army 35, Missouri 28. Don’t overthink it—the Cadets are the No. 2 rushing offense in the country; the Tigers are the No. 125 rushing defense. Army might not have to pass at all, which is perfectly fine with coach Jeff Monken. (When his teams at West Point throw the ball more than 100 times in a season, they average 5.4 wins. When they have thrown in fewer than 100 times, they average 10 wins. This team has passed 101 times.) Army also is much more likely to be motivated to play. Army QB Christian Anderson has thrown for five touchdowns and ran for seven more in 2021. Danny Wild/USA TODAY Sports When: Dec. 23, 3:30 p.m. Where: Frisco, Texas Who: North Texas (6–6) vs. Miami (Ohio) (6–6). North Texas season in a sentence: The Mean Green saved Seth Littrell’s job by closing with a five-game winning streak, capped by handing UTSA its only loss. Miami (Ohio) season in a sentence: The RedHawks also finished well, going 5–3 since September with the three losses by a combined four points. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Please. U.S. quality of life would not have suffered if this newly formed bowl had not been scheduled. Line: Miami by 3. Dash pick: North Texas 28, Miami (Ohio) 27. The only conference that should be faded harder than C-USA is the MAC. Should be a Mean Green home game if UNT fans show up (attendance this season at Apogee Stadium was not great). And the RedHawks have been much more successful at home than on the road this season. When: Dec. 23, 7 p.m. Where: Tampa Who: UCF (8–4) vs. Florida (6–6). UCF season in a sentence: Gus Malzahn arrived, Dillon Gabriel got hurt and hit the transfer portal, and the glory days of 2017–18 receded a little further in the rearview mirror. Florida season in a sentence: Tire fire. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse, even with the in-state (non)rivalry stakes. Line: Florida by 6.5. Dash pick: UCF 21, Florida 19. There are two competing schools of thought here. On the one hand, the Knights’ in-state players who were not recruited by the Gators should bring superior motivation against a team that has performed listlessly for months. On the other hand, Malzahn is 2–5 against the spread in bowl games since nearly winning the 2013 national championship as a 10-point underdog. When: Dec. 24, 8 p.m. Where: Honolulu Who: Memphis (6–6) vs. Hawai’i (6–7) Memphis’s season in a sentence: Things deteriorated after beating Mississippi State to reach 3–0. Hawai’i’s season in a sentence: 33% of the Rainbow Warriors’ six victories came against New Mexico State. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: No amount of paradise can bring this game within range of average. Line: Memphis by 7.5 Dash pick: Memphis 42, Hawai’i 34. With Aloha Stadium condemned, the Warriors have had their home games on campus at Ching Field, which is a “retrofitted” practice field that served as the smallest home stadium in FBS. That’s where this will be played as well. Nothing says bowl pageantry like staging this game where crowds have not exceeded 6,600. If the Tigers care even slightly, they should win and cover. When: Dec. 25, 2:30 p.m. Where: Montgomery, Ala. Who: Georgia State (7–5) vs. Ball State (6–6). Georgia State season in a sentence: Upset Coastal Carolina and finished strong for a third-straight winning record. Ball State season in a sentence: More was expected of the defending MAC champions, who returned almost everyone from 2020. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: A Christmas Day matchup of mid-level Sun Belt and MAC teams? You know the answer. Line: Georgia State by 4.5. Dash pick: Georgia State 28, Ball State 23. This is the Quality Loss Bowl—all 11 combined defeats were to teams that are bowling. But the Panthers come in playing better, having won six of their last seven and pushing Sun Belt champion Louisiana on the road before submitting. Fade the MAC. When: Dec. 27, 11 a.m. Where: Detroit Who: Western Michigan (7–5) vs. Nevada (8–4). Western Michigan season in a sentence: Beat the ACC and MAC champions on the road, but not much to go along with those two high points. Nevada season in a sentence: A trio of two-point Mountain West losses left an aura of disappointment, then coach Jay Norvell left for a league rival. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: It’s 11 a.m. in Detroit in December, man. Line: Western Michigan by 3.5 Dash pick: Western Michigan 30, Nevada 24. The only explanation for the line was that Vegas anticipated Wolf Pack quarterback and NFL prospect Carson Strong opting out, and he did exactly that Tuesday night. Without Strong and Norvell, and with WMU having a presumptive fan advantage, it’s time to reverse the MAC fade for this game. When: Dec. 27, 2:30 p.m. Where: Annapolis, Md. Who: Boston College (6–6) vs. East Carolina (7–5). Boston College season in a sentence: A third-straight six-win regular season, as the commitment to mediocrity remains strong. East Carolina season in a sentence: First winning record and bowl bid since 2014, as the Mike Houston rebuilding plan starts to pay off. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. Line: BC by 3. Dash pick: East Carolina 24, Boston College 22. Give the Pirates the edge in enthusiasm and recent performance. Hard to look past the Eagles recording zero first downs in the second half and throwing for a full-game total of 19 yards in a home loss to Wake Forest. When: Dec. 28, noon Where: Birmingham, Ala. Who: Houston (11–2) vs. Auburn (6–6). Houston season in a sentence: Eleven wins bookended by two losses, with faith in Dana Holgorsen restored. Auburn season in a sentence: Tumultuous, disappointing—and a single Iron Bowl play away from gut-your-rival glory. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Mildly better. Line: Auburn by 3. Dash pick: Auburn 29, Houston 24. The last time Holgo covered the spread in a bowl game was the first one he coached. And that was a decade ago. The Tigers have lost four straight heading into this game, but fade the mullet anyway. When: Dec. 28, 3:15 p.m. Where: Dallas Who: Air Force (9–3) vs. Louisville (6–6). Air Force season in a sentence: The three teams that beat the Falcons have a combined record of 29–9. Louisville season in a sentence: Challenging schedule led to five losses against currently ranked opponents and a late giveaway against Virginia. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. Line: Louisville by 2. Dash pick: Air Force 37, Louisville 35. The Cardinals were massacred on the ground by Kentucky to close the regular season. Now they have to decide whether they’re motivated to handle three hours of cut blocks from the No. 1 rushing team in the nation. Mercurial quarterback Malik Cunningham could win this by himself, though, if he plays to his full capability. Mike Leach will face one of his former schools in the Liberty Bowl. Jake Crandall/USA TODAY NETWORK When: Dec. 28, 6:45 p.m. Where: Memphis, Tenn. Who: Mississippi State (7–5) vs. Texas Tech (6–6). Mississippi State season in a sentence: The Bulldogs have passed 402 more times than they have run, which is assuredly a Southeastern Conference single-season record but not a Mike Leach single-season record. Texas Tech season in a sentence: Fired coach when he was 5–3, radio crew suspended for ripping the refs in a Tech win—just another silly season on the South Plains. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. Line: Mississippi State by 8.5 Dash pick: Mississippi State 48, Texas Tech 34. The nation’s No. 3 passing offense likes the look of the nation’s No. 118 passing defense. Leach Bowl goes to the guy who sued Texas Tech after the school fired him. “I’ve got great memories there,” Leach said last week. “They still owe me for 2009, the last time they won nine games, so maybe they’ll deliver the check. So we’ll see what happens there.” When: Dec. 28, 8 p.m. Where: San Diego Who: UCLA (8–4) vs. North Carolina State (9–3). UCLA’s season in a sentence: Best regular season in six years, starting well and ending well, but a gap remains between the Bruins and the best of the West. NC State’s season in a sentence: A very good year that was a few plays short of a great year, with a chance for its first double-digit-victory season since 2002. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better teams and better weather, since the kickoff temperature in Memphis 48 years ago was 32 degrees. Line: NC State by 1. Dash pick: UCLA 33, North Carolina State 31. Fun quarterback matchup, with the Bruins’ Dorian Thompson-Robinson averaging 274.4 yards of total offense per game and 7.3 yards per play, while the Wolfpack’s Devin Leary checks in at 280 and 6.9, respectively. UCLA hasn’t been bowling in four years and should have an enthusiastic home crowd—if its fans show up. The Bruins are more balanced offensively and a bit better on third down. When: Dec. 28, 10:15 p.m. Where: Phoenix Who: West Virginia (6–6) vs. Minnesota (8–4). West Virginia’s season in a sentence: Consistently inconsistent, with too many games where the offense failed to fire. Minnesota’s season in a sentence: Overcame an absolute plague of injuries at running back, which is a problem for a ground-based offense, and wound up holding Paul Bunyan’s ax at the end. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Let’s call it a push. Line: Minnesota by 3.5. Dash pick: Minnesota 24, West Virginia 14. A couple of good bowl coaches here, with P.J. Fleck 2–0 as an underdog both times at Minnesota and Neal Brown 4–0 in his career. The Gophers’ top-five defense is better than WVU’s offense, and Fleck should get a great scout after having recently re-hired Kirk Ciarrocca, who has been an offensive analyst on Brown’s staff this year. Minnesota is not expecting any players to opt out of the game; there may still be a couple to watch in that category for West Virginia. When: Dec. 29, 11 a.m. Where: Boston Who: SMU (8–4) vs. Virginia (6–6). SMU’s season in a sentence: Started fast against light competition, ended poorly when the schedule got tough, lost its coach . Virginia’s season in a sentence: Brennan Armstrong, bad defense and Bronco Mendenhall’s sudden resignation . Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse, right down to the confusing title sponsor. (A tech company, not the sushi seasoning.) Line: Virginia by 2. Dash pick: Virginia 45, SMU 37. An interim coach at SMU, Mendenhall coaching his last game at UVA, gunslinger quarterbacks and questionable defenses—this could get wild. Tanner Mordecai and Armstrong will put the pop in the passing game, but two of Mordecai’s top three receivers have both opted out. The Cavaliers have the x-factor advantage in multi-purpose Keytaon Thompson, a former full-time quarterback at Mississippi State they have used creatively all season. Bowl prep affords for more experimenting with the Hoos’ leading receiver and No. 3 rusher. When: Dec. 29, 2:15 p.m. Where: The Bronx Who: Maryland (6–6) vs. Virginia Tech (6–6). Maryland’s season in a sentence: Good Taulia was very good , and Bad Taulia was unable to cover up for a porous defense. Virginia Tech’s season in a sentence: Started nicely and ended nicely, but everything in between was bad enough to cost Justin Fuente his job. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. It doesn’t get any more mediocre than two 6–6 teams from Power 5 conferences who needed to win their last regular-season game to reach .500. Line: Maryland by 1. Dash pick: Maryland 36, Virginia Tech 31. The Terrapins were tested against a tougher schedule, having played (and lost to) four currently ranked opponents. The Taulia Tagovailoa–to–Rakim Jarrett connection should concern the Hokies, who have had four starters opt out of the game. The Terrapins’ suspect run defense must deal with Tech’s Raheem Blackshear, who finished the season strong. When: Dec. 29, 5:45 p.m. Where: Orlando Who: Clemson (9–3) vs. Iowa State (7–5). Clemson’s season in a sentence: The Cheez-It Bowl was not the expected postseason destination. Iowa State’s season in a sentence: Major disappointment lessened by the retention of coach Matt Campbell; now what’s up with everyone hitting the transfer portal? Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better. The Tigers bring a brand name to the affair. Line: Iowa State by 1. Dash pick: Clemson 26, Iowa State 21. This game could be more about who’s missing than who’s present. The Tigers are down both their coordinators, with Brent Venables and Tony Elliott finally taking the leap to head-coaching jobs. Player opt-outs may follow. The Cyclones have had a flow of players into the portal, and it remains to be seen what their depth chart will look like when it’s finally released for this game. Which quarterback can end a disappointing season on a high note, Clemson’s D.J. Uiagalelei or Iowa State’s Brock Purdy? When: Dec. 29, 9:15 p.m. Where: San Antonio Who: Oregon (10–3) vs. Oklahoma (10–2). Oregon’s season in a sentence: Very good run with a major Utah problem, and now another coaching transition. Oklahoma’s season in a sentence: Hugely underwhelming on the field, massively shocking at the end … and is that really Bob Stoops? Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better. Brand names with big talent—and interim coaches. Line: Oklahoma by 4.5. Dash pick: Oregon 37, Oklahoma 34. Anyone who says they know what will happen here is lying. Coaches are missing, star players are missing, motivation is a jump ball for two teams that went late into November harboring College Football Playoff aspirations. But since the Sooners really didn’t do anything impressive all season, the Ducks are the pick here. When: Dec. 30, 11:30 a.m. Where: Charlotte Who: North Carolina (6–6) vs. South Carolina (6–6). North Carolina’s season in a sentence: Didn’t you guys start out in the top 10? South Carolina’s season in a sentence: Pleasantly surprised to be bowling in Year 1 of Beamer (The Younger) Ball. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. This is a game only the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce could love. Line: North Carolina by 7. Dash pick: North Carolina 31, South Carolina 28. Sam Howell is expected to play, giving him the chance to go out in a blaze of Tar Heel glory, but this might be more of a running opportunity than passing, given the state of the Gamecocks’ run defense. Still, South Carolina has shown enough pluck that this could be a game that goes down to the wire. When: Dec. 30, 3 p.m. Where: Nashville Who: Tennessee (7–5) vs. Purdue (8–4). Tennessee’s season in a sentence: Other than trashing its home field , this was a buoyant year as the Josh Heupel era gets a strong start. Purdue’s season in a sentence: Best since the Joe Tiller era. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: A smidge better. Line: Tennessee by 4. Dash pick: Tennessee 42, Purdue 31. When the two best Boilermakers—receiver David Bell and defensive end George Karlaftis—opted out, this matchup took on an orange hue. The Volunteers lost running back Tiyon Evans but still have plenty of firepower to throw at Purdue’s pretty solid defense. Hendon Hooker has had a great season at Tennessee after transferring from Virginia Tech, making the most of the Heupel influence. When: Dec. 30, 7 p.m. Where: Atlanta Who: Michigan State (10–2) vs. Pittsburgh (11–2). Michigan State’s season in a sentence: The program slide was reversed in a dramatic manner , with an immense commitment to continue the upward trend. Pittsburgh’s season in a sentence: Best since the glory days of the 1970s and early ’80s, with a Heisman Trophy finalist leading the way to a first ACC title. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Much better. This is a good one. Line: Michigan State by 1.5. Dash pick: Michigan State 32, Pittsburgh 27. Until Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett and Spartans running back Kenneth Walker III declare their bowl intentions, this is a total crapshoot. The presumption is that Michigan State could better withstand the loss of its top-10 Heisman finisher than Pitt, if they both opt out. If Pickett plays, he could put on an epic display against the Spartans’ porous pass defense. When: Dec. 30, 10:30 p.m. Where: Las Vegas Who: Wisconsin (8–4) vs. Arizona State (8–4). Wisconsin’s season in a sentence: Seven solid Saturdays from Oct. 9 to Nov. 20; everything before and after was an offensive debacle. Arizona State’s season in a sentence: A lot of buildup, not much delivery. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Perhaps a smidge better. Line: Wisconsin by 7. Dash pick: Wisconsin 24, Arizona State 13. The Badgers were better against a tougher schedule. The Sun Devils beat exactly one team that finished with a winning record (UCLA), losing to the other four. ASU will be down a couple of running backs, putting more on the shoulders of quarterback Jayden Daniels, who hasn’t had a great season passing the ball. Then again, neither has his counterpart, Graham Mertz. Paul Chryst has a 6–2 bowl record. Daniels, the ASU QB, has already announced he will return for 2022. Mark J. Rebilas/USA TODAY Sports When: Dec. 31, 11 a.m. Where: Jacksonville Who: Wake Forest (10–3) vs. Texas A&M (8–4). Wake Forest season in a sentence: One of the most successful and entertaining in school history ; Slow Mesh forever. Texas A&M season in a sentence: Not really the stuff of $90 million contracts. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better. This should be quality entertainment. Line: Texas A&M by 7. Dash pick: Wake Forest 36, Texas A&M 34. If this were a regular-season game, the Aggies would be the pick. But quarterback Zach Calzada hit the portal, star defensive lineman DeMarvin Leal and safety Leon O’Neal Jr. opted out, and defensive coordinator Mike Elko took the Duke job. Too much upheaval, not enough playmakers to beat a veteran Wake Forest team that thrives on continuity. When: Dec. 31, 2 p.m. Where: El Paso Who: Washington State (7–5) vs. Miami (7–5). Washington State’s season in a sentence: This one deserves its own paragraph, with Nick Rolovich and some assistants being fired in October for failing to comply with the state vaccine mandate and being replaced with interim coach Jake Dickert, who did so well that he got the full-time job after a 7–5 surprise. Miami’s season in a sentence: Messy, with a 2–4 start and a 5–1 finish and a quarterback change and ultimately changes at the athletic-director and head-coach levels, but not until after the school treated Manny Diaz like dirt on the way to hiring Mario Cristobal. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. The Survivors of In-Season Mayhem Bowl feels like a subaverage performance in the making. Line: Miami by 2. Dash pick: Washington State 25, Miami 24. This is the Hurricanes’ third Sun Bowl, all three of them coming after firing their head coach (the dysfunction is real in Coral Gables). Miami is 0–2 in the other Sun Bowls under interim coaches, so make it 0–3. The Cougars had leading rusher Max Borghi opt out, but the offense is more of a Jayden de Laura production, anyway. Key stat: Wazzu is plus-10 turnover margin to Miami’s minus-6. When: Dec. 31, 2 p.m. Where: Tucson Who: Central Michigan (8–4) vs. Boise State (7–5). Central Michigan’s season in a sentence: A 4–4 start and a 4–0 finish powered by running back Lew Nichols III, the nation’s leading rusher. Boise State’s season in a sentence: Worst regular-season record since 1998, as the Andy Avalos era struggled to get off the ground against a stout schedule. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse. A MAC vs. MWC also-ran matchup doesn’t move the needle past average. Line: Boise State by 8.5. Dash pick: Boise State 28, Central Michigan 24. The Chippewas are the hotter team, but the Broncos played the harder schedule. Boise’s run defense improved in the last five games and should be able to avoid being trampled by Nichols, who finished the season on a tear. When: Jan. 1, 12 p.m. Where: Tampa Who: Penn State (7–5) vs. Arkansas (8–4). Penn State’s season in a sentence: Winless in four games decided by fewer than five points, as the clutch play against Wisconsin and Auburn in September evaporated in October and November. Arkansas’s season in a sentence: Best since Bobby Petrino, without the motorcycle scandal. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better, since the Pig People should show up in force for their first bowl game since 2016. Line: Penn State by 2.5. Dash pick: Penn State 27, Arkansas 21. One of two star receivers in the game has opted out—that’s the Razorbacks’ Treylon Burks. We’ll see whether the Nittany Lions’ Jahan Dotson joins him (James Franklin said he generally leaves it to the players to make those kinds of announcements themselves). The Hogs certainly figure to be the more excited party for this game, but if Penn State protects Sean Clifford he could exploit their pass defense. When: Jan. 1, 1 p.m. Where: Orlando Who: Iowa (10–3) vs. Kentucky (9–3). Iowa’s season in a sentence: Some great moments, and not all of them were punts. Kentucky’s season in a sentence: Solo second place in the SEC East is UK’s best league finish since 1976. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Better, although this could be a bit of a stylistic slog. Line: Kentucky by 2.5. Dash pick: Kentucky 22, Iowa 17. Hawkeyes running back Tyler Goodson opted out, which reduces the Iowa offense to tight end Sam LaPorta catching passes from a pair of scatter-armed quarterbacks. Can All-American center Tyler Linderbaum play fullback, too? For the Wildcats, the key is to not commit gobs of turnovers against a team that produces gobs of takeaways. Iowa is plus-13 and Kentucky is minus-13, but much of that was early in the season. When: Jan. 1, 1 p.m. Where: Glendale, Ariz. Who: Oklahoma State (11–2) vs. Notre Dame (11–1) Oklahoma State’s season in a sentence: Inches short—in Ames and in Arlington—of potential perfection. Notre Dame’s season in a sentence: Everything was wonderful until Brian Kelly wound up talking like Foghorn Leghorn one strange night in Baton Rouge. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Far better, one of the best of this bowl season. Line: Notre Dame by 2. Dash pick: Notre Dame 24, Oklahoma State 21. The Fighting Irish had safety Kyle Hamilton and running back Kyren Williams opt out, but Hamilton has been out for weeks with an injury, anyway. Mike Gundy has covered the spread in his last five bowl games but lost star defensive coordinator Jim Knowles to Ohio State. The expectation is that the Irish will be an energized team after the promotion of popular Marcus Freeman to head coach and the retention of the core of the staff. Will the Cowboys be demoralized over what they lost in the Big 12 title game? When: Jan. 1, 5 p.m. Where: Pasadena, Calif. Who: Utah (10–3) vs. Ohio State (10–2). Utah’s season in a sentence: Against a backdrop of tragedy , the Utes fashioned one of their best seasons, and it will culminate in their first Rose Bowl. Ohio State’s season in a sentence: No trip to Indianapolis, no berth in the Playoff and a blowout loss to Michigan makes 10–2 feel quite disappointing. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: The worst Rose Bowl is always better than the best Liberty Bowl, and this is not the worst Rose Bowl. Line: Ohio State by 6.5. Dash pick: Ohio State 34, Utah 31. If Buckeyes wide receivers Garrett Wilson and Chris Olave don’t play, you can flip this pick—they and others have yet to declare their intention for this game, although coach Ryan Day said last week that he expects to have everyone in action. If Ohio State is missing some studs, the building blocks for a Utes upset are there: a physical running game against a defense that was trampled by Michigan; Kyle Whittingham’s ridiculous 11–3 bowl record (though he’s lost his last two); the record against Oregon (the Utes were an easy 2–0, the Buckeyes 0–1); and sky-high motivation against a blueblood opponent in a blueblood game. Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral will end his college career with the Sugar Bowl. Matt Bush/USA TODAY Sports When: Jan. 1, 8:45 p.m. Where: New Orleans Who: Mississippi (10–2) vs. Baylor (11–2). Mississippi’s season in a sentence: Perfect outside the state of Alabama, and it held on to Lane Kiffin through the coaching carousel. Baylor’s season in a sentence: Could a surprise season end any better than a goal-line stand to win the Big 12 championship? Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Far better in every category. Line: Baylor by 1. Dash pick: Baylor 28, Mississippi 25. The Bears have two very good running backs and a mobile quarterback, if Gerry Bohanon is back from injury. The Rebels have issues stopping the run. That could be the difference in this game, unless Matt Corral just decides to go ballistic and win it on his own for Ole Miss. When: Jan. 4, 9 p.m. Where: Houston Who: LSU (6–6) vs. Kansas State (7–5) LSU’s season in a sentence: The disaster escalated quickly. Kansas State’s season in a sentence: Streak City—win three, lose three, win four, lose two. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Worse, without question. Line: Kansas State by 1. Dash pick: Kansas State 23, LSU 21. This game is utter mayhem. Nobody knows who will play quarterback (due to injury at K-State and transfers at LSU). K-State will have an interim offensive coordinator, and LSU has an interim everything. More could change between now and the kickoff for a game weirdly scheduled on Jan. 4. When: Dec. 31, 3:30 p.m. Where: Arlington, Texas Who: Cincinnati (13–0) vs. Alabama (12–1) Cincinnati’s season in a sentence: Best in school history, capped with a barrier-breaking Playoff bid and retention of star coach Luke Fickell . Alabama’s season in a sentence: Narrow escape on The Plains followed by no doubts in Atlanta. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Slightly better. Line: Alabama by 13.5. Dash pick: Alabama 28, Cincinnati 13. The Bearcats are a legitimate Playoff team that will not be scared of the moment and should give the Crimson Tide offense some problems—especially with wide receiver John Metchie III out. But the two major problems for Cincy are these: how to block monster linebacker Will Anderson and trying to shock the world with an unreliable kicker. Problems up front will mean problems for Desmond Ridder, and Cincinnati cannot win without a great game from him. And there is the fact that Nick Saban doesn’t just tend to win semifinal games; he tends to win big. When: Dec. 31, 7:30 p.m. Where: Miami Gardens, Fla. Who: Georgia (12–1) vs. Michigan (12–1) Georgia’s season in a sentence: Dreamy, other than Alabama—again. Michigan’s season in a sentence: What it’s been waiting for since 1997, and certainly since 2015. Better or worse than the 1973 Liberty Bowl: Also slightly better. Line: Georgia by 8. Dash pick: Georgia 21, Michigan 17. The spread is too big, but the Bulldogs’ defense is too good to be shredded for the second game in a row. Unless the Wolverines can hit some big plays in the passing game or via trickeration—which isn’t out of the question—an offense reliant on ground-and-pound running will struggle against the imposing Georgia front seven. The other issue: The teams that bothered Georgia’s defense the most (Alabama and Tennessee) did it with super tempo, which isn’t really in Michigan’s wheelhouse. The huge question for the Bulldogs is whether Stetson Bennett is the quarterback and how he fares with Aidan Hutchinson and David Ojabo chasing him. Wouldn’t be a shock to see JT Daniels early if Georgia’s first couple of drives falter. When: Jan. 10, 8 p.m. Where: Indianapolis. Who: Alabama vs. Georgia in the Greg Sankey Invitational, as the rest of the nation convulses in outrage. Dash pick: Alabama 26, Georgia 23. Tide win on a touchdown bomb in overtime by Paul Tyson to Ja’Corey Brooks. Or something like that.

There was Simon Jones and his knee, Steve Harmison and his yips, Chris Silverwood and his playing career. Coin tosses lost when they hurt most, won when they would have been better avoided. Coming to Australia to win was hard enough, but the dark hand of fate would still see fit to intervene. For a couple of hours on Thursday morning Adelaide time, fate settled on a different target. That was when the news came through that the Australia captain, Pat Cummins, though fit, was ruled out of the imminent Test match after being identified as a close contact of a positive Covid-19 case. Through those pre-match warm-ups, through the early anticipation, some English minds would have wondered if this was a series turning point, the new version of Glenn McGrath rolling an ankle at Edgbaston in 2005 . Cummins had been out for dinner in Adelaide on Wednesday evening, seated near a recent arrival from Sydney who during his meal received a text message saying he had tested positive for the virus. This was because South Australian rules require interstate travellers to be tested on arrival, but not to await their results in quarantine. Cummins was accordingly deemed a close contact and now has to stay in isolation for seven days pending negative tests. While plenty of other places have grown jaded or complacent about the virus, South Australia has so far avoided most of its impact. In the past two days, the entire state recorded 25 and 24 new official cases respectively. Having recently opened their borders, local authorities are trying to keep those numbers to a slow climb while still allowing interstate movement and commerce. Cummins has been caught in the compromise. The Australia captain did not do anything risky: Cricket Australia has been flexible with players this season, allowing latitude for socialising after so many biosecure events. CA’s chief executive, Nick Hockley, did suggest they would revisit rules to ask players to only eat outside at restaurants: the bowlers Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon did just that at the same venue as Cummins, and so avoided being sent to quarantine themselves. Yet for all the dislocation of losing their captain on the morning of a match, Australia not only weathered the storm but prospered. CA got what the organisation wanted when recently installing Steve Smith as vice-captain: a chance for him to lead the team once again after his 2018 sacking during the sandpaper affair , without weathering the criticism of giving him the leadership outright. Smith won the toss, and with it an all-important chance to bat first. England began a day and a night of toil. For all the talk of the pink Kookaburra cricket ball that can offer swing, it travelled through the air as straight as a billiard cue. Across the opening hours of a blamelessly dry and sunny afternoon, CricViz ball-tracking data detected the least first-day swing of any Test in Australia for seven years. Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson got some balls to move off the seam but they passed harmlessly far from the edge of the bat, coming from a length too short just like when the same bowlers opened proceedings at this venue in 2017. So the wheel of luck briskly turned. Australia had been extremely unfortunate to have Cummins ruled out, but the instability of that removal was not compounded. Australia were already missing Josh Hazlewood with a side strain, meaning the premier pair of fast bowlers had suddenly vanished. Jhye Richardson and Michael Neser are quality replacements, but Richardson played his two Tests nearly three years ago and Neser is on debut. Had they been the ones offered no assistance by conditions on the first day, the chance to put them under pressure could well have been taken even by England’s suspect batting. Instead the task of steadying the side fell to those best qualified to do it with the bat: David Warner, Marnus Labuschagne and Smith . The former pair proceeded slowly through the first two sessions, but only in the face of bowling that was steady rather than suffocating. Jos Buttler bookended the day with dropped catches from Labuschagne, aside from which only a few false shots were drawn. For much of the journey it seemed the Australians were less concerned with the runs they could score on day one and more with making sure England would be bowling on day two, with a forecast of 37C before it drops to civilised numbers later in the week. They were also happy to watch England’s over rate drag out, leaving the visitors scrambling to fit in nine overs with a new ball under floodlights after the 80th over. The fifth of those precious overs brought the spurned edge from Labuschagne; the potential 10th of those precious overs was lost. By stubbornness and attrition, Australia turned a bad situation firmly to their advantage. They will resume on the second day on 221 for two, with plenty of time in hand. If good enough with the bat, they may be able to choose to bowl in the evening session. When they do bowl, their inexperienced replacements will be backed by runs. Into the bargain, Cummins gets a rest in the series without the palaver that would have accompanied it had the captain been rested. There are days to go, but so far Australia’s big stroke of bad luck has not done much harm.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13928f7652f3250a40cc0a5f7aeb45005221f8b4/6_211_3883_2330/master/3883.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e29c73d330e743ece3583ae1b245241","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Kohli-led India team lands in South Africa for three-match Test series","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/kohli-led-india-team-lands-in-south-africa-for-three-match-test-series-121121600979_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Indian cricket team, led by skipper Virat Kohli, landed here on Thursday for the three-match Test series against South Africa, beginning on the Boxing Day at Centurion.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-16 13:37:00","full_description":"The Indian cricket team, led by skipper Virat Kohli, landed here on Thursday for the three-match Test series against South Africa, beginning on the Boxing Day at Centurion. \"Touchdown South Africa,\" the BCCI tweeted from its official twitter handle along with pictures of team members, including Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara, Shardul Thakur and Shreyas Iyer among others.

Following the first Ashes Test in Brisbane, England players were fined 100 per cent of their match fee and deducted five World Test Championship points after match referee David Boon pinged the tourists for not getting through enough overs on day two. Speaking on Fox Cricket’s The Follow-On podcast , veteran News Corp reporter Robert Craddock revealed the fines were collectively worth about $300,000. Catch every moment of The Ashes live and ad-break free during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Try 14-days free now. But the sanctions seemingly weren’t enough to spur England into getting through their overs at a quicker tempo. Play was scheduled to finish at Adelaide Oval at 9.30pm local time on Thursday, but England had only bowled 73 overs when the iconic scoreboard’s clock ticked past 9pm. An additional 30 minutes were played to achieve the required overs, but England still fell short of the minimum target. Depending on Boon’s assessment of the play’s action, Joe Root and his teammates could be staring down the barrel of yet another penalty. England did not select a strike spinner for the second Test, opting instead for a five-man pack attack. Root bowled 11 overs of his part-time off-spin in the hope of racing through some overs, much to the frustration of former Australian captain Mark Taylor. “He has brought himself on now and he’s bowling in at leg stump or down the leg side just to get through these overs,” he said on Triple M commentary. “How about getting a wicket or two and then taking the new ball? I think the tactics are terrible, they stink.” 53 overs in 2 sessionsâ¦. Looks like England are hardly going to get any overs with a 2nd new ball under lights tonight through their own doing. I know itâs hot out there but itâs heading for 40 degrees tmrw if England are still bowling into day twoâ¦ #Ashes This over rate is horrible. Wonât get 90 overs inâ¦.again! #Ashes New slow over rates thought: Teams so obviously behind the rate as England are now, don't get the benefit of the new ball.. #Ashes Speaking on Fox Cricket, Australian great Shane Warne suggested that captains should receive one-match bans if their side is slack in the field. “I sit on the World Cricket Committee, and often talk about the over-rate issue and what’s the appropriate fine,” he explained. “A lot of us on that committee have talked about not having a fine for over-rates, but the captain misses the next game, because if you don’t bowl your overs in time, the financial penalties don’t seem to be working, and they haven’t worked for a while. “In the first Test, the entire England team got fined their entire match fee, and they’re still miles behind in this match. “What about the people that paid their money up in the Gabba to see a full day’s play of 90 overs? They’ve been robbed. “If the captain doesn’t play the next Test if you don’t bowl your overs in time, you watch them get through the overs.” Warne also pointed out that by falling behind the required over-rate, England had cost themselves precious time with the swinging pink Kookaburra under artificial lights. “They’re penalising themselves,” he said. “This is the one Test match you don’t want to be short of your over-rate. “You want as much time as you can under lights with the hard, new ball.” England was not helped by a lengthy DRS review in the first session, where third umpire Paul Reiffel examined footage of David Warner hitting the ball onto his front pad for about five minutes. The batting side is sometimes responsible for slow over-rates as well – for example, Australian captain Steve Smith signalled to the dressing room for new gloves after just 15 deliveries at the crease on Thursday. Speaking to reporters at stumps, England assistant coach Graham Thorpe suggested “temperatures” and the “make-up of the team” were partly to blame. “I think there’s bigger things going on in the world than over-rates,” he said. “You get through as quick as you can – reviews are taking time to get through as well, sometimes batsmen aren’t ready. “Minutes get lost throughout the day’s cricket. It’s just one those things in Test cricket. “We’d like it all to be more perfect and everything, but it isn’t. “It’s challenging at times – everyone thinks it’s straightforward getting through at the perfect time, but it isn’t. It’s much harder.” Australia is 2/221 at stumps on day one, with Marnus Labuschagne unbeaten on 95 and Smith on 18 at the other end. The second Ashes Test will resume on Friday afternoon at 3pm AEDT. David Warner was caught out by the stump microphone after being brought undone on a day where Australia pummelled England. Pat Cummins has missed the day-night Ashes Test due to the South Australian Government’s “embarrassing” Covid-19 rules. The man at the centre of Pat Cummins’ shock Ashes exit has been revealed. The individual is reportedly “rattled” by his Covid news.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"‘They stink’: Aussie greats blast sloppy Poms","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/affiliates/kayo/theyve-been-robbed-shane-warne-calls-for-captaincy-ban-to-solve-overrates-crisis/news-story/d36f856baf15b84379b098bf31d2f9de","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England has once again failed to get through 90 overs in a day of Test cricket, sparking debate over the sanctions imposed on sides with slow over-rates.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-16 13:28:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost"},{"title":"SA vs IND: Team India land in South Africa for Test series","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/south-africa-vs-india-2021-22-team-india-land-in-south-africa-for-test-series-sa-vs-ind-749918","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Indian cricket team, led by skipper Virat Kohli, landed here on Thursday for the three-match Test series against South Africa, beginning December 26 at Centurion.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-16 13:12:15","full_description":"The Indian cricket team, led by skipper , landed here on Thursday for the three-match Test series against South Africa, beginning December 26 at Centurion. \"Touchdown South Africa,\" the BCCI posted on its official Twitter handle along with pictures of team members, including Test specialist , Shardul Thakur and Shreyas Iyer among others. The Kohli-led Test side had departed from Mumbai for the tour that also includes three ODIs in January. Given the threat posed by the new COVID-19 variant Omicron, the tour's T20 matches have been postponed for now and the two teams will stay in a bio-bubble for the duration of the series. Star opener and newly-appointed white ball captain has been ruled out after sustaining a left hamstring injury during a training session in Mumbai. He was replaced by talented Gujarat opener Priyank Panchal. The side's build-up to the series has been marred by controversies surrounding captaincy and the issue snowballed into a major controversy on Wednesday when Kohli said that the Board's assertion of trying to stop him from giving up T20 captaincy was \"inaccurate.\" He stepped down as T20 captain after the disastrous World Cup campaign in the UAE and was subsequently removed as ODI captain earlier this month. While the series-opener will be hosted by Centurion, the other two Tests will be played at Johannesburg and Cape Town respectively. The Test team's vice captain is yet to be announced after Rohit's injury. He had replaced a woefully out of form .","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"Stumps: Ashes Daily – England made to toil by Aussies on Day 1","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/stumps-ashes-daily-england-made-to-toil-by-aussies-on-day-1/video/dc3c1bf870f6039186f0003be9146068","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Following patient knocks from David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne, Australia enter Day 2 of the second Test in Adelaide in a commanding position.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-16 12:44:05","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost"},{"title":"Stumps: Ashes Daily – England made to toil by Aussies on Day 1","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/stumps-ashes-daily-england-made-to-toil-by-aussies-on-day-1/video/dc3c1bf870f6039186f0003be9146068","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Following patient knocks from David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne, Australia enter Day 2 of the second Test in Adelaide in a commanding position.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-16 12:44:05","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Warner & Labuschagne put Aussies in control on Day 1","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/warner-labuschagne-put-aussies-in-control-on-day-1/video/a5dcafdbff16b05e067106d1b461a075","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Despite the sudden absence of Pat Cummins due to a COVID scare, Australia are well on top following Day 1 of the second Test.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-16 12:40:06","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Warner & Labuschagne put Aussies in control on Day 1","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/warner-labuschagne-put-aussies-in-control-on-day-1/video/a5dcafdbff16b05e067106d1b461a075","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Despite the sudden absence of Pat Cummins due to a COVID scare, Australia are well on top following Day 1 of the second Test.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-16 12:40:06","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost"},{"title":"‘You get them 999 times out of 1000’: Cricket world loses it over ‘unfathomable’ drop - Fox Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L2NyaWNrZXQvdGhlLWFzaGVzL3lvdS1nZXQtdGhlbS05OTktdGltZXMtb3V0LW9mLTEwMDAtY3JpY2tldC13b3JsZC1sb3Nlcy1pdC1vdmVyLXVuZmF0aG9tYWJsZS1kcm9wL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNmYxOWQyODQwOWMzMWNjOWViNGM4NGJhNDhiNjY3ZDjSAasBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94c3BvcnRzLmNvbS5hdS9jcmlja2V0L3RoZS1hc2hlcy95b3UtZ2V0LXRoZW0tOTk5LXRpbWVzLW91dC1vZi0xMDAwLWNyaWNrZXQtd29ybGQtbG9zZXMtaXQtb3Zlci11bmZhdGhvbWFibGUtZHJvcC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzZmMTlkMjg0MDljMzFjYzllYjRjODRiYTQ4YjY2N2Q4?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"‘You get them 999 times out of 1000’: Cricket world loses it over ‘unfathomable’ drop  Fox Sports‘Ridiculous call’: Ashes star torn to shreds  NEWS.com.auOur Call Of Dave Warner Getting Out In The 90s… Again  Triple MAgony and ecstasy for Jos Buttler in tense day at Adelaide Oval  Wide World of SportsHarris has one knock to save Test career after ‘absolute screamer’ extends horror record  Fox SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-16 12:25:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"}]}
