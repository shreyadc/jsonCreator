Having ascertained their status as a dangerous white-ball team, Afghanistan would look to elevate their credentials as a Test team too as they take on Bangladesh in a one-off Test. However, the Afghans will be missing their talismanic spinner Rashid Khan in the match. So would be Bangladesh who are without the services of Shakib al Hasan in the contest. ( LIVE Scorecard ) TOSS - Afghanistan have won the toss and will BOWL first! Hello and welcome to Day 1 of this one-off test match between Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Two Asian teams go against each other in the longest format after a long time. The visitors will be playing Teat cricket after almost two years. However, a lot has changed in the Afghan side and in a better way. In this match, they will be without their premium bowler, Rashid Khan but so will be Bangladesh who will be without Shakib Al Hasan. Both teams still have a balanced squad and expect a lot of excitement in this match. Stay tuned for toss and other updates. ...Day 1, Session 1... Test cricket is back with all the excitement and we have a historic one-off Test match between Bangladesh and Afghanistan at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium. The Afghans last played in this format almost two years ago against Zimbabwe where they drew 1-1, but this huge gap could make a huge difference in their performance. Hashmatullah Shahidi's side returns to Test cricket after a long time, and this game will see several players making their debuts. The side is without its top bowlers, who have been rested for this series and they will need to make the most of the available resources. Ibrahim Zadran and Nasir Jamal need to build a solid foundation at the top for them but their strength lies in the middle order with Rahmat Shah, Shahidi, and Abdul Malik. The bowling attack will be tested and they will need Amir Hamza, Izharulhaq Naveed, and Zahir Khan to show their quality along with Karim Janat who could use his experience to get ahead of the hosts. They have some quality spinners in their ranks and on this wicket, they are going to be the most crucial for them. They know that this is not going to be easy but they surely won't go down without a fight. Bangladesh, on the other hand, have a really good record at home in recent times and they will look to extend it after defeating the Irish in their last Test match. Litton Das will be leading the side in the absence of Shakib due to an injury. They have Najmul Hossain Shanto and Tamim Iqbal at the top of the order who would like to score big in this game. Their middle order is also a solid one with the likes of Mushfiqur Rahim, Mominul Haque, and Das. Ebadot Hossain and Mehidy Hasan will look to use the conditions well in this game and trouble the Afghans while Taijul Islam will provide them with the required support. The last time these two sides met in the longest format, it was the Afghans who came out on top. Will they be able to repeat that feat again? Or will Bangladesh avenge their defeat? Let's find out together.","pubDate":"2023-06-14 03:10:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"KL Rahul Begins Extensive Rehab At NCA","link":"https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/kl-rahul-begins-extensive-rehab-at-nca-1608917","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP News Bureau"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bengaluru: Senior Indian cricketer KL Rahul has arrived at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) to commence an extensive rehabilitation program following a thigh surgery.

However, a trainer of the RR team has now revealed that he had asked Samson to join a 'big team' in the IPL after the conclusion of the 2021 season. Samson, who joined the Royals for the second time in 2018, has been a consistent member of the team. As per RR trainer Rajamani Prabhu, there Samson had the opportunity to join a different team but he decided to stay out of his loyalty. \"I told Sanju Samson to join some big teams in IPL after 2021 but he replied that I want to make Rajasthan Royals a big team, he further told that let's bring big players like Ashwin, Chahal, Prasidh into the team.

Chasing 444, the Rohit Sharma -led side was bundled out for 234 and lost a brilliant opportunity of winning an ICC title after a hiatus of 10 years. Many disappointed fans have demanded the removal of skipper Rohit and head coach Rahul Dravid but former India captain Sourav Ganguly completely backed the duo and shut the trolls in a commendable manner. The duo of Rohit and Dravid took charge after India were knocked out of the T20 World Cup in 2021. However, the team's fate has remained the same as they are still in search of their next ICC trophy. Team India won their last ICC title back in 2013, where they defeated England to lift the Champions Trophy. Speaking on India Today , Ganguly hit out at the trolls on social media for spreading such rumors and said that it will be the \"selector's job\" if there will be any change in the management. \"It's a selector's job at the end of the day but how does social media influence? Virat himself didn't want to captain Test cricket two years ago. If you ask me who should be and will be India's captain and coach? Rohit and Rahul that's the right way of all,\" said Ganguly. \"Absolutely, at least till the World Cup, this will continue. Well, I don't know what's in Rohit's mind after the World Cup and what he wants to do. At the moment the coach and captain are the two best for India and I wish them all the luck,\" he added. Earlier, Dravid had expressed disappointment after India's loss and stated that things could have been different if they would have got three weeks' time to practice. \"Never going to be happy with the prep as a coach (enough preparation time?) . But that's the reality we are faced with. Coming here three weeks earlier, having a practice game would be ideal. But we have to make do with what we can. Don't think we should make excuses,\" Dravid told Star Sports after the match. Australia were clearly the better team on all fronts while India had only themselves to blame for yet another loss in a global event. India's last ICC title came way back in 2013 and it was their second successive defeat in the WTC final, having gone down against New Zealand two years ago. India lost seven wickets for the addition of 70 runs on the final day.

For the second time in two consecutive editions, the men from the subcontinent fell at the final hurdle, this time going down to Australia in the title-decider. Two years ago, it was the New Zealand team that had prevented India from bagging the Test mace. The team's repeated failures on the big stage have even left the critics short of words, with the crux of the story of India's downfall seeing the team repeating similar mistakes. R Ashwin's Mysterious Absence There's arguably no man in the world who studies his opponents the way Ravichandran Ashwin does. The off-spinner has learned from every mistake in his career to make stronger comebacks. A true legend in the Test format, Ashwin had reportedly started preparations for the World Test Championship final during the Indian Premier League. But, when the day of reckoning came, he found himself warming the bench for India's most important Test match in the last two years. The Indian team management had its reasons but Ashwin's absence against a team that had 5 left-handers was beyond baffling. Even the great Sachin Tendulkar couldn't digest the fact that India had left Ashwin out of the XI. IPL Fatigue Whenever India disappoint in an ICC event, the blame drops hard on the Indian Premier League. Though there's no denying that the cricketing universe is quickly transitioning into a franchise-based ecosystem, the fact that Indian players had to play the WTC final not long after the conclusion of the T20 league, could've played its role. The likes of Shubman Gill , Rohit Sharma , Virat Kohli , and a number of other players who were busy playing for their franchises till the business end of the IPL 2023 season struggled for form against a more hungry Australian side. For Australia, in comparison, the likes of Steve Smith, Travis Head , Scott Boland , Nathan Lyon , Mitchell Starc , Pat Cummins , and a few others didn't even feature in the 16th edition of the IPL. Going forward, Indian players would need to prioritise as WTC finals are likely to be held in June, not long after the conclusion of IPL seasons. Advertisement Misfiring top-order Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara , and Virat Kohli, all punched below their weight, scoring a total of 193 runs cumulatively in the match. It was only because of Ajinkya Rahane 's 89 and Shardul Thakur 's 51 in the first innings that India managed to reach a pride-saving total of 296 runs. Barring them, no batter could score a half-century. In the second innings, the likes of Rohit, Pujara, Kohli and Rahane got off to fine starts but couldn't convert them to big scores. As former India captain Sourav Ganguly rightly pointed out after the match, the averages of Indian batters have drastically reduced over the last couple of years. The shot selection of some players, including Kohli, is bound to be questioned. In events like the WTC final, even the big names couldn't stand up and deliver.","pubDate":"2023-06-14 02:21:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WTC फायनलमधील पराभवानंतर प्रशिक्षक राहुल द्रविडला BCCI कडून इशारा, गोलंदाजी आणि फलंदाजी कोचबाबतही मोठा निर्णय होण्याची शक्यता","link":"https://marathi.abplive.com/sports/cricket/bcci-warns-team-india-support-staff-after-wtc-loss-head-coach-rahul-dravid-vikram-rathour-and-bowling-coach-paras-mhambrey-asia-cup-2023-cricket-marathi-news-1184057","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":["एबीपी माझा स्पोर्ट्स डेस्क"],"video_url":null,"description":"BCCI Warns Indian Team Support Staff : भारताकडून दुसऱ्यांदा जागतिक कसोटी विश्वचषकाचं (ICC World Test Championship) विजेतेपद हुकलं आहे. टीम इंडिया (Team India) वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चॅम्पियनशीप अंतिम सामन्यापर्यंत (WTC Final 2023) पोहोचली पण, भारतीय संघाला विजय मिळवता आला नाही. वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चॅम्पियनशीपमधील (WTC) पराभवानंतर टीम इंडियाच्या (Team India) खेळांडूसह आता सपोर्ट स्टाफवरही (Team India Support Staff) टीका करण्यात येत आहे.

RR had a great start to their IPL 2023 campaign but eventually finished on the fifth place on the league table with 14 points and failed to make it to the Playoffs. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-6601185-5\"); });","pubDate":"2023-06-14 03:38:41","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2023/06/14/8c4510896d67af2f9e1d9f076b9364a61686713644527625_original.jpg","source_id":"abplive","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"न्यूजीलैंड को करारा झटका, चोट के चलते वर्ल्ड कप 2023 से बाहर हुआ अहम ऑलराउंडर","link":"https://hindi.oneindia.com/news/sports/cricket/new-zealand-michael-bracewell-is-to-undergo-surgery-of-achilles-tendon-he-is-out-of-world-cup-2023-781465.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"भारत में होने वाले आईसीसी 50 ओवर वर्ल्ड कप से पहले न्यूजीलैंड के स्पिन ऑलराउंडर माइकल ब्रेसवेल इंग्लैंड में T20 ब्लास्ट क्रिकेट टूर्नामेंट खेलने के दौरान अपने दाएं अकिलीज़ टंडन को चोटिल करवा बैठे हैं, जिसके चलते वे 6 से 8 महीने के लिए क्रिकेट से बाहर हो गए हैं। इसका मतलब यह है कि वह वर्ल्ड कप को मिस करने जा रहे हैं","content":"न्यूजीलैंड (New Zealand Cricket Team) के ऑलराउंडर माइकल ब्रेसवेल (Michael Bracewell) वनडे वर्ल्ड कप (ODI World Cup 2023) से बाहर हो गए हैं। आईसीसी वनडे वर्ल्ड कप 2023 अक्टूबर-नवंबर के महीने में इसी साल भारत में होने जा रहा है, जिसकी डेट आधिकारिक तौर पर आनी बाकी है। न्यूजीलैंड के लिए माइकल ब्रेसवेल एक बहुत अच्छे खिलाड़ी हो सकते थे, जिनको वे इस विश्व कप में देख सकते थे। लेकिन, स्पिन ऑलराउंडर ने इंग्लैंड में T20 ब्लास्ट टूर्नामेंट के दौरान वोस्टरशायर रैपिड्स की ओर से खेलते हुए अपने दाएं अकिलीज़ टेंडन (Achilles tendon Injury) को चोटिल कर लिया है। माइकल ब्रेसवेल ब्रिटेन में गुरुवार को सर्जरी कराएंगे, जिसके बाद उन्हें 6 से 8 महीने रिकवरी में लगेंगे। टेंडन की चोट की रिकवरी मसल्स की चोट की तुलना में काफी धीरे होती है, और यही बात लिगामेंट के लिए भी सच है। न्यूजीलैंड के हेड कोच गैरी स्टीड ने एक बयान में इसकी पुष्टि करते हुए दुख भी जताया है, 'जहां वे कहते हैं, सबसे पहले तो आपको उस खिलाड़ी को लेकर थोड़ा दुख होता है, जब चोट लग जाए, और वह भी तब, जब आपके सामने एक वर्ल्ड इवेंट हो।' कोच ने आगे कहा कि कहा कि, माइकल स्वभाविक तौर पर काफी परेशान हैं। लेकिन साथ ही यह चीज भी सच है कि चोट खेल का हिस्सा होती हैं, और अब वे अपने रिहैबिलिटेशन पर फोकस शिफ्ट कर रहे हैं। न्यूजीलैंड आईसीसी वर्ल्ड कप टूर्नामेंट में काफी अच्छा खेलता रहा है हालांकि उनके पास कोई 50 ओवर वर्ल्ड कप ट्रॉफी नहीं है, लेकिन उन्होंने पहली वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप साइकल जीतने के साथ आईसीसी की बड़ी ट्रॉफी के सूखे को समाप्त किया था। इससे पहले वे 2019 में इंग्लैंड में हुए वर्ल्ड कप में रनर-अप रह चुके हैं, जहां दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण तरीके से 'बाउंड्री अकाउंट नियम' ने उन्हें विजेता होने से बाहर कर दिया था।","pubDate":"2023-06-14 03:12:02","image_url":null,"source_id":"oneindia","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"BAN vs AFG Test Live: Rashid Khan-Less Afghanistan Up Against Bangladesh","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/bangladesh-vs-afghanistan-one-off-test-live-cricket-score-and-updates-4119382","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"BAN vs AFG one-off Test: Afghanistan look to prove their test credentials against the more-experienced Bangladesh side.","content":"Bangladesh vs Afghanistan one-off Test Live Score: A new challenge awaits the brave Afghanistan side that has grown leaps and bounds over the last couple of years. Having ascertained their status as a dangerous white-ball team, Afghanistan would look to elevate their credentials as a Test team too as they take on Bangladesh in a one-off Test. However, the Afghans will be missing their talismanic spinner Rashid Khan in the match. So would be Bangladesh who are without the services of Shakib al Hasan in the contest. ( LIVE Scorecard ) TOSS - Afghanistan have won the toss and will BOWL first! Hello and welcome to Day 1 of this one-off test match between Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Two Asian teams go against each other in the longest format after a long time. The visitors will be playing Teat cricket after almost two years. However, a lot has changed in the Afghan side and in a better way. In this match, they will be without their premium bowler, Rashid Khan but so will be Bangladesh who will be without Shakib Al Hasan. Both teams still have a balanced squad and expect a lot of excitement in this match. Stay tuned for toss and other updates. ...Day 1, Session 1... Test cricket is back with all the excitement and we have a historic one-off Test match between Bangladesh and Afghanistan at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium. The Afghans last played in this format almost two years ago against Zimbabwe where they drew 1-1, but this huge gap could make a huge difference in their performance. Hashmatullah Shahidi's side returns to Test cricket after a long time, and this game will see several players making their debuts. The side is without its top bowlers, who have been rested for this series and they will need to make the most of the available resources. Ibrahim Zadran and Nasir Jamal need to build a solid foundation at the top for them but their strength lies in the middle order with Rahmat Shah, Shahidi, and Abdul Malik. The bowling attack will be tested and they will need Amir Hamza, Izharulhaq Naveed, and Zahir Khan to show their quality along with Karim Janat who could use his experience to get ahead of the hosts. They have some quality spinners in their ranks and on this wicket, they are going to be the most crucial for them. They know that this is not going to be easy but they surely won't go down without a fight. Bangladesh, on the other hand, have a really good record at home in recent times and they will look to extend it after defeating the Irish in their last Test match. Litton Das will be leading the side in the absence of Shakib due to an injury. They have Najmul Hossain Shanto and Tamim Iqbal at the top of the order who would like to score big in this game. Their middle order is also a solid one with the likes of Mushfiqur Rahim, Mominul Haque, and Das. Ebadot Hossain and Mehidy Hasan will look to use the conditions well in this game and trouble the Afghans while Taijul Islam will provide them with the required support. The last time these two sides met in the longest format, it was the Afghans who came out on top. Will they be able to repeat that feat again? Or will Bangladesh avenge their defeat? Let's find out together.","pubDate":"2023-06-14 03:10:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"KL Rahul Begins Extensive Rehab At NCA","link":"https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/kl-rahul-begins-extensive-rehab-at-nca-1608917","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP News Bureau"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bengaluru: Senior Indian cricketer KL Rahul has arrived at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) to commence an extensive rehabilitation program following a thigh surgery.

Whenever Samson gets to feature for the Indian team, crowd turns up in numbers. Leading the Rajasthan Royals franchise, Samson also took his team to the final of the IPL 2022 season. However, a trainer of the RR team has now revealed that he had asked Samson to join a 'big team' in the IPL after the conclusion of the 2021 season. Samson, who joined the Royals for the second time in 2018, has been a consistent member of the team. As per RR trainer Rajamani Prabhu, there Samson had the opportunity to join a different team but he decided to stay out of his loyalty. \"I told Sanju Samson to join some big teams in IPL after 2021 but he replied that I want to make Rajasthan Royals a big team, he further told that let's bring big players like Ashwin, Chahal, Prasidh into the team. He has the vision,\" he said on Sports Vikatan . Rajasthan Royals trainer said \"I told Sanju Samson to join some big teams in IPL after 2021 but he replied that I want to make Rajasthan Royals a big team, he further told that let's bring big players like Ashwin, Chahal, Prasidh into the team.

Chasing 444, the Rohit Sharma -led side was bundled out for 234 and lost a brilliant opportunity of winning an ICC title after a hiatus of 10 years. Many disappointed fans have demanded the removal of skipper Rohit and head coach Rahul Dravid but former India captain Sourav Ganguly completely backed the duo and shut the trolls in a commendable manner. The duo of Rohit and Dravid took charge after India were knocked out of the T20 World Cup in 2021. However, the team's fate has remained the same as they are still in search of their next ICC trophy. Team India won their last ICC title back in 2013, where they defeated England to lift the Champions Trophy. Speaking on India Today , Ganguly hit out at the trolls on social media for spreading such rumors and said that it will be the \"selector's job\" if there will be any change in the management. \"It's a selector's job at the end of the day but how does social media influence? Virat himself didn't want to captain Test cricket two years ago. If you ask me who should be and will be India's captain and coach? Rohit and Rahul that's the right way of all,\" said Ganguly. \"Absolutely, at least till the World Cup, this will continue. Well, I don't know what's in Rohit's mind after the World Cup and what he wants to do. At the moment the coach and captain are the two best for India and I wish them all the luck,\" he added. Earlier, Dravid had expressed disappointment after India's loss and stated that things could have been different if they would have got three weeks' time to practice. \"Never going to be happy with the prep as a coach (enough preparation time?) . But that's the reality we are faced with. Coming here three weeks earlier, having a practice game would be ideal. But we have to make do with what we can. Don't think we should make excuses,\" Dravid told Star Sports after the match. Australia were clearly the better team on all fronts while India had only themselves to blame for yet another loss in a global event. India's last ICC title came way back in 2013 and it was their second successive defeat in the WTC final, having gone down against New Zealand two years ago. India lost seven wickets for the addition of 70 runs on the final day.

For the second time in two consecutive editions, the men from the subcontinent fell at the final hurdle, this time going down to Australia in the title-decider. Two years ago, it was the New Zealand team that had prevented India from bagging the Test mace. The team's repeated failures on the big stage have even left the critics short of words, with the crux of the story of India's downfall seeing the team repeating similar mistakes. R Ashwin's Mysterious Absence There's arguably no man in the world who studies his opponents the way Ravichandran Ashwin does. The off-spinner has learned from every mistake in his career to make stronger comebacks. A true legend in the Test format, Ashwin had reportedly started preparations for the World Test Championship final during the Indian Premier League. But, when the day of reckoning came, he found himself warming the bench for India's most important Test match in the last two years. The Indian team management had its reasons but Ashwin's absence against a team that had 5 left-handers was beyond baffling. Even the great Sachin Tendulkar couldn't digest the fact that India had left Ashwin out of the XI. IPL Fatigue Whenever India disappoint in an ICC event, the blame drops hard on the Indian Premier League. Though there's no denying that the cricketing universe is quickly transitioning into a franchise-based ecosystem, the fact that Indian players had to play the WTC final not long after the conclusion of the T20 league, could've played its role. The likes of Shubman Gill , Rohit Sharma , Virat Kohli , and a number of other players who were busy playing for their franchises till the business end of the IPL 2023 season struggled for form against a more hungry Australian side. For Australia, in comparison, the likes of Steve Smith, Travis Head , Scott Boland , Nathan Lyon , Mitchell Starc , Pat Cummins , and a few others didn't even feature in the 16th edition of the IPL. Going forward, Indian players would need to prioritise as WTC finals are likely to be held in June, not long after the conclusion of IPL seasons. Advertisement Misfiring top-order Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara , and Virat Kohli, all punched below their weight, scoring a total of 193 runs cumulatively in the match. It was only because of Ajinkya Rahane 's 89 and Shardul Thakur 's 51 in the first innings that India managed to reach a pride-saving total of 296 runs. Barring them, no batter could score a half-century. In the second innings, the likes of Rohit, Pujara, Kohli and Rahane got off to fine starts but couldn't convert them to big scores. As former India captain Sourav Ganguly rightly pointed out after the match, the averages of Indian batters have drastically reduced over the last couple of years. The shot selection of some players, including Kohli, is bound to be questioned. In events like the WTC final, even the big names couldn't stand up and deliver.","pubDate":"2023-06-14 02:21:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WTC फायनलमधील पराभवानंतर प्रशिक्षक राहुल द्रविडला BCCI कडून इशारा, गोलंदाजी आणि फलंदाजी कोचबाबतही मोठा निर्णय होण्याची शक्यता","link":"https://marathi.abplive.com/sports/cricket/bcci-warns-team-india-support-staff-after-wtc-loss-head-coach-rahul-dravid-vikram-rathour-and-bowling-coach-paras-mhambrey-asia-cup-2023-cricket-marathi-news-1184057","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":["एबीपी माझा स्पोर्ट्स डेस्क"],"video_url":null,"description":"BCCI Warns Indian Team Support Staff : भारताकडून दुसऱ्यांदा जागतिक कसोटी विश्वचषकाचं (ICC World Test Championship) विजेतेपद हुकलं आहे. टीम इंडिया (Team India) वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चॅम्पियनशीप अंतिम सामन्यापर्यंत (WTC Final 2023) पोहोचली पण, भारतीय संघाला विजय मिळवता आला नाही. वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चॅम्पियनशीपमधील (WTC) पराभवानंतर टीम इंडियाच्या (Team India) खेळांडूसह आता सपोर्ट स्टाफवरही (Team India Support Staff) टीका करण्यात येत आहे.

RR had a great start to their IPL 2023 campaign but eventually finished on the fifth place on the league table with 14 points and failed to make it to the Playoffs. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-6601185-5\"); });","pubDate":"2023-06-14 03:38:41","image_url":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2023/06/14/8c4510896d67af2f9e1d9f076b9364a61686713644527625_original.jpg","source_id":"abplive","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"न्यूजीलैंड को करारा झटका, चोट के चलते वर्ल्ड कप 2023 से बाहर हुआ अहम ऑलराउंडर","link":"https://hindi.oneindia.com/news/sports/cricket/new-zealand-michael-bracewell-is-to-undergo-surgery-of-achilles-tendon-he-is-out-of-world-cup-2023-781465.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"भारत में होने वाले आईसीसी 50 ओवर वर्ल्ड कप से पहले न्यूजीलैंड के स्पिन ऑलराउंडर माइकल ब्रेसवेल इंग्लैंड में T20 ब्लास्ट क्रिकेट टूर्नामेंट खेलने के दौरान अपने दाएं अकिलीज़ टंडन को चोटिल करवा बैठे हैं, जिसके चलते वे 6 से 8 महीने के लिए क्रिकेट से बाहर हो गए हैं। इसका मतलब यह है कि वह वर्ल्ड कप को मिस करने जा रहे हैं","content":"न्यूजीलैंड (New Zealand Cricket Team) के ऑलराउंडर माइकल ब्रेसवेल (Michael Bracewell) वनडे वर्ल्ड कप (ODI World Cup 2023) से बाहर हो गए हैं। आईसीसी वनडे वर्ल्ड कप 2023 अक्टूबर-नवंबर के महीने में इसी साल भारत में होने जा रहा है, जिसकी डेट आधिकारिक तौर पर आनी बाकी है। न्यूजीलैंड के लिए माइकल ब्रेसवेल एक बहुत अच्छे खिलाड़ी हो सकते थे, जिनको वे इस विश्व कप में देख सकते थे। लेकिन, स्पिन ऑलराउंडर ने इंग्लैंड में T20 ब्लास्ट टूर्नामेंट के दौरान वोस्टरशायर रैपिड्स की ओर से खेलते हुए अपने दाएं अकिलीज़ टेंडन (Achilles tendon Injury) को चोटिल कर लिया है। माइकल ब्रेसवेल ब्रिटेन में गुरुवार को सर्जरी कराएंगे, जिसके बाद उन्हें 6 से 8 महीने रिकवरी में लगेंगे। टेंडन की चोट की रिकवरी मसल्स की चोट की तुलना में काफी धीरे होती है, और यही बात लिगामेंट के लिए भी सच है। न्यूजीलैंड के हेड कोच गैरी स्टीड ने एक बयान में इसकी पुष्टि करते हुए दुख भी जताया है, 'जहां वे कहते हैं, सबसे पहले तो आपको उस खिलाड़ी को लेकर थोड़ा दुख होता है, जब चोट लग जाए, और वह भी तब, जब आपके सामने एक वर्ल्ड इवेंट हो।' कोच ने आगे कहा कि कहा कि, माइकल स्वभाविक तौर पर काफी परेशान हैं। लेकिन साथ ही यह चीज भी सच है कि चोट खेल का हिस्सा होती हैं, और अब वे अपने रिहैबिलिटेशन पर फोकस शिफ्ट कर रहे हैं। न्यूजीलैंड आईसीसी वर्ल्ड कप टूर्नामेंट में काफी अच्छा खेलता रहा है हालांकि उनके पास कोई 50 ओवर वर्ल्ड कप ट्रॉफी नहीं है, लेकिन उन्होंने पहली वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप साइकल जीतने के साथ आईसीसी की बड़ी ट्रॉफी के सूखे को समाप्त किया था। इससे पहले वे 2019 में इंग्लैंड में हुए वर्ल्ड कप में रनर-अप रह चुके हैं, जहां दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण तरीके से 'बाउंड्री अकाउंट नियम' ने उन्हें विजेता होने से बाहर कर दिया था।","pubDate":"2023-06-14 03:12:02","image_url":null,"source_id":"oneindia","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"BAN vs AFG Test Live: Rashid Khan-Less Afghanistan Up Against Bangladesh","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/bangladesh-vs-afghanistan-one-off-test-live-cricket-score-and-updates-4119382","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"BAN vs AFG one-off Test: Afghanistan look to prove their test credentials against the more-experienced Bangladesh side.","content":"Bangladesh vs Afghanistan one-off Test Live Score: A new challenge awaits the brave Afghanistan side that has grown leaps and bounds over the last couple of years. Having ascertained their status as a dangerous white-ball team, Afghanistan would look to elevate their credentials as a Test team too as they take on Bangladesh in a one-off Test. However, the Afghans will be missing their talismanic spinner Rashid Khan in the match. So would be Bangladesh who are without the services of Shakib al Hasan in the contest. ( LIVE Scorecard ) TOSS - Afghanistan have won the toss and will BOWL first! Hello and welcome to Day 1 of this one-off test match between Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Two Asian teams go against each other in the longest format after a long time. The visitors will be playing Teat cricket after almost two years. However, a lot has changed in the Afghan side and in a better way. In this match, they will be without their premium bowler, Rashid Khan but so will be Bangladesh who will be without Shakib Al Hasan. Both teams still have a balanced squad and expect a lot of excitement in this match. Stay tuned for toss and other updates. ...Day 1, Session 1... Test cricket is back with all the excitement and we have a historic one-off Test match between Bangladesh and Afghanistan at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium. The Afghans last played in this format almost two years ago against Zimbabwe where they drew 1-1, but this huge gap could make a huge difference in their performance. Hashmatullah Shahidi's side returns to Test cricket after a long time, and this game will see several players making their debuts. The side is without its top bowlers, who have been rested for this series and they will need to make the most of the available resources. Ibrahim Zadran and Nasir Jamal need to build a solid foundation at the top for them but their strength lies in the middle order with Rahmat Shah, Shahidi, and Abdul Malik. The bowling attack will be tested and they will need Amir Hamza, Izharulhaq Naveed, and Zahir Khan to show their quality along with Karim Janat who could use his experience to get ahead of the hosts. They have some quality spinners in their ranks and on this wicket, they are going to be the most crucial for them. They know that this is not going to be easy but they surely won't go down without a fight. Bangladesh, on the other hand, have a really good record at home in recent times and they will look to extend it after defeating the Irish in their last Test match. Litton Das will be leading the side in the absence of Shakib due to an injury. They have Najmul Hossain Shanto and Tamim Iqbal at the top of the order who would like to score big in this game. Their middle order is also a solid one with the likes of Mushfiqur Rahim, Mominul Haque, and Das. Ebadot Hossain and Mehidy Hasan will look to use the conditions well in this game and trouble the Afghans while Taijul Islam will provide them with the required support. The last time these two sides met in the longest format, it was the Afghans who came out on top. Will they be able to repeat that feat again? Or will Bangladesh avenge their defeat? Let's find out together.","pubDate":"2023-06-14 03:10:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"KL Rahul Begins Extensive Rehab At NCA","link":"https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/kl-rahul-begins-extensive-rehab-at-nca-1608917","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP News Bureau"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bengaluru: Senior Indian cricketer KL Rahul has arrived at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) to commence an extensive rehabilitation program following a thigh surgery.

Whenever Samson gets to feature for the Indian team, crowd turns up in numbers. Leading the Rajasthan Royals franchise, Samson also took his team to the final of the IPL 2022 season. However, a trainer of the RR team has now revealed that he had asked Samson to join a 'big team' in the IPL after the conclusion of the 2021 season. Samson, who joined the Royals for the second time in 2018, has been a consistent member of the team. As per RR trainer Rajamani Prabhu, there Samson had the opportunity to join a different team but he decided to stay out of his loyalty. \"I told Sanju Samson to join some big teams in IPL after 2021 but he replied that I want to make Rajasthan Royals a big team, he further told that let's bring big players like Ashwin, Chahal, Prasidh into the team. He has the vision,\" he said on Sports Vikatan . Rajasthan Royals trainer said \"I told Sanju Samson to join some big teams in IPL after 2021 but he replied that I want to make Rajasthan Royals a big team, he further told that let's bring big players like Ashwin, Chahal, Prasidh into the team.

Chasing 444, the Rohit Sharma -led side was bundled out for 234 and lost a brilliant opportunity of winning an ICC title after a hiatus of 10 years. Many disappointed fans have demanded the removal of skipper Rohit and head coach Rahul Dravid but former India captain Sourav Ganguly completely backed the duo and shut the trolls in a commendable manner. The duo of Rohit and Dravid took charge after India were knocked out of the T20 World Cup in 2021. However, the team's fate has remained the same as they are still in search of their next ICC trophy. Team India won their last ICC title back in 2013, where they defeated England to lift the Champions Trophy. Speaking on India Today , Ganguly hit out at the trolls on social media for spreading such rumors and said that it will be the \"selector's job\" if there will be any change in the management. \"It's a selector's job at the end of the day but how does social media influence? Virat himself didn't want to captain Test cricket two years ago. If you ask me who should be and will be India's captain and coach? Rohit and Rahul that's the right way of all,\" said Ganguly. \"Absolutely, at least till the World Cup, this will continue. Well, I don't know what's in Rohit's mind after the World Cup and what he wants to do. At the moment the coach and captain are the two best for India and I wish them all the luck,\" he added. Earlier, Dravid had expressed disappointment after India's loss and stated that things could have been different if they would have got three weeks' time to practice. \"Never going to be happy with the prep as a coach (enough preparation time?) . But that's the reality we are faced with. Coming here three weeks earlier, having a practice game would be ideal. But we have to make do with what we can. Don't think we should make excuses,\" Dravid told Star Sports after the match. Australia were clearly the better team on all fronts while India had only themselves to blame for yet another loss in a global event. India's last ICC title came way back in 2013 and it was their second successive defeat in the WTC final, having gone down against New Zealand two years ago. India lost seven wickets for the addition of 70 runs on the final day.

For the second time in two consecutive editions, the men from the subcontinent fell at the final hurdle, this time going down to Australia in the title-decider. Two years ago, it was the New Zealand team that had prevented India from bagging the Test mace. The team's repeated failures on the big stage have even left the critics short of words, with the crux of the story of India's downfall seeing the team repeating similar mistakes. R Ashwin's Mysterious Absence There's arguably no man in the world who studies his opponents the way Ravichandran Ashwin does. The off-spinner has learned from every mistake in his career to make stronger comebacks. A true legend in the Test format, Ashwin had reportedly started preparations for the World Test Championship final during the Indian Premier League. But, when the day of reckoning came, he found himself warming the bench for India's most important Test match in the last two years. The Indian team management had its reasons but Ashwin's absence against a team that had 5 left-handers was beyond baffling. Even the great Sachin Tendulkar couldn't digest the fact that India had left Ashwin out of the XI. IPL Fatigue Whenever India disappoint in an ICC event, the blame drops hard on the Indian Premier League. Though there's no denying that the cricketing universe is quickly transitioning into a franchise-based ecosystem, the fact that Indian players had to play the WTC final not long after the conclusion of the T20 league, could've played its role. The likes of Shubman Gill , Rohit Sharma , Virat Kohli , and a number of other players who were busy playing for their franchises till the business end of the IPL 2023 season struggled for form against a more hungry Australian side. For Australia, in comparison, the likes of Steve Smith, Travis Head , Scott Boland , Nathan Lyon , Mitchell Starc , Pat Cummins , and a few others didn't even feature in the 16th edition of the IPL. Going forward, Indian players would need to prioritise as WTC finals are likely to be held in June, not long after the conclusion of IPL seasons. Advertisement Misfiring top-order Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara , and Virat Kohli, all punched below their weight, scoring a total of 193 runs cumulatively in the match. It was only because of Ajinkya Rahane 's 89 and Shardul Thakur 's 51 in the first innings that India managed to reach a pride-saving total of 296 runs. Barring them, no batter could score a half-century. In the second innings, the likes of Rohit, Pujara, Kohli and Rahane got off to fine starts but couldn't convert them to big scores. As former India captain Sourav Ganguly rightly pointed out after the match, the averages of Indian batters have drastically reduced over the last couple of years. The shot selection of some players, including Kohli, is bound to be questioned. In events like the WTC final, even the big names couldn't stand up and deliver.","pubDate":"2023-06-14 02:21:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WTC फायनलमधील पराभवानंतर प्रशिक्षक राहुल द्रविडला BCCI कडून इशारा, गोलंदाजी आणि फलंदाजी कोचबाबतही मोठा निर्णय होण्याची शक्यता","link":"https://marathi.abplive.com/sports/cricket/bcci-warns-team-india-support-staff-after-wtc-loss-head-coach-rahul-dravid-vikram-rathour-and-bowling-coach-paras-mhambrey-asia-cup-2023-cricket-marathi-news-1184057","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":["एबीपी माझा स्पोर्ट्स डेस्क"],"video_url":null,"description":"BCCI Warns Indian Team Support Staff : भारताकडून दुसऱ्यांदा जागतिक कसोटी विश्वचषकाचं (ICC World Test Championship) विजेतेपद हुकलं आहे. टीम इंडिया (Team India) वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चॅम्पियनशीप अंतिम सामन्यापर्यंत (WTC Final 2023) पोहोचली पण, भारतीय संघाला विजय मिळवता आला नाही. वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चॅम्पियनशीपमधील (WTC) पराभवानंतर टीम इंडियाच्या (Team India) खेळांडूसह आता सपोर्ट स्टाफवरही (Team India Support Staff) टीका करण्यात येत आहे.
