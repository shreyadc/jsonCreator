Instinctively, Sargent lifted his right foot before catching the ball perfectly on his ankle and in doing so, produced a scorpion goal of sorts. Inevitably, it brought a brilliant reaction from Carragher once the strike was confirmed by the goal line technology. ‚ÄúThis is absolutely out of this world!‚Äù He said in reference to the strike. \"This is absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD!\" ü§Ø Josh Sargent scores his first Premier League goal with an incredible finish and Norwich take the lead! üëá pic.twitter.com/A9cKnPOKbS A bullet header from Sargent 20 minutes later all but confirmed the result who deservedly was given the man-of-the-match award.

Sky Sports pundit Key, along with fellow former England players Matt Prior and Graeme Swann, earlier this week questioned the role of counties in causing cricket to be an elitist sport. Key, whose daughter plays U15 cricket for Kent, explained that the combination of trials, coaching, kit and a tour, costs him ¬£710 a season, before equipment and travel expenses have been factored in. That backed up Prior's claim, made to The Times , that he is paying \"nearly ¬£1,000\" a season for each of his two children going through the Sussex pathway. However, Key disputed Prior's suggestion that the system is merely a \"money-making exercise\". \"I don't know if that's fair,\" Key told Sky Sports News. \"I really don't know where that money goes. It would be interesting to see. \"There are some counties that do it very well; there are others that cost even more than Kent. It varies depending on where you are, I think Essex actually subsidise a lot of the coaching, and it's no surprise then that they've got players and they've done pretty well in the county championship and they produce a lot of their own players. \"It's just become, and it's probably been like this for quite some time actually, it's become expensive. \"We talk about cricket for everyone, we talk about diversity - all these types of things, bringing the game to every person, well, you're just pricing a lot of people out the market with the way you price it.\" The discussion comes following England men's team's heavy 4-0 defeat to Australia in the Ashes, which has left the England and Wales Cricket Board facing scrutiny over the country's recent poor record in the red-ball cricket. Key believes that the issue of high costs at county youth level does not lie \"at the door\" of the ECB, who he says has generated large sums of moneys for counties through signing lucrative broadcast deals. \"I don't think it's all at their door all the time,\" Key said. \"The counties are the ones as well who have to make sure they're investing in youth cricket in the best possible way. ECB can't tell counties what to do. \"I just think it's probably gone unchecked for a little while, and that everyone, not just the ECB, counties need to look at how they're doing it, because it will help them in the long term. If you start producing your own players you're going to save a fortune in the long run.\" Responding to Prior's comments, Sussex Cricket chief executive Rob Andrew told BBC Sport : \"We have made a charge for the pathway programme for many years. The programme across boys and girls runs at a financial cost to the club and continues to do so. \"We appreciate that the cost may be prohibitive for some families, and where this is proven we try to assist in order that no talented individual misses out from taking part. \"We review this on a regular basis, and with the appointment of Mike Yardy into the academy director role, he is conducting his own review of the current programme he has inherited and we will look at his recommendations. \"We strive to make the programme as widely available as possible and to provide value for money for the amount and quality of cricket that is provided.\" Sky Sports News have contacted Kent for comment.","image_url":"https://e2.365dm.com/22/01/1920x1080/skysports-cricket-bat-gloves_5648485.jpg?20220121201503","source_id":"skysports"},{"title":"Cricket-Hazlewood to return from injury for Sri Lanka series","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/01/22/cricket-hazlewood-to-return-from-injury-for-sri-lanka-series","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood will be back in action for next month's Twenty20 international series against Sri Lanka after a side strain cut short his Ashes campaign.

Stand-in captain Lokesh Rahul has become only the fifth Indian cricketer to lose his first two ODIs as a captain. Leading India for the first time in ODIs, Rahul‚Äôs third ODI as captain will be a dead-rubber in Cape Town. A second consecutive lacklustre performance in a row in Paarl witnessed India losing by 7 wickets in the recently concluded match. Failing to defend a 288-run target on Friday, Rahul considers dual losses as ‚Äúgood learning‚Äù for the team. ‚ÄúI think they are playing some really good cricket at home. We are making mistakes as well in the middle. It‚Äôs a good learning for us. We are a team that takes a lot of pride in winning, but good learning for us and hopefully we can grow,‚Äù Rahul told SuperSport during the post-match presentation ceremony. KL Rahul talks about Virat Kohli‚Äôs energy while playing as a specialist batter in ODIs Apart from losing both the series on an overseas tour where they were expected to dominate against a comparatively inexperienced side, India lacking killing instinct is quite surprising for the amount of talent they possess. Rahul, however, picked many positive from two losses at the Boland Park. The 29-year old player highlighted individual performances across departments as good signs for the team. ‚ÄúThe way Shikhar [Dhawan] and Virat [Kohli] batted in the first game was very good. And today Rishabh [Pant], the way he managed the first 20 balls and then he took down the spinners. He is a really important member of the team and Shardul [Thakur], too, showing us he can bat lower down and make a good contribution. The Indian cricket team‚Äôs looking really hard to beat in the Rahuls era. ‚Äî Aniruddha Guha (@AniGuha) January 21, 2022 ‚ÄúJasprit [Bumrah] has been the standout bowler for us and Yuzi [Yuzvendra Chahal] has been good today,‚Äù Rahul said. Before concluding, Rahul was asked about former captain Virat Kohli‚Äôs energy while playing as a specialist batter. While Rahul didn‚Äôt precisely talk about Kohli‚Äôs energy, he answered the question with respect to the whole team. For those who don‚Äôt know, Kohli is playing an international series as a specialist batter for the first time in the last five years. ‚ÄúI think the energy has been great. Obviously, it‚Äôs really hot. Not saying it as an excuse but we haven‚Äôt played 50 overs cricket in a long time. It‚Äôs been tough on the body, staying in the bubbles. It‚Äôs challenging, but I‚Äôm not saying we don‚Äôt love challenges,‚Äù Rahul mentioned.

This is all we have from this second ODI and the series now moves to Newlands, Cape Town for the third and final ODI. The series is already sealed by South Africa but India would like to avoid a whitewash here. The final ODI will take place on Sunday, 23rd December and the action starts at 2.00 pm (8.30 am GMT). But as you know, our coverage will start well in advance. So do join us for the same. Till then, goodbye and cheers! Quinton de Kock is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his brilliant performace with the bat. He says that it was nice to get out there and score some runs. Mentions that lack of game time obviously catches up but says it was just good to be out there and score. Tells that the more he batted, the more he felt that his rhythm was back. Says that he and Janneman Malan had a good partnership. Says that they share a great understanding. On asked how life is as a father, he says that he had only a couple of days to spend at home. Adds that his perspective has changed on life. Temba Bavuma, the South African skipper says that he is very happy. He adds that this was the objective before the series but he did not expect to win the series in just two games. He states that Quinton de Kock played well and showed how valuable a player he is. He mentions that they have a lot of self-belief and they fight for each other and they try to put a team effort. He adds that no one had many expectations from them and they have done really well here. He states that spinners have done a super job. He states that he enjoys captaincy right from domestic cricket and it is something he enjoys and it is probably because he thinks too deeply about the game. He adds that 3-0 sounds better than 2-1 and hopefully they can do well in the final game. KL Rahul, the Indian skipper says that South Africa is playing good cricket at home and they are making some mistakes and it needs to be looked upon. He says that it is a learning curve for them. Mentions that they are a team that takes pride in winning but it has been a good learning for them and hopes that they grow from this. Tells that the wicket does feel like one at home and it didn't look like they will chase it down but credits them for batting really well. Adds that the way Rishabh Pant batted was good and he targeted areas where he is strong. Says that Shardul Thakur showed that he can bat down the order. Tells that Bumrah bowled superbly and Yuzvendra Chahal was also good as well. Says that these are the few positives but they love challenges and have been short in the first two games and tells that they will now look to win the last match. On asked about team changes, he says that it is too soon to tell. Stay tuned for the presentation... India have been really flat with the ball. They never looked like putting pressure on the South African bowlers and easy singles were given away quite easily throughout the innings. The man with the golden arm, Shardul Thakur eventually got the wicket of Quinton de Kock but the third wicket partnership between Bavuma and Malan ensured that India does not comeback into the game. India's strike bowler, Bumrah got the wicket of Bavuma and Chahal also managed to get rid of Malan after that. But it was too late till then and India have been handed a humiliating series defeat here. South Africa have pulled off a very clinical win here. They needed 288 to chase and the game seemed to be on a balance at the end of the first innings. But the way South Africa have gone about their chase has been very impressive. They kept the pressure on Indian bowlers right from the start as Quinton de Kock and Janneman Malan never let any bowler settle. Both the openers missed out on a well-deserved century but they had done their job till then and it was easy for the batters after them to take their side home. Bavuma batted solidly at number 3 and then Rassie van der Dussen and Aiden Markram finished things off for their side quite comfortably. South Africa clinch the ODI series in a rather comfortable fashion with still a game to go. The dressing room erupts and full credit to this South African unit for their brilliant performance. They have chased down this total with ease and have carried the momentum they gained in the Test series into this ODI series. India will be disappointed with their effort with the ball especially after a decent performance with the bat earlier in the day. Indian spinners have been outbowled by the South African spinners in both games and as a result, India have been beaten comprehensively in this ODI series. So the post-Kohli era in ODIs has started on a poor note for India. 48.1 overs (1 Run) Aiden Markram hits the winning runs! Shreyas Iyer bowls it short, on off.

There are many instances of a batter being dismissed on the 22-yard turf wherein the fielding side has no role to play at all. But, the way the Windies all-rounder Andre Russell got dismissed on Friday, is the most quintessential case of a batter being on the receiving end of sheer misfortune. During the 2nd match of the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League 2022 between Khulna Tigers and Minister Group Dhaka, the Windies and Minister Group Dhaka all-rounder Andre Russell got himself Run Out in the most bizarre manner possible on a Cricket field. It all happened on the ultimate delivery of the 15th Over being bowled by Khulna Royals‚Äô all-rounder Thisara Perera. Russsell nudged a slower delivery bowled by Perera towards Short Third Man and scampered through for a single. Mahmudallah on the other end, managed to complete the run with ease despite the fielder managing to hit the stumps at the striker‚Äôs end. With Russell‚Äôs eyes focused on the batting end, the ball deflected off the stumps (at the batting end) and hit the the ones at the bowling end, only for Russell to find himself short of crease to be declared Run-Out in the most unusual and unluckiest manner possible. Russell clearly had not anticipated the ball to come anywhere nearer to the bowling end, leave aside the probability of it hitting the stumps to leave him and everyone at the center of action dumbstruck.

During the second match of the ongoing eighth season of the Bangladesh Premier League between Minster Group Dhaka and Khulna Tigers in Dhaka, Minster Group Dhaka all-rounder Andre Russell was part of arguably the most unfortunate dismissal on a cricket field. It all happened on the last delivery of the 15th over when Russell dabbed a Thisara Perera delivery towards the short third man region to run a single. Russell, who was found guilty of watching the ball, was well short of the crease when it hit the stumps at the non-striker‚Äôs end. Having said that, Russell can‚Äôt be blamed for his complacency as most batters would‚Äôve reacted in the same way knowing that the fielder isn‚Äôt throwing at their end. What led to Russell‚Äôs dismissal was an outlandish run-out which happened even without the fielding team‚Äôs intention. While Mahedi Hasan‚Äôs throw had hit the stumps at the striker‚Äôs end initially, the ball then ricocheted towards the stumps at the other. Hence, Hasan putting on display not one but two direct-hits saw the end of Russell at the Shere Bangla National Stadium tonight. Russell, who had hit a six on the previous delivery, walked back to the pavilion after scoring 7 (3). Asked to bat first by Khulna captain Mushfiqur Rahim, Dhaka scored 183/6 in 20 overs primarily due to captain Mahmudullah scoring 39 (20) with the help of two fours and three sixes in the business end. Earlier, it was a 69-run opening partnership between Mohammad Shahzad (42) and Tamim Iqbal (50) which had provided a brilliant start to the hosts.

Aiden Markram blocks it out solidly. Aiden Markram walks out at number 4. 34.4 overs (0 Run) OUT! BOWLED! Janneman Malan misses out on a well-deserved century by 9 runs! Got to feel for Janneman Malan. Played so well but has to depart. Back of a length, angling in on leg, was a slower one as well. Jasprit Bumrah just rolls his finger over this time. Janneman Malan gets beaten by the lack of pace and gets beaten on the inside edge. The ball takes the gloves and rolls back to dislodge the bails. End of an excellent knock from Janneman Malan. He walks off with a standing ovation. A much-needed breakthrough for India but South Africa still right on top. 34.3 overs (0 Run) Full and on leg, Janneman Malan digs it out to mid-wicket. 34.2 overs (0 Run) Around off, Janneman Malan taps it to point. 34.1 overs (1 Run) Back of a length, around off.

Temba Bavuma deliberately plays it late. It goes past Pant and into the third man fence. 33.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Temba Bavuma is in some form. We saw that in the Test series and in the first ODI and now carrying that rich form in this match as well. Short and on middle, Temba Bavuma pulls it to long on for a boundary. 33.3 overs (1 Run) This is pushed to long on for a single. 33.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Janneman Malan enters the nervous 90s now! Length ball, outside off. Janneman Malan drives it perfectly through point. The timing and placement was equisite and gets a boundary. 33.1 overs (0 Run) On a length, outside off. Janneman Malan pushes it to covers. 32.6 overs (0 Run) Inside edge but drops short of Rishabh Pant! Good-length ball, outside off, nipping in. Temba Bavuma looks to drive but gets an inside edge.

South Africa are running away with the game here. Shardul Thakur got the wicket of Quinton de Kock but that was the only thing to cheer for India. The bowling is looking flat and India need quick wickets here, otherwise the game will be done and dusted soon. 92 needed now from 108 balls. Jasprit Bumrah (5.0-0-26-0) is brought back into the attack. 31.6 overs (0 Run) Length ball, hit hard but straight to covers. 31.5 overs (1 Run) Full and on off, Janneman Malan drives it through covers for a single. 31.4 overs (1 Run) Deft touch!

Janneman Malan wants to get to his century quickly now. Although, this was a poor ball and needed to be punished. Dragged it short and down the leg side, Janneman Malan pulled it behind square on the leg side and got the desired result. A boundary. Shardul Thakur (3.0-0-12-1) is back into the attack. 30.6 overs (1 Run) On middle, worked to long on for a single. Another good over for South Africa. 30.5 overs (1 Run) Nothing going India's way. This was touch short, outside off. Temba Bavuma rocks back and cuts it straight to point. Virat Kohli collects it and throws it wide of Rishabh Pant.

A 0-4 series loss against Australia in the recently concluded Ashes series Down Under has meant that England‚Äôs wait to win an away Ashes series agonizingly continues. The England men‚Äôs team have not only not won an Ashes series in Australia since 2013/14, but have also failed to win a single Test since then as well. Having said that, the build-up to the Ashes rivalry between the two oldest Cricketing nations have always been hyped-up like no other series in modern day Cricket. But, the way Australia have been dominating the rivalry for quite a many years now, a major section of the fans and experts have started terming the series as much inferior to say a match-up between India and Pakistan. Former England skipper Michael Vaughan has also echoed his sentiments along similar lines. Michael Vaughan denies the Ashes rivalry to be superior With the T20 World Cup 2022 fixtures announced by the ICC on Friday, India and Pakistan have yet again been clubbed together in the same group for very obvious reasons. With perhaps the recent Ashes series results in mind, Vaughan finally admitted that it is an India-Pakistan game and not the Ashes which is the biggest game in world Cricket, even though many ex-Australian and England players would like to think otherwise. ‚ÄúI think, we being England and Australia ex-players, we all kind of think of the Ashes as the biggest game in world cricket, it‚Äôs not! India versus Pakistan is the biggest game‚Äù, exclaimed Vaughan during a Star Sports show. The 47-year-old also seemed to be excited to witness Rohit Sharma lead the Indian team in the upcoming T20 World Cup. ‚ÄúLooking forward to Rohit Sharma being the captain, probably the first time he‚Äôs going to be under real pressure. It‚Äôs going to be an epic event,‚Äù Vaughan further added.
