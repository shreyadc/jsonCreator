The first match of the tournament will be played between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan which will be followed by India locking horns with Pakistan on August 28, 2022.

The Sri Lankan islands have been hit by one of the worst financial crisis in the history of their country and with the situation going haywire all around the country, the tournament was moved to the United Arab Emirates. Qualification rounds are on for the Asia Cup and teams like Singapore, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait are having a crack at each other to make their mark and enter the league stage of the tournament. As of now, Hong Kong leads the points table with 4 points. team Hong Kong have played two matches and won both which gives them an edge ahead of all the participating teams. UAE is ranked second with one win in two games and is followed by Kuwait who is in a similar kind of situation. UAE and Kuwait are on the same points and owing to UAE's higher run rate, they are placed second in the points table. In the 4th match of the qualifier, Hong Kong won the toss and opted to field first. Kuwait had a job cut out for themselves. They had a chance to go all the way up on the points table. To Kuwait's dismay, openers Meet Bhavsar and Ravija Sandaruwan could not make any notable contribution towards the team's cause and were dismissed very cheaply by Aizaz Khan. Kuwait's no. 3 Adnan Idrees and wicketkeeper Usman Patel too were dismissed very cheaply as they left their team reeling on 56/4. team Kuwait could never recover from these early blows and none of their batsmen could go past 30 runs except Edson Silva, who provided some respite to his team by scoring 56 off 30 deliveries. team Kuwait finished on 151 and it was now Hong Kong's time to chase. Keeping their dominant streak alive, Hong Kong openers Yasim Murtaza and skipper Nizakat Khan registered an opening stand of 59 runs. Murtaza scored 46 off 33 deliveries with 7 boundaries and 1 six, whereas, skipper Khan scored a sublime 50 off 43 deliveries. Both Murtaza and Khan's batting prowess left Kuwait clueless and they were left with nothing much to do. Following up with Murtaza and Khan's act, Babar Hayat too scored a gritty 53 off 30 deliveries which propelled Hong Kong's score to 153/2 as they won the match by 8 wickets and maintained their firm grip on the points table.

On the contrary, player-turned-broadcaster Ravi Shastri has called for an end to mindless bilateral series and feels that international cricket should only return when there is a world cup. Earlier this year, English all-rounder Ben Stokes announced his retirement from the 50-over format and blamed the English cricket calendar as a motivating factor behind this decision. For many years now, Stokes has been a talismanic figure in English Cricket and has been a part of many iconic moments in their history. Stokes who won the World Cup in 2019 and enjoyed a dream run in the same year opened up about how his body wasn't prepared to play three formats as he solely wants to focus on Test cricket. Coincidentally, to manage workload issues, Stokes has also said that his participation in the Indian Premier League remains doubtful and only time will tell if he throws his name into the auction or not. Under the guidance of Brendon McCullum, Stokes has been handed over the reins of English red-ball cricket and as of now, it seems that he has brought about a much-required change in the English Test setup. Recently, in an interview, Stokes spoke his mind out and did not mince his words when asked about his opinion on the international cricketing calendar. \" \", said Ben Stokes. England is currently taking on South Africa in a three-match Test series. The Proteas team led by blew England off in the first Test match, but now the visitors have a job at their hands to turn things around and push the series towards a decider.","pubDate":"2022-08-24 02:05:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Square legs, fine legs and short legs: the beauty of cricket","link":"https://www.burnabynow.com/local-sports/square-legs-fine-legs-and-short-legs-the-beauty-of-cricket-5732181","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Burnaby’s IndCan cricket club aims to bring the community together through their love and passion for cricket.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-24 01:30:00","image_url":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/burnabynow/images/burnabynow/shorter.00_00_24_27.still001.jpg;w=960","source_id":"burnabynow","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India coach has Covid ahead of Asia Cup","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/984908-india-coach-has-covid-ahead-of-asia-cup","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI: India coach Rahul Dravid tested positive for Covid-19 ahead of the team’s departure for the Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates, the country’s cricket board said Tuesday.The Twenty20 tournament begins on Saturday, with India’s first match a blockbuster clash against...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-24 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PCB gives NOC to 43 players","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/984910-pcb-gives-noc-to-43-players","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board has given No Objection Certificates to 43 players for participation in Big Bash League .Most of the players who have received NOCs are not part of Pakistan’s international commitments at the moment.Pakistan’s star players Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-24 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shubman Gill got better of nerves for 1st ton","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/shubman-gill-got-better-of-nerves-for-1st-ton-424668","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Harare, August 23 India's Shubman Gill dedicated his maiden international hundred to his father after getting \"schooled\" by him for missing the mark earlier, the top-order batsman said after his match-winning 130 in the third One-dayer against Zimbabwe here.

Ever since the UAE and South Africa Twenty20 leagues reshaped cricket’s labour market with an influx of extra cash, this has been the constant question. BBL players deserve better remuneration from next season. Credit: Getty Images Challenged to raise its war chest for the Big Bash League by some $16 million next year, Cricket Australia’s chair Lachlan Henderson and his board, state chairs, the Australian Cricketers Association and their executives are consumed by how to wring extra dollars from somewhere. It is abundantly clear that players are going to have to be paid significantly more than the current $1.9 million BBL salary cap. Most likely, that figure would have to double per club, with a marquee fund for especially valuable Twenty20 players thrown in. All up, that would mean BBL salaries go up from about $20 million this season (including the extra money to overseas players in the tournament’s inaugural draft on Sunday) to at least $36 million. Should pay for women and centrally contracted Australia men also rise, the extra cash required for the 2023-24 season could jump to more than $30 million in total. If that salary cap number rises, cuts are going to have to be made elsewhere, especially when there is a year’s lag between the signing of the next player pay deal in 2023 and the subsequent broadcast cycle starting in 2024 after the current $1.18 billion terms with Foxtel and Seven expire. So where will the money come from? Administrators have pointed to some parcels of money bound up in the Australian Cricketers Association’s 2017 deal with Cricket Australia, including the adjustment ledger worth about $70 million to be paid out next year. The players, logically, rebut this idea by explaining that the money is already theirs. Other pots of cash include about $10 million unused money left in the player union’s grassroots fund, meant to be used to help clubs and junior competitions. At the same time, the union has looked at Cricket Australia’s books to come up with its own suggestions for where the money might come from. But the state associations, having already lived through three consecutive years of reduced distributions due to COVID-19, are adamant that they will not surrender any more money. The associations, it is constantly pointed out, signed a financial deal a decade ago that stressed they would not be worse off by handing over all match revenues and their associated risk to the central governing body. They also insist, rightly, that state distributions are by and large passed down to cricket’s club and junior ranks, whether in capital cities or regional areas. While CA also does plenty of its own work in this area, reduced distributions effectively limit what a state can do within its borders to ensure as many people play cricket as possible. One of the current debates is whether it would be possible to counterbalance grassroots funding, even temporarily, by charging more for junior and club cricketers to play the game, by way of subscriptions and other assorted fees like those for match balls. On the surface, lining cricket up against other sports, this makes some degree of sense. But only as long as it takes to remember how much money must be spent on bats, pads, gloves, helmets and other accoutrements not required by soccer, Australian rules football or the rugby codes. Cricket is a pricier and more complex sport to play. One of the current debates is whether it would be possible to counterbalance grassroots funding, even temporarily, by charging more for junior and club cricket subscriptions. The other option is to pivot to private investment , either for BBL clubs, the BBL as a whole or CA’s commercial operations entirely. Investors would likely come from either the vast pool of rich Indian corporate conglomerates, or US-based private equity giants that already have financial interests in other sports. That money, however, would be conditional on many things: the loss of Cricket Australia’s tax-free, not-for-profit status for one. Selling off a portion of “the farm” and its future earnings is a concept that still fills some decision-makers with a combination of dread for its implications, and pity for other sports that have had to go there. There is optimism in most quarters that in 2024, the next set of Australian broadcast deals will bring in enough of a cash uplift to balance Cricket Australia’s needs to reward players while also investing back into the system that nurtures them. But even there that familiar question is likely to rear its head once more. Who pays? The surest way to raise more broadcast rights value is to place more cricket behind a paywall, much as the AFL is expected to do. Then it will not be Cricket Australia, the states or the players paying more, but the public they serve and perform for. News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

He was speaking at the inaugural function of 28th National Masters Table Tennis Championships 2022 at SK Indoor Sports Complex, Srinagar. The championship is being organised by J&K Table Tennis Association in collaboration with J&K Sports Council & Indian Veterans Table Tennis Committee under the aegis of Table Tennis Federation of India. More than 1000 players and officials from 28 states, 8 UTs and different institutions are competing in the championship. While speaking on the occasion, the Lt Governor said that the government’s effort is to harness the power of youth so they can unleash their full potential in sporting arena. Sports Council has been making extraordinary efforts to create world-class infrastructure, supporting athletes and coaches to deliver performances on national and the world stage, he added. Sports Council is reaching out to every young talent, today. Be it water sports, cricket, football, badminton, judo, wushu, rugby, tennis, hockey, gymnastics, table tennis or lawn tennis, we have better coaching and infrastructure in all sporting disciplines, the Lt Governor said. Expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ushering in a new sporting era across the country, the Lt Governor said, for the first time, sports and sportspersons are getting due resources, respect, and handholding. Earlier, despite having the second largest population in the world, we were not able to create the sports icons that could inspire the new generation, he added. The Lt Governor said that the country’s performance in the recently concluded Commonwealth Games is testimony to the positive change brought in by the Prime Minister. Today, our heroes are giving new energy, new inspiration to young India by their spellbinding performances in all major sporting events across the globe, he added. The Lt Governor observed that a similar change was started in Jammu and Kashmir after 2019 and, in the last three years, the UT has emerged as a bright spot in the field of sports on the national and international stage. Earlier, only 2-3 lakh players used to get the opportunity to play in a year. But now the situation has changed and last year, more than 17 lakh youth were provided an opportunity to play, whereas this year we have set a target to connect 35 lakh youth with sports. A huge step has been taken to safeguard the future of the sportspersons through the Sports Policy launched in January this year. Earlier, there was no incentive for players to participate in sports tournaments but we have ensured that both ca awards as well as government jobs are given to the players. They are the new icons of youth, he further added. This year, 13 national tournaments will be organized in J&K and 11,000 players from all over the country will showcase their talent in the UT with the support of all sports bodies. The Sports Council has also launched ‘My Youth My Pride’ program to reach out to the players at the grassroots level to develop a sports culture, and around five lakh sportspersons will get an opportunity to showcase their talent in various disciplines of sports with the help of 53 sports associations, it was informed. Highlighting the major improvements in the sports infrastructure across the UT, the Lt Governor said that world class sports infrastructure has been developed in Jammu and Kashmir under the guidance of Prime Minister. FIFA Standard Bakshi Stadium and ICC Standard MA Stadium have been upgraded and renovated for international level matches. Today, we have succeeded in creating a Multi-Purpose Indoor Sports Hall in every district of Jammu and Kashmir with all facilities as per the requirements of the players, he said. The Lt Governor appreciated the grit of veterans participating in the Masters tournament and expressed hope that their experience and energy will become an inspiration for the new generation. He also presented awls as a token of appreciation to the veterans on the occasion. Chairperson J&K Waqf Board, Dr Darakhshan Andrabi, while speaking on the occasion lauded the LG led UT Administration bringing a new era of sports development and providing ample opportunities to the sports persons in the UT. Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar, Advisor to Lt Governor highlighted the transformation taking place in the field of sports in J&K.

On Sunday, as Sussex's captain, Pujara smashed a fantastic 174 off 131 balls against Surrey, which also helped him claim the record for the highest-ever score made by a Sussex batter in List A cricket competition in the United Kingdom, going past the 171 made by Namibia all-rounder David Wiese against Hampshire in 2019.","pubDate":"2022-08-23 14:59:39","image_url":"https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/380x285/fixed/jpg/2022/08/Cheteshwar-Pujara.jpg","source_id":"firstpost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"World Cup Super League: वर्ल्ड कप 2023 के लिए क्वालीफाई नहीं कर पाएगी वेस्टइंडीज? आयरलैंड के पास बेहतरीन मौका, देखें प्वॉइंट्स टेबल","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/west-indies-were-reduced-by-2-points-from-the-world-cup-super-league-points-table-due-to-slow-over-rate-during-the-series-against-new-zealand-2199010","keywords":null,"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"World Cup Super League Points Table: आगामी 50 ओवर वर्ल्ड कप भारत में खेला जाएगा. दरअसल, भारत चौथी बार क्रिकेट वर्ल्ड कप का आयोजन कर रहा है. हालांकि, इस बीच 2 बार की वर्ल्ड चैंपियन वेस्टइंडीज को बड़ा झटका लगा है. दरअसल, स्लो ओवर रेट के कारण वेस्टइंडीज के खाते से दो सुपर लीग पॉइंट भी काट लिए गए हैं. इससे कैरेबियन टीम की वर्ल्ड कप 2023 क्वालिफिकेशन की उम्मीदों को बड़ा झटका लगा है. न्यूजीलैंड के खिलाफ वनडे सीरीज के स्टार्ट होने से पहले वर्ल्ड सुपर लीग प्वॉइंट्स टेबल में वेस्टइंडीज की टीम 80 प्वॉइंट्स के साथ सातवें नंबर पर थी. टॉप-8 टीमों को सीधे इंट्री मिलेगी न्यूजीलैंड के खिलाफ 3 वनडे मैचों की सीरीज में वेस्टइंडीज को 2-1 से हार का सामना करना पड़ा. इस हार के बाद कैरेबियन टीम 90 प्वॉइंट्स पर आ गई, लेकिन स्लो ओवर रेट के बाद 2 प्वॉइंट्स और गवांने के बाद टीम के फिलहाल 88 प्वॉइंट्स हैं. इस तरह वेस्टइंडीज 87 प्वॉइंट्स के साथ वेस्टइंडीज सातवें नंबर पर है. गौरतलब है कि भारत में 2023 में होने वाले वर्ल्ड कप के लिए वर्ल्ड सुपर लीग तालिका की टॉप-8 टीमों को सीधे इंट्री मिलेगी, इस टॉप-8 टीम में मेजबान भारत भी शामिल है. आयरलैंड के पास बेहतरीन मौका वहीं, अगर वर्ल्ड सुपर लीग की मौजूदा प्वॉइंट्स टेबल की बात करें तो इंग्लैंड पहले, बांग्लादेश दूसरे, पाकिस्तान तीसरे, न्यूजीलैंड चौथे, मेजबान भारत पांचवें, अफगानिस्तान छठे, वेस्टइंडीज सातवें और ऑस्ट्रेलिया आठवें स्थान पर है. बहरहाल, आयरलैंड की टीम 68 प्वॉइंट्स के साथ 9वें नंबर पर है. दरअसल, आयरलैंड की टीम अगर अगले साल बांग्लादेश के खिलाफ तीन वनडे मैचों की सीरीज खेलेगी. इस सीरीज में अगर आयरलैंड अगर 2 मैचों में जीत दर्ज करता है तो वह वेस्टइंडीज से आगे निकल जाएगा. साथ ही आयरलैंड का नेट रन रेट वेस्टइंडीज से बेहतर है. ये भी पढ़ें- Legends League Cricket: कोलकाता के ईडन गार्डन में 16 सितंबर को खेला जाएगा पहला मैच, जानें अन्य वेन्यू और डिटेल्स Watch: चहल और धनश्री के ब्रेक-अप की अफवाहों पर लगेगा ब्रेक, सामने आया इस जोड़ी का फनी वीडियो","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-23 14:52:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Mumbai Cricket Association to hold election on September 28","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/domestic/mumbai-cricket-association-mca-election-september-28-bcci-constitutional-amendment-supreme-court/article65802373.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Amol Karhadkar  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"“We have initiated the election process. All the members will be duly informed. The member clubs will be asked to submit their representatives by September 5,” MCA secretary Sanjay Naik said.","content":"The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) has decided to go ahead with its election on September 28, with the apex council on Tuesday initiating the election process. “We have initiated the election process. All the members will be duly informed. The member clubs will be asked to submit their representatives by September 5. The appointment of the election officer will be formalised in a couple of days and he will start the due process as per the constitution,” Sanjay Naik, MCA secretary, said after the apex council meeting. The MCA on August 5 had issued the notice to conduct the deferred AGM on September 13. However, on August 20, Naik circulated a single-point agenda for Tuesday’s emergent meeting to “apprise the members about holding the forthcoming elections”. Sportstar understands the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) hierarchy, through representatives of a few influential associations across zones, had reached out to its MCA counterparts about postponing the election. The Supreme Court is likely to hear the pending applications of proposed amendments in the constitution of the BCCI and state associations next month. “There are various pleas in the Supreme Court pending hearing with regard to (constitutional) amendments. If there is an order before the election day favouring the association, it will benefit those in the election. But we are not waiting for the hearings, we are going ahead with the election,” Naik said. Sensing the reluctance of going ahead with the election, a group of five apex council members - led by treasurer Jagdish Achrekar - wrote a letter to the MCA president Vijay Patil ahead of the meeting. The letter - signed by Abhay Hadap, Ajinkya Naik, Gaurav Payyade and Kaushik Godbole, besides Achkrer, and accessed by Sportstar - appealed to fellow members to ensure apex council’s decisions are “held in compliance and not in contravention” of MCA’s rulebook. Besides, Sportstar understands that an office-bearer of a southern state association tried convincing his Mumbai counterpart on Tuesday afternoon to defer the election. But once the dissent to the move was recorded, the apex council had no choice but to proceed with the election as planned.

The excitement around knowing what’s inside the lunch box was such that many of you surely must have opened the lunch box in the first period only. Undeniably, lunchtime was incomplete until and unless the whole group sat together and shared their tiffins. And why not, after all, sharing is caring. With that being said a video is making rounds on the internet which might make you nostalgic about your school days. The video, which is a montage of a few short clips of some dogs, shows them eating each other’s food.The video, which was posted by Indian Police Service (IPS) Officer Dipanshu Kabra on Twitter on 22 August, perfectly portrays how in school friends used to snatch each other’s tiffin to gorge on it. While posting the video, the IPS officer rightly wrote in Hindi, “Duniya ki sari khushiyan ek taraf aur dost ka tiffin loot kar khane ki khushi ek taraf. (Nothing can beat the happiness of gorging on your best friend’s tiffin.”) In the first clip of the video, one dog can be seen snatching another’s food and pouring it into his bowl. In one of the clips, one dog can be seen eating from each and every bowl of his furry friends.दुनिया की सारी खुशियाँ एक तरफ, और दोस्त का टिफिन लूटकर खाने की ख़ुशी एक तरफ 😅 pic.twitter.com/Wz7kIJsBMm— Dipanshu Kabra (@ipskabra) August 22, 2022The video has made the social media users take a walk down memory lane. Several took to the comments section to share their incidents from school and college life. While talking about his hostel life one user commented, “If a friend cribs, then the taste of that food increases. And then friends share a bottle of beer as compensation... hostel humour.” Apart from many agreeing to the caption of the IPS officer, the comments section of the post was flooded with countless laughing emoticons. So far the video has been played over 84,000 times and has garnered more than 2,000 likes. Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
